			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Yeltsin pledge to pull troops out of Moldova MOLDOVA and Russia yesterday both made 11th hour efforts to pull away from open war over Moldova's breakaway region of Trans Dnestr, write Chrystia Freeland in Kishinev and John Lloyd in Moscow. President Boris Yeltsin promised to withdraw the most likely casus belli, the Russian-controlled 14th Army, which on May 19 openly entered the battle on the side of the separatists in the predominantly Slavic region. 'Don't worry, there won't be a war. We will pull back the 14th army to Russian territory and will not permit Russia to be dragged into war,' Mr Yeltsin said, according to the Interfax news agency, during a tour of the remote Altai region of Russia. There was no Russian military confirmation. The highly industrialised Trans Dnestr region declared independence in 1990 under the leadership of Communist hardliners. The Moldovan parliament meanwhile sought to soothe the fears of Russian and Ukrainian inhabitants of the Trans Dnestr that they might soon find themselves living in a new Romanian province. It promised a law which would require all changes in Moldova's national status to be confirmed by a referendum. The parliament had passed a resolution demanding the 'immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Army' which it characterised as an occupation force. But it rebuffed pressure from nationalists to declare martial law and affirmed its desire to resolve the conflict through political channels. Nonetheless, Moldovan authorities were sceptical about Mr Yeltsin's reported promise. There have been three ineffectual meetings between foreign ministers from Moldova, Russia, Romania and Ukraine, and the Moldovans believe the Russian Defence Ministry, rather than the Russian president or Foreign Ministry, is egging on the 14th Army. The avowals of goodwill on both sides are to be tested tomorrow when the foreign and defence ministers of Moldova, Russia, Ukraine and Romania are due to meet again in Kishinev. This is to be followed in the near future by a summit of the presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and Russia.</p>

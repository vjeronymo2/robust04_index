			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Worthington trimmed to Pounds 0.3m Worthington Group suffered a decline in profits to Pounds 305,000 in the first half, because of difficulties within the button wholesaling business and the trimmings operation. On increased sales of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 6.11m) in the six months to September 30, pre-tax profits fell 39 per cent from a previous Pounds 496,000. In order to consolidate the contribution from Hulme Holmberg and Atorp, which were acquired during the period, the merger method of accounting has been used. Consequently the comparable results have been restated. The directors said that moves made to address the problems were unlikely to make a significant impact until the next financial year. Earnings per share fell to 1.3p (1.9p). The interim dividend has been raised to 0.5p (0.3p) with a view to bringing payments closer to the traditional split of one-third to two-thirds.</p>

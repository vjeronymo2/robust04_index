			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif </F> following talks between Presidents Husni Mubarak and Hafiz  al-Asad in Cairo on 5 April--recorded]    [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to Egypt comes  within the framework of continuous consultations between the two  countries and presidents. Several rounds of talks have been  held. The two presidents held private talks and the Egyptian  and Syrian delegations also met.    The talks covered many issues of common concern.  International relations, international developments under the  new world order, and regional, Arab, and Islamic issues were  discussed.    The talks also covered several important issues. The overall  Arab position was reviewed. The two emphasized the efforts made  by both countries to clear the Arab atmosphere and cement Arab  solidarity.    Other issues also figured in the talks, most notably the  Yemeni crisis and the efforts to overcome this crisis. Egypt  and Syria believe that these efforts should continue because of  the dire consequences the crisis holds for Yemen's unity, a  unity that we all hope to preserve.    The two parties reviewed the Libyan-Western crisis and the  Egyptian and Arab efforts to stop the escalation of sanctions  against Libya. The two leaderships see a need for further  cooperation and coordination in this regard.    Concerning Somalia, Egypt and Syria see a need to achieve  reconciliation and agreement among the Somali factions. The  Somalis should be encouraged and helped to rebuild their  country. The Egyptian and Syrian sides also reviewed the  situation in Sudan, stressing the need to preserve the unity of  Sudan's land and people during the dialogue concerning the  problem in south Sudan.    Another topic broached during the talks was peace. The two  sides discussed that issue in full detail, reviewing the current  talks and consultations concerning the Middle East peace process  and highlighting the need to make this peace a comprehensive and  just one. The two parties reviewed some of the obstacles facing  the peace process and the factors affecting it. The two parties  discussed the common vision and principles leading to progress  in the Arab-Israeli peace process. In this connection, the  efforts and consultations of the international community and the  United States were discussed.    The Egyptian and Syrian sides reviewed the peace process on  every track, particularly the Syrian and Palestinian, always  emphasizing the comprehensiveness of a regional settlement in  the Middle East and the need to achieve a just peace.    The Nonaligned Movement was discussed and emphasis was  placed  on the group's upcoming meeting in Cairo and the need to  consolidate the role of the Nonaligned Movement and enhance  cooperation among Third World countries. Perhaps these were the  most important issues discussed on the international, regional,  and Arab levels.    The two presidents and the meetings of the two delegations  discussed bilateral ties. The Higher Egyptian-Syrian Joint  Committee will meet on 15 May. The committee will discuss  cooperation between Egypt and Syria in the political, economic,  cultural, social, and other fields and several joint ventures.</p>

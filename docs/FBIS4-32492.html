			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] It will be decided today whether the  coalition agreement concluded the day before yesterday between  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] will be valid. The two parties' chief  decisionmaking forums, the MSZP's congress and the SZDSZ's  delegates assembly, are to vote on the coalition agreement  today, on the basis of the recommendations of the parties'  leading bodies. The MSZP congress began a few hours before our  broadcast with the speech of Gyula Horn, party chairman and  prime minister designate. The reporter is Kata Peli Nagy:    [Nagy] The party chairman and the party congress are  satisfied with the coalition agreement, which, in the view of  the party leaders, they were able to conclude without making  concessions on a single principle.    Party Chairman Gyula Horn, in a speech of nearly an hour,  again highlighted the agreement's historic significance. He  said that if the two parties' chief delegate bodies approve it,  this will be the first social-liberal government in central  Europe -- what is more, between two parties which prior to 1990  were sharply opposed to one another.    At the same time Gyula Horn found it worth mentioning the  fact that with this agreement it is not the SZDSZ that has  rendered the MSZP fit for polite society; it was the voters who  gave the MSZP its legitimacy. What is more, it gained an  absolute majority. In spite of this, the party offered a  coalition to the SZDSZ.    There was total agreement with the SZDSZ in that the country  must be put onto the path of modernization, while social  viewpoints are taken fully into consideration.    The agreement has no secret clauses, and even taken as a  whole it is a good example. Simply on its own, it is a  guarantee that there can be no repetition of a coalition similar  to the one in 1990 [between the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the  Christian Democratic People's Party, and the Independent  Smallholders Party], the party chairman said.    The coalition agreement, Gyula Horn said, could be a good  foundation for a new political culture. The essence of this is  that the two parties offer the losing parties reconciliation  [megbekeles] and constructive cooperation.    The agreement, incidentally, was also received favorably by  the international political public, at least according to the  party chairman.    Concerning international affairs, Gyula Horn said activities  which offend the Hungarian minorities beyond the borders would  not be ignored by the next government, either. His party  considers it inconceivable to have relations with a party that  for example defends, and furthermore supports, the [Mayor  Gheorghe] Funar type of actions in Cluj-Napoca [Kolozsvar].    Finally, in connection with the government list, Gyula Horn  said the cabinet consists of competent [hozzaertoe] people,  although it is not easy to find experts for government  functions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- Russian communist leader  Gennadiy Zyuganov described the economic situation in Russia as  catastrophic.    Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday,  Zyuganov said that the country has become completely  ungovernable and social tension continues to grow. Social and  economic ties are falling apart.    Summing the results of his trip to several Russian regions,  Zyuganov said that local officials called for a strong and  capable government whose powers must be separated from the  powers of presidential structures, which, as they claim,  "interfere in the economic management" and get in the  government's way.    To solve the food problem, Zyuganov suggested "establishing  the minimum consumer basket and returning to state regulation of  prices of basic necessities, including rationing."    He stressed the need for changing the liberal economic  policy  which has failed. "We will have to use measures of state  regulation, primarily in power engineering, transportation,  communications and agriculture," he said.    Zyuganov also believes that Russia should offer Ukraine,  Byelorussia [Belarus] and Kazakhstan to set up a body to  coordinate economic management and restore the severed ties.  Another task is to fight crime and corruption and restore law  and order in the country.    Zyuganov noted that no one will support the idea of a  general  political strike in Russia, adding that the question of early  presidential elections -- in September-October -- "may emerge  within the presidential structures themselves."</p>

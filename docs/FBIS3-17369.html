The signing and ratification of this agreement at the Saeima  would make the passing of a law of foreigners and stateless  persons status in Latvia more complicated, and it would also  deteriorate the relations between Latvia and Estonia. In  Estonia a similar law, being already in effect, delays  initialling of agreement with Russia on military pensioners'  social guarantees.    After signing an agreement that legalizes occupation army  officers' residence in Latvia, there will be no use for the  Saeima to ask NATO member countries' parliaments to acknowledge  the occupation of Latvia in 1940, said Kirsteins.    Kirsteins considers Latvia can sign only those agreements  with Russia, that do not concern Russian retired military  personnel social guarantees.    The faction also considers that before signing the  agreement,  the public opinion must be taken into account as well, because  nearly a half of the Latvia's inhabitants does not support the  signing of agreement on Russian retired military personnel  social guarantees, said Kirsteins.    The faction and the Latvian National Independent Movement  board will discuss March 26 the issue and declare their attitude  towards the package of agreements, initialled during  Latvian-Russian interstate talks.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: THE BEDROOM SHOULD COME OUT OF THE CLOSET  </P> <P> How's this for a seduction scene? You slip into something satiny with a  spaghetti strap that falls from the shoulder. As you approach the bed (with the  perfumed sheets), your foot becomes entangled in a mound of paper being spewed  out by a fax machine, causing you to bump into the filing cabinet and send the  keyboard to the word processor crashing to the floor. If that doesn't take the  fire out of your desire, it'll at least slow you down.  </P> <P> I didn't know bedrooms had "gone corporate" until I complained in a column  about the exercise bicycle at the bottom of my bed. The mail that followed  enlightened me.  </P> <P> According to one writer, her bedroom is so full of business machines, people  ask, "Who's your decorator? Shearson Lehman Hutton?" Another one who complained  of romance between the sheets (fax, that is) said she considered draping  herself in all that paper and becoming a Turkish belly dancer.  </P> <P> One disenchanted wife said she and her husband don't have exercise equipment,  but they are part of a new trend that brings a microwave oven and a small  refrigerator to their bedroom for those late snacks of popcorn and pizza while  they're watching television. Another woman offered to trade me my exercise  bicycle for the large German shepherd dog draped over the foot of her bed every  night like a "snoring quilt."  </P> <P> It has become apparent that the sexy mirrored bedroom that television depicts  as the last stop before ecstasy isn't a parking lot for sex at all, but a gym .  . . an office . . . a kitchen . . . or a kennel.  </P> <P> Here's a challenge for you. Go to your bedroom and take a look. Is this a room  that sets a tone for intimacy, passion and adventure? Or is it decorated in the  following decor?  </P> <P> Early Cloth World: A dress form, sewing machine and swatches of material  dominate the room. The shag rug on the floor contains some decorating surprises  -- straight pins that go straight through a bare foot.  </P> <P> Neo-Laundry: My personal favorite is a bedroom where the bed is dramatically  underplayed. It is buried under a mountain of clothes to be folded. Every night  the clothes are taken off the bed and dumped on chairs. Every morning, the  clothes are returned to the bed.  </P> <P> Collectible Primitives: Many bedrooms have "carport looks." They hold items  destined to become antiques. These rooms are stacked with plants that need  repotting, a carton containing toilet tissue purchased on sale, bicycles for  storing, etc.  </P> <P> One woman said her and her husband's bedroom held a huge TV screen and a wall  of videotapes of football games past. I'll bet even Alexis on "Dynasty" never  made love with the Notre Dame fight song playing in the background!  </P></p>

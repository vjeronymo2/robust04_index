			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Hata Selected as Prime Minister, But Many Difficulties Remain  in Japan's Political Situation"]    [Text] Two weeks after Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa resigned from office, it was still hard to find a new  prime minister. Early yesterday morning, the seven-party  coalition finally reached an agreement on the basic policy to be  pursued by the new cabinet. It was decided that Tsutomu Hata,  currently deputy prime minister and foreign minister, will  succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. The post, which had gone  unfilled for two weeks, was finally manned.    After repeated considerations, the ruling coalition still  decided to select Hata. It is expected that when the two houses  of the Diet vote next week, the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party will nominate its leader Kawano to contend for the post,  but it is certain that Hata will win majority support in  parliament.    In the past two weeks, the Japanese political situation has  been volatile, and political disputes have arisen again and  again. The main problem is that the ruling coalition did not  reach agreement on the basic policy it will pursue in the  future. When the bickering became fierce, those involved even  threatened to break with each other.    The seven political parties within the ruling coalition are  divided into two major factions. One faction is the mainstream  faction headed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] (Hata, Ozawa)  and Komeito (Ichikawa), and the other faction is the  non-mainstream faction formed by the Social Democratic Party  (Kubo), the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Sakigake  [Harbinger] party's Masayoshi Takemura (chief secretary in  Hosokawa's cabinet). The two sides refused to concede on two  major issues, namely, the new cabinet's tax policy and nuclear  developments in Korea. In the end they made reciprocal  concessions to each other in consideration of their overall  interests and an instant split was prevented.    At present, the consensus reached by the ruling coalition on  the taxation issue is an agreement to reduce direct taxes,  improve or remove current consumption taxes, and greatly  increase indirect taxes while calling for the nation's  understanding.    The Social Democratic Party originally strongly opposed the  option of substantially raising indirect taxes and held that  this meant no tax reduction at all. It insisted that the new  taxation system must be endorsed by the nationals. At present,  the compromise is: The new taxation system being endorsed by  the nationals is changed into "being understood by the  nationals," and the bill concerned will be formulated by June  this year.    As for the issue of nuclear development in Korea, both sides  also reached a compromise. They agreed that according to the  specifications of the Japanese Constitution, preparations be  made against emergencies, and "close coordination be made with  the United States and the ROK" and at the same time "cooperation  be carried out with the Asian countries concerned if necessary."    The Social Democratic Party originally stressed "cooperation  between Japan and China" on the Korean issue and opposed Japan's  participation in sanctions against Korea. It worried that Japan  might follow the United States, and once U.S. forces carried out  a maritime blockade against Korea, the Japanese Self-Defense  Force would support U.S. military action from the rear. Because  the United States and Japan have signed a security treaty, if  the United States acts recklessly, Japan could be entangled by  events.    Shinseito's Ozawa proposed that Japan should take part in  military missions by the United Nations. This evoked an outcry  in society. Therefore, the Korean "nuclear mystery" is very  sensitive in Japan. Because of the U.S.-Japan security treaty,  if the United States or the United Nations takes action, Japan  will have to make a choice.    Since Clinton took office, the United States has often  overreacted to some local disputes in the world. Clinton once  mentioned the option of taking preemptive action on Korea's  nuclear mystery, and this has naturally aroused Japan's  nervousness, causing the Social Democratic Party to call for  cooperation with China.    After Hata takes office, the weak points of the Hosokawa  cabinet and such serious issues as political reform, the new  taxation policy, Japanese-U.S. trade frictions, the new budget,  and stimulating domestic demand will all be put before the new  cabinet. It is expected that the Hata cabinet's workload will be  no less arduous.</p>

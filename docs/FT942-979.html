			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Magazines launch at service stations An international consortium plans to publish 30 new magazines next month, the largest number of titles launched simultaneously by a single publisher in the UK. The consortium, called Retail Revolution, will distribute the titles through TPS, a Windsor-based newspaper and magazine distribution group which will deliver the products to an initial 4,500 petrol service stations. Mr Keith Eden, Retail Revolution's managing director, hopes to sell the magazines through 9,000 service stations by the end of the year. There are no plans to distribute the titles through newsagents. Mr Eden said: 'We aim to create a revolution in magazine distribution, by-passing the wholesalers completely. That gives us an additional margin of about 15 per cent, some of which we can pass on to the retailer.' The group expects to achieve 2m sales a month. Each title will have a cover-price of Pounds 1.95. Retail Revolution's largest shareholder is the London-based Richbell group, a private company that owns the Egon Ronay food guides, and Service Station, a magazine for garage owners. The company also owns Overdrive and Dial, the fuel credit cards businesses, which will provide the accounting software for Retail Revolution. Other shareholders include a company based in the British Virgin Islands which Mr Eden declined to name. The periodicals include women's titles, as well as specialist interest journals for computing, trucking and puzzles, and top-shelf adult titles. All but one magazine, OK], have been specially developed by Retail Revolution. Mr Eden said additional magazines would be added.</p>

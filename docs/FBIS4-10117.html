			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Genoud, chairman of the Senate Industry </F> Committee]    [Text] The recent visit paid by U.S. Vice President Al Gore  to Argentina brought to the forefront once again U.S. insistence  that our Congress pass a new patents law. The second in command  in the United States simply confirmed the overtures made by the  former and current U.S. ambassadors to Argentina, Terence Todman  and James Cheek respectively.    There is a broad consensus of opinion in the country on the  need for a new patents law to replace Act No. 111, enacted in  1864, which has been in effect without interruption since then.  This act acknowledges inventors' rights, with the exception of  pharmaceutical products. The growing globalization of the world  economy over the last two decades has led the majority of  countries to align their legislation, albeit differently, with  the system that acknowledges that the holder of a patent has  ample production and marketing rights for his or her invention.    On the extremes of this controversy, it is argued, on the  one  hand, that the right of intellectual property constitutes the  hub of a free society and that the right to capitalize on the  profitability of an invention is the best stimulus for doing  research. On the other hand, it is affirmed that besides all the  risks that every monopoly entails, patents should not be  applicable to pharmaceutical products -- as a superior good,  like public health, is at stake here -- because otherwise their  prices will inexorably go up. To this one should add arguments  aimed at protecting the domestic industry in this area.    The executive branch sent a bill to the Senate on patents  and  royalties [modelos de utilidad], which is under discussion in  the upper chamber together with the bills that Senators Ricardo  Lafferriere [Radical Civic Union-Entre Rios Province], Gabriel  Romero Feris [Corrientes Autonomist Party-Corrientes Province],  and Federico Storani [Radical Civic Union-Cordoba Province]  submitted on that subject.    It is my considered opinion that the new law ought to  acknowledge the right of the patent holder, including those  applied for pharmaceutical products, thus leaving behind a  legislation enacted 130 years ago. Clear limits should be  established so as to stave off the possibility of the inventor  having monopolistic control. In my view, the law ought to  establish the principle of granting licenses without  authorization by the patent holder in exchange for acknowledging  an economic value in favor of the inventor, estimated at a fixed  percentage of the selling price of the product. (Royalty which  should be approximately 5 percent of the final consumer price.)  Obviously, the state must play the undelegated role of being in  charge of quality control during production and continue  monitoring it until the product is marketed.    Once this law is enacted, there should be a transition  period  after which the law will be fully effective and will cover  pharmaceutical products, like the case in practically all the  countries that passed similar laws. This will enable the gradual  accommodation of the national industry to new market conditions  once the new legislation comes into force. In order to do so,  one has to bear in mind the degree of development of the  pharmaceutical industry, which covers 60 percent of the domestic  demand and exports significant volumes. The new legal text ought  to stipulate that the law is not to be retroactive. The products  that are already on the market will therefore be outside the  scope of this new law.    This brief presentation includes the necessary elements to  draft the new law. The rights of the patent holder are  acknowledged; the holder will receive a return that is  proportional to the degree of market penetration of his product;  the risk of monopolies is eliminated; the medicines supply is  guaranteed; the possibility of excessive markups is ruled out;  and Argentine laboratories are given the possibility of adapting  themselves to future competitive conditions on the market. It is  inexplicable that there should be those who suggest that this  law can be enacted in the forthcoming weeks.    Argentina signed, together with another 116 countries  including the United States, the final act of the Uruguay Round  of GATT in Geneva last 15 December, after seven years of  negotiations. This act devotes a specific chapter to patents.  The final regulation of this issue will be made public in  Morocco in April.    The agreement establishes that when signatory countries  introduce new legislation on patents, they must include an  acknowledgement of the inventor's rights and may institute  antimonopolistic mechanisms through mandatory licenses. The  agreement, moreover, enables governments to establish a  transition period that may extend up to 10 years and declare  that the legislation not be retroactive for products that are  protected by patent. In sum, it leaves a lot of leeway for  drafting a law like the one that was previously put together.    Therefore, it is by no means opportune for Congress to pass  a  new law on patents without first having ratified the GATT  agreement. This, however, does not prevent Senate committees  from approving their respective reports. The country will surely  have a new law on industrial patents once both chambers of  Congress conclude their work and the GATT agreement is ratified.  All this should be done within the framework of the total  independence the legislative branch enjoys in decisionmaking in  any republican system.</p>

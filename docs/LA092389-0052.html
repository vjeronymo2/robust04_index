			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> WILLIAM DAVILA IN RECITAL AT SOUTHWEST MUSEUM  </P> <P> Beginning with a first half of standard fare, followed by a latter half  dedicated to works written within the last decade, a solo recital by guitarist  William Davila provided laudable moments interspersed with less remarkable  efforts in the Sprague Gallery at Southwest Museum.  </P> <P> Davila is an accomplished guitarist, but often overly aggressive, sometimes  allowing his tone to sound over-plucked. Flamboyantly beginning each set  immediately upon sitting down -- without tuning -- also created conspicuous  problems.  </P> <P> Of the new works presented Thursday evening, Deon Nielsen Price's engaging  "Alma Jubilate" shone above the others in its sophistication and innovation.  Borrowing repetitive, tonal ideas from the Minimalist school, the ambitious  concoction uses pitch materials from the overtone series in combination with  simple rhythms. Beverly Grigsby's "Serenade" fittingly provided lyrical  elegance, while three jazzy etudes by James Wyble offered examples of  considerable virtuosity, though lacking memorable expressivity. In encore,  Davila performed his own New Age improvisatory work, "Inner Landscapes," which  innocuously meanders around a pop chord progression and drone.  </P> <P> Also presented were Marshall Bialosky's "Sor-ing," an uncomplicated  juxtaposition of snippets from two minuets by Fernando Sor, and Andrea  Saparoff's ponderous "Seria en Re," three sparsely textured but dissonant  studies.  </P> <P> The first half of the program included pieces from the Renaissance and early  20th Century. Of these, two preludes by Villa-Lobos best demonstrated Davila's  talents as both a commanding and sensitive performer.  </P> <P> Other notable efforts included variations by Gaspar Sanz, Sor and Antonio de  Cabezon on the Folia -- a common melody and harmonic progression used in the  Baroque era. Moreno-Torroba's virtuosic "Nocturno" also provided Davila an  exemplary showpiece. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

During a special inspection, TCU personnel  discovered that Proagro is not supervised. Ademar Guisi, the  TCU rapporteur for the case, was surprised at the results of the  inspection.    He said: "Proagro is totally uncoordinated, disorganized,  and  is not supervised. This has turned Proagro into a veritable  Pandora's box."    Proagro, which is managed by the Central Bank, was created  to  cover farmers' debts to banks whenever bad crops occurred due to  acts of nature. TCU personnel found various irregularities,  such as payment for nonexistent liabilities. Most of the  diverted funds went out this way. [passage omitted]</p>

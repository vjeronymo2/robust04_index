			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Savvateyeva: "Yeltsin's Man"] </F>   [Text] Oleg Ivanovich Lobov, to criticism and exposure of  whom many brilliant pages of Russian journalism have been  devoted, is a dramatic figure in the Russian political arena.    As often happens with people, his shortcomings have become  an  extension of his merits. The main ones evidently being his  creative and selfless involvement with the matter assigned him  and his directness and ability to remain loyal, whether to  people or to ideas....    Born in Kiev in 1937, Lobov has always been proud that his  family comes from an old cossack tribe and is mentioned in  "Quiet Flows the Don" and that his uncle, an inhabitant of  Veshenskaya village, once admitted Mikhail Sholokhov to the  party.    The fate and career of Oleg Lobov himself were determined by  a meeting with Boris Yeltsin. It happened in Sverdlovsk in  1971, where Lobov had then been working for 11 years after  graduating from the Rostov railroad engineers institute. Oleg  Ivanovich was the main engineer at a large institute with the  lengthy title "UralpromstroyNIIproyekt" and was a candidate of  technical sciences. And he looked like a "promising worker" to  Yeltsin, who at that time headed the Sverdlovsk party oblast  committee [obkom] construction department. Boris Nikolayevich  offered the 34-year-old Lobov the post of his deputy although at  that time the latter had served virtually no time at all in the  party. In 1972 Oleg Ivanovich joined the party obkom. It was a  brilliant launchpad.    Since then he has retained his irreproachable loyalty to his  boss. So that if anyone is to be given the title "Yeltsin's  man" then Oleg Ivanovich Lobov is obviously the first. Yeltsin  himself who, according to eyewitnesses' accounts, is  hypersensitive to any kind of betrayal, intrigue, and plotting,  has frequently stressed that he sees in Lobov not only a  pragmatist and a strong economic leader but also a man he  trusts. A man who could not stab him in the back.    From 1972 through to this day Lobov and Yeltsin have been  walking through life arm in arm: Yeltsin became obkom  secretary, Lobov became chief of the construction department and  then chief of the country's biggest construction organization,  "Glavstreduralstroy;" Yeltsin became first secretary, Lobov  became secretary for construction and later chairman of the  Sverdlovsk Oblast Soviet executive committee....    Probably the years spent in Sverdlovsk were the best time in  Oleg Ivanovich Lobov's life. As they liked to say in the old  days, they were glorious pages in his labor career which he is  obviously not ashamed to mention to this day. At least he has  left his mark in Sverdlovsk.    He was indeed a "strong economic leader" of the Soviet era.  Actually, I do not know whether he was a "pragmatist." Perhaps  rather he was a romantic, a man of enthusiasms.    What is in 1993 the offensive nickname of "chicken and egg"  leader invented by journalists in the era of the big battle  against Lobov as minister of the economy was in the second half  of the eighties for Lobov, as chairman of the oblast soviet  executive committee, simply an honorary title. And a deserved  one. To this day people in Sverdlovsk, or Yekaterinburg,  remember that under Lobov there were eggs and chickens and milk  too. They say that in his office there was a huge map of the  oblast showing "the dynamics of the increase in poultry and milk  production" in various rayons and the oblast soviet executive  committee chairman unswervingly kept track of these dynamics.    But Oleg Ivanovich's main hobbyhorse is undoubtedly  construction. They say he was a good construction worker. He  knew his job backwards and had passed through every level of  "professional growth." When he was in Moscow, as an important  man, he recalled with pride and seemingly a certain nostalgia:  "Cultural and sports complexes were constructed for the first  time in the country on the basis of my sketches." The first  such complex was constructed in a village, which was remarkable  at the time. It had everything: a pool, a volleyball pitch,  football, amateur artistic activities, and even baths. What is  curious is that th is complex is still used for its purpose:  People go there to wash....    As chairman of the oblast soviet executive committee Lobov  came out with what for the time was a quite bold initiative:  Giving city dwellers the right to buy houses in the  countryside. Now young people will merely shrug -- so what?  But only seven or eight years ago this decision by the  Sverdlovsk people alarmed Moscow. A special CPSU Central  Committee commission arrived to investigate and closely "studied  the question" and eventually kindly agreed it should be  supported. A special CPSU Central Committee decree was  published, after which Lobov embarked on the construction of  cottages. An experimental settlement was installed near  Sverdlovsk consisting of houses with every comfort and with  auxiliary premises which, they say, were beautifully executed.  To this day the entire local elite lives there.    It is indicative that Lobov was eager to repeat this  successful experiment and he began to speak enthusiastically of  a further 38 settlements. But like the majority of reforming  ideas in the era of socialism, this one was overtaken by an  inevitable fate: It was implemented in a strictly limited  number of examples. Or to be more precise in just one case.    At the same time youth housing complex construction reached  impressive scales in Sverdlovsk and considerable credit went to  Lobov here. Or rather to Yeltsin and Lobov. In general all  Oleg Ivanovich's progressive initiatives saw the light largely  thanks to the fact that he had Yeltsin's support. Often the  initiative itself came from Yeltsin.    Recalling today Oleg Ivanovich's activity in Sverdlovsk one  cannot fail to mention the best supermarket in the oblast, the  idea for which came from the executive committee chairman; the  modernization of old Urals plants; the swift installation of gas  compressor stations; the brick plants which, although he did not  manage to install them in every rayon, as he wished, he  nonetheless managed to construct in some quantity; and, pardon  me for mentioning them, the excellent Sverdlovsk toilets.  Incidentally, all of Lobov lies in the story of the toilets.    At one time he had traveled to Mexico or Italy where he had  familiarized himself with the production of these necessary  items. After which he returned home and called in the director  of a ceramics plant and gave him a real dressing down for  producing poor-quality toilets. Local inhabitants assert that  from then to this day they have made good toilets....    So was Lobov a reformer? Probably there is no one answer to  that question. One thing is perhaps undoubted and that is that  this man was very sensitive to... how to put it more precisely,  to the requirements of the time, perhaps to the market  situation? Obviously both are correct.    They say that in the days of classic party leadership Lobov  was a real party boss -- an inaccessible demigod. When the era  of wide-scale democracy began Oleg Ivanovich became a very big  democrat. When there was the cooperative boom Lobov  enthusiastically supported the "shoots of the new." And when  Moscow began to criticize the cooperatives' get-rich-quick  members Oleg Ivanovich immediately restructured himself.    I do not want to make mischief here. That was how the party  raised people. Be prepared! Always prepared! Today you have  been sent to build youth housing complexes and cooperatives,  tomorrow to bury money at the bottom of irrigation channels.  You must! And loyal soldiers of the kind that Oleg Ivanovich  Lobov undoubtedly is will put all their efforts into organizing  the digging. They will set up an optimum work schedule,  organize hot lunches for the workers, and where necessary even  take hold of a spade themselves....    In 1987 on instructions from Yeltsin, who was already  working  in Moscow at the time, Lobov became deputy chairman of the  Russian COuncil of Ministers. They say he was viewed with great  sympathy there. It was a time of general discord, a time of a  disorderly work style. And in this situation, when emergency,  anticrisis decisions frequently had to be taken, Lobov was not  equal to the task.    Moreover, in that government he almost looked like the most  zealous reformer. At least to my journalist colleagues working  at the time Lobov seemed the most progressive man in the  government: He spoke more than anyone about the market, he  supported youth housing complexes and in general everything new  and progressive. For instance, he preached what was then a  terrible heresy: Specialists should be sent to Germany to buy  housing construction plants and then a "mass cottage industry"  should be set up in Russia with the aid of these plants. In  general Lobov's press conferences at which journalists were  spoken to in human language were an event at the time, in the  era of universal secrecy.    Oleg Ivanovich looked good in 1989-1991 in Armenia, where he  was sent immediately after the earthquake as leader of the  restoration work staff. After a while be became second  secretary of the Armenian Communist Party Central Committee.    And in April 1991 at Yeltsin's initiative Lobov was  appointed  first deputy chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers.    His short stay -- scarcely more than six months -- in that  post was marked by the stormy events of August. During which,  eyewitnesses assert, Oleg Ivanovich behaved with dignity. It is  universally known that he was assigned leadership of the  "reserve" government in exile.    But when the time came for balanced rational work to reform  the economy Oleg Lobov felt uncomfortable. In the fall of 1991,  when Silayev had just been dismissed and Gaydar had not yet been  appointed, he was left in charge of the economy. And imagine:  Everything was collapsing, disintegrating, ties were breaking  down, enterprises were coming to a standstill, but Lobov was  discussing at a government session the question of...  procurements of conifer branches to feed livestock. Observers  believe that it was then that he failed -- like the Swede at  Poltava [reference to defeat of King Charles XII of Sweden by  Peter the Great in the battle of Poltava].    Yeltsin obviously understood this. When Gaydar's team  appeared on the horizon and the question of a change of course  arose, there was no place in the government for Oleg Ivanovich.  He himself explained the situation like this: "New people have  come who want to work in a new way, I do not want to make them  nervous with my presence." But to all appearances if anyone was  nervous then it was primarily Oleg Lobov himself, whom the young  reformers obviously did not want to take on as a mentor.  Concealed hurt could be heard in the words uttered after  Gaydar's men had been dropped: "What was the Gaydar team's  mistake? They should have relied on experienced cadres and then  the young men's energy would have had a reliable cover."    But that is highly doubtful. When Lobov returned from the  council of experts which he had headed while Gaydar was the top  man in the government and joined the cabinet of ministers now  headed by Chernomyrdin, he became virtually the number one enemy  of liberal market reforms.    Oleg Lobov, first deputy premier and minister of the  economy,  became widely known to the public concerned for his  norm-creating activity. And primarily as the author of two  impressive works: the draft president's edict "on the Russian  Federation Ministry of the Economy" (May 1993) and the  analytical memorandum "on the economic situation in the country"  (August 1993). The imposing and threatening nature of these  works contains all Oleg Lobov's cossack nature. When the sabers  are unsheathed the Russian Ministry of the Economy will become  "the leading central organ of federal executive power." Lobov  eagerly arrogates to his department many functions of the State  Committee for the Administration of State Property, the Ministry  of Finance, the central Bank, the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations, and other departments. His instructions are  compulsory for all regional authorities.... His first deputies  are equal to ministers "in terms of remuneration conditions and  material and consumer and medical services...." In all Lobov  tried to arrogate to himself in the heat of his lawmaking at  least half of all the economic and sociocultural powers which  the law on the Council of Ministers assigns to the government.    The program which Oleg Ivanovich was eager to implement with  these powers was distinguished by the drastic intensification of  state regulation of the economy. The tax system was to be  reviewed: The state was to be given the opportunity not only to  lay claim to taxes but also to the revenue of enterprises with a  share of state property. Privatization was also to be reviewed:  There was to be a reduction from 80 percent to 30 percent in the  proportion of state and municipal property handed over in  exchange for privatization vouchers....    Oleg Ivanovich defended these ideas of his as selflessly and  enthusiastically as he had once defended the ideas of youth  housing complexes, cottage construction, and brick plants. The  press pulled him to pieces, turning Lobov into a simply odious  figure. It is said that when Oleg Ivanovich yet again tried  with unfeigned enthusiasm to preach his ideas at government  session, a rumble went round the auditorium. Even Mr.  Zaveryukha looked quite sane compared to Lobov. Eventually in  September 1993 Oleg Lobov was honorably removed from the  economy: He was appointed secretary of the Russian Security  Council.    In considering this inglorious and dramatic page in Oleg  Ivanovich Lobov's history you can make several hypotheses.  Experts believe that the drastic increase in the activity of  "Yeltsin's man" could only have been sanctioned by the  president. Thus Yeltsin was sounding out the possibility of  retreating from the reforms after the Russian Supreme Soviet had  voiced its lack of confidence in Gaydar in December 1992 and  removed him from the management of the economy. Lobov's  resignation in September 1993 was a concession to the  "monetarists" fighting him not for life but to the death, when  the president needed their support again in the late summer and  early fall. When the idea of constitutional reform ripened,  when all public opinion polls showed unequivocally that if the  president were to dissolve parliament then the people would not  lift a finger.    In addition virtually the entire government at the time was  interested in Lobov's resignation. Fedorov and Chubays because  of the obvious contradiction in views of economic policy. The  premier and his henchmen because of apparatus considerations:  Chernomyrdin had absolutely no need for the close presence of a  man laying claim to a considerable proportion of the powers of  the premier himself.    But I would not present Oleg Lobov as a kind of unfortunate  victim of the political struggle. His rise and fall in 1993  were ultimately by no means the consequence of the president's  political games or the premier's bureaucratic intriguing  (although there undoubtedly were games and intriguing). Rather  they were the natural outcome of the next stage in the country's  historical development. A stage at which managers like Oleg  Lobov were quite unable to hold commanding heights in the  economy.    One newspaper wrote at the time: "Oleg Lobov has the image  and personal qualities of a typical representative of the former  party and economic nomenklatura and whatever he does, however he  tries to look like a 'market man,' his style and manner will  remain those of an inveterate representative of the  administrative-edict system. And nothing can be done about that.  The man will not be able to change his skin in his maturity."    Today Oleg Lobov holds the "honorable" post of Security  Council secretary. This work is hardly to his liking. He  himself has repeatedly stressed and seemingly quite sincerely:  I am not a politician, I am an economic manager. And now, on  the anti-Chubays wave raised by Yuriy Luzhkov, Lobov continues  to defend his views of privatization. But the Security Council  is in no haste to study the economy and, people in the know say,  are quietly grumbling about their new boss.    What next?    Lobov will not break through to power like Yuriy Skokov.  Because he does not know how. During his entire time in leading  posts Oleg Ivanovich has not cobbled together any "support  group": He simply did not engage in it. There are no lobby  structures behind him. No "initiative group" of interested  political "chess players" will gamble on him because what kind  of a chess game is it when everyone can clearly see on hundred  moves ahead: Lobov is Yeltsin's man. And in general playing  political chess is not in the nature of this heir of the Don  cossacks.    Experts believe that if there is a military coup tomorrow (I  stress -- this is a purely hypothetical suggestion, there are no  real grounds for it, and it does not lay the slightest claim to  the "number three story) and if Yeltsin were to go abroad, he  would leave the country not to Chernomyrdin but to Lobov. The  former, a pragmatic man, who has always had his personal  interests in sight, will find a common language with the  putschists and will make compromises. The latter will shoot it  out to the last but will not surrender Yeltsin.    And the experts also say that if Chernomyrdin drives the  country into hyperinflation and Yeltsin decides to take full  economic power into his own hands -- he will put Lobov in the  government in order to neutralize it but always to have it to  hand and to feel calm about it.    God forbid we live to see such options....</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Mediation Committee for the </F> Preservation of Social Peace and National Unity on 14 April;  place not given]    [Text] Faced with the particularly tense situation our  country is experiencing, and in view of the dramatic  consequences that this could have for democracy, national unity,  peace, and social harmony, the ANDDH and the (?DMD) have agreed  to join hands within the framework of a mediation committee for  the preservation of civil peace and national unity.    The mediation committee notes that the authorities of the  Third Republic -- the state president, the speaker of the  National Assembly, and the prime minister -- support and  encourage the mediation efforts being undertaken by these two  associations, and that the parliamentary opposition has shown  its willingness for dialogue and equally endorses the initiative  of the two associations. Consequently, the mediation committee  notes with satisfaction the desire for openness and dialogue  exhibited on both sides, and strongly urges the two parties to  refrain from any act or acts that could compromise national  unity, peace, social harmony, democracy, or the Republic.    At this juncture, the committee earnestly calls on the  opposition to set aside any initiatives which could lead to  strikes and civil disobedience, and to refrain from any  statements likely to thwart the ongoing negotiations. The  mediation committee counts on the two parties' sense of  responsibility, wisdom, moderation, and their commitment to the  creative values of civilization -- which constitute one of the  basic hallmarks of our people -- in order to preserve unity and  brotherhood among all Nigerois, to ensure economic well-being  and progress, and to guarantee as well as safeguard democracy,  peace, and social harmony in our country.</p>

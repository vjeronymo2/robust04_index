			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Buyer sought for sports car maker DISCUSSIONS were said last night to be proceeding with 'several' potential buyers for Ginetta Cars, the maker of sports cars based in Scunthorpe, Humberside, which is in receivership. Mr David Stokes, the joint administrative receiver with Cork Gully, is operating the company as a going concern, with final development being continued of a new car planned for launch at next month's Birmingham motor show. Ginetta, the subject of a management buy-in led by Mr Martin Phaff nearly three years ago, is one of the less well-known UK specialist carmakers. However, since the company was founded in 1958 it has built a small but loyal following based mainly on successes in motor sport. Following the buy-in, Ginetta launched an ambitious expansion programme, notably into export markets. Its entry into receivership, at the request of its directors to its bankers, Barclays, was triggered last week by sterling's collapse and its adverse effect on the company's foreign-currency borrowings. It was most heavily hit by the effect of sterling's fall on around Pounds 1m of yen borrowings. Total indebtedness is around Pounds 2m. In 1990 Ginetta had signed a three-year deal to supply at least 30 cars a year over the next three years to Wary House, the Japanese importing company, based near Tokyo. At the time, the deal appeared to be a sufficient coup for Sir James Cleminson, chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board, to travel to the company's base to welcome Japanese delegates to the signing ceremony. Ginetta produced 150 cars in 1991 but had intended to raise the total to 300 this year. The Scunthorpe company is the second specialist UK carmaker to go into receivership within two months. Land Rover, the four-wheel-drive subsidiary of British Aerospace's Rover Group, is to launch a new 'flagship' Range Rover model at next week's Paris motor show. It will be longer than the current model, have a larger engine and what is claimed to be the world's first electronic air suspension system. Lex, Page 26</p>

The details of the active shuttle diplomacy being conducted  behind the scenes in Tunis are not being divulged as yet, but  our correspondent managed to obtain a comprehensive interview,  which sets forth Russia's general approaches to the situation in  the region at this time, with Viktor Posuvalyuk, special  representative of the president of Russia in the Near East and  chief of the North Africa and Near East Department of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, who has already been here  several days.    Responding to a question concerning the fundamental bases of  the restoration of the peace process, the representative of the  president of Russia emphasized that Russian policy proceeds from  the need to preserve as the base of the negotiating process the  "Gaza and Jericho first" agreement and the Declaration of  Principles of Relations Between the PLO and Israel signed on 3  September 1993 in Washington. "All the direct participants in  the peace negotiations, Russia included, are confronted by a  single task--making it recoilless," Viktor Posuvalyuk continued.  He observed here that after 13 September "many people succumbed  to a certain euphoria, believing that the process had become  irreversible," but after the tragic events of 25 February at the  mosque in the city of Hebron, "it transpired that we had all  been `resting on our laurels' too soon."    "No compromise, as the phenomenon of a combination of two  viewpoints, is ideal if seen merely from the standpoint of one  party," V. Posuvalyuk observed. "But, by and large, the  negotiations in Oslo and their `crown'--the Declaration of  Principles--are of `an optimum diplomatic form.'" "Russian  diplomacy not only knew of the secret meetings in Oslo but also  actively assisted their successful completion. Despite the  pressure being exerted from different sides, we always put the  emphasis on the PLO and its present leadership as the sole  credit-worthy partner of the government of Yitzhak Rabin, who  came to power in Israel to slogans of peace."    Posuvalyuk rejected attempts to revise the said agreements  inasmuch as it would play into the hands merely of extremist  forces of all shades on both sides. "We must not farm out the  development of events in the region to madmen, fanatics, and  provocateurs," Viktor Posuvalyuk declared. While recognizing  that fundamental questions of a settlement (the fate of the  Israeli settlements on the West Bank of the River Jordan and in  the Gaza Strip, the future form of the official status of the  occupied territories, the affiliation of East Jerusalem, and so  forth) remained outside of the framework of the said agreements,  the Russian diplomat emphasized that, in his opinion, the boat  could not be "overloaded" at the time they were being signed.    To conclude the interview Viktor Posuvalyuk observed that  Russian diplomacy intended to continue to play an essential part  both in the Near East and at other focal points of international  tension and to step up its efforts in resolving conflict  situations. "Russia occupies its ample niche in the Near East  region, to which, by virtue of its distinctiveness, primarily  historical and spiritual, no one else can lay claim," he  emphasized.    Touching on the situation in connection with Iraq, the  Russian diplomat observed that "Baghdad has already gone a  considerable way toward compliance with UN Security Council  Resolution 687." "This could at some stage, not too far off,  what is more, put on a practical footing discussion of the  question of the lifting of the international sanctions, the oil  embargo in particular," he noted. Posuvalyuk emphasized in this  connection that Russia "has a particular interest in this,  considerable, what is more," alluding to Iraq's debt to Moscow.  "This does not, it is true, release Iraq from its obligation to  unequivocally comply with all the other resolutions," he  concluded, "particularly those connected with unambiguous  recognition of the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait."    The representative of the president of Russia announced that  during his stay in Tunis he had "useful talks with Ambassador  al-Ubaydi, special representative of the Libyan leadership,  during which the present situation in the `Lockerbie case'" and  also problems of bilateral Russian-Libyan relations with regard  to Russia's serious economic interests in this country were  discussed.</p>

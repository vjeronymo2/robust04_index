			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the Metropolitan Hill Palace [parliament  headquarters] today, Suleyman Demirel, president of the Republic  of Turkey, who yesterday began a visit in our country, addressed  a joint session of the two chambers of the Romanian parliament.    The festive occasion was opened by Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Adrian Nastase, who emphasized the fact that our  countries have a long joint history and today they have found  each other again in [words indistinct] turning it into a joint  source of further development. Nastase also said that the visit  to Romania of the head of the Turkish state and of the  delegation he is heading has a special significance both for the  two countries and for our neighbors.    In his speech Turkish President Suleyman Demirel recognized  the road left behind by our country after December 1989 on its  way to pluralist democracy and market economy, a road which, as  is only natural, is also full of obstacles; to overcome them one  needs determination, patience, understanding, effort and time,  Demirel said.    Talking about the evolution of cooperative relations between  Romania and Turkey, Demirel said that it is characterized by  mutual respect, the will to know each other better and increase  efforts to further cooperation, and the sentiment of solidarity  in difficult moments. In that context he mentioned the fact  that Turkey currently ranks sixth in Romania's total trade  dealings, and in fourth place in relation to the number of  foreign companies investing in our country.    Reviewing the principal events in current international  affairs, the head of the Turkish state noted that the peace  process budding in the Middle East represents a hope that will  influence the future of the entire area, after which he asserted  that in the southern parts of Turkey there are possibilities for  new cooperation.    Concerning the transformation currently occurring in the  central and eastern parts of Europe, Demirel pointed out that  the projected Partnership for Peace ensures the security and  stability of Europe and adjacent areas, adding that his country  learned with satisfaction about the fact that Romania was the  first state to sign that accord.    On relations in the Balkans, the Turkish president said that  some of the countries in that region are facing difficulties  created by their transition to democracy and a free market  economy and by certain ethnic problems that cause tension among  the countries in that area.    After mentioning the fact that last week in Washington an  accord was signed by Bosnian Muslims and Croatians, who decided  to live together, Demirel appealed to the Serbs to join that  process to contribute to the reestablishment of peace and  cooperation on the soil of the former Yugoslavia. He also  requested that the nations in the Balkans support this  opportunity that has been created and ensure a growing hope for  peace, so that it can spread throughout the region.    In concluding his speech, referring again to our bilateral  cooperation, the Turkish president pointed out that his country  and Romania are two large countries in this area and they are  developing their cooperation in a way that can be seen as an  example for the entire region.</p>

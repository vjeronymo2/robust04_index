Ambassador  Howard Dee, chairman of the government panel, said they are  still awaiting the response from the NDF leaders to the  government's letter dated 27 December. Dee said the government  has agreed in that letter to the holding of preliminary talks in  Europe primarily to settle issues blocking the holding of  exploratory talks in Vietnam. Earlier, the government proposed  to hold the preliminary negotiations with NDF leaders middle of  this month.</p>

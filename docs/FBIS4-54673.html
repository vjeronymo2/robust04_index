			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.Lj.: "9th Battalion From All the Battlefields"] </F>   [Text] Ante Prkacin, Assembly deputy and member of  the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] Headquarters, and Major General  Mate Sarlija Daidza were present at the formal review of the 9th  Battalion of the 114th Brigade.    "It is an extraordinary honor for me to welcome the best  sons  of Croatia on behalf of the HSP's Headquarters and to  congratulate you on the third anniversary of your founding and  combat activity," said Assembly deputy Ante Prkacin on the  occasion of the formal commemoration of the third anniversary of  the founding of the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion of the 114th  Brigade on Sunday at the Visoka barracks.    Later in his speech, Prkacin spoke about the unfavorable  external and internal reasons that led to the collapse of the  NDH [Independent State of Croatia], emphasizing that at that  time the Croatian people was not as cohesive and homogeneous as  today in fulfilling the Croatian state, but the leadership at  that time was well aware who the enemies of the Croatian people  were, creating a strong anti-Serbian front from members of the  Croatian and Muslim population, ready to give their own lives  for freedom.    The members of the 9th Battalion were also congratulated on  the third anniversary of the founding of the Sir Rafael Boban  battalion by the commander, Major Marko Skejo, Major General  Mate Sarlija Daidza, and Mate Gotovac, president of the HSP's  Kastelanec branch. Major Marko Skejo emphasized that the members  of the Sir Rafael Boban battalion had fought bravely throughout  Croatia, and commented that the heroic unit had more dead and  wounded than some entire Croatian parishes.    "The families of the dead are therefore sacred to us, and  our  concern for them must never cease," Skejo said, adding that the  members of the HOS [Croatian Defense Forces] were precisely the  ones who had frightened the Greater-Serbian enemy the most with  their courage, and put an end to Yugoslavia and communism.  Finally, Skejo emphasized that the motives of the grandfathers  and fathers who had once fought for Croatia, and the motives of  their sons, were completely identical, namely love for their  homeland, and he warned that cheap political games could not be  played with respect to members of the HOS, and demanded the same  status for all Croatian defenders who rose in defense of our  homeland.    A review of the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion was also  conducted at the Visoka barracks, with the anthem "Lijepa nasa"  being sung, and deputy commander Mice Cuk presented a report to  the battalion's commander, Major Marko Skejo. Finally,  refreshments were arranged, and thanks were expressed to the  members of the Sir Rafael Boban battalion.</p>

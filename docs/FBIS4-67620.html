			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yonatan Hileli] </F>   [Text] During the first three months of 1994, 31 new AIDS  carriers were registered in Israel.    New figures on the AIDS situation in Israel arrived at the  Health Ministry this month. Since 1981 1,134 AIDS carriers were  discovered, 784 of them men. Of these carriers, 33 left the  country and 29 died of causes not directly related to the  disease.    So far 202 people have died of AIDS in Israel; 16 of the  patients have left the country. Only 26 women are registered as  AIDS patients at the present time, approximately 10 percent of  the living patients.    Over the last few years there has been a steady increase in  the number of women contracting AIDS in Israel. The reason for  this is the increase in the number of hetrosexually contracted  cases.</p>

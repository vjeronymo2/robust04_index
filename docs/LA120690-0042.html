			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Law of Love: Italian porn star and parliamentarian Ilona Staller and U.S.  sculptor Jeff Koons have fallen in love via intercontinental faxes. "They are  madly in love," said Sabrina Innocente, Staller's spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Though the two had met earlier, the relationship developed "via fax," said  Innocente. The brassy blonde has campaigned for an end to obscenity laws.  </P> <P> Knocked Out: The Army rejected an offer to send Boxing Illustrated magazine to  U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia because the Saudis might consider it pornographic,  an Army spokeswoman in New York said Wednesday. A magazine with pictures of men  wearing only boxing trunks is "offensive to the Saudis," said the spokeswoman.  But Bert Sugar, the magazine's publisher, was not down for the count: "I have  waited this long in my life to be called pornographic. It's wonderful!" he  joked.  </P> <P> Cover-Up Girl: The current Esquire magazine cover reads: "What Michelle  Pfeiffer Needs . . . Is Absolutely Nothing." Not so, says the January Harper's  magazine, which is publishing the photo retoucher's bill of $1,525 to "clean up  complexion, soften smile line, trim chin . . . soften neck muscle a bit."  Harper's Editor Lewis Lapham pictured the expose as a public service: "Women  are constantly faced with perfection in magazines. This is to remind the reader  in an amusing way there's a difference between life and art."  </P> <P> Colorful: Crayola company officials in Easton, Pa., might be turning a little  red -- make that fuchsia -- with news that its top crayon maker is blue-green  colorblind. But Emerson Moser, 63, says he has only a shade of it. "If you have  a serious case of it, you could foul up a lot of materials," said Moser. He  hasn't. He's made a record 1.4 billion correct crayons.  </P></p>

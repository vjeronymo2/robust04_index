			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Beckenham turns in loss of Pounds 2.6m Beckenham Group, the USM-quoted heating and ventilation engineer which has recently undergone a capital reconstruction, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.6m for the six months to April 30. The deficit, which compared with losses of Pounds 186,000 last time, reflected 'continuing difficult trading conditions, the heavy cost of completing long-standing contract commitments, and damage inflicted by the financial crisis the group has experienced', the directors said. Turnover fell from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 13.4m and the pre-tax result was struck after an increased interest charge of Pounds 174,000 (Pounds 112,000). Losses per share emerged at 12.9p (3p). The company also announced it had sold its Contract Components subsidiary to Simco 651 for Pounds 2.5m cash. The sale would enable the group to concentrate its resources on the core ductwork businesses and to develop its fire protection activities. It was also necessary to maintain the company's working capital and reduce indebtedness, directors said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, 16 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) --  Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial CPC Committee,  recently stated that 10 different work styles among leading  cadres were quite worthy of attention. They were:    --Vague leadership. Being contented with the current  situation, not using their brains, being slack at work, having  no distinguishing features, not making breakthroughs, and having  no creativity in work.    --"Principle" leadership. Being accustomed to talking about  great truths, general principles, and general concepts, but  lacking deep and thorough analyses of problems, and not showing  real knowledge and deep insight in light of reality when giving  guidance to work.    --Wait-for-instruction leadership. Waiting for instructions  from higher levels in handling any matter, acting according to  what people at higher levels say, making no investigation, no  studies, no personal stands, and taking no initiative for solid  work in solving problems.    --Leadership of shirking responsibility. Shirking one's  duties to higher or lower levels or to lateral organizations,  making no progress in work, and blaming others for any mistakes  made.    --Weak leadership. Trying hard to play the part of a good  person, being afraid of confronting tough issues, of undertaking  responsibility, of facing contradictions squarely, or of  tackling difficult problems.    --Nonprofessional leadership. Not acquiring new knowledge  and new skills on one's initiative despite changes in the  situation, depending only on old experience and old ideas,  looking triumphant and considering oneself right despite one's  incompetence in work.    --Formalist leadership. Doing superficial work, seeking  sensational effects, blowing one's own trumpet in writing  articles and summing experience while paying no attention to  actual results.    --Routine work leadership. Being busy with welcoming people  and seeing people off, accompanying people to meetings and  dinners, attending ceremonies for laying foundation stones and  cutting ribbons, wasting energy on reading speeches, and failing  to grasp essential work.    --Reckless leadership. Paying empty lip service, telling  lies, forging accounts, reporting false achievements to put up  an outward show and to please people at higher levels, striking  one's chest and promising to do something which one never  intends to do.    --Favor-currying leadership. Being enthusiastic in  establishing relationships and visiting people, seeking fame and  personal gain, and even openly demanding official posts and  power.    A few days ago, Cheng Weigao, together with cadres of some  provincial departments, went to Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and  Cangzhou to carry out investigations. They discovered that an  important reason why some localities had long been unable to  open up a new situation and why work had not been properly done  was that there were problems in the ideology and work styles of  some leading cadres. Cheng Weigao pointed out that, although  the number of cadres with the ideology and work styles mentioned  above was small, their influence was bad. In some localities,  many things had been delayed; reform, opening up, and economic  construction had been prevented from developing better and  faster; and the image of the party and the government among the  people had been damaged, causing resentment among the people.    In view of problems in the ideology and work styles of  leading cadres, Hebei Province has adopted corresponding  measures for assessing and using cadres and for further  establishing necessary rules and regulations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russia, the United  States, the European Union and the United Nations have set up a  "contact group" which wanted a four-month peace to allow the  Bosnian map to be redrawn.    London will be the first venue for the "contact group"  meeting scheduled on Tuesday [26 April], British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd said today after meetings with his U.S,  French counterparts and Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin.    Hurd said he preferred negotiation to air strikes, which  were  threatened if Serbs failed to comply with the ultimatum to  withdraw all heavy weapons at least 20 kilometers from  Moslem-held Gorazde by 0001 GMT on Wednesday.    "I think there is a realization amongst most people that  this  war is only going to be brought to an end by a negotiated  settlement," he said, "What we are doing is seeking to unify the  efforts we are all making towards that end."    British officials said the cast of negotiators in the  "contact group" will be little changed from the previous team  already working for the Bosnian peace. The list would probably  contain Russian and American special envoys to former  Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkin and Charles Redman, United Nations  peace negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg and German, French and  British officials.    Western officials welcomed in the new group the inclusion of  Russia, widely considered as an ally of Serbs. Churkin said he  expected tremendous efforts to be made in bringing peace in  Bosnia.    "I think the next week or two are going to be very intensive  and hard work for us all in order to bring things to a peaceful  conclusion in Bosnia," Churkin said after a meeting with British  Prime Minister John Major.    Churkin said he had been working hard to persuade Bosnian  Serbs to end hostilities with the Moslems.    British officials said there was a broad agreement that  Serbs  face "firm response" if the ultimatum to withdraw is not met.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher hailed the  formation of "contact group" and said there were "good  prospects" of ending bloodshed.    "The contact group is the best way to try and regain the  momentum that existed prior to the situation in Gorazde," said  Christopher after meeting Britain's Major.    "We think only through the combined influence of all the  parties that I mentioned will we achieve success here. It is  the combined influence that has the best prospect for a  resolution of these matters," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan's household  expenditures posted the second straight yearly decline in fiscal  1993, which ended March 31, reflecting continued weak consumer  spending, the Management and Coordination Agency reported  Thursday [26 May].    The average Japanese family of 3.48 people spent 335,379 yen  monthly in the year, down 0.6 percent from the previous year,  following a 0.5 percent fall in the previous year, the agency  said.    "Families spent less on durable goods, discouraged by lower  income resulting from the recession," an official at the agency  said.    Families of salaried workers spent 1.3 percent less, while  families of nonsalaried workers registered a 0.7 percent  spending increase, the official said.    In March alone, household spending shrank a real 4.3 percent  to an average 353,908 yen for the second consecutive month after  four months of year-on-year gains, it said.</p>

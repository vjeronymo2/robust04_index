			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Managed news BY OPPOSING change in the timing of News at Ten, the independent television network's flagship news bulletin, the government may temporarily have mollified its back benches. In doing so, however, it has highlighted growing internal contradictions in what passes for Britain's broadcasting policy, which cannot be resolved by a political quick fix. The ITV companies want to shift News at Ten to an earlier prime time hour to make way for programmes which will attract bigger audiences and advertising revenues. It is hard to fault their logic, since the explicit purpose of the government's reform of the ITV franchise system was to induce the companies to behave more commercially. The Independent Television Commission's objection that the proposed programme change would violate the companies' licence obligations is tenuous at best. The ITC asserts that, when bidding for franchises, several indicated in their proposed programme schedules that they would keep News at Ten at its traditional hour. But that was never a condition of the franchise licences. By attempting to impose it now, the ITC seems to be suggesting it can veto any departure by franchise-holders from their original schedules. There are legitimate grounds for arguing that, television news, as the main source of information for most of the population, occupies a special position. Ideally, diversity and impartiality should be encouraged by free competition. But if that cannot be achieved by the market, regulation - and even some public funding - may be required. However, the sole aim of such measures should be to safeguard the integrity and editorial independence of news providers. Regrettably, that does not appear to be main concern prompting the prime minister and Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, to intervene publicly in the News at Ten affair. Indeed, Mr Brooke's hint that the ITV companies should back off if they want him to relax the current takeover restrictions on them hints at potentially murkier motives. The government cannot have it both ways. If Britain is to have a television network that is genuinely commercial and independent, it must be allowed to develop free from capricious regulation and political meddling. A new framework is needed, which also takes account of the BBC and the growth of alternative broadcasting channels. The longer the government delays confronting that challenge, the more glaring will become the shortcomings of its existing policies.</p>

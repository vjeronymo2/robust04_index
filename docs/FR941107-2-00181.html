			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, we must ensure that airlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give consumers clear information about the characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of their service product, and that consumers can distinguish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between code sharing and other forms of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the two types of global networks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (sole-carrier systems and joint carrier systems), there will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be a role for air services outside of global  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> networks. The U.S. experience with deregulation indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that_absent legal barriers to entry_specialized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitors will enter the market and discipline the pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service behavior of the larger network operators. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction of technologically advanced aircraft such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the B&hyph;767, the MD&hyph;11 and the B&hyph;777 make direct service on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer or thinner routes economically viable. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines can viably serve heavily traveled routes with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point-to-point service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, as indicated by our domestic experience, a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of service forms_global networks with carriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating either as the sole provider or as participant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a joint network, and regional niche carriers_can exist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the international aviation market and the competition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among these services will enhance consumer benefits through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient operations and low fares. Thus, our international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aviation strategy should provide opportunities for all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these forms of service so that we realize the benefits from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum competition among them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our airlines are well positioned to be primary participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in all aspects of the future global marketplace. In recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, our largest domestic carriers have become our primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international carriers, replacing specialized international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators. After operating in a deregulated domestic market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for more than 15 years, our carriers have developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating efficiencies that give them a cost advantage over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their major foreign competitors. Moreover, the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions of our carriers are improving due to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost-cutting measures and improving economic conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coupled with their cost efficiencies, their improving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial status will further enhance their competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capabilities. Over time, however, trends toward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> privatization and increased productivity of major foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitors may affect the current cost advantage U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines enjoy. We must try to provide our carriers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flexible rights and economic environment that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable them to respond to the dynamics of the marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Intergovernment Aviation Relations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> International air services between two nations have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditionally been conducted pursuant to bilateral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements. The U.S. National Commission To Ensure a Strong  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Competitive Airline Industry and the European Union's Comit&eacute;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> des Sages for Air Transport have both recognized that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilateral system is limited in its ability to encompass the broad,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multinational market access required by the new global  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating systems. Consequently, progress in developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> global networks has been and will be extremely fragmented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and may preclude or limit the development of efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. We must consider alternative forums for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international aviation negotiations and agreements in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we can obtain the necessary broad access rights. We should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine the feasibility of achieving multilateral air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service agreements among trading partners. Although such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations may be more complex and difficult because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of parties involved, they should be undertaken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when they present a reasonable prospect for further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liberalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

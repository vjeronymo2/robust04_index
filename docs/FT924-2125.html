			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Pressure to free textile markets TEXTILE coalitions from the US and Europe yesterday united in Washington to demand changes in the Uruguay Round negotiating text to force developing countries to open their textiles and clothing markets to the industrialised countries. Mr M L Cates, president of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute, cautioned against a 'rush to a quick and crippling conclusion in the Round', so as to give the Clinton administration a chance to address issues neglected in the negotiations. Mr Cates and Mr Wolfgang Sannwald, president of Comitextil, a coalition of European producer groups, presented what they called 'a Magna Carta' for the industry and urged that it be adopted in the Round. It provides for market openings 'on a reciprocal basis among free market economy countries'; vigorous measures against piracy of intellectual property; commitments on labour rights like child labour laws; and enforcement of environmental standards.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hani Naqshabandi: "Sanaa Rebuilds Socialist Party </F> in North"]    [Text] Sanaa--High-ranking sources in the Socialist Party  leadership in northern Yemeni governorates have said that the  party is continuing the process of rebuilding its grassroots  organizations right up to central committee level. But two  points are still under discussion:     -  Determining the the legal and political status of the new  formation, whether it is "a unionist extension" of the party,  whose leadership is in southern governorates (Aden and  Hadhramaut) at present, or whether it is a new organization  completely separate from the Socialist Party with its known  shape and formations.    -  Whether the new formation is going to rise structurally and  organizationally from central committee level to political  bureau level. This is in addition to the issue of selecting an  alternative leadership to the leadership present in the south,  whom Sanaa accuses of "secessionism and rebellion."        There is a heated debate among the party's members in Sanaa  over their position toward 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the secretary  general, and other leaders in general. Some middle-ranking  cadres of northern origin are urging the speedy selection of an  alternative leadership in a clear expression of the desire to  seize the favorable opportunity to achieve personal ambitions.  Meanwhile, high-ranking leaders of southern origin who happened  to be in Sanaa when the war broke out are calling for patience.    It seems that a decision in this connection will be delayed  for some time pending the outcome of the ongoing fighting  between northern and southern forces, the attempts to secure a  cease-fire, and the resumption of the dialogue between the two  warring parties (the General People's Congress and Yemeni Reform  Grouping, on one hand, and the Yemeni Socialist Party, on the  other)    The situation will be determined in the light of an  agreement  on a new shape for unity. Then the new formation would become  part of the process of rebuilding the party or a perpetuation of  the secession between the north and the south, hence a separate  party raising the banner of reachieving unity, thus becoming a  tool in Sanaa's hand to shake the southern regime in the future.    This raises an important question about the position of  numerous high-ranking leaders of southern origin who are in  Sanaa at present and whether their current convictions "stem  from the state of emergency" and could change when conditions  change.</p>

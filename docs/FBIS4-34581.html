			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Jun (NA) -- Peruvian citizen Jorge  Diaz Reategui, who was detained a week ago in the city of  Tucuman on charges of being a member of the Shining Path [SL]  guerrilla group, was released after it was confirmed that he is  no longer a SL member.    Diaz Reategui was released on 17 June after an Interpol  report confirmed that Diaz Reategui is a SL deserter who  received special OAS political asylum.    The Peruvian police have confirmed that no arrest warrant  has  been issued on Diaz Reategui. It was also confirmed that his  Argentine residence permit is authentic.    Diaz Reategui was detained at a hotel in the poor district  of  "El Bajo," near the bus terminal of the city of San Miguel de  Tucuman. At the time of Diaz Reategui's detention, it was  reported that he was participating in a meeting with other  alleged guerrillas who escaped.    Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf accused Diaz Reategui of  participating in protests in some northern provinces. Ruckauf  noted that those who were meeting with Diaz Reategui "had been  spotted in other parts of our country, participating in public  disorders."</p>

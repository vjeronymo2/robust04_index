			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A bubbly time at last - Champagne WHEN we are all belt-tightening, and Lent is just around the corner, February may seem an odd month to recommend champagne. But it is a good time to buy and drink it - and not just the cheap brands promoted by supermarkets. Overall it is likely to be superior in quality compared with a few years ago. Moreover, sterling devaluation and likely Budget duty rises may increase retail prices of new imports by up to 20 per cent. Quality should be better for two reasons. The sharp fall in sales since 1989 has resulted in an accumulation of merchants' stocks. Many firms have five years' stock in their cellars. One leading merchant described his Epernay cellars as almost full to the roof. All but the immature champagnes, dumped on the market mostly by cash-hungry growers who market their own brands, will have the benefit of increased bottle-age - an important factor for champagne. Secondly, non-vintage blends, which account for 85 per cent of production, will include wines from the particularly fine and prolific 1989 and 1990 vintages. The high quality of these years and a still optimistic market partly led to excessive rises in official prices. However, at the last vintage, the price of grapes per kilo fell sharply to FFr24 plus a premium of FFr2.50 for the top villages and FFr19 for the bottom-rated communes. With 1.3 kilos of grapes needed per bottle, and a basic production cost without overheads, depreciation or interest charges of FFr15, this means a minimum of FFr45 per bottle for the top level and FFr39 at the bottom. However, the French supermarkets have been selling champagne at FFr45 to FFr50 a bottle and one big one, LeClerc, at less than FFr40 - in all cases including 18.6 per cent VAT. So they have presumbly been selling at a heavy loss. This has rebounded on the big co-ops which market their own brands and the 4500 growers who do the same. They have been undercut in a slice of the French domestic market that accounted for nearly half French domestic sales. It is mostly these too-young brands from low-level sources that have attracted criticism for their lack of quality. However, in the 1992 vintage, significant improvements were made. Apprehensive growers sold more grapes to the merchants than for 20 years. The third pressing (the deuxieme taille) was eliminated. For each 100 litres of pressed juice 160 kilos of grapes were required, instead of 150, thus raising quality. The maximum yield per ha was reduced to 10,400 kilos, but this year everything above 9,000 kilos was put into a blocked reserve of still wine, denied second fermentation - or payment - until its probable release in two years' time. This year the minimum bottle-age allowed before sale is expected to be increased from 12 to 15 months, with 18 on the horizon. This will certainly improve quality, but not affect the Grandes Marques which sell their NV when 2 1/2 to three years old. Future developments in prices will depend on the state of the market and the size and quality of the next vintage, likely to be large in designated vineyard areas; unless, hit by natural disasters. Top prices may drop again to FFr20 per kilo, and growers may demand a return to modified inter-professional contracts, guaranteeing their sale. But the merchants are nearly all firmly against this. However, Champagne is the best organised wine region in France, with close collaboration between growers and merchants and with both dedicated to higher quality in order to compete with other sparkling wines. Good champagne can never be cheap but, increasingly, it should be good value as the best wine of celebration.</p>

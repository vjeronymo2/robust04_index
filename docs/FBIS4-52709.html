			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic </F> Socialist Party [DSP]; place and date not given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano's resignation?    [Ouchi] The issue cannot be settled by merely withdrawing  his remarks. In view of the fact that his remarks have had a  serious effect on various concerned countries, he has to take  the blame for making them. And it is appropriate for him to  decide to resign. It was extremely inappropriate for him to say  that "[the Nanjing masscare] is a fabrication."    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How about the effect on the political  situation?    [Ouchi] The new cabinet has just been formed, the Hata  administration will have to undergo a serious ordeal such as  attacks by opposition parties. And the cabinet will have to  overcome various trials.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The idea of forming a new parliamentary  group, "Kaishin" [Innovation], has caused the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] to secede from the coalition. Mr.  Chairman, was this idea worked out by you?    [Ouchi] That is correct. Since gaps were noted between the  SDPJ and other coalition parties, there was a danger that these  gaps could lead to the breakup of the coalition. Therefore,  setting aside my own personal feelings, I had been thinking of  forming a stable parliamentary group. It would have been  undesirable for conflict to arise every time the issue of the  DPRK's (North Korea) development of nuclear weapons is brought  up. With the idea of forming such a parliamentary group in  mind, I called a meeting of the party executives on 22 April.  Then, I directly informed General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa  (of the the DSP) and Representative Ichiro Ozawa (of Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party]) of this idea and asked their views.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How did Mr. Ozawa respond at that time?    [Ouchi] Very simply, he said that "he would agree to the  idea." When I asked him if "he was opposed to the idea of  including Sakigake [Harbinger]," he answered that he "was not  opposed to it." Therefore, I thought it was all right to go  ahead with the plan.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Did you talk to Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama of the SDPJ?    [Ouchi] I said to Mr. Murayama: "In viewing the situation  from a broader point of view, we intend to form a parliamentary  group composed of the Japan New Party, Sakigake, DSP, and  Shinseito, although it would be impossible to win the SDPJ's  immediate understanding." In response, Mr. Murayama said:  "Yes, that is right. Why do you not go ahead with the plan?"  I asked for his understanding that this group would be formed  with four parties.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Maintaining that the act "constitutes a  breach of faith," the SDPJ has seceded from the coalition. What  do you think of this?    [Ouchi] It would be understandable if they seceded from the  coalition because of a disagreement in policies. However, since  the administration is different from the parliamentary group, I  do not think it is a good reason for them to secede from the  coalition. I think that the decision was made basically because  of their original intention to cooperate with the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP], and it just so happened that the forming  of a new parliamentary group has given them a good excuse to  secede from the coalition. It is contrary to the fact to say  that our decision was "a complete surprise" to them.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the change of the  administration this time? And what role will the DSP play in  the future realignment of political circles?    [Ouchi] If the realignment of political circles should be  based on the new electoral system, it will be a task involving  all political parties. Now that the SDPJ has become an  opposition party, it will be difficult--when viewed from the  standpoint of common sense--for the SDPJ to promote regrouping  of political parties through its cooperation with the LDP. The  realignment should not be carried out without following some  principles. What is most important is that an accord should be  reached on basic policies. With our political ideology,  characteristics, and policies, it is always possible for our  party to play the leading role in promoting the realignment of  political circles.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hosokawa cabinet was criticized  for allowing its operations to be managed under the leadership  of Shinseito and Komeito. It seems that such a tendency will be  further strengthened under the Hata administration. What is  your view on this point?    [Ouchi] When the idea of the National Welfare Tax was  brought up without going through sufficient deliberations, we  dauntlessly asked for the idea to be revised. In the Hata  cabinet are many cabinet members who are members of Shinseito or  Komeito. Nevertheless, in aiming to create an open cabinet we  will do our best to promote cooperation within the cabinet.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] As a result of the issue of forming the  new parliamentary group "Kaishin," some members of the DSP as  well as labor unions that support the DSP have raised the issue  of the chairman's responsibility. What do you have to say on  this point?    [Ouchi] The idea of forming the parliamentary group was  based on the unanimous approval at a meeting of the party organ.  If criticism is based on the result, the idea has certainly led  to the unfortunate result of the SDPJ's secession from the  coalition. However, none of our party members are opposed to the  idea of forming the group. With regard to the issue of my  responsibility in dealing with this matter, I would listen to  criticism with modesty.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Have you ever thought of any concrete  plans to take responsibility?    [Ouchi] It will be necessary to think about how to take  responsibility. However, I do not think it is proper for me to  take responsibility right now.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the "Kaishin" group become a  political party before the next election?    [Ouchi] For the time being, it will be a floor group in the  Diet that supports the Hata administration. If a relationship  of confidence between each other should develop, the coalition  parties will play the central role in the realignment of  political circles. It will take considerable discussions before  the group can be developed into a new party. Viewed from the  standpoint of size, we cannot say that the realignment has been  completed when the size of all the political parties that have  joined the coalition this time is taken into consideration.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The opposition parties are already  engaged in discussing the possibility of dissolving the House of  Representatives or calling for a no-confidence vote on the  cabinet. What do you think of it?    [Ouchi] Some people may have such views. However, since the  opposition parties are willing to cooperate in the enactment of  the budget and other bills, I do not think that for the time  being the management of state affairs will be hampered. During  this period, measures will be worked out to strengthen the  coalition, and I will make efforts to this end.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Which system does the DSP intend to  support, the system of two major parties or the system of  multiple parties?    [Ouchi] An urgent question lies in preparing for a situation  in which there will be several political parties, and also in  creating two administrations (that can be replaced by each  other). I do not have any idea that multiple parties should be  reorganized into two major political parties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, chairman of the CPPCC </F> Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, at the closing meeting  of the Second session of the Sixth Tibet Regional Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)  on 21 May 1994]    [Text] Fellow members, comrades:    The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Regional CPPCC  Committee has successfully completed various tasks according to  its agenda through the joint hard work of all members and  comrades and will end today.    The current session has examined and adopted the work report  made by Vice Chairman Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub on behalf of the  Standing Committee of the Tibet Regional CPPCC Committee.  Members of the regional CPPCC committee have attended the  second session of the sixth regional people's congress as  observers, and heard the government work report by Chairman  Gyaincain Norbu and other important reports. Through serious  discussions, members of the regional CPPCC committee have  further unified their thinking, raised their common  understanding, heightened their spirit, and clearly understood  various goals. In a highly responsible spirit, members have  expressed many suitable opinions on reform, opening up, economic  construction, and other important issues related to the vital  interests of the broad masses of people. Their suggestions will  certainly promote various tasks of this region in a positive  manner. This year will be a crucial one for carrying out an  all-around reform, achieving breakthroughs, and accelerating the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure. In his  government work report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu has clearly  explained the guiding principles for promoting the tasks of  economic construction and deepening reform. We should see that  the accomplishment of those tasks will have a very important  bearing on fully implementing the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Fifth  Enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional  CPC Committee, promoting economic development and social  progress in this region and maintaining political stability. We  should also see that the tasks facing us are very arduous and  there are still many problems and difficulties on our road of  advance.    Fellow members and comrades, the CPPCC is an important  organization of our country in promoting multiparty cooperation  and political consultation, and shoulders an important mission.  The party's overall policy of seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and  maintaining stability has fully embodied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thinking for development and represents the fundamental  interests of people of all nationalities in the whole country.  The CPPCC organizations at various levels and all CPPCC members  must seriously study and firmly implement Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC National Congress and the fifth Enlarged Plenary  Meeting of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee,  emancipate their minds, further eliminate the old ideology and  concept formed under the system of the planned economy, change  their ways of thinking, use a new concept and new way compatible  to a socialist market economy to guide our work, and constantly  enhance our understanding in promoting reform, development, and  stability. In discussing major affairs in the autonomous  region, CPPCC members must take the entire national and regional  situation into consideration and see the local and actual  problems, and also take both long-term fundamental interests and  the current measures into consideration. We should promote  reform and development and at the same time maintain stability.  We should strive to take part in the building of the two  civilizations, and study and put forward suggestions and  opinions for solving new contradictions and problems emerging in  the course of reform. We should use the fruitful work of the  CPPCC to unite various mass organizations and people of various  nationalities on various fronts. We should give full play to all  positive factors, turn negative factors into positive one, and  unswervingly support the government's measures to deepen reform.    Fellow members, the realization of national progress and  people's prosperity is the common wish of people of various  nationalities in this region. We have already set major  policies and understand our tasks. Now the key is to implement  those policies and tasks. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line and under the  leadership of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, we  should closely unite around the party Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; seriously implement the  guidelines of the current session; heighten our spirit; work  with concerted efforts; struggle hard; and make greater  contributions to creating a new situation for promoting reform,  development, and stability in this region and to raising our  work of taking part in and providing consultative service for  government affairs to a new level!    I wish fellow members and all comrades good health and  smooth  progress in their work.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / When choice does not mean change in Ulster: The issues dominating the campaign in the province There are 17 candidates for the three Northern Ireland seats at Strasbourg, seven more than in 1989. Greater choice though, including a Conservative this time and a 'Yogic flyer' of the Natural Law party, is unlikely to produce significant changes to traditional voting patterns in Ulster's hothouse of sectarian politics. The Rev Ian Paisley, of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, topped the poll for the three-seat constituency in the 1989 election, followed by Mr John Hume of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and Mr Jim Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist party. Even the other candidates have little doubt that the same three will be elected again. The main interest therefore is in how the relative share of votes may shift. The key division between the three sitting MEPs is over the Downing Street declaration. Mr Paisley has declared the June 9 Euro-election to be a referendum on the Anglo-Irish peace efforts and what he says is a 'sell-out' to Dublin. Mr Hume and Mr Nicholson, moderates of the nationalist and unionist camps respectively, have chosen to fight the election on their Euro-credentials. Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the UUP, said: 'There is probably more in common between us and the SDLP in this campaign than there is with the DUP.' Europhile Mr Hume points to his successful lobbying to attract European Union structural funds to the province. He said: 'You've got the bizarre situation in this election that parties who have been against Europe are running around trying to claim credit for the European developments that have taken place in Northern Ireland.' The anti-federalist Mr Nicholson says that Ulster's MEPs have to do better. 'The republic (of Ireland) is getting funding at a level 2 1/2 times per head of population than we are in Northern Ireland. We've got to get in there to fight for the best possible deal and maximum support for Northern Ireland. If we don't achieve that the republic will continue to advance into the future and we will be left standing behind.' Sinn Fein is putting up three candidates and doing all it can to get its supporters out. It obtained 9 per cent of the poll in 1989, and any improvement on that will be used by the party's leaders to vindicate their begrudging approach to the peace process. Similarly the DUP will see any improvement in Mr Paisley's vote as a vindication for his rejection of the Downing Street declaration. The DUP is also likely to further strengthen its vote among Protestant working-class voters disgruntled with government economic and social policies that the UUP has backed at Westminster. Significantly, the only candidate to have visited a picket line at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast last week was Mr Paisley. The 125-strong workforce of the shipyard's ship-repair division has been on strike over management plans to implement an annualised hours agreement. This will effectively abolish overtime rates, yet will oblige the workforce to work up to 80 hours a week at peak periods. The dispute has highlighted Britain's opt-out on the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Sammy Wilson, DUP spokesman, said: 'We are against federalism that would dilute sovereignty and the union, but we support the social chapter.' The UUP could be vulnerable on the economic issue. Last weekend Mr Nicholson was out with party leader Mr James Molyneaux in the Protestant working-class area of Sandy Row in south Belfast, enthusiastically stuffing campaign literature through letterboxes. In a part of the Sandy Row enclave where wall paintings testify to support for loyalist paramilitaries, a local man approached Mr Nicholson and said: 'What are you going to do about housing - that's what I want to know?' A somewhat surprised Mr Nicholson paused a moment and said: 'Well housing isn't a European issue actually.'</p>

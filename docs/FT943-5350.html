Campaign members say abolishing the ancient rights would lead to an explosion of car boot sales and unauthorised markets. The government says the rules are anachronistic and are misused by some councils to stifle business initiatives. The association says, however, that the government has failed in its pledge to bring forward proposals to reform market franchise rights, which the association admits contain many anomalies and need updating. It is worried that the government will try to reintroduce clauses abolishing the rights into the deregulation bill when it continues its passage through parliament. Mr Brian Ormshaw, secretary of the association, said it was ready to rally cross-party support for its campaign in the autumn.

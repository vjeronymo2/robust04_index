			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Profits cheer - The week ahead Three of the UK's largest composite insurers are expected to report substantially increased profits in their interims next week. The results will be boosted primarily by recovery in UK underwriting, reflecting high premiums and stable claims. Analysts warned that the balance sheets may be weaker as a result of the turbulence in equity and bond investments. General Accident is set to announce its half-year results on Tuesday. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 177m-Pounds 200m are expected, against last time's Pounds 126m. The forecast dividend is in the range 10p to 10.25p, against 9.7p last time. Commercial Union is expected to unveil its results on Wednesday, although the timing may be changed or separated from details of the way in which the insurer is to pay for its purchase of Groupe Victoire, the French insurer, earlier this year. Analysts are predicting half-year profits of Pounds 168m-Pounds 180m, up from Pounds 66m. The dividend range is 10.1p to 10.25p, against 15.1p last time. Royal Insurance is due to report on Thursday, with forecast profits of Pounds 127m-Pounds 150m, with an average of Pounds 138m. This compares with just Pounds 52m last time. The predicted dividend range is 3p to 3.5p, rising after the company cut its dividends substantially two years ago. Interim results this week for the two marketing services giants, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and WPP, are expected to reflect the growing confidence in a gradual worldwide recovery in advertising expenditure. On Monday Saatchi is expected to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m-Pounds 13.5m, compared with Pounds 9.1m. WPP's interim results on Wednesday are likely to show pre-tax profits of between Pounds 36m and Pounds 37m, compared with Pounds 24.1m in 1993. British Airways is expected to report strong first-quarter pre-tax profits on Monday with estimates of the range of Pounds 85m-Pounds 95m. It reflects the airline's strong traffic growth in the first quarter which has continued into the start of the second. The resumption of dividend growth is expected at Barclays, when it announces its interim results on Tuesday. After it cut the full-year pay-out last year, analysts expect an increase in the interim to between 7.5p and 8p from last year's 6.5p. Bad debts will be down, leading to pre-tax profits forecast to rise to Pounds 670m-Pounds 770m from last year's Pounds 335m. GKN, the engineering, automotive components and defence equipment group, is expected to announce a sharp increase in first-half pre-tax profits on Wednesday. Underlying profits are likely to grow by at least 28 per cent to Pounds 77m (Pounds 60m), although some analysts say they could reach Pounds 95m. Interim figures for Shell Transport and Trading and Royal Dutch Shell are due on Thursday. Analysts say the presence of a number of exceptional items in the figures make it difficult to assess the underlying trend in profits. But most expect modest growth, with replacement cost profits of around Pounds 800m. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group at the centre of controversy about its Persil/Omo Power soap powder, is expected on Friday to announce a small decline in second-quarter pre-tax profits, from Pounds 590m to about Pounds 560m - although City forecasts range from Pounds 530m to Pounds 600m.</p>

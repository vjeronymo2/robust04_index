			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Paris tackles Gatt as urgent priority FRANCE's new government yesterday announced that a re-appraisal of the Gatt trade negotiations was its 'most urgent' economic priority, as its foreign minister crossed swords with his UK counterpart on the issue. At his first formal cabinet meeting, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, asked his trade and farm ministers to draw up proposals to reflect the new conservative government's unhappiness with the course which the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks have taken recently. On Tuesday Mr Balladur will receive leaders of France's farmers, who are against November's draft EC-US farm accord, as well as leaders of fishermen who have separate grievances with Brussels about cheap fish imports. After an otherwise harmonious meeting in Paris with Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, said France wanted 'the time to put the international trade dossier on a new footing'. Recalling the previous French government's position, Mr Juppe complained of lack of balance, in the November transatlantic farm deal and in the Gatt negotiations, between concessions in agriculture and non-farm aspects of trade. Mr Hurd said it was 'perfectly natural' the new French government 'should need a certain time to establish its position'. But he stressed Britain's view that last November's farm deal, reducing the EC's subsidised farm exports and oilseed output, was balanced. 'We don't want to see it unpicked on this side of the Atlantic, because there are plenty of people on the other side of the Atlantic who want to unpick it,' Mr Hurd said. Mr Philippe Seguin, the conservative politician who led the 'No' campaign in last autumn's Maastricht referendum, has been appointed president of the National Assembly. The appointment places Mr Seguin, 49, who was minister of social affairs in a past conservative administration, in a powerful position. Mr Seguin, together with Mr Charles Pasqua, now interior minister, have lobbied forcefully within the Gaullist RPR against France's monetary links with Germany and the franc fort policy of maintaining a strong currency.</p>

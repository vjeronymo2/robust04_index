			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Italian grain 'king' arrested Mr Franco Ambrosio, the largest private grain trader in Italy, was arrested yesterday in Naples on charges of being involved in illicit financing of political parties. The charge related to a L7.5bn (Pounds 3m) payment made in 1990 by the late Pietro Barilla, then a leading industrialist, which Mr Ambrosio is alleged to have deposited in a Swiss bank account on behalf of the Socialist party. The arrest was ordered by Milan magistrates as part of their investigations into the secret use of accounts at the Clariden Bank, Geneva, by the Socialist party, then headed by Mr Bettino Craxi. Mr Ambrosio, dubbed 'the king of grain', has his trading base in Naples and he is the biggest business figure in southern Italy. He has already been arrested once in the past year on charges of alleged corruption, but this related to investigations by Naples magistrates.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY OKS REMOVAL OF GRASS, BENCHES AT HORTON PLAZA  </P> <P> Weighing safety concerns against aesthetics, the San Diego City Council voted  Monday to temporarily remove the benches and grass from Horton Plaza Park in an  effort to rid the small, historic gathering spot of drunks and rowdies.  </P> <P> The plan, approved unanimously, was an amended version of an earlier proposal  under which downtown businesses will pay to replace the grass with  drought-resistant flowers and to remove the benches that line three sides of  the park to deprive undesirables of places to sit.  </P> <P> Under a Central City Assn. plan endorsed by the council last summer, the  benches were to be returned within six months, but the grass was not to be  restored unless the landscaping changes were unsuccessful in improving the  park's atmosphere.  </P> <P> However, under the plan passed Monday, the grass, too, will be restored, even  if the landscaping modifications -- expected to be completed within three  months -- prove successful in discouraging loitering in the park.  </P> <P> Area businesses have long complained that the park, on Broadway between 3rd and  4th avenues, has become a haven for drunks and criminals whose drug dealing,  panhandling and general unsavory demeanor scare away citizens.  </P> <P> "This insures . . . that an important part of downtown will be available to  more and more people," said Councilman Bob Filner, whose district includes  downtown.  </P> <P> Under the park redesign, a kiosk where food will be sold will open, other  vendors will sell merchandise from pushcarts, and the park increasingly will be  used for musical performances, art shows, book sales and organized luncheons  intended to attract more pedestrians.  </P></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Newspaper publisher gains 49% to NZDollars 23.4m INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the New Zealand publishing company 49 per cent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has lifted its operating profit after tax by 43 per cent in the six months ended December 31, agencies report from Wellington. Net profit after tax for the period amounted to NZDollars 23.4m (USDollars 12.1m) or 20.6 cents a share, against NZDollars 16.3m or 14.4 cents in the first half of 1991. Sales improved by 4.8 per cent, to NZDollars 494.1m from NZDollars 471.4m. Pre-tax profit amounted to NZDollars 40.53m against NZDollars 28.54m previously. The group said that it was poised to meet or exceed its full-year profit targets but it did not specify what those targets were. INL increased its interim dividend to 8 cents a share from last year's 7 cents. 'There have been demonstrable signs of a recovery in confidence in New Zealand with a pronounced improvement in advertising demand across all areas,' INL said. But it added that the same confidence in recovery could not be found in Australia or parts of the US. Operating profits had risen but had come from a very low base. Gains had come from cost efficiencies through technology rather than from significant growth in revenue.</p>

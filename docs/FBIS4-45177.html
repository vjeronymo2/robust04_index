			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The internal disturbance decree that recently  prevented a mass release of prison inmates today was placed in a  precarious position. The "National Newscast" has learned that  this afternoon, the prosecutor will tell the Constitutional  Court that the decree is unconstitutional. This will be  announced in the next few hours.    Over the past two years, the government has issued internal  disturbance decrees eight times. The most recent implementation  of this measure was to prevent a mass exodus of inmates from  Colombian jails.    The arguments the prosecutor could wield to call for a  ruling  that such decrees are unconstitutional are as follow:    1. He says that eight internal disturbance decrees have been  used to undermine the rights of due process of many inmates who,  because of the expiration of deadlines, should have been  released from prison a long time ago, as stipulated by the Penal  Procedures Code.    2. He criticizes the state for being unable to conduct  investigations on people facing drug-trafficking and terrorism  charges in an efficient and timely manner.    The court has already rejected a request from the prosecutor  that it delay its ruling on the most recent internal disturbance  decrees. The official ruling will be handed down in 20 days.</p>

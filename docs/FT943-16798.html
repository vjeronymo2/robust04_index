			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Special tax rate would allow low paid to receive benefits Sir, Your leader 'Work and Benefits' (June 27) states that 'the benefits system needs to be radically shaken up to support people through partial employment and low paid work as well as during unemployment'. It is difficult to see the slightest possibility of change from the current process of shaking down the benefit system. The only potentially helpful change that is offered by any political party is fuzzy commitment to a meagre element of universality, and anything more adventurous would attract widespread derision. It may be more sensible to leave the benefit system doing the job for which it is now designed, that of alleviating the most dire misery, and to concentrate attention on direct taxation, real and nominal. It may be possible to support people through partial employment and low paid work by allowing them to pay, say, 50 per cent tax on any income earned, in return for that income being ignored for benefit purposes. Such taxation is easy to administer, directly addresses the problem by providing marginal labour market forces and, above all, is politically acceptable. R A Ledingham, Rose View, Hethe, Oxon OX6 9HD</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 TOP CEAUSESCU AIDES ADMIT COMPLICITY IN GENOCIDE;  </P> <P> ROMANIA: THEY ARE THE FIRST SENIOR OFFICIALS OF REGIME TO GO ON TRIAL BEFORE A  MILITARY COURT. THE FOUR ARE SAID TO HAVE CONFESSED TO ALL CHARGES.  </P> <P> Four top aides of former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu have confessed  they are guilty of complicity to commit genocide, a lawyer told a military  court Saturday.  </P> <P> Former Deputy Prime Minister Ion Dinca, former Interior Minister Tudor  Postelnicu, Communist Party organizational chief Emil Bobu and former Vice  President Manea Manescu are the first senior Ceausescu regime officials to go  on trial.  </P> <P> A lawyer who read out the charges to the court said the four had confessed to  all charges, but they did not formally enter a plea in court.  </P> <P> The trial was adjourned after a three-hour opening session.  </P> <P> During the hearing, Dinca told the court that he was a coward not to have  opposed Ceausescu's orders to shoot protesters in the Transylvanian city of  Timisoara.  </P> <P> The killings in Timisoara sparked the revolution that toppled Ceausescu on Dec.  22. He and his powerful wife, Elena, were executed on Dec. 25.  </P> <P> The presiding judge said it had been confirmed that 689 people were killed and  1,200 wounded in last month's uprising against Ceausescu, figures far lower  than initial estimates.  </P> <P> Dinca, 61, responded confidently and promptly to the questions of the five  uniformed military judges.  </P> <P> Questioned by a defense lawyer, he said: "If I did not agree (with Ceausescu's  orders) I would not have lasted for a single minute."  </P> <P> He said that shortly before Ceausescu fled Bucharest in a helicopter as  protesters cried for his blood, the dictator called a last meeting of the  ruling Politburo to discuss how to restore order.  </P> <P> "He asked each of us if we would fight for the revolution, and we each said  yes," Dinca told the trial, which is being televised live.  </P> <P> Dinca said Ceausescu had called for Postelnicu to be shot for not putting down  the protests in Timisoara with enough force.  </P> <P> After being questioned, Dinca signed a document saying the court record of his  remarks was accurate.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Bucharest, Romania's embattled provisional government held crisis  talks with three main opposition parties in the face of mounting public  discontent, party sources said.  </P> <P> The ruling National Salvation Front demanded the meeting hours after Vice  President Dumitru Mazilu resigned, accusing the front of using Stalinist  methods.  </P> <P> "An aide of President Ion Iliescu called during the night to invite us," one  opposition party source said, adding that no reason was given.  </P> <P> Leaders of the National Peasants Party, the National Liberal Party and the  Social Democratic Party attended the talks in the Popular Front's heavily  guarded headquarters in the Foreign Ministry.  </P> <P> The three old parties, banned at the start of Communist rule in 1947, accuse  the leaders of the five-week-old Popular Front of being closet Communists.  </P> <P> The parties formed a loose opposition coalition this week after the Popular  Front sparked street protests when it said in an abrupt about-face that it  would run candidates in elections set for May 20.  </P> <P> When the Popular Front took power after Ceausescu was toppled, leaders pledged  to disband the movement after guiding Romania to democratic government.  </P> <P> Opposition parties want elections to be postponed and a broad-based transition  government, including Popular Front supporters, to be formed.  </P> <P> "May 20 is too soon for elections. We need more time to organize and are  seeking a postponement until August or September," Peasants Party spokesman  Valentin Gabrielescu said.  </P> <P> "Our intention is to have a neutral government immediately. This is a Communist  government," he said.  </P> <P> The three parties have called for a mass anti-Popular Front demonstration today  outside the Foreign Ministry.  </P></p>

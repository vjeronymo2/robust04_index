			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: A wine drinker's guide to the currency markets - Jancis Robinson tries to make the best of the exchange rate debacle JASPER MORRIS, of fine wine importers Morris &amp; Verdin, is one of the more exasperatingly cheerful members of the London wine trade. In the past few weeks however, even he has been sounding as though someone forgot to wind him up. He is currently paying for rather a lot of 1990 burgundy priced when the pound was worth nearly FFr10 and has also had to issue a new wholesale list which will earn him neither friends nor profit. In Colchester meanwhile, Lay &amp; Wheeler's man about France has been spending his days chez the local printer, painstakingly adjusting columns of prices on his firm's new list. Wine merchants are in the front line of the exchange rate debacle. What they sell is almost 100 per cent imported, notably from France and Germany, countries with expensive currencies nowadays. Here are some of the likely and possible effects, with some suggestions as to how to make the most of this miserable situation. French and German wines bought recently are the worst affected, which effectively means the younger, less expensive bottles on sale in November and December (although champagne will not look any cheaper). That said, the 1992 vintage in France and Germany is plentiful, if not invariably superlative, so this should ease cellar door prices soon and smooth out some of the currency-related increases. Don't worry, folks, we can still give you your Pounds 1.99 Liebfraumilch] Most major retailers are hanging back before issuing their all-important Christmas prices. The supermarkets may decide that wine profits are worth sacrificing in order to lure customers away from the specialist wine shops whose pips are squeaking most plaintively. This is a great time to buy fine wine (and fine art, antiques, houses . . . and anything else you cannot afford). Most fine wine was imported long ago and is now a sterling commodity. Good guys like Jasper Morris are even responding to the almost negligible movement in the fine wine market by reducing prices at this top end. The good news is that wines from Italy, Spain and Portugal should not cost any more (there are healthy signs of a return to sanity in even the most image-conscious Italian producers). This could be just the fillip that the English wine industry desperately needs. Look for any wine made by the skilled Australian winemaker at the Harvest Wine Consultancy near Reading (0734- 340176). They include Thames Valley, Boze Down, East Mersea, Moorlynch, Pilton Manor, Sharpham and Wickham - so far. They may taste more New World than English, but that may be no bad thing. (Waitrose, Safeway and the Co-op are trying particularly hard with English wines.) And New World wines themselves should not suffer too many price rises. The British love affair with all things vinous and Australian looks set to continue (see accompanying box).</p>

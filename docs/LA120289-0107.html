			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> POP BEAT: REACTIONS MIXED OVER MCCARTNEY'S TALK OF BEATLES REUNION  </P> <P> Paul, George and Ringo together again?  </P> <P> Paul says he'd love to.  </P> <P> George says no thank you.  </P> <P> Ringo says no comment.  </P> <P> If the three surviving members of rock's most celebrated group disagree over a  possible reunion project, fans too seemed to have mixed feelings.  </P> <P> The prospect of some kind of Beatles reunion has come up frequently since the  group dissolved two decades ago, but all four principals always rejected it.  John Lennon's death in 1980 brought renewed calls for the surviving three to  get together, but various legal and personal differences have kept them apart.  </P> <P> But with the lawsuits all settled recently, McCartney said at a Monday press  conference in Los Angeles that he would be interested in finally teaming up  again with his ex-mates. And once again, the fans are intrigued. The general  feeling: a mix of nostalgic elation, but doubts about whether the "magic" would  still be there and whether it would be proper to proceed without Lennon.  </P> <P> At Pepperland Records in Anaheim, a store that highlights Beatles music and  memorabilia, the potential re-teaming has been a hot topic all week.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of talk," said store owner Mike Lefebvre. "In the concerts, Paul  is coming across very warm and that makes a lot of customers come in here  thinking he's a loving guy and would be happy to have the others on stage with  him."  </P> <P> Many of Pepperland's patrons were caught up in rumors that a reunion would take  place at Wednesday's closing night of McCartney's five-concert engagement at  the Forum. (It didn't, although both Ringo Starr and George Harrison were in  town.)  </P> <P> But Lefebvre and other Beatles enthusiasts seem torn about the prospect,  generally agreeing with Harrison's terse response to McCartney's comments: "As  far as I'm concerned," Harrison said in a statement Tuesday, "there will be no  Beatles reunion so long as John Lennon remains dead."  </P> <P> Said Lefebvre: "My opinion is they fear that if they got back together there  wouldn't be the magic any more. They're probably right. They would put out good  music, but not as good. We all have a, well, morbid curiosity, but there's a  part of me that says, 'Why bother?' "  </P> <P> Among fans surveyed in the Forum parking lot before and after Monday's  McCartney concert, Mary Zekin's reaction was typical. The 14-year-old, who had  come to Los Angeles from San Diego with her 19-year-old sister to see  McCartney's concert at the Forum, was visibly elated, her eyes growing big in  anticipation.  </P> <P> "I think it would be the best thing in the world," she said in a burst of  excitement.  </P> <P> Her sister, Laura, concurred, stating that though Paul, George and Ringo  couldn't be expected to recreate the old Beatles magic, "It would be a new kind  of magic."  </P> <P> But then, the initial adrenaline rush over, the Zekins nodded in agreement as  George Emmel, a first-generation Beatles fan at 40, spoke with the dampening  voice of reason.  </P> <P> "There would always be something missing," he said.  </P> <P> "We were anticipating something like that (comment by McCartney)," said Lonnie  Pena, 31, who had traveled with two friends from Houston to see the show. "But  there's no Lennon, so I'm not going to have high expectations."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, it became clear that even if Beatles fans aren't looking for a  true reunion, they want something.  </P> <P> "It would never be the Beatles again, even if John was alive," said Allen  Weiner, a Potomac, Md.-based writer and author of the 1986 book, "The Beatles:  A Recording History."  </P> <P> But Weiner has some ideas for a second-best situation.  </P> <P> "My first choice would be to get them back in the studio to do new things,"  Weiner said. "Paul and George writing together would be a neat idea. It would  be a pressure-free situation, hopefully."  </P> <P> A different fantasy is held by Pepperland's Mike Lefebvre.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't like to see any songwriting type of thing," Lefebvre said. "I'd  like to see them get together with other musicians like at some benefit and not  just be the three of them. If they did get together, I wouldn't want it to be a  Monkees-type reunion."  </P> <P> That attitude suits some in the Beatles camp just fine. Elliot Mintz, longtime  confidant of Lennon and Yoko Ono's spokesman, suggested that McCartney's  announcement may have been made to draw attention to the press conference,  which was called to announce a tour sponsorship deal with Visa.  </P> <P> "If Ringo or George elected to take him up on the invitation, that's  wonderful," said Mintz, producer and host of the ongoing "Lost Lennon Tapes"  radio series, heard here Wednesdays at 11 p.m. on KLSX-FM. "But to me the whole  thing seemed a little hollow. I think perhaps the invitation was extended a  little too late."  </P> <P> Speaking as a fan, Mintz was dubious about the aesthetic prospects of any kind  of reunion. "The Beatles represented more than a musical group," he said. "They  represent a time in history, a time in our development as a culture and a  generation. It seems unlikely that those experiences and sensibilities can ever  be reclaimed, and I think that any effort to do so might somehow rob us of the  experience we once shared and revere."  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Stevie Wonder will top a benefit concert to help educate  inner-city youth at the Forum on Jan. 6.

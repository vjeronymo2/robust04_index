			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining ministers come under attack - Canadian report confirms increased investment abroad at expense of home budgets Canada's mining industry will be giving federal and provincial mines ministers a hard time when the ministers hold their annual meeting in the Yukon this month. Top of the agenda will be a report on the investment climate in Canada by a government-industry task force. The report, not yet made public, will confirm that Canadian mining companies are cutting exploration budgets at home while increasing investment elsewhere. 'It's not that the bottom is falling out, but there's a drift away from Canada's attractiveness,' says Mr George Miller, president of the Canadian Mining Association in Ottawa. Others are more forthright. Mr Jim O'Rourke, president of Princeton Mining of Vancouver and chairman of the British Columbia Mining Association, complained in a recent speech that 'the resource industries of the province have been milked and drained to support costly government programmes and a standard of living which makes our operations uncompetitive in international markets.' Evidence of mining companies' unhappiness with the business climate in Canada is not hard to find. Falconbridge, the big nickel producer, has closed its exploration office in Vancouver and moved five employees and their families to Santiago, Chile. A growing number of junior mining companies listed on the Vancouver stock exchange have their operations outside Canada. About 40 Canadian mining companies are now active in Chile, helping to make Canada the biggest foreign investor there in 1991. Others have gone to the US, Mexico, Australia, Indonesia and elsewhere. 'The exodus is now in full swing,' said Mr Robert Holbauer, Cominco's president, in a speech earlier this year. The discontent is greatest in Ontario and British Columbia, which are both ruled by interventionist, social-democratic governments. By contrast, Mr Claude Drouin, general manager of the Quebec Mining Association, says companies in the francophone province have a 'fairly good relationship' with the government. Manitoba recently unveiled incentives, including cash grants, to encourage exploration. The list of complaints is long, but can be grouped into three main categories: high taxes, lengthy delays in getting projects off the ground, and increasingly rigorous environmental assessments. The tax burden on mining companies in Canada is among the highest in the world. But the industry is especially critical of a lengthening list of government levies which bear no relation to profits. These include licensing fees, fuel taxes and the spiralling cost of funding workers' compensation claims. The Ontario Mining Association estimates that its members are exposed to a CDollars 1bn unfunded liability in the province's workers' compensation fund. Muncipalities in the province went a step further recently by suggesting that they be allowed to levy property taxes on underground facilities as if they were on the surface. Sandy Laird, senior vice-president of Placer Dome, the Vancouver-based gold producer, said earlier this year that 'the probability is that future changes will increase, not decrease, the tax burden for the mining industry. From the point of view of tax, British Columbia must be counted as a high-risk region.' The industry also frets about long delays in the approval process for new mines without any assurance that, in the end, the projects will be allowed to go ahead. Mr O'Rourke gives the example of a relatively small garnet quarry in British Columbia, where the provincial government has insisted on a study on markets and competitors before it allows construction to proceed. Placer Dome estimates that the project-approval process lasts an average of more than two years in BC compared to about a year in Nevada and Papua New Guinea, six months in Australia and virtually no delay at all in Chile. 'The stonewalling is the worst of it,' says a Falconbridge official. Besides the usual criticism about bureaucratic inefficiency, applications for mining rights are invariably bogged down by environmental concerns and by disputed aboriginal land claims. 'We're not against the environment,' says Mr Drouin in Quebec, 'but it's difficult to break a rock without creating dust and making a noise.'' The most bitter battle is taking place over the Windy Craggy property, located amid the spectacular mountains of northwest BC Geddes Resources of Toronto has spent some CDollars 50m evaluating what appears to be Canada's biggest copper and cobalt deposit. But the provincial parks service and environmental groups throughout North America are pushing hard to kill the project before a mine is built. Mining executives acknowledge that their complaints might be less strident if commodity prices - and therefore profits - were higher, or share prices stronger. According to a Price Waterhouse study, mines in British Columbia, lost CDollars 1.04bn in 1990 and another CDollars 485m last year. But the companies also say some concerns have little to do with the business cycle. Mr Holbauer said in his last annual report that other countries were seeking to attract mining investment through changes to ownership laws, lower tax rates and minimising red tape.</p>

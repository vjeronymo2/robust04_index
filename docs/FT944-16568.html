			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Dentists bare their teeth in funding row Germany's dentists yesterday threatened to stop treating routine cases in a row over funding. The KZBV, an organisation which represents two-thirds of Germany's 70,000 dentists, said its members would only handle emergencies because they had treated more patients than expected this year and would probably exceed their DM10.5bn budget for 1994. There have been only three cases where patients have been turned away but the news still made headlines in most newspapers, days before the Germans elect a new government. However, whatever political capital the dentists were hoping to make may have misfired. Politicians of all persuasions lambasted them for insensitivity. 'The dentists seem to think that the last week before the election is a good point to try and blackmail politicians,' said Ms Annelies Klug, the health ministry spokeswoman. 'It seems they have been rather mistaken.' The dentists' threats are another in a long line of outbursts from various medical lobbies beginning to feel the pinch of the German health reforms. The system has become world famous for its generosity. Everyone who is insured is, for instance, entitled to a spa trip, almost free of charge, once every three years. But the system also caters for more far-fetched wishes. There is even provision for women who find their chest size disturbs them. If they can produce a letter from a psychologist which provides evidence of psychological distress due to breast size then whatever treatment is necessary can be charged to the Krankenkassen, or health insurance funds. 'People have ideas in this country about what they are entitled to which are simply too grandiose,' said Dr Jurgen Simonsmeier, a dentist at the Medeco clinic in Bonn. 'They've simply been incorrectly educated.' Now, as the country pulls out of its worst post-war recession there is a growing realisation that health insurance on this scale can no longer be financed. The dental budget was one of the first symptoms of this new thinking, introduced for the first time last year when it became clear that the system was heading for a DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) deficit, according to Ms Klug. However, many dentists warned yesterday they would be unable to work with budgets in the long run and that patients would simply have to pay for anything on top of the most basic treatment. 'The all-or-nothing principle on which health insurance is based in this country is going to have to be reviewed,' said a KZBV spokesman.</p>

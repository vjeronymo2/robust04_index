			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Insurers' association to face calls for shake-up THE leaders of the Association of British Insurers will face calls from some of its members for a shake-up of the trade organisation at its first extraordinary meeting today. The move is primarily the result of widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of the association, which represents life and general insurance companies, in the face of fierce public criticism of the life assurance industry. The Building Societies Association is seen as a more effective lobby group. 'The building societies have a much better image than they deserve,' a leading insurance industry executive said. 'The insurance industry deserves a much better image than it gets. We need to combat the impression of the public that the industry is incompetent and that the public is paying for its mistakes by charging more.' The most important demands are for a change of management at the top of the association. The new board would function more as a board of management - meeting more frequently and playing a more hands-on role. The association has a budget of more than Pounds 19m and over 180 staff, many devoted full-time to public relations. Critics say the association has failed to respond adequately to criticism from regulators and consumer groups about the products it sells and the way it sells them. They argue that the association has fallen short in its efforts to present a positive image of insurance to the public. 'When the question of members' contributions came up, people began to ask what they were getting for their money,' said a life company chairman. Pressure for the meeting has been engineered largely by nine leading life insurers which last year formed a pressure group to respond to the increasing complaints against business practices. The nine - Commercial Union, Eagle Star, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange, Legal and General, Norwich Union, Prudential, Royal Life and Sun Alliance - founded the 'Watford Group'. Between them they control about 30 per cent of the life assurance market. Life assurance members feel the association has responded badly to a study by the Securities and Investments Board showing that a quarter to a third of all insurance and personal pensions policies were cancelled within the first two years. The association's response had been to question the validity of the data, even though many in the industry privately acknowledged that they were correct. 'In particular, it was the way that the ABI responded to the Securities and Investments Board's proposals on disclosure,' said a senior official at one life company. The association, he said, had failed to appreciate the public-relations storm that would ensue from opposing what in the public's mind is an issue that cannot be opposed - disclosure of fees and charges. The association executive says it is unaware of any general dissatisfaction. However, an official conceded: 'In certain circumstances the decision-making process is cumbersome.' He acknowledged members' desire to rein in costs. Members blame the association's failure to promote their cause on an archaic 'committee' system under which an individual's seniority rather than the employer's market share determines chairmanships and eventual appointment to the association's board. Today's meeting will hear a proposal to drop the seniority requirement for committee chairmen. The qualification for committee chairmanship is nine to 10 years of committee membership. Heads of big insurance companies are unable to devote so many years to the association. As a result, those with the largest market share have the least say in how the association is run. At today's meeting, members will be asked to approve a new board of 10 to 16 members, instead of the present 14. However, it is expected that the board will be at the low end of the range. While the chairman and deputy chairman will continue to hold their seats, new members, including Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential chief executive, will be elected. There is also dissatisfaction on the general insurance front. An executive with one of the leading composite insurers, which underwrite general as well as life insurance, said: 'We are determined to do something about it. There is real dissatisfaction among the major companies. They have been footing the bill and they don't think they have been getting the service that they should.'</p>

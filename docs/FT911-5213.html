			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Malaysia clash with Australia over tariffs MALAYSIA has criticised Australia for blocking the entry of Malaysian-made car batteries. Ms Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, said the high duties imposed on the batteries, supposedly on anti-dumping grounds, were arbitrary and amounted to a trade barrier. She said Malaysia would take up the issue under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Australian government recently announced that tariffs on cars, for instance, were to be reduced from 35 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent by 2000. But Mr Bob Hawke, the Australian prime minister, also warned foreign producers he would take tougher anti-dumping measures and agreed to phase out preferential trading arrangements with countries like Singapore and Taiwan. Malaysia's prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, has high hopes of building up the motor industry. By promoting an extensive motor parts manufacturing network through incentives such as tax holidays, and by raising local content in cars to between 60 and 80 per cent, Malaysia hopes to be a significant exporter by 1993. The Malaysian complaint over the batteries adds to a growing list of disputes which led to the suspension of senior level official contacts since early this year.</p>

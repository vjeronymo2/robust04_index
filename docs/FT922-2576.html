			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Stock market looks at plans for new capital THE Stock Exchange is considering plans to raise new capital, probably from continental European brokers and investors, it said yesterday. Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive, said that the exchange wanted to spread the costs of financing the development of new technology more widely. The brokers and marketmakers who own the exchange are under financial pressure and are finding it difficult to pass on the costs of the exchange to their customers. Also, Mr Rawlins said, they are concerned that they are being forced to pay for developments which one day will benefit other users of the market. In the past year the exchange has spent Pounds 25m on Taurus, its long-delayed settlement system, bringing total spending so far to nearly Pounds 50m. It also plans an overhaul of the systems that support trading. The Stock Exchange said it had yet to develop any firm proposals on how it could raise more capital. However, it seems unlikely that it would attempt to sell shares to investors with no direct interest in the exchange. With its declared aim of remaining a non-profit institution, it cannot pay a market rate of return. One exchange executive said: 'The scope for profit-making is not great in the UK market. There are so many legal and regulatory matters that would get in the way.' The alternative would be to tempt securities brokers and others on the Continent to join the exchange. However, since it operates an electronic market, the exchange cannot sell seats to brokers to raise cash. The exchange's operating costs fell from Pounds 182m to Pounds 171m during the year, largely as a result of staff reductions. Its income climbed by Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 194m, reflecting increases in settlement income as trading volumes climbed. After a review of its properties, the exchange lowered the valuation of for its headquarters building in the City by Pounds 20m to Pounds 90m. Observer Page 21 Lex, Page 22</p>

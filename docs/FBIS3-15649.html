			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What Provokes Destabilization?"] </F>   [Text] "The new Defense Ministry leadership is hampering  the establishment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces." These words  begin a statement sent to our paper by the Union of Officers of  Ukraine [SOU], which has been signed by SOU Chairman Major  General Oleksandr Rol. The statement points out that although  concerns over strengthening the defense system of our country  are voiced in the media, they are not followed up with practical  activities. Offshoots of democratic and national traditions are  being squandered; the Ukrainian language is being introduced in  the Army very slowly. Again, as it was in the former Soviet  Army, "officers' meetings" are being reintroduced, which have  always served for the reactionary army leadership as an element  of pressuring its subordinates.    Responsible military leaders want to drag the Ukrainian  Armed  Forces into the CIS Joint Forces. Dismissals of servicemen who  refuse to serve Ukraine and want to go abroad are being stalled.  The implementation of a program for national, military-patriotic  education of servicemen and youth is being delayed. The SOU,  reads the statement, is against the unilateral nuclear  disarmament of Ukraine, the transfer of Black Sea Fleet vessels  to Russia, the lease of the city of Sevastopol and its onshore  infrastructure, and deployment of foreign troops on our  country's territory. The SOU considers prolonged delays in  payments to contract servicemen and the failure to provide  housing for them, which deteriorates their living conditions, as  a dangerous action which provokes destabilization in certain  military units and generates an unwillingness to serve in the  Ukrainian Armed Forces.    The statement concludes with an appeal to the Ukrainian  president to immediately resolve the social and legal problems  of servicemen, which are destabilizing the situation in the  Armed forces, and which are a consequence of pressure on our  state and its internal affairs.</p>

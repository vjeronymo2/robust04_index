			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Black Sea nations see the trade tide turning - The region is witnessing big changes The collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the Caspian Sea region as one of the most promising oil and gas suppliers in the early 21st century have profoundly altered the strategic importance and trading potential of the Black Sea and the newly independent states that surround it. This week in the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Varna, energy officials from the 11 member countries of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation group held their first working meeting. On the agenda was setting up a regional energy centre, to be based in Sofia, to co-ordinate joint projects. Mr Charalambos Tsardanidis, director of the Institute of International Relations in Athens, told a recent meeting of Balkan and Black Sea experts in Sofia that 'the energy sector is one of the priorities for Black Sea co-operation, and joint ventures in oil and gas will bring closer links between our region and the European Union'. Turning the rhetoric into reality will require considerable political skill, however. The region is fraught with ancient rivalries, such as that between Greece and Turkey or those that have led to conflict between ethnic Armenians and Azeris for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. This and other regional conflicts in Chechnya, Abkhazia, Georgia and elsewhere have allowed Russia to reimpose itself as the regional power in the Caucasus through 'peace-keeping operations' which many suspect are a way to reassert control over energy exports from the region. Moscow's response to the loss of empire is leading to a partial restoration of its former dominance of the Black Sea. Independence gave Ukraine control over Odessa and 14 other smaller ports, while the collapse of the Warsaw Pact ended Soviet influence over Bulgarian and Romanian ports such as Constanta with its upstream links to central Europe via the Danube. The collapse of the Soviet empire left Russia with Novorossiysk as its only Black Sea port of any consequence. Now this port city, which lies at the end of a Soviet-era pipeline bringing oil for export from the Urals and Caspian Sea region, is rapidly becoming the key to developments in the region. Novorossiysk's new-found strategic importance has spawned ambitious development plans for new pipelines, higher cargo capacity and improved oil storage and other port facilities. The aim is to make it the principal export harbour for the sharply higher oil and gas volumes expected to start flowing early in the next century. For this to happen, however, the international oil and gas companies still have to reach agreement on both the exploitation and transport of the vast reserves known to exist under the Caspian Sea, in Kazakhstan and elsewhere in central Asia. Until now most Russian export oil has been shipped in huge tankers through the Bosporus. But a series of accidents and growing ecological concerns led Turkey in July to restrict tanker traffic along the busy and vulnerable waterway. Reluctant to lose out from the expected growth of oil traffic, however, Ankara is busy promoting a new oil pipeline to connect the Black Sea with the eastern Mediterranean. But Russia has already made its own preferences clear by signing letters of intent earlier this month with Greece and Bulgaria for the construction of a 350km pipeline costing Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m and capable of transporting more than 40m tons of oil from the Bulgarian port of Burgas to Alexandroupolis, a Greek port on the Aegean. This week Greek and Bulgarian businessmen discussed plans for a new motorway from Alexandroupolis through Varna to Romania, Ukraine and Russia. The outgoing Bulgarian government also approved a Russian-Bulgarian joint venture project to build a transit gas pipeline which could deliver more than 20bn cu metres of gas annually to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and on to western Europe. Under the transit gas agreement, Russia's Gazprom would take a 50 per cent stake alongside a group of Bulgarian state-owned companies. Under Russian pressure the Bulgarian side will put into the joint venture an existing pipeline network built under earlier agreements with the former Soviet Union. This has been criticised for making Bulgaria dependent on a single gas supplier. Domestic critics have also attacked the outgoing government's decision to allow full tax relief on the proposed joint venture company, which is subject to approval by the new parliament after the December 18 elections. Meanwhile, Russia's choice of fellow-Slav Bulgaria as its main partner for future energy and other co-operation is underpinning ambitious plans for port developments at both Varna and Burgas. Mr Dimitar Alexiev, the captain of Burgas port, has drawn up a Dollars 250m development plan with technical assistance from Barcelona and Hamburg. It calls for a four stage expansion and modernisation of its container, roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro) facilities, bigger coal and ore terminals and expansion of the oil terminals which at present can only accommodate 80,000dwt tankers, compared with 250,000dwt at its arch-rival Constanta. The shift in Bulgarian trade away from 80 per cent dependence on the Soviet and Comecon markets five years ago to more than 50 per cent trade with OECD markets this year has already brought newcomers such as South African ore carriers and American coal ships to the harbour. Bulgarian ports also now handle the bulk of trade with Macedonia following the Greek blockade of the landlocked republic. The re-emergence of the Black Sea as an important link in growing trade between Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East is particularly important for Bulgaria and is not confined to future energy trade or links with the former Soviet states. Earlier this year Iran signed a protocol to ship 3.5m tons of cargo a year through the expanded ro-ro facilities planned for a new Burgas terminal. For political reasons Tehran is determined to avoid dependence on Turkey and plans to import 6m-7m tons annually through Burgas and other Black Sea ports by the end of the century. The plan is to ship cargo from Europe and elsewhere across the Black Sea to Poti and then truck it through Georgia and Azerbaijan. Rover, the UK-based subsidiary of the German BMW group, has been among the first western companies to spot the potential for manufacturing in the region. Last month it decided to set up a car plant at a dockside site near Varna that will import knocked down components by ship from the UK and export assembled cars to markets around the Black Sea rim.</p>

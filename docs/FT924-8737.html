			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Political council for Bahrain BAHRAIN is set to become the latest Gulf state to announce fresh moves towards wider political participation by unveiling details of a 30-seat consultative council next month. Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, Bahrain's emir, told the Saudi newspaper Asharq al-Awsat he was 'serious' about naming the council, which would be announced 'very soon.' Senior Bahraini officials said a decree establishing the council, all members of which will be appointed by the emir, would be issued in December. The council is expected to have a purely advisory role and diplomats said yesterday the state's rulers appeared to be moving with great caution in establishing the new body. It will be the first broadening of political participation in the Gulf state since the emir suspended Bahrain's first elected parliament just two years after its formation in 1973, claiming the body's internal arguments were obstructing government. Oman last year set up its first consultative council, while King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, recently named the speaker for a 60-member advisory body, appointments to which have still not been announced. Kuwait last month held its first general elections since 1985.</p>

			<p>Temperature-Difference   Battery Using Vitreous Carbon Material   <F P=102> 94FE0326H Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Dec 93 p  6 - - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0326H </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] The research group of Assistant Professor Hisatada  Hashimoto and Researcher Seiji Maeda at the Organic Material  Engineering Department of the Faculty of Engineering at Tokyo  Institute of Technology has developed a new  temperature-difference battery using a vitreous carbon material  for the electrodes. This battery is said to generate  electromotive force twice as strong as that generated by  existing temperature-difference batteries. The generation of  greater electromotive force is attributed to the greater  difference in the electrolytic reactions that is produced by  using a vitreous carbon material that can convert  temperature-difference energy into electric energy, instead of  platinum for the battery electrodes. This new battery is  expected to draw the attention of environmental fields, because  it can generate electric energy from warm industrial-waste water.    The temperature-difference battery generates electricity by  taking advantage of the difference in the degrees of ionization  of an electrolyte at two temperatures. Previous  temperature-difference batteries used platinum electrodes that  had a low capacity for converting the temperature difference  into electric energy. Also, some batteries used vitreous carbon  made from either a phenolic resin or cellulose for the  electrodes, which needed extra thickness to compensate for the  lack of strength. With thicker electrodes, the battery's  internal resistance increased to consume a part of the  electromotive force.    For the electrodes, Assistant Professor Hashimoto's group  used the vitreous carbon material it developed in-house. The  material is approximately 1.5 times stronger than the vitreous  carbon material made from cellulose. Moreover, the group added  boron onto the surface of the new vitreous carbon to obtain  higher voltage.    Actually, the new, 50-micron-thick, vitreous carbon film was  produced by adding boron to an organic compound called  polycarboxy-diimide and shaping the mixture into film form  before baking at 600C. The electrode is prepared by  vapor-depositing copper on one side of this film.    The new battery generated electromotive force of  approximately 3 millivolts per use, which was twice that of the  battery with platinum electrodes. The current from this battery  was 25 mA/m[.sup]2[/] at a temperature difference of  20C. In experiments, the group used an electrolyte that was  comparatively poor in electric conductivity in order to confirm  the performance of the electrode. However, the group believes  that industrial applications of this battery are feasible if  larger electrodes and a more conductive electrolyte are used.</p>

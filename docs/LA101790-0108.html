			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAMPING FOR THE VOTE;  </P> <P> RECORD INDUSTRY COALITION PUSHES REGISTRATION CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> Leave it to Madonna.  </P> <P> Who else could transform the simple act of voting into a provocative display of  sexual innuendo?  </P> <P> On Monday at 10 p.m., MTV will debut the pop siren's latest video clip: a  60-second, rap-oriented public service advertisement in which she encourages  her fans to express themselves at the voting booth:  </P> <P> Dr. King, Malcom X  </P> <P>  Freedom of speech  </P> <P>  Is as good as sex.  </P> <P>  Madonna delivers the rhyme wearing red bikini underwear with an American flag  curled around her shoulders. She ends the clip with the teasing quip, 'If you  don't vote, you're going to get a spankie."  </P> <P> Madonna's TV spot is the latest in a series of pro-voting ads designed to  motivate pop fans -- especially the 18-to-24 age group -- to become active in  the political process. Other pop artists who have made clips include Iggy Pop,  M.C. Hammer, Ozzy Osbourne, Mellow Man Ace, Megadeth, Donny Osmond, Lita Ford,  Lenny Kravitz, and Los Lobos' Louis Perez.  </P> <P> MTV will show all the spots in a half-hour "Rock the Vote" special beginning  after the Madonna ad.  </P> <P> The ads, which run about twice an hour on MTV, were commissioned by "Rock the  Vote," a nonprofit, nonpartisan recording industry coalition made up of some of  the most powerful figures in the music business -- including the presidents of  Warner Bros., Capitol, Geffen, MCA, A&amp;M, Virgin and Giant Records. The  voter registration campaign is the most ambitious step yet on the part of the  record industry to respond to the widening debate over explicit lyrics in pop  music. Concerned over recent court rulings deeming 2 Live Crew's rap music  obscene and the obscenity-related arrests of record retailers and pop music  artists throughout the country, music industry executives are on the offensive.  </P> <P> "What we are trying to do here is stimulate young rock fans to consider the  issues at hand and begin to participate in the democratic process," said Virgin  Records co-managing director Jeff Ayeroff.  </P> <P> "There is a new generation gap and government officials like (Sen.) Jesse Helms  (R-N.C.) are taking advantage of it. They assume that because young music  lovers rarely vote that they can trample on the rights of rock artists and not  worry about retaliation at the election booth. We aim to turn that around."  </P> <P> Ayeroff and Virgin co-managing director Jordan Harris unveiled the concept for  the voter registration drive at a July 11 meeting in Beverly Hills attended by  a cross-section of musicians, writers, directors, actors, executives and  entrepreneurs who have all cooperated in donating time and money to the  project.  </P> <P> Capitol Records president Hale Milgrim says "Rock the Vote" has united an  unlikely combination of corporate competitors.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to get different record companies to agree upon anything,"  Milgrim said this week. "But something as patriotic and positive as this  campaign, one that activates young people to get involved in government, is  certain to be applauded by every American, regardless of their political  persuasion."  </P> <P> Not everyone is clapping.  </P> <P> While national media watchdog groups such as the Focus on the Family of Pomona  and the Parents Music Resource Center of Washington have no problem with the  campaign, Sandy Crawford, editor of the Alexandria, Va., newsletter TV etc.,  questions the political strategy behind the "Rock the Vote" campaign.  </P> <P> TV etc., which analyzes political activities of the Hollywood entertainment  industry, is distributed by the Media Research Center, a watchdog group founded  by conservative activist L. Brent Bozell III.  </P> <P> "On the surface it looks real nice," Crawford said. "These (public service  announcements) sound like an innocuous invitation to register young people to  vote, but how can they can call it nonpartisan when the underlying goal of the  drive is to remove conservative government officials like Jesse Helms from  office?"  </P> <P> Ayeroff disputes Crawford's assessment, arguing that at least 30% of those  signing up to vote as a result of the campaign are registering as Republicans.  </P> <P> "This isn't a campaign about bashing conservatives," Ayeroff said. "It's about  preserving the piety of freedom of speech and dealing with the demagogues who  are trying to destroy it."  </P> <P> Setting their sights on the 1992 presidential election, "Rock the Vote"  officials have created a strategy to market their pro-voting, anti-censorship  theme on college campuses, concert tours and through promotional contests soon  to be initiated on radio, television and at record retail outlets such as Tower  and Wherehouse Records.  </P> <P> Voter registration booths were set up at "The Gathering of the Tribes" benefit,  the heavy-metal Foundations Forum convention and a recent California campus  concert tour that ended last week at UCLA, yielding more than 10,000 new  voters.  </P> <P> MTV vice president and creative director Judy McGrath maintains that her  network -- which debuted the public service campaign at the MTV Video Awards  Show on Sept. 6 -- has already donated more than $1 million in air time to the  project.  </P> <P> Additionally, a new collection of pro-voting clips featuring country artists  such as Randy Travis, Tammy Wynette, Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless and Brenda  Lee is also expected to begin airing on VH-1 within the next few weeks.  </P> <P> "This is a long-term project," said Geffen Records president Eddie Rosenblatt  by phone from New York. "Our commitment to 'Rock the Vote' will extend beyond  the upcoming November election. The goal is to alter the voter make-up of the  1992 election. Once young people are aware of what censorship means, we believe  that voter apathy will cease."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PHAROAH SANDERS  </P> <P> When tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders walked on stage for his first set at  Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, he was greeted by a front row of listeners containing  no fewer than five young men wearing ponytails and tie-dyes. The symbolism was  inescapable. Sixties revivalism has finally embraced the decade's most  clangorously radical new music.  </P> <P> How ironic, then, that Sanders' performance Tuesday night retained few of the  radically innovative qualities that marked him in the mid-'60s as one of John  Coltrane's most gifted legatees. The intervening years appear to have softened  Sanders' sound and his vision with somewhat ambivalent results.  </P> <P> His willingness, for example, to play a lovely ballad (on which he turned the  improvising over to bassist Jeff Lilton and pianist William Henderson), as well  as a jaunty West Indian piece and a straight-ahead blues, resulted in vigorous,  if not particularly startling, contemporary jazz.  </P> <P> But it remained for Sanders' occasional forays (usually undertaken at the close  of a piece) around the outer limits of his tenor saxophone's capabilities to  provide far too-brief reminders of the genuinely revolutionary qualities of his  earlier playing. During those moments, as well as during the improvisational  passages in which he responded and interacted with drummer Wayne Wright's  multilevel carpet of complex rhythms, Sanders came close to reviving the spirit  of the '60s.  </P> <P> More often, he stepped aside to allow his excellent rhythm section to dominate  the proceedings. Making the most of the opportunity, were bassist Lilton with  his feathery dynamics, drummer Wright and his articulate brush work and  Henderson whose dense piano chording was more than worth the price of  admission.  </P> <P> Still, it would have been nice to have heard a bit more from Sanders.  Revolutionary or not, he continues -- when he so chooses -- to be one of the  world-class players on his instrument.  </P> <P> The Sanders group will be at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill through Saturday night.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report from New York by Hayim Handwerker] </F>   [Excerpts] Israeli economic sources have expressed fear  that the United States is trying to surreptitiously alter the  spirit of the free trade agreement between the two countries by  changing the regulations pertaining to the country of origin.  [passage omitted]    According to the agreement between the United States and  Israel, any change in the free trade agreement requires prior  consultations and agreement. U.S. sources promised Israeli  representatives that Israel had no reason to be concerned.  Officials in Jerusalem nevertheless fear that certain Israeli  industries may be seriously affected by these changes. Israel  has still not studied the changes in the rule of origin  provisions; however, it seems that the Israeli textile industry,  for example, could be badly hurt by the anticipated tightening  of the rules.    Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Industry and Trade  Minister Mikha Harish have sent letters to Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen and U.S. Trade Commissioner Kantor expressing  concern about the recently proposed changes in the rules of  origin, designed to maintain harmonious trade relations between  the United States and the NAFTA countries and ease the load on  U.S. customs. As a result of these changes, Israeli companies  may be asked to pay customs on products previously exempt under  the free trade agreement.    The U.S. officials have not yet replied. The matter was also  raised in the talks between Shohat and U.S. Trade Secretary Ron  Brown in mid-January. [passage omitted]    Officials in Jerusalem are worried because the proposal  calls for comprehensive regulations stipulating, among other  things, that whenever there is a discrepancy between various  rules of origin and the NAFTA regulations, the latter will  prevail. NAFTA regulations on rules of origin are tougher than  those in the trade agreement with Israel. Officials in  Jerusalem fear that one day they will find themselves facing  faits accomplis.</p>

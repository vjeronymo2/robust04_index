			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Panamanian President Guillermo </F> Endara by Julio Miller, RPC general news director; place not  given; from the "RPC Television News" newscast--live]    [Text] [Miller] I am on the telephone with the president  of the Republic to get his reaction to the Arnulfist Party's  [PA] decision to stop negotiating with its ally parties. Mr.  President, what is your first reaction to this announcement by  the PA leadership?    [Endara] I must say with regret that I will refrain from  making any political statements due to the pledge I made to the  Panamanian people at the National Theater in November, when I  swore that I would remain impartial and would not involve the  state and Presidency in political activities. Regarding my  government, I must say that the PA's decision does not disband  the government alliance; it means that it has been impossible to  form an alliance for the 1994 elections. I know this will have  certain consequences for the government, but I believe [words  indistinct].    [Miller] Mr. President, along those same lines, what will  happen with Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement]  ministers who are in your cabinet?    [Endara] I am not planning to ask any of my ministers to  resign.    [Miller] This disruption of the talks leads to the  assumption that the alliance has been broken off, however.    [Endara] The break is political and concerns the 1994  elections. This, unquestionably, might and very likely will  affect my government, but my duty as president of the Republic  and of all Panamanians is to diminish as much as possible the  effects of the schism.    [Miller] Don't you believe this situation will benefit other  political candidates?    [Endara] That is a political comment, and I prefer to  refrain from answering.    [Miller] How do you respond to the views expressed by  certain government leaders that ethics dictate that Molirena  cabinet ministers should resign and not wait for you to change  them?    [Endara] I do not know who made that comment, but I would  not ask any minister from Molirena or any other party to resign.    [Miller] Mr. President, what do you believe will happen from  this point on?    [Endara] I will pray to God to help me during these  difficult times--which they are, unquestionably--and to help me  overcome any negative or harmful effects this situation may have  on my government. I want this period to go down in history as a  true model electoral period for future governments.    [Miller] Mr. President, are you not under the impression  that too many political parties that are not the parties that  formed the alliance which is now in power and was once a civic  movement are aspiring to political power?    [Endara] I can understand, more or less, what is happening  to these presidential hopefuls, because I went through a similar  struggle; therefore, I cannot throw the first stone in that  sense. I know that, at least in my opinion, service as president  of the Republic is not something you seek because you like it.  The exercise of power is, rather, a sacrifice on the people's  behalf; therefore, I believe that altruistic and not private  interests should prevail in these affairs. Within altruistic  interests there can be differences. I understand this perfectly  well, because I have experienced all of those things.    [Miller] A final question, Mr. President. Along those same  lines, isn't it true that this schism favors the political party  and the deposed military regime that the current government  opposed?    [Endara] I would like to answer you, Julio, but I must  abstain from doing so. I am very sorry, but I must not answer  your question.</p>

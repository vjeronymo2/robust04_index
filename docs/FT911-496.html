			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Cookery: An autumn taste of Tuscany - Philippa Davenport commends an Italian cookery course to Weekend FT readers I DID not enjoy my schooldays much but I would not mind becoming a student again if it meant attending the Villa Arceno in Tuscany for its one-week term in October. The subject on the curriculum is A Taste of Tuscany and the co-hosts and organisers are Anna Del Conte and Betsy Newell. Their talents, the location and the provisional programme suggest a lovely blend of food, culture, comfort and fun. Betsy is no newcomer to cookery schools. She has been at the helm of her own in London for the past 10 successful years, and she has owned a house near Arceno for twice that long so she knows the Chianti Classico area well. Anna Del Conte is Britain's most respected writer on Italian food, author of the indispensable Gastronomy of Italy and the best-selling Secrets from an Italian Kitchen. The Villa Arceno estate is a beautiful 4,000 acres. It fell into disrepair and neglect after the war and is only now recovering under the management of a new consortium of owners. Gradually the buildings and land, the olive groves, vineyards, woods, parks and gardens are being resuscitated. The villa itself, built in the 17th century, restored and extended in 1825, reopened this spring, refurbished as a small luxury class hotel. It is here that the party will stay and the cookery school will be held. There is no obligation to attend the classes. Non-cooking partners are free to shoot pheasant, help harvest and tread the grapes, ride (horses or mountain bikes), play tennis or swim. The cookery classes will embrace techniques and the quality of ingredients as well as regional recipes, their history and development. There will be talks, tastings, discussions and demonstrations. And everyone will be encouraged to try their hand at making pasta. There will be advice about buying pasta and pasta-making machines. Tortellini and rotolo will be made. The latter is little catherine wheels of pasta lusciously stuffed with spinach, cheese and prosciutto. Prosciutto? Cue for discussion and comparative tasting of Parma, San Daniele and other hams. Traditional polenta recipes will be made using oven, pressure cooker and old-fashioned stirring methods. The degree of milling needed for different purposes will be examined, as will the merits of traditional versus pre-cooked. Demonstrations will include polenta layered and baked with a four-cheese sauce, and polenta moulded in a ring, the centre of which may be filled with a wild mushroom sauce. Autumn vegetables will be stuffed, including red peppers filled with monkfish. There will be tastings of the new season's nuts and favourite Tuscan recipes using local chestnuts and chestnut flour. Game from the estate - wild boar, duck and venison as well as pheasant  - will provide star turns, including a dish of boar in a medieval sauce to which chocolate is added. Although boar is now obtainable in Britain, I am assured that hare or spicily marinated pork make fine alternative candidates for this treatment. Lunches, whether taken in the Villa or as a fete champetre by the lake, will tend to relate to the morning's cookery class. Dinner will usually be taken in neighbourhood restaurants, some smart, some family affairs, all offering characteristic Tuscan fare. Food, although the pivot on which the course turns, is by no means the be all and end all of things. The idea is to give the visitor a taste of all things Tuscan, culture as well as cuisine - and the grape. A tour of the estate's winery is planned and a tasting of wines from the region. There will be opportunities to explore the history and art of the area with leisurely afternoons and evenings in Siena, where an art expert will join the party. One day will be spent in Florence and there will be a visit to Pienza, a jewel of a Renaissance town famed for some of the best pecorino cheese in all Italy. A feast of architectural treats and Epicurean delights for Italophiles. Just 20 places are available on the trip which will run from October 12-19 (a second one-week course will probably follow). The cost is Pounds 1300 per person. This is based on sharing a room and does not include aperitifs or spirits, but is basically an all-inclusive price.

PEPPERS STUFFED WITH AUBERGINES &amp; CROUTONS This recipe is a sneak preview from Anna Del Conte's Entertaining All'Italiana, to be published by Bantam in September. It will serve six as a first or main course, when it might be teamed with other stuffed vegetables or a dish of cannellini beans dressed with garlic, parsley and oil. Although the recipe is written for immediately consecutive cooking and eating, Anna points out that most of the tasks can be done well ahead. The peppers can be grilled, wrapped and stored in the fridge up to three days in advance, and both croutons and aubergines can be cooked up to two days ahead. Always, however, delay adding the croutons to the aubergine mixture until ready to stuff and bake the peppers. 6 meaty peppers, red and yellow; 1 1/2 lb aubergines; 4 slices good white bread, 1-2 days old, cut into  1/2 inch cubes; vegetable oil and extra virgin olive oil; 1 garlic clove; 1 dried chilli, seeded and crumbled; 4 anchovy fillets; 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and dried; 4 tablespoons chopped parsley; 1 dozen black olives (optional). Peel the aubergines, cut into  1/2 inch cubes and sweat with salt in a colander for at least half an hour. Meanwhile char the peppers over a direct flame or using a very hot grill. Keep a watch on them and turn them so they blacken evenly. While keeping an eye on the peppers, heat some vegetable oil and when very hot fry the bread until golden. Drain well. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel and halve them. Discard cores, seeds and ribs. Place in an oiled dish. Rinse and dry the aubergine cubes. Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil and saute the aubergine until cooked, about 6 minutes, stirring frequently. Chop the garlic, chilli and anchovy fillets and add to the aubergine with half the parsley. Cook for 1 minute. Draw off the heat, add the capers and adjust seasoning. Add the croutons to the aubergine and fill the peppers with the mixture. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley, drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and bake for 10 minutes in an oven heated to 200 degrees C (400 degrees F) Gas mark 6. Do not serve this dish straight from the oven; let it rest for half an hour or so, since stuffed vegetables are much nicer just warm. Scatter with the olives just before serving.</p>

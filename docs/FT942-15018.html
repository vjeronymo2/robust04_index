			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Linking of tax and benefits 'flawed' Proposals to integrate the tax and welfare benefit systems are flawed, says a survey prepared for the Commission on Social Justice, the think-tank set up by Mr John Smith, Labour leader, at the end of 1992. The report by Andersen Consulting says most plans for integration are based around two proposals - a negative income tax and a citizen's income. A negative income tax would assess everyone using a single administrative structure, with the government paying credits or collecting taxes according to income. The report argues that an integrated scheme would still be likely to need different assessment periods, with taxpayers being assessed annually and benefit receivers weekly or monthly. Furthermore, benefits are at present assessed on the basis of a household unit. If this element of the system were maintained, women would lose the right to independent taxation; but if assessment were done individually, credits would be paid to the non-working wives of high-earning men. The authors also argue that, because there is little overlap between taxpayers and benefit recipients, any integrated system would probably still retain two divisions to deal with the different groups. A citizen's income would pay a basic income to everyone, clawing back the cost in the form of higher taxes. The report argues that the tax increase involved would be enormous and that incentives to work would be reduced. The authors believe, however, that integration of tax and benefits might be useful for specific groups such as pensioners, whose circumstances change infrequently. For the rest of the population, 'strategic integration - ensuring that the tax and benefits systems work together instead of creating poverty and unemployment traps - may be more important than structural integration'.

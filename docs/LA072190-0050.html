			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE MIGHT BE A COURT, BUT SOME READERS SAY SHE SHOULD NOT JUDGE  </P> <P> At tennis matches, I've seen a lot of tennis, but I've never seen a performance  of sex. Unlike Margaret Court, I wasn't afraid to take my niece to see Martina  (Navratilova) and Chris (Evert) play tennis, that her sexual identity would in  any way be influenced.  </P> <P> Admiring an athlete for his or her talent, determination and hard work makes  sense. Expecting their personal lives to fit some unrealistic model is  nonsense. Athletes' marriages, relationships, liaisons and divorces provide  gossip and sell news, but they do not predict integrity, intelligence,  personality or compassion.  </P> <P> Margaret Court was a great tennis player, but her religious prejudices against  Martina's sex life are not admirable. Clearly, the quality of Court's tennis  did not determine the quality of her character.  </P> <P> VICKI BARTMESS  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

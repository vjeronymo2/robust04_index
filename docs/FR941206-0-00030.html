			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (d) Forms for U.S. Reporters and foreign affiliates that are banks or bank holding companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For purposes of the BE&hyph;10 survey, ``banking'' covers a business entity engaged in deposit banking or closely related functions, including commercial banks, Edge Act corporations engaged in international or foreign banking, foreign branches and agencies of U.S. banks whether or not they accept deposits abroad, savings and loans, savings banks, and bank holding companies, ie., holding companies for which over 50 percent of their total income is from banks that they hold. If the bank or bank holding company is part of a consolidated business enterprise and the gross operating revenues from nonbanking activities of this consolidated entity are more than 50 percent of its total revenues, then the consolidated entity is deemed not to be a bank even if banking revenues make up the largest single source of all revenues. (Activities of subsidiaries of a bank or bank holding company that may not be banks but that provide support to the bank parent company, such as real estate subsidiaries set up to hold the office buildings occupied by the bank parent company, are considered bank activities.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Form BE&hyph;10A BANK (Report for a U.S. Reporter that is a bank). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A BE&hyph;10A BANK report must be completed by a U.S. Reporter that is a bank. For purposes of filing Form BE&hyph;10A BANK, the U.S. Reporter is deemed to be the fully consolidated U.S. domestic business enterprise and all required data on the form shall be for the fully consolidated domestic entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If a U.S. bank had any foreign affiliates at any time during its 1994 fiscal year, whether a bank or nonbank and whether held directly or indirectly, for which any one of the three items_total assets, sales or gross operating revenues excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision for foreign income taxes_was greater than $3 million (positive or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994 fiscal year, the U.S. Reporter must file a complete Form BE&hyph;10A BANK and, as applicable, a BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT listing each, if any, exempt foreign affiliate, whether bank or nonbank. It must also file a Form BE&hyph;10B(SF) for each nonexempt nonbank foreign affiliate and a Form BE&hyph;10B BANK for each nonexempt foreign bank affiliate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the U.S. bank Reporter had no foreign affiliates for which any one of the three items listed in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section was greater than $3 million (positive or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994 fiscal year, then only items 1&hyph;4 of Form BE&hyph;10A BANK and the BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT, listing all exempt foreign affiliates, should be completed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Form BE&hyph;10B BANK (Report for a foreign affiliate that is a bank). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A BE&hyph;10B BANK report must be filed for each foreign bank affiliate of a bank or nonbank U.S. Reporter, whether directly or indirectly held, for which any one of the three items_total assets, sales or gross operating revenues excluding sales taxes, or net income after provision for foreign income taxes_was greater than $3 million (positive or negative) at any time during the affiliate's 1994 fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, a Form BE&hyph;10B BANK must be filed for a foreign bank affiliate of the U.S. Reporter that owns another nonexempt foreign affiliate of that U.S. Reporter, even if the foreign affiliate parent is otherwise exempt, i.e., a Form BE&hyph;10B(LF), (SF), or BANK must be filed for all affiliates upward in a chain of ownership. However, a Form BE&hyph;10B BANK is not required to be filed for a foreign bank affiliate in which the U.S. Reporter holds only an indirect ownership interest of 50 percent or less and that does not own a reportable nonbank foreign affiliate, but the indirectly owned bank affiliate must be listed on the BE&hyph;10A BANK SUPPLEMENT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Due date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A fully completed and certified BE&hyph;10 report comprising Form BE&hyph;10A or 10A BANK, BE&hyph;10A SUPPLEMENT (as required), and Form(s) BE&hyph;10B(LF), (SF), or BANK (as required) is due to be filed with BEA not later than May 31, 1995 for those U.S. Reporters filing less than 50, and June 30, 1995 for those U.S. Reporters filing 50 or more, Forms BE&hyph;10B(LF), (SF) or BANK. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29767 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;EA&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>A     Russian academician has publicly denied a Canadian film's  charges that he offered human organs for sale.  A Russian press  report gives detailed explanations why the accusations are medically  and logistically improbable.     In a KOMMERSANT-DAILY article (23 Nov 93), Academician Valeriy  Shumakov, the director of the Public Health Ministry's Scientific  Research Institute for Transplantology and Artificial Organs, denies  a Canadian film's claims that he offered human body parts for  export.  Shumakov calls the allegations an attempt to discredit  Russian transplant specialists, who are beginning to attract  patients from Europe.     The film "Body Parts Business," which was broadcast on British  and Canadian television in November 1993, urges international  organizations to stop an alleged international black market in human  body parts.  According to a 25 November 1993 TRUD article, which  takes its information from a report in the Belgian newspaper LE  SOIR, the film alleges that organs procured from Russian kidnap  victims, corpses in Moscow morgues, missing Honduran children, and  Argentinian psychiatric patients and accident victims are being sold  for transplantation or cosmetology research.     TRUD, seconded by the Moscow newspaper KOMMERSANT-DAILY (23  November 93), says that the Canadian film describes large-volume  sales of body parts for hard currency in Russia.  Allegedly one firm  sold 600 kidneys at 20,000 rubles apiece, and a second company sold  700 kidneys, hearts, and lungs; 2,000 eyes and 3,000 pairs of  testicles.  The film reportedly asserts that most of these organs  are taken from unclaimed corpses in morgues, but some are removed  from kidnapped Russians by rings of doctors working in well-guarded,  secret locations.  The contraband organs are reportedly shipped out  of Sheremetyevo airport under forged documents.  As reported in the  KOMMERSANT-DAILY article, the BBC broadcast of the film included  allegations by Bernard Cohen, director of Eurotransplant,  a Netherlands-based organization that distributes organs to European  transplant clinics, that Shumakov offered to sell him Russian  organs.     Shumakov, an eminent transplant surgeon, USSR State Prize  laureate, hero of socialist labor, and academician of the Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences, says that the rumor is an attempt by  "certain forces in the West ... to compromise Russian  transplantology because the entry of Russian surgeons into the  international market would inflict significant injury on their  Western colleagues" (KOMMERSANT-DAILY 23 Nov 93).  Shumakov says  that his institute collaborated for one year with Eurotransplant at  Cohen's initiative.  According to Shumakov, "relations became  complicated" when the German physicians' association protested the  possibility of a group of German patients undergoing transplant  surgery in the Russian Federation (KOMMERSANT-DAILY).  DER SPIEGEL  and other Western publications had previously created a "similar  scandal," according to Shumakov, who says the negative press reports  caused a decline in Russian organ donations.     In KOMMERSANT-DAILY Shumakov denies charges that he participated  in kidnappings for the purpose of obtaining organs from the victims.  He admits that he shipped human body parts abroad but not vital  organs, not for compensation, and only after failing to find a  suitable Russian recipient.  He expresses great doubt that such a  black market could exist, because vital organs taken from morgues  are unsuitable for transplantation.  Organs must be delivered  rapidly after removal, and "it would practically be necessary to  corrupt an entire hospital" to conduct the illegal trade.  Shumakov  says his institute's only commercial venture is surgery on foreign  patients which generates hard currency to finance surgery for  Russian patients.     While the TRUD article relates the film's contents without  analysis, KOMMERSANT-DAILY accompanies its report with a pair of  side bars that reinforce Shumakov's denials.  In one, Anatoliy  Sutyko, director of the All-Russian Center for Kidney  Transplantation states that he has not encountered any violations of  the law in decades of work in this field and notes that the issue of  body part thefts did not arise at the Sixth European Congress of the  Society of Transplantologists, held in October in Greece.  Sutyko  says that donors are selected in accordance with Russian Federation  Health Ministry instructions, which require the formation of a  special committee and prohibit removal of organs before the heart  stops.  According to Sutyko, creation of a criminal ring would  require enlisting some 25 physicians from a very small group of  qualified specialists.  He further asserts that tissue compatibility  testing, which involves taking lymphocytes from the spleen,  essentially eliminates the possibility of anonymous organ donations.  A second sidebar quotes a Moscow official's assertion that the  Moscow police have discovered no corpses of missing persons with  organs removed.  It also summarizes the recently enacted Russian  Federation Law on Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues, which  prohibits their purchase and sale and requires donor consent.     Illegal exports of human body parts from former Soviet republics  have been reported previously in the Russian media.  According to  Shumakov, the accusations against him were previously raised on the  television program "Black Box" and circulated in the press for two  or three years.  A 27 April 1993 TRUD article reported that the  Kherson Center for Scientific and Technical Services in Ukraine sent  655 kilograms of human bones and muscles to Flark Medical, Inc. in  Miami Beach during a two-month period in 1992.  The exports came to  light when  Ukrainian customs officials inspected one of the  enterprise's shipments and found the export license suspicious.  Issued by Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister L. Steshenko in  1991 for 1000 transplants worth $600,000, the license not only  lacked the required signatures, originator's name, and specific  consignee address but also listed a Russian customs office,  Sheremetyevo.  Legal specialists say the license is invalid because  human transplants are not subject to licensing under Ukrainian law.  In the judgement of an oblast public prosecutor's office  representative, who is quoted in the article, the export scheme was  apparently developed to take advantage of the lack of a Ukrainian  law on transplants.     Other reports of organ exports from former Soviet republics have  appeared in the foreign press.  The HONG KONG CHRONICLE alleged that  Armenians have been smuggling kidneys to Hong Kong (Baku TURAN 25  Nov 93).  The Poznan newspaper WPROST (23 August 92) claims that the  Ukrainian "mafia" smuggles transplants to the West via Poland.  (AUTHOR:  DOBBINS.

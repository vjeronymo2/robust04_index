			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-SHIRA' in Arabic in its issue  of 14 February carries on pages 3-5 an approximately 3,000-word  article by Chief Editor Hasan Sabra, entitled "A Compound Crime  in Ba'labakk--the Assassination of a Family and a State",  commenting on a recent incident in al-Biqa' where local clansmen  took the law into their hands and put to death a youth of 16 who  had killed three people -- a mother and her two children -- in  the course of an armed burglary. After analyzing the factors  leading to the current economic hardships in that area, the  slowness of the judicial process, and the enfeebled sense of  national identity, the writer discusses Hizballah's plans to  replace or nullify the state in various Lebanese areas. He  remarks that Ba'labakk's double crime "did not come from a  vacuum."    Sabra points out that when the narcotic crops in al-Biqa', a  former mainstay of that area's economy, particularly in northern  al-Biqa', were eliminated in line with new "regional  circumstances and U.S. conditions," no lawful alternative to  making a living was offered, thus encouraging theft.    He then discusses some people's weak affiliation to the  homeland and their inclination to accept tribal justice. He  says this is encouraged by the condition of the Lebanese courts,  which are plagued by delays and interventions by politicians.  The result, he says, is that people despair of getting justice  from the courts. He notes that "thousands of cases have piled  up in the Lebanese courts, some never get to court, some remain  in the investigators' hands, and some are buried under the  debate among lawyers and judges."    He calls for improving judges' living conditions and urges  politicians to keep their hands off the judiciary, declaring:  "We place the chief responsibility for the judicial crisis in  our country on the shoulders of the majority of politicians,  their wishes, greed, circumvention of the law, their pressure on  judges, and their alternate threats and bribes to them."    On the significance of the Ba'labakk incident, he says:    "While we denounce the rejection of society's laws, weak  sense of national belonging, and recourse to tribal law, we also  share the feeling of those who believe in one homeland that  there is a party that does not want the state to exist and  indeed believes that the state's very existence is at the  expense of its own.    "Who does not know Hizballah's plans to abolish the state in  Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil, Beirut's southern suburb, and every other  place where it can forfeit the state's institutions, flout its  laws, and reject society's norms, using pretexts to resort to  armed force, sometimes trying to bribe and at others making  threats? It always has ready rulings [fatwas] to twist the arm  of religion, distort it, and use it to intimidate the public.    "The state is absent in Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil just as it is  absent in the southern suburb and Jabal 'Amil.    "In Ba'labakk, Hizballah nullifies the courts, in the  southern suburb it nullifies public services, and in the south  it nullifies the state's sovereignty. In all these cases it  tries to impose its laws at the public's, society's, and the  homeland's expense.    "An opportunity offered itself in Ba'labakk to implement  Hizballah's Islamic republic slogan, in practice not in theory.  It was offered on a blood-soaked pillow. Hizballah did not let  the opportunity slip. The party that prevents the building of a  general hospital in the Southern Suburb and opposes new roads,  electricity supplies, and telephone services to the people will  have no scruples about exploiting the murder of a whole family.    "And now what?    "What happened in Ba'labakk is a compound crime in which a  family was murdered and a state was assassinated. State  officials and the public must respond to this assassination.  They must go by the book and use the state's prestige. The  crucial component of prestige is justice and the retrieval of  outlaws... by the law."</p>

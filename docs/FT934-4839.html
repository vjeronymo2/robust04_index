			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Customers report banking errors A fifth of bank and building society customers have suffered mistakes in standing orders or direct debits, says a poll published in Which? the Consumers' Association magazine. The magazine says that the poll, which involved more than 3,500 people who responded to a random postal survey, showed that the code of banking practice had not succeeded in improving services. The most prevalent complaints were of money being incorrectly taken from an account, reported by one in seven; and of incorrect charges being imposed, reported by one in eight. Midland Bank and National Westminster Bank are rated worst for overall satisfaction, while Abbey National, First Direct, Girobank and Yorkshire Bank are rated best.</p>

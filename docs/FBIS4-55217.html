			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sun `Trimmed' From Macedonian Flag in </F> London"]    [Text] At the CITEX [expansion unknown] fair in London,  which is attended by the participants from 25 Central and  Eastern European countries, the symbol on the Macedonian [FYROM  -- The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] flag -- the Sun of  Vergina -- was printed in the form of a sunflower! However, the  authentic Macedonian flag is printed on the invitation for  applications to this fair.    The organizers of the Macedonian stand at this fair have  confirmed that the invitation had the "trimmed" sun from the  Macedonian flag printed on it, which is seen as a provocation!  Today, the Macedonian Ambassador in Great Britain Risto  Nikovski will ask for an official explanation from the CITEX  organizers. It is unclear as to who made the change of symbols  on the flag, printed on the invitation for the participation to  the fair.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Pep money focuses on charges - At a glance Competition for Pep investors' money before the end of the tax year is still tightly focused on charges. Save &amp; Prosper is halving its initial charge on its Managed Portfolio Pep to 0.75 per cent, for investments of more than Pounds 4,000 made between now and the end of the tax year. This also applies to the S &amp; P Dealing Plan Pep. Additionally, the initial charge on all the unit trusts available through S &amp; P's Unit Trust Pep will be cut by one point to 4.5 per cent for the same period. Annual charges on all the Peps range from 1.25 to 1.5 per cent. Prolific is cutting the initial charge on unit trust Peps from 5.25 per cent to 3 per cent, until June 1 this year, so that investors can take out Peps with the lower initial charge for both tax years.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Cause for concern behind the South Pacific smiles: World Bank estimates the islands' real GDP has grown 0.1% a year in the past 10 years There was little disguising Mr Paul Keating's satisfaction as the Australian prime minister presided over the closing formalities at the annual meeting of South Pacific leaders in Brisbane this week. Australia, as host nation to the South Pacific Forum, attended by 14 other countries ranging from Nuie (pop: 2,500) to Papua New Guinea, had suggested 'managing resources' as a theme for the conference. Items agreed included a pledge from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Solomons Islands, that they would 'work towards a common code of conduct governing logging of indigenous forests, to which companies operating in their countries will have to adhere'. Monitoring of logging activities would be stepped up, and senior offficials would meet within two months to begin implementing these agreements. On the fraught question of overfishing in South Pacific waters, countries would make an effort to define sustainable catch levels, and take a multilateral approach to monitoring how, and at what prices, resources should be exploited. They would also look at ways of rationalising air services in the region to try to curtail losses suffered by national carriers. A meeting of finance ministers from the island states was proposed for 'the near future', with participation from representatives of international financial institutions encouraged. Last year, the World Bank estimated that the Pacific island nations' real gross domestic product had grown by just 0.1 per cent a year over the past 10 years. This looks all the more lamentable alongside the double-digit growth rates in the Asean countries nearby. Reasons sometimes put forward for the disparity in performance include the smaller size of Pacific island nations and their geographical isolation. But Australia, for one, feels the explanations are to be found elsewhere. 'Asian governments have taken deliberate steps to adopt and pursue economic policies which have had the effect of mobilising domestic savings and opening their economies to quality foreign investment,' Mr Gordon Bilney, Australian minister for Pacific Island Affairs, said recently. 'It is perhaps not too harsh a judgment to say that a number of South Pacific countries are. . . yet to take up this example.' Moreover, there are fears that, unless immediate action is taken, big problems are being stored up for the future. The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations last year, with its promise of a more competitive world trade environment, could pose trouble for key sectors in some of the island states' economies. The Fijian sugar industry, which enjoys preferential treatment in Europe, is one example. There also is concern that the region will deplete - or allow foreign interests to deplete - its rich natural resources, in a short-term chase of profits. Severe environmental damage, from deforestation to coastal degradation, would be the result. Heavy logging of tropical rainforests in countries such as PNG and the Solomons, largely by Malaysian interests, is seen by many as the main worry. Australia as a leading trading partner and aid donor has a particular vested interest in the region. Its exports to Forum island countries (excluding New Zealand) topped ADollars 560m (Pounds 267m) last year, and Australian mining companies have some large holdings in the region, especially in PNG. Australia's aid budget to the region is almost ADollars 500m a year, two-thirds of which goes to PNG. The point has been made that aid to the rest is about equal to the losses suffered by their national airlines. Recent problems at the debt-laden Polynesian Airlines - where allegations of corruption and unsound business judgment within the Western Samoan cabinet have led to the appointment of a commission of inquiry - has bolstered the views of those who would like to see more financial discipline associated with such aid. Encouraging change without offending sensibilities is a delicate matter. Australia's approach is to suggest that it is merely passing on lessons which it, all too recently, learned the hard way itself. Even so, while smiles were plentiful in Queensland this week, Pacific island leaders plainly have a different perspective on some of these issues. For example, Mr Francis Billy Hilly, prime minister of the Solomon Islands, conceded that his government was concerned about the rate of logging. But, he noted, 'if we do stop our export of round logs today, which counts for more than 50 per cent of government revenue, we'll have a big hole in our budget'. In the absence of assistance, 'our reform policies will be slower than what we would much like,' he said. Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, said that developed countries 'had to appreciate the difficulties small island countries faced in controlling resource development'. 'It is more than just a matter of money. We must take into account the traditional rights of our people to fish and to harvest their forests,' he declared.</p>

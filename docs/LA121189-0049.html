			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAGUE CHEERS A NEW REGIME;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: A CZECHOSLOVAK COALITION GOVERNMENT IS SWORN IN. IT IS CONTROLLED BY  NON-COMMUNISTS.  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Czechoslovaks poured into Wenceslas Square on Sunday to  sing and cheer and celebrate the victory of their peaceful revolution as the  opposition Civic Forum announced it would nominate its leader, playwright  Vaclav Havel, as the nation's next president.  </P> <P> Havel appears to be the clear favorite to replace hard-line Communist President  Gustav Husak, who resigned Sunday shortly after swearing in the first  government in 41 years here that the Communists do not control.  </P> <P> Civic Forum and its allies in the new government will control economic, labor  and social welfare policy, the police and foreign policy. Prime Minister Marian  Calfa and a Communist army general left in charge of defense will be the only  party members holding major portfolios in the new government.  </P> <P> The minister in charge of the police will be a former dissident just released  from jail two weeks ago. The foreign minister will be another opposition figure  who succeeded only a few days ago in having his telephone turned back on after  security forces had cut it off.  </P> <P> "It's a world turned upside down," said one Western diplomat.  </P> <P> Havel announced the new interim government to the crowd gathered to celebrate  International Human Rights Day in the square, the scene of the massive  demonstrations over the last three weeks that drove the Communists from the  power they had monopolized since a coup in February, 1948. The new government  is expected to lead the country to elections in a matter of months.  </P> <P> A similar crowd, estimated at 100,000 by Czechoslovak state television, turned  out in Bratislava, the country's second-largest city.  </P> <P> "Thanks to the peaceful revolution, our artificially stopped history suddenly  has begun to move again," Havel said as the crowd shouted back "To je ono!" (a  Czech equivalent of "Right on!"), "Svobodne volby!" (Free elections!) and  "Havel na Hradna!" (Havel to the Castle!), a reference to the home of  Czechoslovak presidents.  </P> <P> A little over an hour later, Calfa described the government in a lengthy press  conference. Calfa has had an undistinguished career as a government official,  but he appeared poised and articulate as he discussed the new government's  plans and the challenges it faces.  </P> <P> The 21-member government is nominally made up of 10 Communists, seven members  of the opposition and two members each from the Socialist and People's parties,  both of which were longtime allies of the Communists.  </P> <P> But of the 10 Communist Party members, two are economic reformers nominated by  Civic Forum and allied with it. Civic Forum also has formed an alliance with  the two People's Party representatives, giving it a solid 11-vote majority in  the government.  </P> <P> In addition, four of the remaining Communists in the government are generally  considered technocrats chosen for their expertise to head ministries in charge  of trade, telecommunications, energy and mining.  </P> <P> With the new government formed, the crisis stage of Czechoslovakia's revolution  appears to be over, leaving the more arduous task of consolidating the move to  democracy. Civic Forum announced it was calling off a general strike set for  today and asking instead that people throughout the nation ring church bells  and honk horns for five minutes beginning at noon.  </P> <P> Students, however, announced that their strike, which began the revolution,  would continue, at least for now, to maintain pressure for a full investigation  of the police attack on student demonstrators Nov. 17 and to allow students to  leave Prague to fight attempts to block democratization in the countryside.  </P> <P> Reports from provincial areas indicate widespread attempts by local Communist  authorities to hold onto their power, blocking news of events in Prague from  reaching their regions.  </P> <P> Those reports illustrate the magnitude of what Calfa and Havel both say will be  the chief task of the new "government of national understanding" -- preparing a  legal framework to guarantee basic civil liberties and free elections.  </P> <P> The elections, which will be the first free voting here since 1946, are  expected to be held next spring or early summer.  </P> <P> Calfa, who pledged to act independently from the Communist Party and who  promised "open doors" to Czechoslovak emigres wishing to return, also said that  the government would make a start at "radical" economic reforms. The reforms,  which would alter Czechoslovakia's centrally planned economy but not change it  fundamentally, are scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1.  </P> <P> But Calfa made clear that the divided government, containing every political  shading from Communist to ardent free-marketer, would have to postpone major  decisions on whether to go further and leave such issues to whatever government  is formed after the elections.  </P> <P> For example, he said, no decision will be made on legalizing private ownership  of businesses until after the elections.  </P> <P> A third major challenge will be to rein in the nation's once-omnipresent secret  police, who have long been a law unto themselves.  </P> <P> In negotiations with Civic Forum leaders, Calfa admitted that despite his long  career in the legal department of the prime minister's office, he himself does  not know "where the jurisdiction of the security forces starts and where it  ends," said a Civic Forum spokesman.  </P> <P> Bringing the police "under strict control" is "a priority for us," Calfa said.  "We have to solve this matter before elections."  </P> <P> Despite the rapid democratization Czechoslovakia has seen in the last three  weeks, the secret police remain active. Diplomats warn, for example, that  telephone tapping and surveillance appear to have increased in recent days as  the security forces scramble to keep track of the rapidly changing situation.  </P> <P> The task of controlling the security forces will fall mainly to First Deputy  Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky, a highly respected lawyer and Roman Catholic  activist who was jailed for dissident activities in August and released only  Nov. 26.  </P> <P> Several other new government officials also have been victims of the former  regime's persecutions. Miroslav Kusy, who will head the government information  office, was arrested with Carnogursky in August. Valtr Komarek, the new first  deputy prime minister in charge of economics, was fired from his job in the  purge following the 1968 Soviet invasion. And the new foreign minister, Jiri  Dienstbier, has long been harassed for his views.  </P> <P> Calfa, asked about how well he could work with people who had been maltreated  by a government he long served, offered an apology.  </P> <P> "My feelings are of regret," he said. "I know this will not help Mr. Dienstbier  now," he added, but "we will be able to cooperate together."  </P> <P> Nor did Calfa deny that the Communist governments of the past bore  responsibility for the nation's current "difficult" state.  </P> <P> "We all are responsible," he said, "those who governed in a certain way, and  those others who respected this type of government or accepted this type of  government."  </P> <P> The remaining job in restructuring Czechoslovakia's new political order will be  the election by Parliament of a new president to replace Husak, and Havel  appears to be a formidable front-runner.  </P> <P> Speaker after speaker in the square called on him to take the job, a suggestion  that met with loud applause from the crowd.  </P> <P> Havel, himself, did not mention the possibility. Instead, he warned his  audience that they would have to remain on guard to prevent democracy from  being subverted.  </P> <P> "We have not yet won," he said, although the revolution has achieved "great  success" toward its goals.  </P> <P> "Let us preserve its purity, its peacefulness, its lovingness, its joyful  friendly tenor," he said. "Let us ensure its values continue to flourish. Let  us not permit anybody in any way to mar the beautiful face of our revolution.  Truth and love must triumph over anger and hate."  </P> <P> Civic Forum officials said that Havel had agreed to run for the job, but only  on the condition that he be allowed to resign after the general election. A new  president would then be chosen by the newly elected Parliament for the  customary five-year term. Havel did not rule out running for reelection then.  </P> <P> The parliamentary election must be held within two weeks. And although some  political figures still oppose Havel, there appear to be few, if any, viable  alternatives.  </P> <P> The Communists agreed in round-table negotiations Friday that because the prime  minister is a Communist, the new president will not be.  </P> <P> And there is a general consensus that because Calfa is a Slovak, the president  should be Czech to maintain the nation's ethnic balance.  </P></p>

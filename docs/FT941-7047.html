			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Australian miner cautious despite rise North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and exploration group, yesterday reported a sharp rise in after-tax profit in the six months to the end of December. The result was ADollars 86.4m (USDollars 63m), compared with ADollars 52.3m in the same period of 1992/93, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. However, it warned that lower profits were expected in the second half because there would be no contribution from the paper manufacturing and distribution business sold to Amcor in November. Lower iron ore prices negotiated with the Japanese steel mills would also affect the result. These factors would be partly offset by improved contributions from gold mining and the 66 per cent-owned Energy Resources of Australia.</p>

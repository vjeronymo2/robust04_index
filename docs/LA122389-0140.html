			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DISCUSS CHILD'S NIGHTTIME FEARS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 7-year-old son is suddenly afraid of the dark and begs  not to have to sleep alone if the light is turned off. I don't want him to get  in the habit of sleeping in my bed, so I bought an attractive little night  light and I allow him to keep it on. His grandfather feels this is spoiling him  and is convinced he'll grow up to be a sissy because of my "coddling." -- B.P.  </P> <P> DEAR B.P.: Grandfather is badly misinformed, and your instinct is correct. Talk  with your son about his fears of the dark, let him know that you always want  him to discuss anything that's troubling or frightening him and that he's free  to turn the light off or on whenever he wishes.  </P> <P> Sometimes youngsters associate darkness with being left alone or being lost.  Some youngsters associate darkness with death, and if this is the case, it is  something you need to explore and talk about. As Dr. Jonathan Kellerman points  out in his book "Helping the Fearful Child," for 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds, death  is often seen as someone or something who comes in the night.  </P> <P> Parents who refer to death as sleep or a journey often have children who  develop anxiety about the dark. Maybe you should ask your son if he knows why  he suddenly developed this fear of darkness. You may be able to help him  overcome his fear by gradually rewarding him for success when, over a period of  weeks, he's able to reduce the wattage of the light.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My neighbor, a woman in her mid-50s, is very strange.  Sometimes, she's the nicest person and one couldn't wish for a better, more  considerate neighbor, but at other times, she's horrible and almost frightening  to me. Her husband told me that she's being treated for what he calls MPD. He  says she has more than one personality. How could this be? -- V.T.  </P> <P> DEAR V.T.: Drugs and alcohol have nothing to do with this disorder, although if  there are multiple personalities, one of these personalities may drink or abuse  drugs. MPD, or multiple personality disorder, was considered a separate and  highly treatable mental condition by the American Psychiatric Assn. in 1980.  </P> <P> It's relatively rare, but there's little question that some individuals do have  more than one personality -- even two personalities are enough to meet the  definition of MPD.  </P> <P> It's believed that these personality splits begin in childhood when some  traumatic incident sets it off. Occasionally, as a reaction to serious child  abuse, the mind fragments or splits off in order to cope with the pain and a  separate personality emerges to deal with the next psychic assaults.  </P></p>

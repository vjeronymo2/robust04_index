			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY'S SMOG THREATENS SIERRA AND AGRICULTURE  </P> <P> There was a time, Simon Lakritz recalls, when he could see the snowcapped peaks  of the Sierra Nevada from his San Joaquin Valley home.  </P> <P> Over the years, however, Lakritz, who has lived in the valley for 30 years,  watched the horizon dissolve into a haze as smog obscured his vista.  </P> <P> "It used to be you could see the Sierra from my front yard," Lakritz said. Now,  although mountains are just an hour's drive away, "it's only once in a blue  moon, when the wind is blowing just right, that you can see them."  </P> <P> Like Lakritz, many San Joaquin Valley residents and air quality officials are  becoming increasingly aware of the region's air quality. Encircled by mountains  and capped by a recurring layer of warm air that traps emissions, the valley is  a natural smog caldron.  </P> <P> Since 1980, the valley's population has grown by 450,000 people, and more  people mean more cars, trucks, barbecues and fireplaces spewing pollutants into  the air to be cooked by the summer sun.  </P> <P> Air pollution, especially ozone, has begun to threaten the valley's $8-billion  agricultural harvest. Ozone rarely kills plants, but it can cause them to lose  leaves and buds sooner than normal. According to state estimates, smog caused  more than $150 million in reduced crop yields last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'The Worst . . . Problem'  </P> <P> "We have the potential of becoming the worst air pollution problem in the U.S.,  even worse than they have down in L.A.," said Judy Andreen, Fresno County  representative on the Basinwide Air Pollution Control Council, a panel  representing eight San Joaquin Valley counties.  </P> <P> Valley smog also contributes to acid rain and fog, which forestry officials  fear may one day lead to the destruction of forests and lakes in the southern  Sierra Nevada.  </P> <P> "We don't have any dead lakes or forests yet, but they are the most sensitive  forests in the nation," said Dr. John R. Holmes, a researcher with the state  Air Resources Board.  </P> <P> Smog also threatens the region's economic health in another way. In order to  comply with the California Clean Air Act passed last November, air pollution  officials in the valley must reduce emissions from factory smokestacks and  other stationary sources by 15% -- and develop plans for complying with federal  smog limits -- by 1991.  </P> <P> Local officials may also have to impose regulations that would impede economic  growth and they have begun to consider air quality when approving land use  plans.  </P> <P> Fresno County, for example, is weighing whether to restrict developments that  encourage longer commutes.  </P> <P> "There's always some potential for limiting of residential, commercial and  industrial growth. . . . We have to look at everything in order attain those  (clean air) goals," said Robert C. Dowell, Fresno county air pollution control  chief.  </P> <P> In Stanislaus County, officials are considering a fee on commercial and  residential developers for cleaning up auto exhaust generated by motorists who  use their shopping malls and housing tracts. Such fees are now imposed only on  industrial sources of pollution, said Mark Boese, deputy air pollution control  officer.  </P> <P> In Kings and Kern counties, companies that employ large numbers of people or  require frequent deliveries may have to pay for air cleanup or minimize their  emissions through car-pooling.  </P> <P> "The evaluation of air quality requires that we look at how we design  communities. It's not just a matter of how we regulate tailpipe and smokestack  emissions," said Bill Sessa, state Air Resources Board spokesman.  </P> <P> Smog levels in the valley had stabilized with tougher requirements for  anti-smog devices on new cars and stricter regulation of industry in the last  decade, Sessa said, but over the last three years, the added pollution from  growth appears to have canceled out those gains. Ozone levels in the valley  appear to be on the rise, having exceeded federal standards on 59 days in 1986  and 64 days in 1987.  </P> <P> The state Air Resources Board counts 2.5 million people living in the valley  from Lodi in the north to Bakersfield in the south. Since 1980, the population  has grown by 22%, and the state predicts that it will grow 40% more by 2005.  </P> <P> Much of the growth in the northern part of the valley has come from Bay Area  residents looking for affordable housing. The cities of Stockton, Manteca,  Tracy and Modesto are rapidly becoming Bay Area suburbs.  </P> <P> Half of the 12,000 people who moved to San Joaquin County last year commute to  jobs in the Bay Area, said Lakhmir Grewal, director of the county air pollution  control district.  </P> <P> The Bay Area may also be contributing directly to the valley's growing air  pollution problems. Studies have shown that smog from the Bay Area drifts  through the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta or creeps over the Altamont Pass where  Interstate 580 connects with the valley.  </P> <P> Bay Area smog officials concede that some of their impure air ends up in the  valley, but they dispute its effects.  </P> <P> "I think everyone would agree the Bay Area contributes to (smog) exceedances in  the Central Valley. But the question is how much," said Robin DeMandel, a  spokesman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> But the valley is not without its own industrial pollution. The southern San  Joaquin Valley accounts for 64% of the state's total oil production. In 1987,  Kern County alone produced more than 250 million barrels from its 78 oil  fields.  </P> <P> "If Kern County were a country, we would be the 16th largest oil producer in  the world," said Ed Welge, Kern County deputy for the state's Division of Oil  and Gas.  </P> <P> San Joaquin Valley oil, often referred to in the trade as "sour crude," is  heavier and more viscous than oil from other regions. Because of its high  viscosity, steam generators are needed to loosen and pump the molasses-like oil  to the surface. The steam generators dump a significant amount of exhaust into  the valley air.  </P> <P> Some critics say the way air pollution is regulated in the valley contributes  to the problem. Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area have  regional air pollution control districts, but the valley's air quality is  regulated by eight independent agencies, one per county.  </P> <P> Smog is not confined by county boundaries, so any solution will require a  regional approach, the critics say.  </P> <P> "We can continue to meet guidelines and still choke to death," said Ken  Bettencourt, a member of the Kings County Citizens for a Healthy Environment.  </P> <P> The main group working to improve regional cooperation, the basin control  council, meets monthly, with one elected supervisor serving from each county.  The group is only advisory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Everyone Goes Home'  </P> <P> "We go, we meet and everyone goes home," said Les Brown, the group's chairman  and a Kings County supervisor.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the counties have agreed to produce the San Joaquin Valley Air  Quality Study, a $9-million project initiated last year by a regional joint  powers agency. Scheduled to be completed some time over the next decade, the  study will measure the effect of various sources of smog and consider new  regulations.  </P> <P> Bettencourt and others say the lack of regional control has led to the  proliferation of another source of pollution: the small energy-producing plants  known as cogenerators.  </P> <P> Cogeneration plants generate electricity along with heat or steam by burning a  variety of fuels, including natural gas, garbage, wood and coal. Cogenerators  supply canneries, garbage incinerators, factories and other businesses with  heat or steam and use the rest of the steam to produce electricity.  </P> <P> There are 49 cogeneration facilities in California today, contrasted with only  one in 1980. Another 116 projects are expected to be operating by 2000.  </P> <P> "Out of all the industrial development in the San Joaquin Valley, this is the  biggest segment and consequently the most controversial," said Sessa, from the  state Air Resources Board.  </P> <P> Growing concern over smog in the valley has prompted many communities to oppose  such projects. In Hanford, Kingsburg and Selma, proposed coal-burning  cogeneration plants have touched off bitter battles between the communities and  GWF Power Systems, the company behind the projects.  </P> <P> In Hanford, the dispute has led to the ousting of the mayor and two City  Council members who approved the project. Attempting to ban the burning of coal  within the city limits, the newly elected council is now tangled in a lawsuit  with GWF.  </P> <P> The controversy has arisen despite assurances from the industry -- which has  contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the official air pollution  study -- that cogeneration is cleaner than many other industries.  </P> <P> "Since there is seldom any desire to do anything to existing sources of  pollution, the tendency is to deal with the new sources coming in. Cogeneration  is always the new guy on the block," said Jan Hamrin, executive director of the  Independent Power Producers Assn.  </P> <P> The growing concern over air pollution has also led to a new alliance between  environmentalists and farmers. Farmers were often regarded as part of the  problem because of agricultural burning, dust from plowing and smog device  exemptions for farming equipment.  </P> <P> But farmers are becoming increasingly aware of the effect of air pollution on  their livelihoods, said Jim Verboon, Kings County Farm Bureau president.  Verboon estimates that crop yields for cotton, grapes and citrus are reduced by  15% to 20% because of ozone pollution.  </P> <P> "We fought environmentalists in the past. But now we stand to suffer the most  (from air pollution)," Verboon said. "In my opinion we'll be the  environmentalists of the future."  </P></p>

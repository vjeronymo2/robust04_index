			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Bank is left on the sideline as two suitors make secret approaches - The battle for Midland BRITISH clearing banks are no longer a species protected by the Bank of England. To be more precise, they cannot rely on the Bank to protect them from a takeover, although the Bank will intervene in a bank's affairs if there is a threat to its depositors' interests. This is one lesson from the remarkable story of the secret negotiations between Midland Bank and Lloyds Bank and between Midland and Hongkong Bank, which took place between December last year and March. These negotiations culminated last week in Lloyds' announcement that it was proposing to pay Pounds 3.6bn to acquire Midland, as a challenge to a formal Pounds 3.3bn bid made a fortnight earlier by Hongkong Bank. Midland published part of this story in a letter sent to its shareholders yesterday. The Financial Times has pieced together the rest of the narrative from interviews with bankers involved in the talks. Lloyds had been doing research on the logic of buying Midland since early last year. It did not tell Midland it was interested in buying it until the end of November. Detailed discussions on a possible deal then started immediately between Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds and architect of the takeover plan, and Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive. Mr Pearse and Mr Pitman are both lifetime career bankers, with more than 80 years experience of the industry between them. Mr Pearse, at 58, is two years younger than Mr Pitman. Though they are involved in the first takeover battle between two English clearers, their careers are a paradigm of the British banking tradition. They became bank clerks straight from school, stayed loyal to their employers for decades and gradually rose through the ranks. They are both strong-willed individuals and tough negotiators. Their main financial advisers are also renowned in the City for being extremely determined. Mr Pitman is being helped by Mr Andrew Tuckey, the chairman of merchant bank Baring Brothers Mr Derek Higgs, a managing director at merchant bank SG Warburg and dubbed by competitors as the 'bruiser', is Mr Pearse's aide. Mr Pearse was disappointed that Lloyds had made the approach. In the previous March, he had moved banks for the first and only time in his career. The Bank of England had asked him to leave Barclays, where he had been finance director, to become chief executive of Midland, which was then at the low point of its fortunes. Sir Kit McMahon, Midland's then chairman, had hoped to merge his bank with the Hongkong Bank. But the deal had not materialised at the end of 1990, as had been hoped. At the same time, a collapse in Midland's profits forced it to become the first clearer since the 1930's to cut its dividend. The Bank felt it would be sensible for Sir Kit to retire early. Mr Pearse took on his executive duties and Sir Peter Walters, former chairman of BP, became Midland's chairman. Mr Pearse had hoped to do the job for at least two years. By the end of 1991 he had become convinced that measures taken to boost productivity were paying off and that it had a future as an independent organisation. Mr Pearse felt it was 'slightly odd' - as he now says - that Lloyds should have made its approach. The day after Lloyds made contact, he went to see Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England. Mr George said he was powerless to intervene. The competition authorities might question whether it was in the public interest for two big banks to combine. But this was not an issue to be considered by the Bank. There was no suggestion that depositors' funds would be at risk as a result of a link-up between the two. Mr George said the Bank could not interfere in a question which was more properly the concern of both banks' shareholders. Lloyds wanted access to Midland's detailed accounts, to carry out a process known as 'due diligence' to assess what it should offer to acquire Midland's shares. However, Midland felt it would be premature to give this information to a competitor. Instead, Mr Pearse said Lloyds would have to wait until after its financial results were published, on February 27, before making its offer. Negotiations on the structure of the deal continued, with Mr Pearse finding time for very little else. At the end of the year it was agreed that Lloyds would make a formal bid proposal to Midland's board of directors at a meeting fixed for March 13. In the meantime, Mr Pearse had to face the delicate task of informing Hongkong Bank what was going on. Since the end of 1987, Hongkong Bank has owned just under 15 per cent of Midland's shares and it has two of its own directors on the Midland Board, including Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman. In mid-January, Mr Pearse told Mr Purves that it had received a takeover approach, though he did not mention that the potential bidder was Lloyds. He told him so that Hongkong Bank could decide whether it wanted to sell its stake or revive its takeover plans. In early February, Hongkong Bank said it did not want to sell its shares. Mr Purves said he would be interested in a takeover, but detailed discussions could not take place until after its financial results were published on March 10. Midland slotted Hongkong Bank into the same negotiating timetable as Lloyds. Hongkong Bank was also told it would have to make its formal proposal to the Midland board on March 13. At the same time, Midland informed Lloyds it had a rival suitor. Both Lloyds and Hongkong Bank were able to deduce the identity of their challeng-er. Midland asked both of them to give a commitment that if Midland's board did not opt for their bid that they would not make a hostile takeover attempt. Lloyds listened but did not give any response to this request. Then in early March came a display of brinkmanship by Lloyds. On Sunday March 1, Mr Pitman hinted to Mr Pearse that it might make an announcement that it was in takeover talks with Midland. However, it was only the following evening that Lloyds told Midland it was definitely going to make an announcement and that this would be made at 8am the following day. Lloyds had even made arrangements for its chairman, Sir Jeremy Morse, to be interviewed by the BBC Today Programme using its radio car. Then at 9pm Mr Pitman rang Mr Pearse. Lloyds' reason for making the announcement, Mr Pitman said, was that it was concerned there might be a leak, since so many bankers and their advisers knew what was going on. Mr Pearse was not happy. He was concerned that the disclosure would be very unsettling to the banks' customers and its employees. That would be a price worth paying if Lloyds was making a firm bid which stood a good chance of success. But at that stage, all Lloyds would have said was that it was interested in bidding. It would not have put a price on Midland's shares. Nor was there was much indication about whether the competition authorities would have allowed the takeover to take place. Mr Pearse did not know whether Lloyds was planning to say what role he would have in the combined business at the press conference it was organising for the following day. But he pointed out to Mr Pitman that there was a clause in his contract with Midland that allowed him to quit, giving just six months notice, if control of Midland changed hands. Mr Pearse then spent a frantic two hours telephoning Midland's directors to tell them that the announcement was imminent. He then went to a small appartment in the City owned by Midland for directors' use. There he telephone Mr George, to tell him what was coming. However, Mr George was ahead of him. He informed Mr Pearse that Lloyds had changed its mind about making the announcement. Mr Pearse had to telephone all his fellow directors again. Banking sources say that the Bank of England put no pressure on Lloyds to change its mind on making the announcement. Although the Bank may have shared Midland's anxiety that an announcement by Lloyds at this stage was not playing by Marquess of Queensbury rules, it did not feel it could intervene. However, Mr Pitman interpreted Mr Pearse's statement about his contract as a direct threat to resign - and he felt that would be damaging to his bank's chances of success. He therefore cancelled the announcement and agreed to adhere to the original negotiating schedule. Both banks continued to work on the detailed proposals which they would put to Midland's board on Friday March 13. At the same time, Mr Pearse, with the help of the accountants Price Waterhouse and his finance director, Mr Richard Delbridge, was preparing a separate presentation on the merits of Midland remaining independent. The fateful Friday morning arrived and Midland's directors gathered for the meeting. However, they did not meet at the bank's distinguished Lutyens-designed headquarters at Poultry in the City. To pre-empt rumours which would inevitably be stimulated by the arrival at Poultry of Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, and Mr Pitman, they went to Warburg's offices. Lloyds said it would be prepared to offer one of its shares, then worth 400p, for each Midland share (its subsequent proposal is to offer one share plus 30p). The commercial rationale for the deal was to cut costs by closing 1,100 of the combined banks' branches. Lloyds expected that at least as many of its branches would be closed as Midlands' - possibly more. Mr Pitman also also said that Midland's directors would be given the lion's share of the top jobs in the combined business. Mr Pitman would be chief executive. But Sir Peter Walters would be the chairman. Mr Pearse would be deputy chief executive, in line probably to succeed Mr Pitman. Mr Delbridge would be finance director and Mr Brian Goldthorpe, Midland's deputy chief executive, would be in charge of the corporate banking department. For the presentation by Hongkong Bank, the Midland directors returned to Poultry. Mr Purves is a regular visitor to Midland, so his presence at the headquarters that day would not have aroused outsiders's suspicions. He offered one share and 80p of loan stock for each Midland share (in its later published offer, it proposed one share and 100p of loan stock). At the time, that was worth slightly more than the Lloyds' offer at 410p, but the difference was not great enough to be the determining factor in Lloyds' board's choice. There was a third presentation, by Mr Delbridge, on the merits of Midland remaining independent. The Price Waterhouse study concluded that there was no doubt about Midland's ability to survive and prosper on its own. But shareholders could not expect their shares to yield a return - in the form of a share price rise and dividends - equal to what Hongkong Bank and Lloyds were offering for some considerable time, perhaps two years. So Midland's board felt they could not vote for independence. In the end, they plumped for Hongkong Bank for two reasons. They preferred Hongkong Bank's promise to invest in the business and expand it. But they were also concerned that Lloyds' takeover would be blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority. They had taken advice on this issue from a leading barrister, an economist and from other legal advisers. At 6pm the Midland board returned to Warburgs and delivered the news to a disappointed Mr Pitman. Sir Jeremy was not present. The secret war was now over. On March 17 Midland and Hongkong Bank announced their nuptials. Last Tuesday Lloyds said it wanted to break up the engagement and carry off Midland itself. Battle had commenced.</p>

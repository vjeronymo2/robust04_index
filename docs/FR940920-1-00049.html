The best emission control system for controlling Cd emissions is an SD/FF. The EPA's analysis of test data from existing MWC's with SD/FF systems indicates that these systems can continuously achieve a Cd emission level of 0.010 mg/dscm, which represents greater than 99-percent reduction. Therefore, the MACT floor for Cd emissions is 0.010 mg/dscm. The proposed MACT standard for Cd for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants is the MACT floor level of 0.010 mg/dscm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Lead. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Uncontrolled Pb emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 25 mg/dscm. The best emission control system for controlling Pb emissions is an SD/FF. The EPA's analysis of test data from existing MWC's with modern SD/FF systems indicates that these systems can continuously achieve a Pb emission level of 0.10 mg/dscm, which represents greater than 99-percent reduction. Therefore, the MACT floor for Pb emissions is 0.10 mg/dscm. The proposed MACT standard for Pb for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants is the MACT floor level of 0.10 mg/dscm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Mercury. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Uncontrolled Hg emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 0.65 mg/dscm. The MACT floor is based on using an SD/FF. Control of Hg is highly variable, and the EPA's analysis of recent test data has indicated that the control efficiency of SD/FF systems for Hg ranges from no control to 50-percent Hg reduction (i.e., achieving Hg emission levels of 0.33 to 0.65 mg/dscm). Therefore, the MACT floor for Hg is 0.65 mg/dscm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in section IV.F.1.b of this preamble, the EPA has determined that Hg control is based on three variables: Lower flue gas temperatures in the air pollution control system, high-efficiency PM control (e.g., based on use of an FF or ESP), and a sufficient level of carbon in the fly ash (i.e., based on use of activated carbon injection). Recent testing programs at the MWC plants in Stanislaus County, California, and Camden County, New Jersey, have demonstrated that the combination of an SD/FF or SD/ESP system, activated carbon injection, and low flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet can achieve high Hg control efficiency. The EPA's analysis of this test data has indicated that MWC's equipped with this combination of control technologies could continuously achieve an Hg emission level of either less than 0.080 mg/dscm, corrected to 7 percent O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. Data from individual test runs show occasional spikes of high inlet Hg emissions due to the variability in the waste feed composition. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily elevated, a 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be consistently achievable; however, activated carbon injection could achieve an 85-percent reduction during such episodes. Based on the data from MWC's using activated carbon injection, Hg control to these levels is achievable by properly operated systems on all types of MWC's. Since activated carbon injection is a relatively new technology and has not yet been applied commercially, the 0.080 mg/dscm or 85-percent reduction Hg emission level is not part of the MACT floor. The EPA estimates the cost to add carbon injection to be reasonable, at a cost effectiveness of $1.00/Mg of MSW combusted. Therefore, the EPA is proposing MACT for Hg for MWC's at both small and large MWC plants to be more stringent than the MACT floor, at a level of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions, whichever is least stringent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has selected activated carbon injection as the basis for achieving MACT for Hg, although facilities may use any technology capable of meeting the proposed standard. Of the three Hg control technologies discussed in section IV.F.1.b of this preamble, the EPA has determined that the performance of activated carbon injection is the best demonstrated of the three Hg control technologies in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MACT for Dioxins/Furans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Uncontrolled dioxin/furan emission levels at both small and large MWC plants are, on average, 1,000 ng/dscm, total mass. The best emission control system for controlling dioxin/furan emissions is an SD/FF system and GCP. The EPA's analysis of available test data for dioxin/furan emissions from new MWC's with SD/FF systems and GCP indicates that dioxin/furan emission levels of less than 20 ng/dscm total mass are continuously achievable. Therefore, the MACT floor for dioxins/furans is 20 ng/dscm, which represents a 98-percent reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

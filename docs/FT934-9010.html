			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Change at the stock exchange THE THREE words the new chief executive at the London Stock Exchange said most frequently yesterday were 'I don't know'. In part, they reflect Mr Michael Lawrence's prudent desire, given the three months that will elapse before he takes office, to give no hostages to fortune. In part, they reflect a genuine lack of knowledge about the inner mysteries of the stock market from someone who has spent his career as an accountant and finance director. But most of all they reflect a determination, it would seem, to hold nothing sacred - not the tasks of the exchange itself, nor the structure of its governance, nor whether it has a part to play in providing settlement or any other particular services. Only the exchange's role as the central marketplace is not up for discussion. Such open-mindedness is refreshing: part of the exchange's problem in recent years has been a partisan enthusiasm, shared by outside observers as much as by members and officials, to take sides over individual aspects of the exchange's role. But it is also potentially destabilising: the exchange has gone through at least two agonising reappraisals of its future in the last few years, and the revolving door of senior executives has only recently slowed to a manageable speed. Few could blame staff and market participants from groaning at the thought of another 18 months of 'recasting the exchange's role', as Mr Lawrence put it yesterday, coinciding with the arrival of a new chairman. So though Mr Lawrence must certainly help the exchange to establish the clear vision of its future that has so far escaped it, he must also focus on the day to day. That means getting closer to achieving the excellent service that alone can offer a defence against emerging non-exchange trading systems. It means building the exchange's own new computer trading support system to replace SEAQ, and making its voice heard more clearly in the debates over financial services regulation and corporate governance. Most of all, though, it means holding the ring between the interests of the exchange's own members - brokers and marketmakers - and those of investors and quoted companies. Mr Lawrence says he will enjoy this aspect of his job. Just as well: his predecessor's tenure, cut short by the collapse of the Taurus project, was in any case threatened by disagreements among the exchange's constituencies. Mr Lawrence must manage those relationships better, giving proper weight, despite his time at the top of Britain's largest institutional investor, to the neglected needs of individual share-owners. Without such even-handedness, the new chief executive will be unable to achieve his aim of re-establishing the exchange's leadership in the City. Leadership is earned by deeds, as well as words. Initial ignorance, real or feigned, is no barrier to this - as long as it is accompanied by a willingness to listen and a refusal to take sides.</p>

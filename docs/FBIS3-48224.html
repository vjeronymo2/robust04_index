			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Each company wishing to  take part in the second mobile phone network project has been  given 24 hours to form its own consortium and present a formal  application to the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI).    FKI, which was commissioned by the government to form a  single consortium for the multibillion-dollar project by next  month, had decided Friday to oblige all aspiring companies to  form their own consortia by Saturday to be screened for their  eligibility, a FKI spokesman said.    It made major headway in its responsibility after the  Sunkyong Group, chaired by FKI Chairman Choe Chong-hyon,  announced it was dropping out of the project and would instead  bid for control of the state-run cellular monopoly, Korea Mobile  Telecom, earlier in the week.    The Ssangyong Group followed suit to ease the traffic by  giving up its bid for leading shareholder of the second cellular  network.    Remaining competitors among the six consortia that vied  until  Sunkyong won in August 1992, but returned the license over  alleged political favoritism, are Pohang Iron and Steel Co.,  Kolon Group, Dongbu group, and Tongyang Group.    With Sunkyong and Ssangyong giving up, the competition for  the leading role in the second mobile project narrows down to  Sinsegi Mobile of Posco and Second Mobile of Kolon.    Making all applicants form a new consortium was the best way  to solve the complicated problem of allowing just the four  companies in the project or randomly giving stakes to any  company that wants them, the spokesman said.    Under the decision, the four companies that have long  prepared for the business stand in a very advantageous position  and other firms that wish to have a stake in the new cellular  network will have to join one of the four.    FKI will decide and announce the screening criteria on  Monday.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> The Wrath of Chung: Connie Chung got a little miffed Saturday when the tables  were turned and she was barraged with questions about the glitz factor of her  newly redone interview show on CBS. "You people are so insulting," she told a  roomful of television critics at the Century Plaza.  </P> <P> The reporters were grilling her about the news value of "Face to Face With  Connie Chung," formerly "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," which moves with  its new name to Mondays at 10 p.m. next Monday. Chung insisted that celebrity  interviews were not the driving force of her hourlong program, despite recent  network promotions that highlight the star-side chats. "Look, it's a magazine  program," Chung said, her voice rising. "We're going to have all kinds of  stories." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

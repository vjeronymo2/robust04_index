			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Single transferable voting empowers electorate Sir, Gary Titley MEP is correct in writing that the single transferable vote system strengthens the political 'bosses' (Letters, March 1). Indeed, it strengthens those who should be the real political bosses - the voters. It removes the power of political parties to decide the order of lists, as in some systems of proportional representation, and thus who is elected. The final result of the 1992 Irish general election was delayed for technical and legal reasons arising from recounts. But such delays are rare. With more modern techniques, the counting process could be speeded up. The members of the Plant Commission may well have misled themselves in saying the STV system is 'capricious'. Candidates are only excluded when they have no hope of election. The transfer process carries out precisely what the voters have instructed on the ballot paper. There is a mathematical logic to the procedure. The ultimate result in each constituency is what most voters wanted, and while politicians might not like the outcome, they must accept it. In every STV result one can see a clear link between the votes cast and the outcome. What is more, every MP is accountable to those electing them. STV is a very sensitive system which gives immense power to the voters, which political parties might not be happy for them to have. Representing the voters' interests is surely a quality to be commended in a voting system. STV in practice is as proportional in party political terms as any party list system which does not aggregate votes nationally. Contrary to Mr Titley's view, I would suggest that STV makes for very effective constituency representation because of the direct accountability of every MP. It is telling that the Irish electorate has twice rejected by referendum attempts to abandon STV. E M Syddique, Electoral Reform Society, 6 Chancel Street, London SE1 0UU</p>

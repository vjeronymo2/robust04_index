			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> WHERE THE PROOF IS;  </P> <P> DICKENS NEVER TASTED ANYTHING LIKE THIS PERSIMMON PUDDING  </P> <P> IN COOKING, as in life, looks can be deceiving. Take steamed puddings. Though  they appear complicated, steamed puddings are deceptively easy to prepare,  requiring only patience and a small amount of work. Ingredients are quickly  mixed together, poured into a buttered pudding mold, then steamed. The  delicious concoction that emerges is a moist and elegant dessert bearing little  resemblance to that "speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm" that Charles  Dickens lovingly described in "A Christmas Carol."  </P> <P> Once steamed, the puddings can be served immediately with hard sauce or left to  mellow for several days, sometimes even several months, depending on the  ingredients. With time, flavors merge, which makes a tastier pudding upon  reheating. Steamed puddings also travel well, and they make terrific gifts.  </P> <P> Two types of persimmons are available from October to January--the large,  flaming orange, acorn-shaped Hachiya and the smaller, lighter-colored, tomato-  shaped Fuyu. Hachiyas have a tannic, acrid taste if they are eaten before the  flesh has ripened to a soft, almost mushy consistency. The Fuyus, more delicate  in flavor than the Hachiyas, have a firm, plum-like texture when ripe and are  tannin-free. Both are equally delicious when used in baked goods, especially  this steamed pudding.  </P> <P> The accompanying Rum Butter is also known as hard sauce. It lasts for months in  the refrigerator and also keeps well frozen. The recipe can be doubled and  stored in one-cup containers.  </P> <P> PERSIMMON PUDDING  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons plus 1 1/3 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup mixed dried fruit  </P> <P> 1/3 cup golden raisins  </P> <P> 1/4 cup currants  </P> <P> 1/4 cup brandy  </P> <P> 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 2 large eggs, separated  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups persimmon puree  </P> <P> 1/2 cup half-and-half  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon hot water  </P> <P> 3/4 cup chopped pecans  </P> <P> 1 cup Rum Butter or  </P> <P> 1 cup whipped cream sweetened with 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar  </P> <P> Butter sides and lid of 2-quart pudding mold with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter.  Dust entire mold with 2 tablespoons sugar. Set aside.  </P> <P> Prepare pot for steaming pudding (see below).  </P> <P> Soak dried fruit, raisins and currants in brandy. Sift flour, cinnamon, nutmeg  and salt into small bowl. Set aside. In electric mixer or food processor, cream  remaining butter and sugar with egg yolks, vanilla and lemon juice. Mix in  persimmon puree and half-and-half. Dissolve baking soda in hot water and stir  into persimmon mixture. Stir in sifted ingredients and pecans. In separate  bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Carefully fold into batter. Pour  batter into mold and place lid on top.  </P> <P> Steam on rack over boiling water 2 hours and 20 minutes or until skewer  inserted into pudding comes out almost clean. Remove mold to rack and cool 10  minutes before unmolding or until pudding shrinks away from sides of mold.  </P> <P> Invert onto serving platter.  </P> <P> Serve warm or cold with Rum Butter or sweetened whipped cream. Makes 8  servings.  </P> <P> Rum butter is also known as hard sauce. It lasts for months in the refrigerator  and also freezes very well. You can double the recipe and store it in 1-cup  containers.  </P> <P> RUM BUTTER  </P> <P> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted several times  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  </P> <P> 2-3 tablespoons Jamaican rum or brandy  </P> <P> Beat all ingredients together until light and fluffy. Serve at room temperature  or cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Makes 2 cups.  </P> <P> NOTES: Pudding molds should only be filled 2/3 to 3/4 full so pudding can rise  and expand. Always tap the pudding on counter several times to break up any air  bubbles before tightly securing lid. Use deep, heavy stock ot or spaghetti  cooker that is large enough to allow steam to circulate around whole pudding  mold. Filled mold should rest on small rack, trivet or folded cloth placed on  bottom of pot.  </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (7): There are some flies in the Nafta ointment - Will new foreign investors be wooed if old ones move away? AS the drive towards an integrated North American market gathers pace, Canada's toughest challenge is to hang on to foreign investors with a presence north of the 49th Parallel, and at the same time attract new ones. The elimination of customs duties under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement has led many US companies to look on Canada not as a foreign market with its own branch plants but as a part of their domestic operations. All too often, this has meant closing factories in Canada and serving Canadian customers from giant, low-cost plants south of the border. The trilateral North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which is due to take effect in January 1994, will also pit Canada against Mexico in wooing new investment, especially from the US. Professor Alan Rugman, of the University of Toronto's faculty of management, concluded in a recent paper that the terms of the Nafta bring only 'modest actual gains in terms of a liberalisation of the North American investment regime'. But as Prof Rugman put it, 'American investors considering investments outside the US now have two countries to choose from which both ensure easy trade access to the US market.' Of the three countries, Canada has most to lose. It has a small, widely dispersed market, most of it within easy reach of US factories. High wages make it likely that labour-intensive industries would choose Mexico or the southern US. Canadian business is also burdened by high taxes. According to a recent OECD report, tax revenues have soared from 31.6 per cent of gross domestic product in 1980 to 39.4 per cent in 1991, higher than either Britain or Germany, and well above the US. The Canadians are confident, however, that they have much to offer. Mrs Jean McCloskey, president of Investment Canada, the federal investment promotion and review agency, observes that the relatively high wages, taxes and other costs of operating in Canada do not necessarily mean low profits. Canada's advantages include a skilled workforce, first-rate infrastructure and a sophisticated market, not to mention the public health-care system for which a sizeable chunk of taxes is earmarked. The country's abundant natural resources continue to attract many companies. Several international mining groups, for instance, have recently joined a stampede for diamonds in the Northwest Territories. Foreign investors have also been active buyers of oil and gas properties in western Canada. But Canada's best hope for the future may lie in more sophisticated businesses. Investment Canada has targeted a handful of sectors, including computer software, hazardous waste, marine technology and optics. It is about to add medical devices, telecommunications and water treatment to the list. The agency has identified about 700 Canadian companies in these fields which are interested in joining forces with a foreign partner. Recent successes include a decision by Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, to locate its cellular software development centre in Montreal, in the face of competition from the company's US and Mexican subsidiaries. Plant Genetic Systems of Belgium plans to invest a total of CDollars 10m in Saskatchewan to develop a strain 87. With Canada's unemployment rate at over 11 per cent foreign investors can expect a warm welcome from federal and provincial governments. Interest-free loans smoothed the way for both Ericsson and the UK's Rolls-Royce, which recently decided to produce an industrial version of one of its turbofan aero engines near Montreal. Screening by Investment Canada is now limited to direct purchases of businesses with assets of more than CDollars 5m, or indirect acquisitions (those where ownership of a Canadian business changes as a result of the acquisition of its foreign parent) involving assets of more than CDollars 50m. Under the US-Canada free trade pact, however, the threshold for direct US investors has been raised to CDollars 150m. Indirect acquisitions by US buyers are now usually exempt from review. Indeed, since its formation in 1985, Investment Canada has never turned down a proposal. Nonetheless, foreign investors in some high-profile, politically sensitive sectors need a good deal of agility and patience if their plans are to come to fruition. Foreign control in the 'cultural' sector, which includes publishing, films, broadcasting and music, is especially frowned on. Public opinion  - and thus political decision-making - is also sensitive to foreign involvement in financial services and airlines. The recent experience of Dallas-based American Airlines shows, however, that hard times have softened Canadian attitudes. American ran into stiff opposition from trade unions and politicians when it proposed earlier this year to buy 25 per cent (the maximum allowed by law) in Canadian Airlines International of Calgary. The opposition evaporated, however, when it became clear that the alternatives were either a costly merger for Canadian with Air Canada or bankruptcy. In spite of the improved climate for foreign investment, there are some clouds on the horizon. One is a possible change of government after the federal election to be held next year. The opposition Liberal party has yet to spell out a clear investment policy. Under Mr Pierre Trudeau, the former prime minister, the Liberals spearheaded a plethora of new curbs on foreigners in the 1970s and early 1980s. A group of pragmatists within the party is pushing hard for a less nationalistic platform. Significant new restrictions are unlikely, at least in the early years of a Liberal government. But with Ottawa and the provinces facing growing budget deficits, higher taxes may be on the way, no matter which government is in office.</p>

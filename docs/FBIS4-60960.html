			<p>BFN     [Text] A report was broadcast yesterday by the news program  of the Ostankino television that the situation on the border in  Badakhshan allegedly became tense, which has resulted in clashes  between the border guards and the Tajik opposition fighters from  the other side of the river [in Afghanistan].    According to a report by our correspondent from the  executive  committee of the oblast and the military unit of the border  guards of Badakhshan, this report is groundless and is a mere  lie. In general, such reports could destabilize the situation  and become the source for false rumors. The situation in  Badakhshan and its bordering areas is calm.</p>

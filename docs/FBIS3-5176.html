			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak  reiterated the potential of Thailand in trade and investment  competition as well as that of the Indochinese countries. He  said that Thailand has made progress and enjoyed a 30 percent  increase in its trade surplus.    Speaking about the trend of expanded foreign investment into  the Indochinese market, Suphachai said this is a mechanism of  competition in trade, but the Thai market is still attractive to  investors. Moreover, the deputy minister notes that Thailand  still needs to improve its trade and investment system in order  to be able to compete with other rivals in the future.    [Begin Suphachai recording] In my opinion, among the ASEAN  countries last year, Thailand had a trade surplus with ASEAN  countries for the first time. It had never happened before. You  cannot say we suffer disadvantages with others in ASEAN. It is  impossible. Our export of goods to ASEAN countries increased by  30 percent last year. That was the first such time in history,  and we also enjoyed a trade surplus. It is not the other way  round, I believe. We asked a number of companies why they  transferred their investment into Indochina or China. Is it  because our country is not attractive or because of the  appearance of new markets? Most of them said it is because they  have to compete with other companies in the Chinese market, not  because our market is not competitive enough. They still  continue to invest in our country. Because other companies have  shifted their competition to China or Indochina, they therefore  have to follow suit. We have to consider these points  carefully. Our expansion of exports is second to none. [end  recording]</p>

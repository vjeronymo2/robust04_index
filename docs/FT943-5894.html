			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Seagram climbs 32% to Dollars 224m in second term A strong contribution from 24.5 per cent-owned Du Pont, the US chemicals group, lifted Seagram's second-quarter net profit by 32 per cent to USDollars 224m, or 60 cents a share, from Dollars 170m, or 46 cents, a year earlier. Seagram, one of the world's top three drinks groups, said its revenues from beverage operations rose 2 per cent to USDollars 1.45bn, with good gains at Tropicana, the fast-expanding juice unit, offsetting a modest decline in spirits and wines. Tropicana achieved a 41 per cent share of the US ready-to-serve orange juice market, up from 37 per cent a year earlier. Beverage operating income overall was Dollars 144m, down Dollars 14m, partly due to exchange factors. Latin American markets were weak, especially in Venezuela, but US spirits sales staged a turnround, with a strong contribution from Seagram's new vodka brand. Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, president, estimated that fiscal 1995 spirits and wines operating income will exceed the fiscal 1994 level of Dollars 666m. Seagram's share of Du Pont's unremitted earnings jumped to Dollars 117m, against Dollars 51m, and dividend income was Dollars 77m, compared with Dollars 74m. Du Pont has been reporting higher profits with a strong recovery in chemical prices, especially in the US. Seagram's overall first half earnings were Dollars 346m, or 93 cents, up from Dollars 332m, or 89 cents, a year earlier, while beverage revenues totalled Dollars 2.7bn, up from Dollars 2.6bn. The share of Du Pont profit was Dollars 198m, against Dollars 98m, and dividend income was Dollars 153m, against Dollars 146m. The quarterly dividend is being raised to 15 cents from 14 cents with the September 30 payment. Seagram also owns almost 15 per cent of Time-Warner, the US communications giant.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (2): Targets are being achieved - Profile of Electronics Design and Manufacturing Services A STATEMENT hangs on the reception wall of Electronics Design and Manufacturing Services' purpose-built headquarters at Maldon, Essex. It says simply: 'Our aim is to establish EDMS as a significant force in contract manufacturing, primarily focusing on the needs of multi-technology based companies. We will achieve this by providing a quality manufacturing facility, with a professionally minded, technically capable workforce, and by developing a 'Partnership in Production' with all our customers and suppliers.' EDMS appears to be well on the way to achieving its primary objectives. The company was originally a department within Industrial Control Services, supplying circuit boards for the UK-based international electronic safety systems group which obtained a Stock Exchange listing last year. But it became a separate, fully owned ICS subsidiary in 1986 and has since grown quickly, moving into its custom-built 20,000 sq ft factory in 1990. Today, according to Mr John Reid, EDMS's managing director, only 10-15 per cent of its business comes from the parent company. Although EDMS made a small operating loss in the year to May 31 last year, it has moved back into profit since then. In the first half it made an operating profit and should be profitable at the pre-tax level in the current second half, says Mr Andrew Leeser, group financial director. Contract manufacturing is, it seems, recession proof in terms of volume, but not in terms of margins. EDMS's volumes have doubled in two years from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m this year, reflecting growing interest in contract electronics in its prime computing, industrial, telecommunications, medical and consumer electronics markets. Its customer base includes companies such as Acorn (EDMS produces motherboards for Acorn's educational computers), Reuters, Unicam and British Telecom. It exports its products throughout the UK and Europe where it distributes directly to Reuter's customers. EDMS is a principally a niche player producing 'specialised products in (relatively) small volumes,' says Mr Reid. The service spans the range from prototype and small batch fast-turn around projects to medium volume production. In particular, EDMS has targeted consumer goods manufacturers who are replacing electro-mechanical controls and incorporating sophisticated electronics into their products for the first time. Since they lack the capital equipment or in-house electronics expertise, they represent a prime opportunity for innovative contract electronics manufacturers whose design engineers can work with them and produce electronic controls based on the latest surface mount technology (SMT). Mr Reid sees 'a big growth opportunity' for companies whose core business relies on using SMT. Companies moving from mechanical to electronic controls 'are going straight to SMT', he says. These days EDMS can provide customers with a cad/cam service to lay out cards using the latest surface mount technology. It also has a product engineer who spends one or two days a week with customers helping to design products to ensure that when it comes to manufacturing, 'we have taken out a lot of cost'. Mr Reid, who is due to become chairman of the Association of Contract Electronics manufacturers at this month's Nepcon exhibition in Birmingham, calls this process 'design for manufacturing' or 'cost engineering'. EDMS is now working with three of its customers on new products from design to manufacturing using its fully computerised cad/cam system to support printed circuit board layout. One product is a spectrometer designed in conjunction with a customer which has transferred all its PCB business to EDMS. EDMS is also working with a computer product design house manufacturing a product to its design for the European market in direct competition with Far East imports. To reinforce the 'partnership' between EDMS and its customers a programmes engineer is appointed to each new customer and retains full responsibility for that contract including its commercial, financial, technical and administrative aspects. The recent rapid growth in the business means that EDMS has already outgrown its headquarters building which houses the company's Pounds 500,000 investment in fully automated in-line surface mount capability using Dynapert and Mydata equipment, together with comprehensive in-circuit, functional and temperature stress testing. Unlike big companies which need high volumes to support their heavy capital investment, EDMS's contract volumes are much smaller, but nevertheless often involve highly complex mixed technology boards. So EDMS uses slower, more flexible surface mount machines capable of handling a wide range of components together with a highly skilled workforce which can undertake hand assembly where required. A second 7,000 sq ft building which is being renovated will be used for EDMS's growing board upgrade and repair service and, at the end of last month, the company moved into a third Maldon manufacturing unit dedicated to building complete systems. EDMS has spent Pounds 300,000 on the latest surface mount and test equipment for the 20,000 sq ft factory which will create jobs for 85 people in addition to the 150 already employed by the company. All three facilities are linked and controlled by a computer network which controls all procurement, manufacturing and finance. EDMS chose its location carefully. In the early days of contract manufacturing most customers supplied all the components on a 'consignment' basis. It was therefore important to site the manufacturing facilities close to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to minimise transport costs. However, these days most customers rely upon the contract manufacturer to provide a full service including procurement. Physical location has become much less significant - particularly since most paperwork, and even design work, can be handled electronically using electronic data interchange (edi) systems. Another distinctive feature of today's UK-based contract manufacturers is their commitment to quality standards. For example, all EDMS operations are governed by a company-wide quality management programme and all stages of administration, manufacture and testing are audited to internationally recognised quality standards. EDMS is also working to maintain a high level of customer service. It has opened an office in Grangemouth, Scotland, to support its developing customer base in Scotland and Ireland. In addition, it has launched a sales drive to find business in new niche markets in continental Europe. Mr Reid is very optimistic about the future. 'Britain is the centre in Europe for contract manufacture,' he says, and he is determined that EDMS will play a significant role in the development of European CEM.</p>

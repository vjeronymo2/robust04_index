			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Storehouse upbeat and plans BHS expansion Storehouse is stepping up the expansion of its BHS clothing chain, including extending its franchise network in Spain, Greece and the Middle East. The news came as the retail group, which also includes the Mothercare and Blazer chains, said sales were running 7 per cent ahead of last year, and it expected interim profits from retail operations to be 'comfortably ahead' of last year. Storehouse was upbeat on prospects for trading and growth. Its shares rose 1p to 198p. It said that while sales for the first quarter to July were 5 per cent ahead of last year, the increase for the first half was expected to be 7 per cent, thanks partly to a strong back to school period. Gross margins were being maintained, in spite of increased mark-downs to clear excess stocks of children's clothing at Mothercare. Cost increases were better than budget, although the group said refurbishment of Mothercare stores would lead to higher operating costs and depreciation charges. BHS is accelerating its expansion programme and will increase selling space by 5 per cent this year, and 8 per cent next year. Capital spending will increase from Pounds 46m to Pounds 80m. It is opening three stores during the autumn in Rochdale, Telford and Stirling, and extending other stores. Six openings are scheduled for next year. The group plans six openings in each of the following two years. Some 13 BHS franchises will open this autumn in Spain Greece, Portugal and the Middle East, where they will add to existing operations in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Abu Dhabi. Refurbishment of the Mothercare chain is continuing, with 42 stores, representing a quarter of trading space, now completed. See Lex</p>

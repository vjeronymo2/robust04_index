			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hour for Officers and Men of the South Korean </F> Armed Forces" program: "Which Road Must One Walk Along?"]    [Text] Officers and men of the Armed Forces: As you know,  49 years have passed since the division of our nation. It is  indeed a heartbreaking and intolerable national shame that our  nation, which has lived in harmony with Tangun as the founder,  sharing one blood and creating a 5,000-year history, has been  suffering from national division by outside forces for a long  time.    Thus, in the fifth year of this decade [referring to 1994],  the whole nation is accelerating the grand march of  reunification more than any other time and is upholding the  banner of great national unity. The Kim Yong-sam puppets,  however, who put out the signboard of a civilian government, are  rushing in the opposite direction along the road of treachery  and antireunification.    The rascals have viciously carried out reckless maneuvers  for  a northward aggressive war rupturing all North-South dialogue  and have committed unforgivable serious crimes, such as  trampling the North-South agreement, which was already adopted  and about to come into effect. In the meantime, they are  recklessly running wild to harm fellow countrymen by picking on  us with the nonexistent nuclear issue with outside forces.    This year, traitor Kim Yong-sam is still walking along the  road of treachery and is in the fever of the maneuver for an  aggressive war. The rascals, who have conducted northward  aggressive war exercises every day in various parts of South  Korea since the beginning of the new year, mobilized military  forces of the puppet Capital Defense Command a few days ago and  conducted war exercises day and night three times in areas  adjacent to Mt. Umyon in Seoul, driving residents in fear and  horror by firing guns and shells at random.    Due to such maneuvers of aggressive war of the Kim Yong-sam  puppets, North-South relations are being further aggravated and  more and bigger obstacles are piling up on the road of  reunification, which is the greatest long-cherished desire of  the nation.    Facing the severe situation, officers and men of the Armed  Forces should think deeply when putting their hands on their  breasts. On which road are we walking? What is the road  following Kim Yong-sam, the flunkyist nation-seller second to  none in the world and the most vicious antireunification  element, that you are still walking along?    The more you think, the more you cannot resist the shame of  walking along the road of treachery following the traitor Kim  yong-sam, who trampled the nation's dearly long-cherished desire  of reunification and who is running wild to harm fellow  countrymen with a mouthful of blood.    All people want to spend their youth, the most precious time  of life, valuably. The glory of youth ultimately lies in the  devotion to the country and the nation.    Officers and men of the Armed Forces: The whole nation has  come to vigorously advance along the grand march of  reunification in the nineties. As young men born with the blood  of the Korean nation, you should resolutely part from the Kim  Yong-sam puppets and boldly come out to actively contribute to  the cause of national reunification.    At present, there is no greater devotion to the country and  the people than for Koreans to sacrifice themselves for national  reunification. When officers and men of the Armed Forces  vigorously walk in step with the nation's strong grand march of  reunification, their value of life will shine on and they will  live in endless happiness even after the reunification, amid the  nation's respect and love being highly appraised as the ones who  contributed to the feat of reunification.    When officers and men of the Armed Forces become deeply  conscious of the national duty they are entrusted with and walk  along the road of devotion to the country and the people with  firm unity under the banner of the great national unity, the  greatest long-cherished national desire of the fatherland  reunification will thereby be expedited.</p>

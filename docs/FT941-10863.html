			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Finland's loser is still a winner: Hugh Carnegy assesses the result of the presidential election run-off Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the defeated candidate in Finland's presidential election, discovered on Sunday that standing political convention on its head was not, after all, as easy as the opinion polls had suggested two weeks ago. In the end the solid, if unspectacular, appeal of Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a United Nations diplomat and Social Democrat, overcame the flamboyant challenge by a margin of 53.9 per cent to 46.1. Her natural charm and easy intelligence at one point seemed set to make Mrs Rehn, the defence minister and a member of Finland's small Swedish-speaking minority, the country's first woman president. But Mrs Rehn still achieved a remarkable result which may have further consequences for Finland's political establishment. She demonstrated that after three years of deep recession, when the economy has shrunk by almost 15 per cent, many Finns had become so disillusioned they could be persuaded to vote for a candidate who represented a 6 per cent ethnic minority traditionally viewed with some suspicion by the Finnish majority. Her emergence in the first round of voting ahead of the candidates of the Centre and Conservative parties - the main parties in the coalition of Prime Minister Esko Aho - stunned government and opposition parties alike. The Social Democrats are now favourites to win the general election in March 1995, but all the main parties expect an erosion of traditionally strong voter loyalty, making the outcome more unpredictable. Meanwhile, Mr Ahtisaari may face an uncomfortably warm introduction to office when he takes over, for a six-year term, from President Mauno Koivisto on March 1. By then, Finland - along with fellow applicants Austria, Norway and Sweden - is supposed to complete negotiations on an accession accord with the European Union, clearing the way for a referendum to decide the issue later this year. But the deadline could well be missed as key questions remain unresolved. On the Finnish side, the chief obstacle is Helsinki's demand that its agriculture be treated as a special Nordic category under the Common Agricultural Policy. This demand has been rejected by Brussels, which so far has conceded only that certain areas be afforded subsidies under the Union's regional policy structure. 'We have to have the principle of subsidies for all of Finnish agriculture or we are in big trouble,' a senior Finnish diplomat said. Mr Ahtisaari, a strong supporter of Finnish entry to the EU, said on Sunday he would intervene in the negotiating process once in office 'if need be' - an eventuality which could lead to tension with Mr Aho, whose rurally-based Centre party is split on joining the EU and cannot afford an accession deal which is unpopular with farmers. Mr Aho has already firmly rejected any question of altering the government's tight fiscal policies following Mr Ahtisaari's victory. The new president - who has little formal role in domestic policy - says he wants to persuade the government to adopt more interventionist policies to tackle unemployment, running at almost 20 per cent. But with the economy set to return to modest growth this year, Mr Aho is anxious to curb a budget deficit of around 10 per cent of GDP. He insists that he will stick to his strategy of tight spending limits, market reforms and low interest rates. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

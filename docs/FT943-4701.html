			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Czechoslovak bank raises five-year syndicated loan Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (CSOB), the re-capitalised and restructured former Czechoslovak foreign trade bank, is raising Dollars 50m through a five-year syndicated term loan managed by Sumitomo Bank at a margin of 70 basis points over Libor and with front-end fees of 30 to 35 basis points. The bank, which has been re-organised as a general bank, raised billions of dollars for the former Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in its former role as the monopoly socialist foreign trade bank. The latest borrowing is the bank's first foreign borrowing on its own account, without a state guarantee, but is expected to benefit from syndication among a network of relationship banks. CSOB is one of the few joint Czechoslovak institutions to survive the January 1992 disintegration of Czechoslovakia into the Czech and Slovak republics. Slovakia participated in a series of capital refinancing operations last year and Slovak banks and other institutions retain a 25.6 per cent stake. Czech banks and institutions own 72.75 per cent with the balance held by employees. The bank is scheduled for privatisation. The bank reported a gross profit of Kcs7.8bn last year but made an operating loss of Kcs10.9bn after taking a charge for non-performing loans of Kcs18.7bn. After clearing its books of bad debt the bank received a Kcs4.05bn capital injection, which restored its capital adequacy ratio to 6.49 per cent at the end of 1993. Standard &amp; Poor's recently upgraded the Czech Republic's credit rating, reflecting the growing attraction for foreign investors of the country's low foreign debt and single-digit inflation.</p>

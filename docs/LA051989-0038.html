			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME TO LIGHTEN UP AFTER WEEK OF GRAY DAYS  </P> <P> Relief is in sight for Southern Californians suffering from weather blahs  because of a succession of gray, overcast days and cool temperatures. It's  supposed to be a "very nice weekend."  </P> <P> Meteorologist Patricia Cooper of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for  The Times, expects the improving trend to start today, with mostly sunny skies  and warmer temperatures -- ranging from the upper 60s at the beaches to the 70s  and 80s inland.  </P> <P> There will be a few clouds, according to Cooper, but the marine layer will not  be as deep, and that means clearing skies, at least through most of Sunday.  </P> <P> "By the first of next week, we can see more clouds across the area," Cooper  said. "It's going to be a kind of brief respite, but it should be a very nice  weekend."  </P> <P> The gray days that have aggravated sun lovers so much were the handiwork of a  lingering low-pressure area that is now moving east into the Central Plains,  making way for a high-pressure area over Southern California, Cooper said.  </P> <P> What that means is that, whether you go to the beach, the mountains or desert  this weekend, it should be nice.  </P> <P> The only minor exception will be in the deserts, where gusty winds and blowing  sand are expected today. The gusts are expected to be lighter on Saturday.  </P> <P> Motorists heading into the northern deserts and Owens Valley were advised  Thursday to expect blowing sand and winds up to 45 m.p.h. Drivers of campers  and trailers were warned to use extra caution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low-Pressure Front  </P> <P> The winds were being whipped up by a low-pressure front extending from the  northern Rockies to Nevada and Arizona.  </P> <P> Those heading to Nevada for the weekend can expect temperatures at night to  drop to freezing in some protected areas in the north.  </P> <P> Stay-at-homes can expect lows in the 50s and low 60s in the coastal areas of  Southern California, with temperatures dropping into the mid-30s to mid-40s in  the mountains at night.  </P> <P> Bay Area weekend travelers can expect mostly sunny skies with highs ranging  from the upper 60s to near 80.  </P></p>

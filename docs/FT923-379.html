			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Belgrade and Croatia to hold top-level talks THE YUGOSLAV federal authorities and Croatia agreed yesterday to hold top-level peace talks in Geneva, but the war in Bosnia raged on, dramatised by a bomb attack on a funeral in Sarajevo. The international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, visiting Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav and Serbian leaders, announced that the presidents of Yugoslavia and Croatia had accepted an invitation to open peace talks in the Swiss city tomorrow. President Dobrica Cosic of Yugoslavia and the Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, are to try to reach agreement on the demilitarisation of Prevlaka, a key peninsula on Croatia's southern Adriatic coastline, the mediators said. Mr Vance and Lord Owen, the co-chairmen of the peace process, were on their first visit to Belgrade since Yugoslavia's virtual exclusion from the United Nations last week. Lord Owen, the European Community envoy, said that 'significant progress' had been made on various issues including the opening of Prevlaka and key roads in Croatia. An accord on Prevlaka, currently under the control of the Yugoslav army, would unblock access to Dubrovnik, the Croatian port. He said Yugoslav officials had agreed on the 'desirability of soon opening' the Belgrade-Zagreb motorway, closed since last August. Meanwhile, three people were killed and more than 20 injured when a shell hit a cemetery during a funeral in Sarajevo, Bosnian radio said. The radio blamed Serb irregulars for firing the shell but there was no proof of who was responsible. Doctors at the city's French hospital confirmed casualty figures and said many of those wounded were in a serious condition. The US said yesterday it had new witnesses to corroborate reports that as many as 3,000 Bosnian Moslems were executed at Serbian-run detention camps near the town of Brcko last May-June, Reuter reports from Washington. 'Until recently, nearly all of the reports alleging large scale murders have either come to us second hand, or have contained elements that raise questions about their credibility,' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. But he said the department had recently received two accounts from former prisoners in a brick factory who said they had witnessed the murders and estimated as many as 3,000 were killed. He said some of the dead were later cremated in an animal slaughterhouse.</p>

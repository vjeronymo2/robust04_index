These companies have begun to place orders for goods  from the outside world and to sign contracts with foreign firms.  Some companies, however, do not understand the provisions  formulated by this Ministry on shipping marks for imports and on  the numbers for import contracts, and they have not submitted  the required applications to the relevant department of this  Ministry for shipping-mark codes. This situation has brought  about many difficulties in the work of customs, commercial  inspection, and transportation departments, and also has  seriously hindered the prompt transportation of goods, to the  extent that some cargoes have been piled up at ports and in  warehouses for a long time. As their owners cannot be found,  the cargoes cannot be dispatched, and work has been made very  difficult.    In light of this situation and in order to prevent the  incorrect shipping marks on imported cargoes from affecting  forwarding work, this Ministry reiterates that both the shipping  marks on imports and their contract numbers must be printed  strictly according to our provisions, and that various import  companies and cargo-receiving departments must submit  applications to this Ministry for codes allowing them to run  import businesses and place orders, as well as codes for the  persons to receive imported cargoes.    Various local governments are requested to inspect the  import  companies under their jurisdiction, and if they discover  companies that have not applied to this Ministry for  shipping-mark codes, please urge them to do so.    Please see the annex to this circular for the provisions on  printing shipping marks and contract numbers on imported cargoes.    Annex: Provisions for printing contract numbers and shipping  marks on imported cargoes.    [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade    16 September 1985  <H3>  Annex  Method for Arranging Numbers of Import Contracts and Shipping  Marks  When signing contracts with foreign firms, companies that  operate import businesses should arrange contract numbers and </H3>  shipping marks according to these provisions:    I. Component parts of the number of an import contract and  its shipping mark.    According to prevailing international practice; considering  our country's actual experience over the years in handling  imports and placing orders for goods; and based on the principle  of making things simple, easy, and convenient to check and find;  the following six parts are adopted -- depicted in English  characters and Arabic numerals -- to form contract numbers and  shipping marks.    1. Number for the year in which an order for goods is  placed: Contracts signed in 1985 will be represented by "85,"  and other years will follow the same rule.    2. Code for a company running import business and  placing orders for goods: The import business companies having  permission to directly place orders for goods from the outside  world and to sign contracts with foreign firms will be given  codes exclusively by this Ministry for running import business  and placing goods orders. These codes generally will consist of  three English characters.    3. Code for a unit placing orders for goods (that is,  the consignee who receives imported cargoes): The Ministry will  arrange and issue codes to the consignees of imported cargoes  within the units that place orders for goods. These codes  generally consist of three English characters.    4. Numerals representing commodity categories: Two or  three Arabic numerals will be used to represent the categories  of imported commodities. For details, see the List of Numerals  Representing Categories of Commodities.    5. Codes for cargo-supplying countries: Two English  characters are used to represent each of the countries and  regions that have already established diplomatic relations and  have trade interactions with our country. See the list of codes  for cargo-supplying countries and regions formulated by this  Ministry on 25 August 1989 [date as published].    6. Serial number of contract: This will be decided by  the companies that sign contracts on imports and place orders  for goods, so as to distinguish different contracts.    II. Structure in which the codes of an import contract and  shipping mark are organized.    1. For any contract signed with any country or region,  the codes should be arranged horizontally, and the positions are  as follows:    The first position is the code for the year in which the  order for goods is placed.    The second position is for the code of the company running  the import business and placing the order for goods.    The third position is for the code of the cargoes'  consignee.    The fourth position is for a punctuation code; various  specialized foreign trade corporations and their branches use a  "-" [hyphen] code, other companies use a "/" [slash] code.    The fifth position is for the commodity category code.    The sixth position is for the code for the contract serial  number.    The seventh position is for the code of the cargo-supply  country.    2. Structure for organization of the shipping mark.    The shipping mark is organized into two lines, with the  upper  line representing the serial number of the import contract, and  the lower line representing the English name of the port of  destination of the cargoes as specified by the contract.    For example, in 1985 (code is 85), a certain industrial and  trading company (suppose the code name for it to run import  business and place orders for goods is AA), is entrusted by a  certain order- placing department (suppose the code for the  consignee of the imported cargo is BB), to sign a contract which  is numbered 003 (the serial number of the contract is 003), with  Britain (code name is CE) to order some marine equipment (code  is 382), which will be shipped to the port of Shanghai in China  (English name is Shanghai China) [preceding two words printed in  English]. In this case, the code of the contract should be:  85AABB/382003CE. The shipping mark should be: 85AABB/382003CE.  SHANGHAI CHINA [preceding two words printed in English].    III. Points for Attention    1. To import cargo from any country or region --  regardless of whether the cargo is carried to a port of our  country by sea, land, or air transport; mail; or a combination  of various forms of transport -- when an order for goods is  placed with the outside world, it is necessary to strictly  observe the provisions on the arrangement of the contract code  and shipping mark.    2. When conducting import business negotiations with  visiting foreign trade delegations and businessmen in various  trading companies, at the Guangzhou Trade Fair, or on any other  occasion, and when the commercial organizations, trade  delegations, or purchasing teams sent abroad by our country  negotiate import business with foreign businessmen and sign  agreements and contracts with them, the contract codes and  shipping marks must be made clear, according to the provisions.    3. When various import companies negotiate business  with foreign businessmen, they should make the following issues  clear to the other party, the consignor:    1) When copying loading lists, rail and air waybills,  bills of lading, and various kinds of commercial bills,  completely correct and corresponding shipping marks and contract  numbers must be written down.    2) Regarding the packaging of goods, on two sides of  every packing case, nonfading pigment must be used to paint a  complete shipping mark, which must be clear, noticeable, and not  blurred.

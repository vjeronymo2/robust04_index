			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy believes that to expect concrete actions  from the Russian cabinet "would be madness." He made this  statement at a meeting with his voters in the Schelkovsky  constituency where he was elected to parliament. A party  spokesman in the Duma has quoted him as saying that "the cabinet  is not working and is paralyzed, functionaries just care about  their prosperity."    "The State Duma has no real levers to influence this  government. We are reviewing the situation so that our deputies  and Duma committees can prepare documents for our future  government and there would be no need for it to start everything  from scratch," Zhirinovskiy declared.</p>

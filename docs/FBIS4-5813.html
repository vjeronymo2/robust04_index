			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Japan's crude steel  production fell below 100 million tons in fiscal 1993, ended  March 31, for the second year in a row, the Japan Iron and Steel  Federation said Thursday [14 April].    Japanese steelmakers turned out a total of 97.11 million  tons  of crude steel, a 1.9 percent fall from the previous year and  the smallest volume since fiscal 1986, it said in a report  reflecting the weak national economy.    In March alone, crude steel production fell for the sixth  straight month of year-to-year declines, sliding 9.8 percent  from a year earlier to 7.75 million tons, it said.    The March production volume represents an increase of 7.1  percent from the month before, although March was the fifth  consecutive month in which crude steel output fell below 8  million tons.    Crude steel production is viewed as a key economic  indicator,  as steel products are used for a variety of industrial goods  ranging from autos to machinery.</p>

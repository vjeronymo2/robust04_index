			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Inco cautions on nickel output Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer, expects world supply and demand for the metal to be roughly in balance by the second quarter of this year. However, Mr Michael Sopko, chairman, indicated to the annual meeting in Toronto yesterday that producers may have to cut output further to restore equilibrium. Mr Sopko singled out a continuing surge in exports from Russia, due mainly to a collapse in domestic consumption, for over-supply in world markets. However, he added: 'It is also up to the rest of us in the industry to take responsible action to bring supply and demand into better balance.' He insisted that Inco, which announced production cuts late last year, 'will not shoulder the entire burden'. The company's priorities were 'to drive down costs, improve our competitiveness and defend our market share'. Inco suffered a first-quarter loss of USDollars 60.9m, or 53 cents a share, up from Dollars 23.6m, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dropped to Dollars 523.8m from Dollars 542.8m. The latest losses reflect charges of Dollars 104m to cover the cost of staff cuts and production shutdowns. First-quarter nickel prices averaged Dollars 2.77 a pound, down from Dollars 2.95 a year earlier, but above the Dollars 2.42 realised in the final quarter of 1993. However, the market has weakened again recently in response to the rise in North American interest rates and the collapse in Russian demand. London Metal Exchange stocks have continued to rise. Nickel was trading yesterday on the exchange at about Dollars 2.45. Inco projects a long-term annual growth rate of between 2 and 3 per cent in nickel demand. However, Mr Sopko cautioned that 'there are bound to be ups and downs along the way'. In anticipation of a long-term improvement, the company plans to expand output by about 20 per cent by the end of the decade. Half of this will come from existing facilities. The biggest new project is likely to be a fourth line at 58 per cent-owned PT Inco of Indonesia. Mr Sopko promised 'an even leaner, more assertive Inco.</p>

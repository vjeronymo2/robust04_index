A convoy for the local population will arrive in [Serb-held]  Banja Luka today, as well as another one destined for  [Muslim-held] Zenica. Both have been inspected at the border  crossing [between Croatia and Bosnia] in [former Bosanska]  Gradiska on the river Sava.    As has been reported, the Banja Luka delegation of the ICRC  temporarily suspended aid deliveries following the incident when  an explosive device was planted under an ICRC vehicle [in Banja  Luka] on 17 January this year.</p>

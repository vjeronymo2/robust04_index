			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hazardous waste charge dents Aetna Expected liabilities from the clean-up of hazardous waste sites pushed net income at Aetna, the US insurance group, down 8 per cent in its latest quarter, compared with a year before. Concern that the company may harbour other pollution-related liabilities pushed Aetna's share price down Dollars 4 3/8 , or nearly 8 per cent, to Dollars 51 1/2 , by the close in New York yesterday. Uncertainty about the scale of environmental clean-up costs remains the biggest concern overhanging the US property-casualty insurance industry. The Connecticut-based company said in the three months to the end of June it had set aside additional reserves to cover environmental indemnity claims, resulting in an after-tax charge of Dollars 64m. The unexpected charge led to a Dollars 32m operating loss in Aetna's commercial property/casualty business during the second quarter, compared with a profit of Dollars 25m a year before. The losses were offset in part by advances in life and health insurance businesses, as well as financial services.</p>

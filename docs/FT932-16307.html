			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Investor base raised by installing screens A NUMBER of Europe's electronic derivatives exchanges are hoping to increase their market share and expand their investor base by installing screens overseas. The board of governors of the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German futures and options exchange, voted on Friday to allow foreign institutions without a German subsidiary to join the DTB. The decision still has to be approved by Mr Ernst Welteke, the Hesse economics minister. Last year, he approved plans to allow DTB members' branches outside Germany to install screens. Extra Clearing, a Dutch broking firm with DTB membership through its German subsidiary, is expected to put terminals on line in Amsterdam during the first half of April in the first such link. Meanwhile, Meff, the Spanish futures exchange, last week announced it had applied for status as a designated and recognised investment exchange in the UK. This would allow the exchange to set up Meff trading screens in the UK and so to gain access to London's international market place. The Spanish exchange is also holding discussions with the London Clearing House (LCH), which provides clearing for all London's derivative markets. Meff hopes to be able to offer its members the alternative of clearing through LCH, which would allow them to offset their exposure on Meff contracts against other contracts cleared by LCH. The exchange is also lobbying Spanish authorities to allow non-resident firms to be members of the exchange. The board of governors of the DTB has postponed the planned integration of Frankfurt stock exchange options with DTB options. 'At the moment there is no solution in sight which would cover costs and ensure that the smaller orders of private customers are given equal treatment,' said Mr Jorg Franke, DTB chief executive.</p>

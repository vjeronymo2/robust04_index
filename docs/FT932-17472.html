			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / EC fears link to Italian scandal CONCERN is growing in Brussels that European Community institutions could be dragged into Italy's spreading corruption scandals, following the suicide of a senior EC official and the disappearance of a former official. A senior Italian bureaucrat, formerly in charge of the Community's tobacco-growing subsidy regime, jumped from a window of the offices of the Agriculture Directorate in Brussels two days ago, only weeks ahead of an internal Commission hearing about tobacco fraud. Mr Antonio Quatraro was moved from his post two years ago after he was implicated by the EC's Court of Auditors in fraud involving payments to Italian and Greek tobacco growers and processors for 'phantom' crops. The suicide comes just after the disappearance of a former senior official at the European Parliament, and close aide to Mr Bettino Craxi, the Italian Socialist leader being investigated on multiple charges of corruption in Italy. Mr Mauro Giallombardo, secretary general of the confederation of European socialist parties until 1990 and then on contract as a senior official in the Parliament secretariat general, dropped out of sight after being forced to resign in February. The Italian judicial authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest. Belgium's authorities are understood to be investigating his possible links to the Agusta affair, involving kickbacks paid on Belgium's 1988 purchase of helicopters from the Italian company Agusta. Reports in Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium allege that two subsidiaries of a company called Merchant Italia, set up in Luxembourg by Mr Giallombardo, are being examined as possible conduits for kickbacks. The European Parliament is holding an inquiry into Mr Giallombardo's activities, officials confirmed yesterday. Mr Quatraro was an adviser on international aspects of the EC's common agricultural policy. Brussels police said yesterday they were satisfied it was suicide and were not pursuing inquiries into his death. There is no firm evidence to link Mr Quatraro with the series of Italian corruption scandals. But Commission officials said yesterday they were puzzled that the prospect of a disciplinary hearing should have prompted suicide, when Mr Quatraro probably could have been quietly retired from the Brussels executive without facing criminal charges. Mr Giallombardo, after Italian Socialist pressure, was found a temporary post in the Parliament's secretariat. 'We were totally unaware at the time of his transfer of the nature of the activities he is now accused of,' a senior official in the secretariat general said yesterday. Mr Giallombardo ceased appearing for work from July 1991, the official said. He finally accepted repeated invitations to resign in January this year, after letters had been sent to his Luxembourg address. Italy has a reputation for misusing EC funds, but not necessarily of getting away with it. The Rome government is due to repay the Community some Ecu2.3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) for illicitly exceeding the milk quota fixed under the Common Agricultural Policy. Over Ecu3bn of regional funds earmarked for Italy are being withheld because the European Commission is not satisfied with some of the programmes Italy has put forward.</p>

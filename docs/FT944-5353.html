			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Spare the knife, spoil the view - Gardening / Robin Lane Fox has no time for the leave-it brigade The painter Constable used to say that he had never seen an ugly thing in his life. Perhaps things were easier on the eye in the 18th century: for a start, there were not so many dwarf conifers and no one had learnt how to make flowerpots out of tyres and sell them on the garage forecourt. But there was always winter: not an unusual winter like this one, in which roses are flowering for the third time and even the trailing lobelia is having a second deep-blue childhood, but normal winter - and I have to say that even Constable would have difficulty finding beauty in the sight of a flowerbed that has been hit by frost and then drenched by heavy rain. In the warmth of summer, when anything seems plausible, I listened to a well-known gardening expert explaining that beauty does exist in winter, but that most gardeners shut their eyes to it. From November, we were told, gardens entered their fourth season, alive with the concordant beauty of glowing stems and leaves, sedge greens, chocolate browns and the play of light on fresh cobwebs. Because seeing is believing, we were shown slides to make the point. Under ice-blue skies, a friendly frost had powdered the stems of tall fennel; light filtered artistically through gossamer and the flat heads of the sedums contrasted with yellowing leaves, making all of us feel vandals who hurry to cut down our gardens at this time of year. I like to think I see beauty when it is there, but in early winter, I am one of those who likes to cut the borders flat. Have I been throwing three months of beauty on to bonfires for the past 40 years? Non-cutters have been gaining ground in the past decade. They leave the border standing until March and tell the rest of us what we miss by being too tidy too quickly. Some of the non-cutters speak with conviction, others feel relief at not having to cut down sodden delphiniums on wet weekends between now and Christmas. Is there not a Post-Modernist beauty in doing nothing? The non-cutters are the ones in tune with our over-stretched age. This month, I promised myself that I would give the non-cutters a chance to prove their point and try harder to find beauty in what I see from my window during the winter, but sadly this is a far cry from the slides of hoar-frost on faded salvias under blue skies. Rime is no reason. In real life the rain drips in a thick fog on borders that are full of blackened herbaceous plants. Come off it, Constable; there is real ugliness in the dead growth on tree peonies, tall helianthus and the heavy black leaves on clematis heracleifolia. You may be lucky with the cobwebs, and a few plants do look fetching when they have died and are standing straight in a rare bout of clear winter weather. But for most of the winter, peonies, defunct lupins and blackened thistly echinops look less like an essay in still life and more like an eyesore, much of which does not even make proper compost. The missionary non-cutters, usually flower-arrangers who are looking at gardens for vase-potential, like to see through plants, focusing on a backdrop of sky behind the dead stems of Verbena bonariensis. They gaze upwards, not outwards, like medieval observers who looked skywards into their multi-layered heaven. They are picturing bits of the garden in the hall or in church and they ignore the rest, which is for the most part an ugly blot. I think the reason I do not like to see the garden untended goes deep into my past. I see beauty in an expanse of bare, keen earth, freshly dug and waiting for the frost that will break it up. It looks orderly, monochrome and all the better for human effort. This goes deep into the bedrock of my youth. When I first started to garden, I remember reading a story in which bare, clean earth represented salvation. The story was about the owners of a garden, who lived on the edge of a wood. They had fallen on hard times - even without being members of Lloyd's. The husband had lost his job; the wife used to take in washing, but a laundry had opened nearby and she too had lost her source of income. The couple were left only with their garden and their earnest, 10-year-old son. One evening he solemnly went out and cleared off what nowadays would be considered a flower-arranger's unappreciated Eden of dead growth. He dug the ground from end to end all night and when his parents looked out in the morning, they began to quarrel over his achievement. Father thought the son's exercise had been pointless, because the family could certainly not afford fertiliser, let alone stock for the newly-dug land. The mother, however, thought the boy deserved credit because he had, after all, turned up such a lovely clean expanse of brown soil. I identified strongly with a digger of my own age and instincts and, a few pages later in the story, he had raised enough cabbage and sprouts from seeds to keep the family until the crisis passed and the father, I suppose, could once again bear to look at his Financial Times. You can tell me that there is beauty in an uncut garden this weekend, but actually, I will think that you are being lazy. It takes more than Constable to change the general perception and to persuade me that there is not a greater beauty in the rescuing act of digging, cleaning and turning the ground.</p>

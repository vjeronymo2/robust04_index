			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Salvation Army probe discloses arrest FRAUD SQUAD detectives with the City and Metropolitan Police made one arrest last July in connection with the bank behind the alleged Pounds 6.2m fraud on the Salvation Army, it emerged yesterday. Senior investigators believe they could have made more arrests had police been informed earlier about the fraud. In July police seized documents linking the Islamic Panamerican Bank with an international network dealing in forged letters of credit and in forged bank guarantees. After the arrest and the obtaining of the documents police contacted the FBI and regulatory authorities in the US. This led to Islamic Pan-american Bank being identified as a fictitious bank and a second person, Mr Gamil Naguib, as one of those mainly responsible for it. Both the Islamic Panamerican Bank and Mr Naguib were named in a writ issued by the Salvation Army last month to recover its funds. It was only after this that police were officially asked to investigate the alleged fraud. It has emerged that although Salvation Army officials may have suspected fraud as long ago as last August, they did not contact the police then. One senior investigator, referring to Mr Naguib and others linked to the Islamic Panamerican Bank, said yesterday: 'If the Salvation Army had told us then I think we would have caught them with their pants down.' The importance British police are attaching to the international dimension of the Salvation Army fraud will be underlined this week when senior detectives ask the Crown Prosecution Service for approval to travel abroad in pursuit of fresh informa-tion. It is understood they want to interview officials in Luxembourg and Belgium in connection with the transfer between at least two bank accounts last year of an estimated Dollars 10m of Salvation Army funds. The sum was initially deposited in an account of ASLK-CGER Bank in Antwerp, Belgium. The bulk of these funds is believed to have been transferred to Banque Continentale du Luxembourg subsequently without the knowledge of most of the charity's senior officers. Police now believe that the bulk of the funds has been the subject of theft and may never be recoverable unless further legal action is taken. The latest development in the Salvation Army case comes amid renewed indications that the Serious Fraud Office is interested in becoming involved in the investigation. The Criminal Justice Act allows the SFO to take over from the fraud squad cases of serious and complex fraud usually involving more than Pounds 5m. The Salvation Army had no comment to make last night.</p>

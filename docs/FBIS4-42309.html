			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["bos"-signed report: "Bonn Wants To Speed Up Monetary </F> Union"]    [Text] Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the German  Government will take advantage of Germany's duty presidency of  the European Union [EU] in the second half of 1994 in order to  "take concrete steps toward European Monetary Union."    At a talk with 100 key managers of Brandenburg and Berlin  industry on the subject of Germany's industrial situation,  Rexrodt said that some of Germany's partners are still not happy  about the idea of a single Europe. Nothing can happen, he said,  unless France and Germany reach agreement on some thorny EU  issues. On the other hand, some partner countries have been  complaining about excessively narrow German-French agreements,  according to Rexrodt. "Right now, there is a lack of  initiatives on the subject of the EU's development that would  enjoy the support of most members from the very beginning," said  Rexrodt.    In reply to fears from some of the industrialists concerning  monetary union, Rexrodt pledged that Bonn would reach no hasty  decision on this matter. This is a subject that can only be  dealt with in small steps, he said.    The German Government assumes that its EU partners would not  like to see an instable Deutschmark and are, therefore, willing  to accept some German solutions in their own interests. In the  long run, there is no alternative to a single European currency.    Rexrodt said that the currency issue is directly linked to  the government's efforts to "bring something new" to Europe.  "The united Europe must be more than a league of nations but  less than a federal republic," he said. "If we do not achieve  this kind of Europe, there will be more situations where people  are dying in a terrible war just a few hundred kilometers from  Munich and everyone else is just watching it happen." The  absence of a unified security concept is one of the EU's  greatest shortcomings, according to Rexrodt. Monetary,  economic, and security policy should be viewed closer together.    Rexrodt said he fails to understand the tendency of the  British, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Greeks to restrict East  European countries' access to West European markets. One cannot  expect progress in the economic transformation process if one  deprives the developing East European markets of maneuvering  space, this being a prerequisite for these countries' full EU  membership, he said.    According to Rexrodt, the current EU members are located a  long way away from the East European reform countries and have  little understanding of these countries' dilemma. The Germans  in the middle of Europe should adopt a leading role. An  eastward expansion of the EU can only be performed slowly,  through a process of separate association agreements. It is  important that the east European countries see each step as part  of the general road toward full EU membership, said Rexrodt.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Ulster peace expected to bring Pounds 180m security cuts A saving of Pounds 180m can be expected from cuts in security spending in the next three years following the paramilitary ceasefires in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday. His announcement of a 'cautious peace dividend' will give a boost to the local economy before next week's International Investment Conference in Belfast. The announcement comes only four days before the planned opening talks between British government officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. The savings, which Sir Patrick announced with public spending plans for the province, represent cuts in the compensation paid for bomb and other terrorist damage to property and a planned reduction in the overtime bill of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The savings will be reallocated to the education and health budgets. Spending on law and order, excluding army costs which are carried by the Ministry of Defence, comes to Pounds 889m a year. About Pounds 50m will be saved this year, rising to Pounds 60m in 1996-97 and a further Pounds 70m in 1997-98. RUC overtime currently costs Pounds 82m a year. Overall spending for Northern Ireland over the period is expected to remain fairly constant at Pounds 8bn in real terms. Sir Patrick warned, however, that the measures were contingent on the ceasefire being maintained. He emphasised that RUC staffing numbers would remain the same, and that recent security moves, such as reducing police and army presence on the streets, could be reversed 'within 24 hours'. Sir Patrick said: 'I hope that we are entering a new phase in the history of Northern Ireland. 'Peace, if it is seen to be established, will provide a chance for a fresh start for the people of Northern Ireland who for the first time in 25 years have had the opportunity to experience daily life free from the fear of violence.' Sir Patrick said there had been a 'substantial' number of acceptances of invitations to the investment conference. Invitations went out to all elected MPs and MEPs for the opening dinner. The government said that representatives from the economic committees in Belfast and Londonderry city councils had been invited to the working sessions. Sinn Fein seemed set to boycott the investment conference, however, saying it had been snubbed and demanding treatment equal to that of the other political parties. The row surfaced after it emerged that a full invitation to the dinner had been sent to Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, who is a local councillor and whose party has smaller electoral support than Sinn Fein. Government officials yesterday said the three Belfast Sinn Fein councillors, Mr Mairtin Muilleoir, Mr Joe Austin and Ms Una Gillespie, had initially indicated that they would attend the Wednesday sessions. Yet Sinn Fein said yesterday it was boycotting the conference and the three councillors briefly picketed the offices of the Industrial Development Board, which is organising the conference, saying that they were treated as 'second class citizens'.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Barclays lending officer to leave after shake-up THE BARCLAYS senior executive whose department approved many of the poor loans which led to a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss last year is to leave the bank, it will be announced today. Mr Mark Deverell is leaving as Barclays introduces a new structure to control and balance its lending. The bank's reforms include the breaking-up of the 'central advances department' which Mr Deverell has headed. Barclays said yesterday that Mr Deverell, the 52-year-old director of risk management, had 'agreed to leave'. He is the highest ranking casualty to result from the growth in lending that followed a Pounds 921m rights issue in 1988. Mr Deverell, former chief executive of Barclays' subsidiary in Australia, took over risk management in 1989. The property lending, which contributed to Pounds 1.96bn in UK bad debt provisions last year, rose rapidly in 1989 and 1990. Barclays' management has faced sustained criticism by investors. Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, has announced that Barclays will appoint a new chief executive from outside the bank this year. Mr Alan Brown, the director taking over responsibility for management of lending, said Mr Deverell had set in train the review of loan controls that led to both the breaking-up of his department and the abolition of his post. 'He was one of the people who suggested it, so there is no question of him being a victim. But having helped create the new structure, it removes his job,' said Mr Brown. The bank will disclose its new structure for controlling risk - along with Mr Deverell's departure from May - to its managers today. Mr Brown, 47, formerly chief executive of Barclays in Japan, will take charge in the new post of director of group credit policy. He said he intended to reduce lending to property, construction and hotel companies. He said executives had been too rushed by the growth of loans in the late 1980s to balance the lending properly. Mr Brown disclosed a series of changes in Barclays' structure for assessing loans of more than Pounds 5m, and for ensuring that its lending portfolio is balanced: The central advances department - responsible for both loan approval and portfolio management - will break up. Loans will be approved within banking and investment banking divisions. Mr Brown will head a new credit policy unit that will be responsible for balancing lending, and ensuring the bank is not over-exposed in risky sectors. Loans of more than Pounds 5m will each be assigned to a single executive. He or she will be responsible for making sure Barclays' risk is contained.

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids and mergers The big news this week in the bids and deals arena has to be the proposal to merge the merchant banks, SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley, to create a global investment group. The deal, if it goes through, would be the most significant transatlantic merger the investment industry has ever seen. The banks were forced to make an announcement on Thursday, after rumours in the London market drove up Warburg's share price. On the surface, the synergies seem obvious. Warburg has a modest presence in the US capital markets, while Morgan Stanley is one of the leading Wall Street houses. In London, Morgan Stanley would benefit from Warburg's strong client list and trading position in the UK and on the Continent. However, there is always the possibility that the merger plans could fall apart. Particularly if disrupted by a counter bid from another institution. Meanwhile, both bids in the on-going battle between British Aerospace and GEC for the submarine maker VSEL were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission by the trade secretary Michael Heseltine on Wednesday. The move stunned the stock market. VSEL's shares fell from 1535p to 1338p on the week as the battle went on hold. Mr Heseltine kicked the increasingly contentious bids into touch after the Office of Fair Trading recommended GEC be referred because it owns the competing warship yard at Yarrow on the Clyde. BAe was referred on the rather ill-defined grounds of 'national security'. Sending both to the MMC avoids a nasty choice between over-ruling the OFT and not referring GEC on competition grounds, and upsetting GEC by referring its bid alone and allowing BAe to win by default. It was widely seen as the government opting for the easy way out. The MMC has been given until March 15 to report, and so both bids have now technically lapsed. BAe has said it will continue with the fight, GEC is currently deciding whether it wishes to go ahead. Most analysts expect that the bids will eventually be cleared, though GEC may have to give undertakings about the future of both yards. Since VSEL is almost certain to be taken over by one company or the other for at least the previously offered Pounds 14, the shares are not likely to fall much further. Meanwhile, VSEL shareholders and employees will have to wait to know their fate. Finally, Portals, the security paper manufacturer, was this week forced by a sharp rise in its share price to reveal that De La Rue, the banknote printer, was again in bid talks with the company. Seven months ago, the two groups called off bid talks, after failing to reach agreement following an approach by De La Rue. This time round, De La Rue has said it would not make a hostile bid without the agreement of Portals board and emphasised the close commercial relationship between the two companies.</p>

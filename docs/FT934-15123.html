			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble optimistic PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US household products and foods group, expects to report record first-quarter unit volume and earnings, Reuter reports from Cincinnati. Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, told the annual meeting that the company had absorbed less favourable foreign currency exchange rates. Without these effects, first-quarter earning would be well ahead of the company's average growth rate in 1992-93. Even after these effects, which have affected most US companies, the company would still report a substantial year-on-year profit increase, Mr Artzt said. Procter &amp; Gamble's worldwide unit volume growth in the first quarter was 6 per cent, excluding discontinued pulp and orange juice operations. Mr Artzt cited improved US business as a key to the results. He also said the company's globalisation strategy was paying off and he expected the company's international share to reach 60 per cent of world sales by the year 2000. He added that there was real momentum in the business, especially in the US, where shipments were up 6 per cent during the past six months. In addition, cash flow from operations reached a record Dollars 3.3bn. During 1992-93, the company's worldwide unit volume grew 4 per cent. Mr Artzt said he expected the company's stock to appreciate in line with future earnings growth. The shares closed yesterday at Dollars 50 3/8, up Dollars 5/8.</p>

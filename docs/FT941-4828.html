			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Brazilian miner launches ADRs Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the government-controlled mining company and the world's largest iron ore exporter, yesterday launched an American depositary receipts (ADR) programme on the US over-the-counter market. The company said the Level 1 programme was the first step towards a Level 3 ADR issue, which would involve an increase in capital and listing on a US stock exchange, but imposed much stricter accounting requirements. Under yesterday's operation, each ADR represents 250 CVRD preferred shares, which have limited voting rights. CVRD is Brazil's largest exporter, with net sales of Dollars 2.45bn last year. Its share price increased 162 per cent in dollar terms in 1993 and has grown by 43 per cent this year, helped by a very strong local market. Morgan Guaranty Trust, a subsidiary of J. P. Morgan, is acting as sponsor. Sakura Bank, a leading Japanese bank, has announced that it will issue Y100bn (Dollars 945m) in convertible preferred stock to boost its capital levels, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. It will be the first Japanese bank to issue preferred stock since the finance ministry eased restrictions on capital-raising programmes using the instruments last year. The bank said its capital-to-assets ratio would rise by 0.5 percentage points to 9.6 per cent after the issue, which would enable it to expand its balance sheet by increasing lending.</p>

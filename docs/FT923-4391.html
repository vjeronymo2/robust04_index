			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Athens wins praise for narrowing gap GREECE was given a gentle pat on the back by the European Commission at the weekend for its attempts to narrow the economic gap with the rest of the European Community. EC finance ministers meeting in Bath - preoccupied with the tension in the European monetary system - were able only to glance at a report on the Greek economy. But Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC commissioner for economic affairs, said afterwards that the Community had seen 'clear progress during the last few months' as Greece laboured to meet economic convergence targets set by the Maastricht treaty. Mr Christophersen said he expected Greece's convergence programme to be discussed by finance ministers at a formal meeting in October or November. The Commission's comments are particularly heartening for Greece coming just two days after a critical report on the country's economy by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD said Greece would have to apply its economic adjustment programme much more rigorously to curb tax evasion and improve efficiency in the public sector. Mr Stefanos Manos, the Greek finance minister, said at the weekend that Greece had been 'working very hard' to recover from the economic problems of the 1980s.</p>

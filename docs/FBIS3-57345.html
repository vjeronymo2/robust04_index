			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 25 Jan -- An IBERIA correspondent has  learned that Hamlet Chipashvili, head of the Georgian  parliamentary staff, has been released from his duties on the  orders of Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgian head of state. He is  blamed for failing to promptly make available the full text of  the Geneva communique to parliamentary members.    The parliamentary opposition regards this as the head of  state's political retaliation against parliamentary vice speaker  Rusudan Beridze, who oversees the work of the staff.    Similar statements were made by the Republicans and Charter  91, who are Ilya Chavchavadze Association factions. The  parliamentary majority, in fact, agreed with the decision of the  head of state and the parliamentary speaker on releasing Hamlet  Chipashvili from his duties.</p>

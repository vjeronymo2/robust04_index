			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: SEP to boost dividend SEP Industrial Holdings, a manufacturer and distributor of engineering products, raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 319,000 to Pounds 378,000 in the half year to March 31. Reflecting that improvement, directors of this USM-quoted company intend to lift the dividend from 0.2p to not less than 0.65p and have declared an interim of 0.3p. Turnover came to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 26.2m). Comparisons included Pounds 13.5m sales and Pounds 123,000 profit attributable to Combori Group and American Socket Screw Manufacturing. Earnings per share were 0.7p (0.26p). Mr Paul Formby, chairman and chief executive, said the reorganisation reduced gearing and SEP was producing significantly improved results even before the recession ended. The better half year reflected an improved contribution from distribution, which was expected to continue. Acquisition of Huntingdon Fastener further increased market share. Activity in manufacturing remained subdued throughout the period but 'we are starting to see the first tentative signs of a recovery'.</p>

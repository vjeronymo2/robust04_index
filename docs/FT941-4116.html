			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forte speculation There was further strong speculation that Forte may be about to announce the purchase of the French-owned hotel chain Meridien after a French news agency reported the two sides were in discussions. Air France, which owns a majority stake in the 53-strong chain, is said to be entertaining offers with several other international hotel groups said to have expressed an interest. The rumour helped depress Forte's share price as the market fretted over the possibility of a rights issue. They closed off 9 at 255p with turnover a lowly 2.2m. However, analysts pointed out that a large proportion of Meridien's hotels are operated on management contracts, with the equity being owned by outside investors, a fact that would reduce the price of any prospective deal. Should Forte emerge as the buyer of Meridien, it would go some way to making up for the disappointment of losing the deal for Ciga, the luxury Italian chain, last month.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea recorded  negative economic growth for the fourth consecutive year in  1993, a Bank of Korea (BOK) report said Friday.    The report, titled "The Estimated Gross National Product  (GNP) of North Korea in 1993," presumed that the North's GNP  last year fell to 20.5 billion dollars from the previous year's  21.1 billion dollars.    The BOK report put North Korea's estimated economic growth  rate at minus 4.3 percent last year compared with the previous  year. Its estimated economic growth rates were minus 3.7  percent in 1990, minus 5.2 percent in 1991 and minus 7.6 percent  in 1992.    North Korea's per capita GNP fell to 904 dollars last year  from 943 dollars in 1992 while total foreign trade nosedived to  2.64 billion dollars last year from 4.8 billion dollars in 1989,  a 55-percent decrease over four years, according to the report.    In contrast, South Korea's GNP was 328.7 billion dollars  last  year, 16 times that of North Korea, and the South's per capita  GNP came to 7,466 dollars, 8.3 times that of the North.    The North's total trade volume of 2.64 billion dollars last  year, 1.02 billion dollars in exports and 1.62 billion dollars  in imports, was a mere 1.6 percent of the South's 166.04 billion  dollars in trading volume.    North Korea spent 5,620 million dollars on building up its  military last year while the South spent 11.92 billion dollars.    North Korea posted minus 9.7 percent economic growth in the  construction sector last year, minus 8.7 percent in electricity,  gas and tap water, minus 7.6 percent in agro-fisheries, minus  7.2 percent in mining and minus 4.2 percent in heavy industries.    The North's light and service industries, however, showed  5.0  percent and 1.2 percent growth rates, respectively.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Observer: Tyreless Horst Urban is a hard man to keep down. Uncowed by his forced departure from Germany's Continental tyre giant last May, when it was trying to fend off the advances of Italy's Pirelli, he is carving out a new career as a management guru. After a brief stint at the Treuhand privatisation agency in Berlin, the 55-year-old Urban has popped up as a senior management consultant with Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance where he will advise companies on strategy and operational tactics. Not surprisingly, he feels vindicated by events at Conti, where Pirelli beat a humiliating retreat. It was mainly his robust defence of Conti's independence that led to his exit after disagreements with the supervisory board. He did not see eye-to-eye with the mighty Deutsche Bank, one of whose directors, Ulrich Weiss, heads that board. So he is glad his new activities will not put him under the thumb of any bank. Hiding any bitterness well, his only aside is that he is 'not alone in thinking the banks have too exaggerated a role on the supervisory boards of German companies.' Weiss, for example, is also a non-executive director of Volkswagen and Fiat, as well as being responsible for Deutsche's activities in Italy.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / New Brazilian finance chief sticks to plan: Minister promises continuing anti-inflation policy but stock and bond markets slip The Brazilian government yesterday tried to assure domestic and international observers that the country's latest anti-inflation plan remained on course, despite the weekend resignation of Mr Rubens Ricupero as finance minister. Worries over the resignation and the possibility that it would affect the presidential election chances of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the government's candidate, led to the Sao Paulo stock market closing 10.5 per cent down yesterday, from the Friday close, and to falls for Brazilian bonds on international markets. The new minister, Mr Ciro Gomes, met President Itamar Franco yesterday and said the present anti-inflation plan - with its main component, a new currency called the Real - would not be changed. Mr Gomes stressed that the team of economists which has overseen the Real's introduction would stay at the ministry. Mr Gomes, the governor of Brazil's poor north-eastern state of Ceara until his new appointment, said the resignation of Mr Ricupero was the result of 'lamentably bad luck'. The latter had quit after his private comments were broadcast by mistake on satellite TV. He said he had no scruples about the government using the anti-inflation plan to help its candidate in the presidential election next month. Advisers to Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, presidential candidate of the left-wing Workers' Party and Mr Cardoso's main opponent, said they would appeal to the electoral court, claiming unfair government support for Mr Cardoso. Mr Orestes Quercia, another candidate, demanded that the court disqualify Mr Cardoso. This is seen as very unlikely. Mr Cardoso, who is leading in the latest opinion polls by 45 per cent to Mr da Silva's 23 per cent, tried to brush off the incident. In an election broadcast on Sunday night, he emphasised the Real plan, which has cut monthly inflation from 50 per cent earlier this year to less than 5 per cent. The price of dollar-denominated Brady bonds - bank loans repackaged as bonds, which form the largest part of the Brazilian bond market - yesterday fell by more than two points before recovering slightly in later trade. The US markets were closed for a holiday so most of the trade took place in London, with some in Brazil and Argentina. 'The other main presidential candidate (Mr da Silva) is seen by investors as more inflationary, and that is worrying the market,' said Miss Ingrid Iversen, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell in London.

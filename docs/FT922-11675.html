			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Anglo Irish Bankcorp and Hill Samuel end sale talks ANGLO IRISH Bankcorp and Hill Samuel Bank have terminated negotiations on the proposed purchase by Anglo of Hill Samuel Bank (Ireland), after failing to agree detailed terms and conditions during negotiations following the completion of their due diligence process. The two sides announced agreement in principle on the deal on December 24 last year. Three weeks earlier, Anglo had raised IPounds 26m on a rights issue. Mr Sean FitzPatrick, Anglo's chief executive, said yesterday that the deal failed because Anglo was unwilling to pay the minimum price sought by Hill Samuel, part of the TSB Group. 'The gap between us got closer as negotiations went on but our final ceiling price was below their floor price at the end,' he said. The difference between the parties when negotiations were terminated could be as much as IPounds 10m (Pounds 9.2m). Mr FitzPatrick said yesterday that the bank was pressing Mr John Clegg, a former non-executive director and ex-chief executive of Wace, to dispose of his family's 15 per cent stake and that prospective buyers had been arranged. He said the Clegg family was not willing to sell because to do so may be interpreted as an admission that the rumours linking Wace with the IRA were true.</p>

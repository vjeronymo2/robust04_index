			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Books: A place in the Gothic heights - Alannah Hopkin considers Angela Carter / Fiction AMERICAN GHOSTS AND OLD WORLD WONDERS by Angela Carter Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 13.99, 146 pages OPERATION SHYLOCK by Philip Roth Cape Pounds 14.99, 398 pages AMONG the few writers of English Gothica Angela Carter must rank high. She made the difficult transition from the impecunious life of the experimental novelist to that of a writer who received enormous respect and acclaim from her colleagues while also commanding decent sales, before her life was cut short last year by cancer at the age of 52. A line from Freud quoted in one of these pieces could well serve as her motto: 'Reason becomes the enemy which withholds from us so many possibilities of pleasure.' Highly intelligent and erudite, she fought hard to reconcile her intellect and her imagination. It is the struggle between these two faculties that characterises her work. She is perhaps best known for The Bloody Chamber, her wild Freudian versions of traditional fairy tales, one of which was filmed as The Silence of the Wolves. The nine pieces assembled here represent various aspects of a quirky talent, but they are not among her best work. Compared to the exuberance of her accomplished 1985 collection Black Venus, these are rather thin and tentative. a 'Lizzie's Tiger', one of the few conventional 'stories', is a prelude in a minor key to 'The Fall River Axe Murders'. Carter's unforgettable account of the day that 'Lizzie Borden with an axe/gave her father forty whacks' which appeared in Black Venus. Sometimes in this first section there is an odd feeling that one is reading a pastiche of Angela Carter rather than the real thing. The five 'Old World Wonders' are more interesting, and typically unclassifiable. A lightly humorous piece,'The Ghostships', describes the unforeseen problems when the early Puritan settlers of Massachusetts attempt to ban Christmas. 'Ashputtle or The Mother's Ghost' offers three versions of the Cinderella story, each more beguiling than the last. 'Alice in Prague' is a baffling tribute to a Czech film animator, verging on the incomprehensible, but still able to delight in its inventiveness. The latest novel by Philip Roth (of Portnoy's Complaint fame), Operation Shylock, is like a long and very bad Woody Allen movie, a simile which would not amuse the illustrious author. Besides sharing an American Jewish background, Allen and PR are both neurotically self-obsessed and given to manic behaviour, long-winded arguments and feeble jokes. Roth's joke is to state in the Preface that this book is 'as accurate an account as I am able to give of actual occurrences ..that culminated, early in 1988, in my agreeing to undertake an intelligence gathering operation for Israel's foreign intelligence service, the Mossad' The punchline comes at the end: a Note to the Reader beginning 'This book is a work of fiction . . .' If the 398 pages between these two claims had been either credible or faintly amusing it would have made a better joke. As it stands it is no laughing matter. We are asked to believe that a Philip Roth doppelganger turns up in Jerusalem campaigning for 'Diasporism' - the return of Ashkenazi Jews to their European countries of origin, which would lead to the liberation of occupied territory by reducing Israel's population. Roth fears that the existence of his double is a recurrence of old depressive symptoms. However, when a job for the New York Times takes him to Jerusalem he comes face to face with his 'other'. The complications caused by the two being in the same city are of course mighty, and given the state of Arab-Israeli relations in 1988 also potentially dangerous. 'Existence is surely a debate . . .' goes the epigraph from gloomy Kierkegaard and so is this novel. Arguments about Jewish identity, Israeli aggression, the rights of the Palestinians, anti-semitism, and so on, are expounded relentlessly at full volume. The effect is exhausting: like being buttonholed by a bore. This is a pity because on those rare occasions when Roth is not arguing, he manages some crackling descriptive prose which reminds one of how good he can be.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS A-PLANT HAS THIRD EMERGENCY IN 4 MONTHS  </P> <P> The Comanche Peak nuclear power plant experienced its third "unusual event" in  four months with the release of non-radioactive steam into the atmosphere,  utility officials said.  </P> <P> Steam was released late Monday from the only operable reactor in the  twin-reactor plant when a steam relief valve apparently malfunctioned and  opened too wide.  </P> <P> An "unusual event" is the lowest of four categories of emergencies defined by  regulators. There never was a threat to the public, a plant spokesman said.  </P></p>

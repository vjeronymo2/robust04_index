			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: 'Angels' on Broadway - Karen Fricker talks to Tony Kushner about his play NEARLY TWO weeks after its opening at the Walter Kerr Theatre, Angels in America: Millennium Approaches has every look of a Broadway hit. The first part of Tony Kushner's freewheeling seven-hour-long play about gay life, AIDS, Reagan-era politics, Mormonism, and Roy Cohn (the second half, Perestroika, is scheduled to open in the autumn and to run in repertory with Millennium) opened with over Dollars 1 million in advance ticket sales - a very high figure for a non-musical. The production was dogged with technical problems in the final weeks before it opened, but Kushner's being awarded the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Millennium on the day of its first preview surely boosted company morale. The reviews were excellent, and, most importantly for business, the New York Times' Frank Rich, who reviewed the play favourably in its two previous major productions at London's Royal National Theatre in early 1992 and at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles last November, gave it a rave. This week Millennium was nominated for nine Tony (Broadway theatre) awards, more than any other play in Tony history, including nominations for best play and best director, George C. Wolfe. This strong reception, fed by and fuelling the kind of hype that only American popular culture can provide, and little competition in an otherwise bleak Broadway season, has made Millennium essential viewing for New Yorkers. 'I never thought I would write anything that would go to Broadway,' Kushner said this week. 'and it was never terribly important to me to do so. But when the opportunity presented itself to take Angels to Broadway, I wondered if I'd ever get another chance.' The playwright, who is 34, was talking about the decision he faced late last year after Angels' Los Angeles opening. This production was originally slated to transfer intact from the Mark Taper Forum to the Public Theatre, the flagship house of the not-for-profit New York Shakespeare Festival, and then, perhaps, move on to Broadway. Critical reaction in Los Angeles - ecstatic about the play (though most suggested that Perestroika wanted rewriting), but not about Oskar Eustis' production - meant that whatever its course, Angels would have a new director and design team. Kushner returned to New York to find the power barons of commercial theatre falling over themselves to produce his play on Broadway. But it was important to him that the play be accessible to the gay and downtown theatre communities that had nurtured him, and several advisers urged him to stick with his original plan, to work out Perestroika's kinks and to gain momentum downtown. But the play's technical challenges could better be answered on a Broadway stage and with a Broadway budget than at the Public, and the wider audience that Kushner could reach on Broadway beckoned. The earliest any production could open would be May, so that a transfer uptown from the Public could not happen until early summer, missing this year's Tony Award deadline: box office suicide. In the current glow of his success, what Kushner decided looks like the obvious choice, but at the time it was an act of chutzpah inviting hubris. Many of the play's defining characteristics - it is long, political, about serious subjects, and loved by the intelligentsia - are thought to be commercial audience repellents. 'I thought it would be fun,' says Kushner, 'to take a risk.' He accepted the Jujamcyn Organization's offer of its Walter Kerr Theatre, a relatively intimate space that he felt best suited the play. It was soon announced that Wolfe, the young African-American theatrical auteur who wrote and directed last year's Broadway musical hit Jelly's Last Jam, would direct. And New York has not stopped hearing about the play since. That his risk paid off is due, at least in part, Kushner thinks, to recent changes in America's social and political climate. 'We are in the middle of an historic transformation for gays and lesbians in this country. People are seeing Angels on Broadway as a harbinger of that, or, as a symptom of it, if it's something they don't approve of.' Though Angels opened big, it still faces its greatest challenge: staying big. When the rush of ticket sales after the Tony Awards (which it is bound to sweep) has died down, will Angels be a success with tourist audiences and theatre parties? 'The biggest gratification right now is that we've done something that defies the conventional wisdom that big, daring political plays can't play on Broadway,' says Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum/Center Theatre Group which is one of Angels Broadway producers, 'but that's not to say that we are out of the woods yet. Once we get past this initial surge we have to get to a much wider audience.' Kushner agrees: 'We still have to prove that there is a real audience for this show and that it can work as a popular event.' It is certainly not a show that is going to make a fortune for its producers. Not only is it expensive to mount and keep running, but it will cut back to four performances a week in August and September while the company rehearses Perestroika. Kushner's insistence that there be low-price tickets available at every performance - his way of assuring accessibility to the downtown community - and the dollar per ticket that is donated to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, also cut into profits. Kushner surveys his ever-expanding kingdom with exhaustion: 'There was a production of Angels in Sydney that's now running in Tel Aviv, and there are productions planned in Japan, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, France, and . . . other places. The play's going to have a new life in this country in regional theatres and in amateur and college productions, and I'm excited about that. I hope that the life of this play will go on and on, but this part of it, which has been the most extended and difficult project of my life, will come to an end when Perestroika opens in the fall in New York and London (at the National, where it will run in repertory with Millennium, both directed by Declan Donnellan). I hope I get it right this time because if I don't I just can't go back and fix it. I have to move on. I can't keep writing Angels in America all my life.'</p>

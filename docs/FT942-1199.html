			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Hollick urges new media watchdog Lord Hollick, managing dir-ector of MAI, the broadcasting and financial services group, yesterday called for the creation of a new watchdog to be responsible for ITV, the BBC and other broadcasters. The Labour peer whose company controls ITV companies Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television told a London conference yesterday that governments could and should regulate the market in which the media will develop. He said a broadcasting watchdog should be responsible for standards, complaints and finances. He said at a conference organised by The Voice of the Listener and Viewer, the pressure group, that the idea of a media monopoly had to be redefined to cover all forms of media and called for a more effective and coherent government policy. He argued that an element of public service obligation should apply to all terrestrial, satellite and cable broadcasters 'to promote both programme diversity and domestic production'. He said he wanted to 'maintain ITV's public service obligations, the positive programme requirements in the Broadcasting Act and the capacity to meet them'.</p>

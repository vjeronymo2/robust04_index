			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: PizzaExpress at Pounds 1.42m and continues expansion PIZZAEXPRESS sold more than 3m of its upmarket pizzas in the 134 days between coming to the market via a reverse takeover in February and its June 30 year end, helping the company to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 119,000 to Pounds 1.42m for the year. In spite of improved earnings per share of 4.7p (1.9p), the board is not recommending a final dividend as promised at the time of flotation because High Court permission to dip into reserves came too late. Instead, in November, the board is to pay a first interim dividend of 0.5p for the six months to February next year, and is likely to pay another at that stage. Turnover rose from Pounds 7.33m to Pounds 15.7m. Mr Peter Boizot, founder of PizzaExpress and now non-executive chairman, said: 'It's not surprising the company's done well since it's come from a good base.' The pizza and distribution business achieved sales of Pounds 8.22m in the 4 1/2 months since its acquisition by Star Computer, with computing, which the company has now sold, having turnover of Pounds 7.51m. The company, which owns 29 restaurants and franchises 41, aims to fund up to 10 new pizzerias annually, and plans to own half the outlets. Mr David Page, managing director, said the company was 'absolutely committed' to the 'quality and value' of its pizza. Some suppliers had been changed but only where quality was held and price improved. Mr Boizot said: 'I don't think they have moved that many suppliers. They have changed a rather splendid and unique wine that we had into one that is a little more popular. Maybe that's what pizza eaters want.' Trading in company restaurants had been strong, Mr Page said, with sales up about 8 per cent in the February to August period with both increased customer volume and expenditure per head. There had been a similar pattern in the franchised restaurants. That improvement had also benefited the wholesale and beer importing divisions. Net interest received fell to Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 32,000). The group has no debt following a rights issue at the time of the flotation and at the year end had net cash of Pounds 2.4m. Since June 30 the restaurants and distribution company has exchanged contracts for the sale of the computer business for Pounds 2.23m including the repayment of Pounds 1.73m inter-company debt. PizzaExpress will receive Pounds 100,000 in cash and hold 20 per cent of the new company, valued at Pounds 400,000, which will retain a three-year buy-back option.</p>

Past CV studies have used different methods to elicit values, including open-ended WTP questions; bidding cards; and voting formats typically termed ``referenda.'' The Department believes that selection of a choice mechanism should be left to the discretion of trustee officials, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that the current state of the art shows many advantages for using a voting format as the choice mechanism for CV surveys in natural resource damage assessments. Therefore, if trustee officials select a choice mechanism other than a voting format, they should document the factors that led them to reject a voting format. Nevertheless, the Department solicits comments regarding the incentive compatibility of alternative choice mechanisms and whether the final regulation or its preamble should state a preference for the voting format. The Department also solicits comments regarding the administrative and analytical costs associated with alternative choice mechanisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that the method of elicitation should be one with which people are familiar and one which provides a realistic context in which respondents can choose to increase levels of public goods. Local jurisdictions and State governments often ask voters to increase taxes on themselves so that public goods may be increased (e.g., school bond issues; special assessments for public infrastructure). Second, in our society, most goods are offered using posted prices. Asking an individual to reveal his or her maximum WTP for a good is both unfamiliar and unrealistic. Third, it is important that respondents believe that they will receive the program offered in the CV survey. To CV respondents, the cost of the program naturally determines the price they must pay. If no set price is offered, the respondents may perceive uncertainty regarding the program's costs and, therefore, uncertainty regarding the provision of the program. Finally, the voting format is incentive compatible. Respondents must reveal their preference and vote for the program if they desire the program at the stated price. Voting against or refusing to vote will only lower the probability of obtaining the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Survey Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The most carefully designed CV survey can produce unreliable results if the survey administration is faulty. NOAA has proposed several standards for survey administration. The Department solicits comment on whether the same standards should be included in the Department's type B rule. NOAA's proposed rule language, which the Department is considering for its type B rule, is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Survey administration_(A) Sampling procedures. (1) The trustee(s) shall determine the relevant population(s) to be sampled and document the rationale for that determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The trustee(s) shall draw a probability sample(s) from the target population for the administration of the final survey. Less rigorous sampling is suitable for pretesting and pilot surveys so long as the heterogeneity of the target population is considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The sample size(s) shall be sufficient to draw statistically significant population inferences and to estimate WTP valuation functions or to test relevant statistical hypotheses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The trustee(s) shall minimize nonresponse bias to the extent practicable by striving for as high a response rate in the final survey as possible, consistent with the requirements of reasonable cost. In no case shall the response rate be less than seventy percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected response rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Mode of administration. (1) The trustee(s) shall document the rationale for the selected mode of survey administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If interviewers are used, the survey administration shall be conducted by trained interviewers who are supervised by experienced interviewer field managers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Regardless of the mode of administration, the trustee(s) shall use an experienced survey research organization to administer the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

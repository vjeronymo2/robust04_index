			<p>BFN     [Text] A Pyongyang report meeting to mark the 21st  anniversary of the publication of "Let Us Prevent a National  Partition and Reunify the Country," a historic work of Comrade  Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and our people, was  held in the People's Hall of Culture on the afternoon of 22 June.    Portraits of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and of  dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il were respectfully placed in the  front of the hall.    Slogans reading "Long live the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song!" and "Long live the glorious Workers Party of Korea  [WPK]!" were hung in the hall.    The meeting was attended by Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of  the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice  president; Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, alternate member of the  Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and chairman of  the Supreme People's Assembly [SPA]; Chang Chol, vice premier of  the Administration Council and minister of culture and art; Yu  Mi-yong, chairman of the Central Committee of Chondoist Chongu  Party; Kang Hyon-su, responsible secretary of Pyongyang  municipal party and chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's  Committee; Yom Tae-chun, chairman of the Central Committee of  the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland  [DFRF]; responsible functionaries from public organizations and  personages concerned; functionaries from central organizations  and workers from all walks of life in the city.    The meeting began with the playing of the national anthem.    Paek Nam-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Committee  for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF], made a  commemorative speech.    [Begin Paek recording] Comrades, today our people across the  country are fully demonstrating chuche Korea's dignity and grand  appearance by resolutely smashing antisocialist and  anti-Republic maneuvers of the imperialists and international  reactionaries with singlehearted unity with the party and the  leader [suryong]. The ardent wish to achieve the reunification  in the nineties with great national unity has been increasing  with each passing day among fellow countrymen at home and  abroad. Under this heartwarming circumstance, we are  significantly marking the 21st anniversary of the publication of  "Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country",  an immortal work of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    On this historic occasion, our people are recalling with  deep  emotion justness and invincible vitality of the five-point  policies for national reunification put forward by the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and lodestar  of national reunification. We are filled with a firm resolution  to break through difficulties laid in the way of reunification  with the strength of national unity and to achieve the  independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland by all  means.    The great leader's immortal work, "Let Us Prevent a National  Partition and Reunify the Country", was published at a very  grave time when confrontation between the lines of reunification  and division was aggravated to an extreme pitch in our country  owing to two Koreas policy of separatist forces at home and  abroad and when the new danger of a permanent division was being  created before the nation.    As everyone knows, a dialogue between the North and the  South  was provided for the first time according to the policy for  broad-range North-South negotiation elucidated by the great  leader in his speech on 6 August 1971, and the 4 July joint  statement, which assumed the principles of independence, peace  and great national unity as its basic content, was published.  Since that time, the spirit for national reunification has  rapidly been enhanced among the South Korean people, together  with all the Korean people, and the anticommunist confrontation  line has begun to be shaken to its roots in South Korea.    Embarrassed by this, the South Korean ruling bunch openly  infringed upon the three principles for national reunification,  which it pledged before the nation, at the instigation of  outside forces, and fabricated the fascist Yusin system. In  addition, the South Korean ruling bunch intensified North-South  confrontation and advanced along the road of betrayal to pursue  permanent division. Finally, on 23 June 1973, the South Korean  ruling bunch went so far as to publish a special statement  announcing the creation of two Koreas as its policy.    The situation that prevailed at that time urgently demanded  that active measures be worked out to prevent the danger of  permanent division impending before the nation and to open the  path for national reunification.    On 23 June 1973, immediately after the South Korean ruling  bunch published a special statement, the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song put forth the five-point policy of national  reunification as a revolutionary measure decisively to smash the  permanent nation-splitting moves of the U.S. imperialists and  their stooges and open an epochal phase of national  reunification.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our  proposal is to remove military confrontation and ease tension  between the North and the South, bring about multilateral  collaboration and interchange between the two parts, convene the  great national congress composed of representatives of people of  all levels and political parties and social organizations in the  North and the South, institute the North-South confederation  under the single name of the Confederal Republic of Koryo and  enter the United Nations under that name. When this proposal  for the country's reunification is put into effect, a great  turning point will be brought about in accomplishing the  historic cause of peaceful national reunification based on the  principle of the North-South joint statement, as commonly  desired by our people and the world's people.    The five-point policy of national reunification laid down by  the great leader was a patriotic reunification formula most  correctly reflecting the unanimous aspirations and will of all  the fellow countrymen who desired a peaceful reunification of  the country and opposed a permanent division of the nation, and  an immortal militant banner which set forth a broad vista and  the way of national reunification and vigorously inspired all  the people to the struggle to realize it. [applause]    The policy for removing military confrontation and easing  tension set forth by the great leader in his five-point policy  for national reunification is a just policy which gave a clear  answer to the most urgent and important question for removing  misunderstanding and distrust between the North and the South,  for achieving national reconciliation, and for achieving the  nation's peaceful reunification. The proposal for realizing  multilateral collaboration and interchange between the North and  the South is a most reasonable plan enabling us to promote the  unified development of the nation by linking severed ties of the  nation.    The proposal for convening the great national congress  composed of representatives of people of all levels and  political parties and social organizations between the North and  the South, which the great leader put forward in his five-point  policy for national reunification, is a chuche-oriented  reunification policy which enables us to resolve the issue of  national reunification in compliance with the will and demand of  the nation through the nation's own strength by making the  people from all walks of life in the North and the South broadly  participate in accomplishing the cause of national reunification.    In particular, the proposal for instituting the North-South  confederation under the single name set forth by the great  leader is a unique method for achieving national reunification  most promptly and most reasonably without giving any  disadvantage to either the North or the South under the  condition in which different ideas and systems exist in the  North and the South of our country. This proposal clearly  reflects the consistent patriotic position of our party and the  government of the Republic to achieve national reunification at  an early date by ending confrontation between fellow countrymen  and the division at any cost, based on the national unity  between the North and the South.    The five-point policy for national reunification put forward  by the great leader is a most reasonable and realistic  reunification policy that can be accepted by all the people who  love the nation, and by the people who want national  reunification, because of its thoroughgoing patriotic position,  justness, and fairness that are reflected in all articles and  clauses.    The three principles of national reunification--the great  common reunification program of the nation--are comprehensively  embodied in the five-point policy of national reunification. The  basic spirit contained in these principles is the firm  reunification will and patriotic ideal to achieve the  reunification into one Korea by opposing division.    The five-point policy of national reunification also  contains  concrete measures and methods for expediting the independent and  peaceful reunification of the fatherland by preventing the  nation's permanent division. The five-point policy is a  declaration of one Korea that opened a bright future for  resolving the reunification issue by giving a hard blow to the  two-Koreas moves of the splittists at home and abroad, and is a  great programmatic guideline of national reunification that  intensively reflected the aspiration of the entire nation to  reunification.    Indeed, the five-point policy for national reunification  is an immortal reunification program which can be put forward  only by the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song,  the peerless patriot, the sun of the nation, and the lodestar of  national reunification, who has devoted his whole life to  achieving the country's independence and the nation's grandeur  and prosperity since he embarked on the road of revolution,  taking upon himself the destiny of the country and the nation,  and who is leading all of the people to the single road of  national reunification, while feeling grieved over the nation's  division more than anyone else. [applause]    Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and  people, who has been carrying out great exploits for the cause  of our revolution and the cause of national reunification, has  wisely led the struggle to realize the five-point policy for  national reunification put forward by the great leader. The  dear comrade leader has not only vigorously pushed ahead with  the work to explain and propagate the five-point policy for  national reunification at home and abroad, but has also taken  various epochal measures to realize this new peaceful  reunification policy.    The 59th expanded meeting of the Central Committee of the  Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland,  convened in accordance with the dear comrade leader's plan  discussed the matter on convening a great national conference to  be participated in by representatives of political parties and  social organizations and representatives of all strata in the  North, the South, and overseas and proposed, in the name of the  political parties and social organization in the North, to the  people of all strata, political parties, and social  organizations in South Korea the convocation of a great national  conference to consult and solve the question of national  reunification, the utmost desire of the nation.    Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader our  party and the Government of the Republic vigorously struggled to  thoroughly implement the five-point policy for national  reunification and to open a new phase of national reunification  with the independent strength of the nation. Thanks to the dear  comrade leader's wise leadership in the struggle to implement  the five-point policy for national reunification it was possible  to impose big blows on the maneuvers for a permament division of  the nation by splittists at home and abroad and to vigorously  encourage and inspire the compatriots at home and abroad into  the accomplishment of the cause of national reunification.    At this significant meeting which marks the 21st anniversary  of the publication of the great leader's historic speech, "Let  us prevent national division and reunify the country," I  respectfully extend utmost honor and warmest gratitude, along  with the infinite reverence and burning loyalty of all of the  Korean people, to the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, the sun of the nation and the lodestar of national  reunification, who is brilliantly elucidating the road ahead for  national reunification with the rays of chuche, leading our  people to the single road of victory and glory. [applause] [end  recording]    The reporter said that the past 20-odd years from the time  when the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song declared the  five-point policy for national reunification up to now were the  20-odd years of serious confrontation between the reunification  forces and the splittist forces and the days of struggle during  which the whole nation vigorously fought to repel the  splittists' challenges and to achieve the cause of national  reunification and revealed the criminal maneuvers of the U.S.  imperialists, the South Korean puppets, and the Japanese  reactionaries to block our national reunification.    The reporter then said that the imperialist reactionaries  who  have forced the untold sufferings of division and misfortune  upon our nation for a long time and are perpetrating the  maneuvers to crush [apsal] the Republic under the pretext of our  nonexistent nuclear issue, and the flunkeyist nation-sellers in  South Korea who have followed the imperialist reactionaries,  will not be able to escape the condemnation of all of the Korean  people and continued:    [Begin recording] Comrades: It is not allowable for our  nation, who has been forced to endure the sufferings of division  caused by outside forces for nearly half a century, to live in  uneasiness, failing to achieve unity and reunification until  today, exposed to the danger of an unpredictable nuclear war on  top of the tragedy of national division. We should put an end to  the division of the nation with the nation's united strength and  achieve the country's reunification.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Reunifying  the country by ending the history of division and confrontation  for nearly half a century is the unanimous demand and will of  the entire nation. To achieve the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country it is imperative to achieve the  great unity of the entire nation.    Today, all of the Korean people in the North, the South, and  overseas are faced with the heavy but honorable task of  expediting the cause of the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country with united the strength of the  entire nation, by thoroughly implementing the 10-point program  of the great unity of the whole nation for national  reunification laid down by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation  for national reunification laid down by the great leader is a  most reasonable and realistic political program for national  unity and a great charter of national reunification which can be  acceptable to anyone who loves the country and the nation and  who desire national reunification. [applause]    Our nation's only way out under today's stern situation  [chosondoen chunomhan chongsehaeso] is all fellow countrymen's  strongly uniting under the uplifted banner of the 10-point  program of the whole nation for national reunification. The  people from all walks of life in South Korea and overseas  compatriots must consider the 10-point program of the whole  nation for national reunification to be the nation's common  guideline and firm will and continuously and vigorously wage the  struggle to implement this program.    In compliance with the aspirations of the time and the  demand  of the people of the DPRK and the United States, the United  States must no longer seek sanctions against us but come out,  with a sincere attitude and position, to the DPRK-U.S. talks,  which can peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    Strong-arm measures or sanctions can in no way be a way to  resolve the nuclear issue but will only bring a catastrophic  situation [kanggwonina chejenun kyolko haengmunje haegyorui  pangdoro toelsu opsumyo kugossun ojik pagukchogin satae manul  chorae halppunimnida].    Even though our people hope for a fair solution to the  nuclear problem and value peace and security in the country,  they will not beg for this even at the expense of national  dignity and independence.    We believe the visit to Pyongyang by a former U.S. President  a few days ago will produce an affirmative result.    The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the hostile policy  toward the Republic, a policy that they have pursued motivated  by a foolish intention to realize their old dream of the greater  East Asia prosperity sphere.    The Japanese authorities must ponder over consequences from  their maneuvers against the Republic and the General Association  of Korean Residents in Japan, honestly apologize for all the  crimes committed so far, and punish the criminals.    Sanctions against us are immediately sanctions against the  South and a declaration of war to the 70 million Koreans [urie  taehan chejenun kot namedaehan chejeimyo chilchonman kyore-e  taehan sonjon pogo imnida].    The South Korean authorities must renounce the policy of  depending on outside force, take the stand of national  independence, give up the policy of confrontation between the  fellow countrymen, and seek national reconciliation and unity.    It is our consistent position to meet with anyone--who truly  wants the independent, peaceful reunification of the country  from the stand of great national unity and national  independence--and jointly seek the way of peace in the country  and its peaceful reunification.    The premier of the DPRK Administration Council, thinking it  lucky that the South Korean side expressed its position to hold  top-level talks with us, sent a message today upon authorization  to the South Korean prime minister, a message that welcomes and  agrees to the South side's proposal for holding a preliminary  contact for the North-South top-level talks.    I express support to it in the name of the participants in  this report meeting, considering that it reflects our side's  consistent position and policy to bring an end to North-South  confrontation and open a new phase for national reunification  independently and peacefully through top-level talks. [applause]    The year 1995 is a meaningful year that marks the 50th  anniversary of the fatherland's liberation and a historic year  designated to be the starting year of our nation's  reunification. We must make positive efforts to adorn 1995 as  the year of national reunification at all costs.    After strongly uniting, under the banner of the 10-point  program of the great unity of the whole nation, all the  compatriots at home and abroad must vigorously struggle to  achieve reunification based on the most reasonable confederal  system involving one nation and one state, two systems and two  governments.    The dear leader of our party and people Comrade Kim Chong-il  is the symbol of socialism, our life and existence, and the  destiny of the fatherland and the nation [uriui saengmyongigo  saenghwarin, sahoejuuiui sangjing imyo chogukkwa minjogui  unmyong isimnida].    All people in the northern half of the Republic must defend  and glorify our-style socialism and hasten reunification, in the  nineties, by cherishing deep in their hearts the belief of sure  victory, that they always win only if there is the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, and continuously and highly displaying  their enthusiasm and loyalty, which were more highly  demonstrated on the 30th anniversary of the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il's start of work at the party Central Committee.    All the workers must score great upsurges in all fronts of  socialist economic construction in hearty response to our  party's revolutionary economic strategies.    No force in the world will be able to block the path of our  people who, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, are  vigorously marching forward under the wise leadership of the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause]    Let us all vigorously struggle to hasten the complete  victory  of socialism and the fatherland's independent, peaceful  reunification, after strongly uniting around the party and the  leader [suryong]. [applause] [end recording]    The report meeting ended with the chorus of the song "Korea  Is One."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- On 23 March, President Itamar Franco  rejected for the third time an agreement that would have put an  end to the crisis among the three government branches over the  conversion of salaries into URV's [Real Value Unit]. The  agreement, which was negotiated all day on 23 March with the  active participation of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso [FHC], was officially attacked by Federal Supreme Court  [STF] representatives, party leaders in Congress, and Attorney  General Aristides Junqueira. The agreement also depended on  President Itamar Franco's approval. At the beginning of the  evening the president said: "No."    For the sixth consecutive day, Brasilia awakes to an  impasse.  The government would have lost nothing with the agreement  negotiated 23 March. It established that the conversion of  salaries for Congress and STF employees would be made on the  30th of each month, without the additional 10.94 percent. This  was exactly what the government wanted.    All the government had to do was reedit the MP [provisional  measure], which creates the URV with some changes clearly  establishing that the salaries of all public employees should be  converted on the 30th of each month. The change meant admitting  an executive branch mistake. The STF, which converted its  salaries on the 20th, would have to retreat from its position,  but it could argue that it proceeded correctly and that the  mistake was made in the original MP. Thus, the judicial branch's  autonomy would have been preserved and the issue would have been  solved without any more problems.  <H5>  Meeting </H5>   The proposal to reach an agreement was made the morning of  23  March in the home of Attorney General Aristides Junqueira. The  meeting held there was attended by Ministers Cardoso (Finance),  Mario Cesar Flores (Strategic Affairs), STF Justices Sepulveda  Pertence and Paulo Brossard, and Deputies Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS)  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul],  Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF) [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party-Federal District], and Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Workers  Party-Sao Paulo].    The agreement was founded on a basic fact: The crisis could  develop into an institutional confrontation, threatening the  development of the democratic system. Everyone present at the  meeting presented solutions. FHC said he also favored the  agreement, but that it depended on a decision by the president  of the Republic.    The meeting began at 0930 with the arrival of FHC. Soon  afterward, Jobim, Flores, and the two justices who had met  earlier arrived to discuss the situation. The rest of the  participants arrived soon after.    At around 1900, when Congress considered an agreement  certain, Minister Cardoso announced that President Franco did  not accept the solution. According to the minister, the  government will wait for a STF decision on the legality of  converting salaries on the 20th. Franco did not want to admit  that the PM was written incorrectly.    Consequences of the crisis are unpredictable. So far, the  conversion of judicial branch salaries was based on an STF  administrative decision disregarding the executive branch, which  imposed a cut in workers' salaries. The administrative decision  may become a court ruling based on suits presented 23 March by  the judicial branch labor unions and may become a preliminary  court ruling. With this new situation, instead of disregarding a  mere STF administrative decision, the executive branch would be  disregarding a court ruling, thus establishing an open  confrontation between the two government branches.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / US, Japan clash as vote on top WHO job looms NEXT Wednesday the 31 executive board members of the World Health Organisation are due to cast their votes for director-general of the United Nations agency, bringing to a head a long and unusually bitter election campaign that has set the US and Japan at loggerheads. An internal US State Department paper has accused Japan of 'aggressive tactics, including the pursuit of votes in exchange for favours' in the quest for support for the incumbent Japanese director-general, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima. Japan, which strongly denies the charge, claims the US government is waging a disinformation campaign against it and Dr Nakajima, based on little more than the personal animosities of a few key officials at the US health department. For Tokyo, the re-election of Dr Nakajima for a second five-year term has become not simply a matter of national pride but a crucial test of international good faith in urging Japan to take a greater role in world affairs. 'In the eyes of the Japanese people, Dr Nakajima is a symbol of Japan's contribution to the international community,' says Mr Masao Kawai, a senior official in the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The WHO chief is the only Japanese to have been elected (rather than appointed) to a top UN position. The US is backing the candidacy of Dr Mohamed Abdelmoumene, an Algerian neurologist, who was Dr Nakajima's deputy at the WHO until sacked from his post last August after announcing he would run against his boss. Dr Abdelmoumene, who says he was asked to stand for director-general by a number of rich and poor countries, has the official backing of the European Community and the Arab League, but Dr Nakajima claims strong support from developing countries who are in the majority on the executive board. The US pays about a quarter of the WHO's Dollars 850m (Pounds 552m) annual budget. Japan, which has rapidly increased contributions since Dr Nakajima took over as director-general, to become WHO's second-biggest paymaster, last year paid about Dollars 57m. Both governments deny that contributions will be cut if the wrong man wins. Dr Nakajima's faults, on the face of it, do not seem very grave. He is accused of an authoritarian management style, of travelling too much and of being a poor communicator. Furthermore, he was involved in an embarassing incident last year after an official visit to Russia when customs officials at a Moscow airport confiscated six icons in his baggage which he had not declared. Dr Nakajima's supporters argue that he has improved the running of the organisation since taking over in 1988 from Dr Halfdan Mahler, a Dane, and that he has initiated valuable work to achieve 'basic health' in developing countries. However, it is clear that Dr Nakajima has not won the hearts and minds of WHO staff, who complain of a lack of vision and leadership. There has been a steady exodus of senior officials, including the sudden resignation in March 1990 of Dr Jonathan Mann, a high-profile American who headed WHO's programme on Aids. US officials say their opposition to Dr Nakajima is based solely on concern for the ability of WHO effectively to tackle big health challenges. Within the WHO itself, executive board members are allegedly being wooed with top-level visits, promises of aid and top jobs - practices, it must be said, which are widespread throughout the UN system, often backed by national governments. US officials too are alleged to have hinted that American backing for WHO activities could wane if Dr Nakajima is re-elected.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>   [Excerpt] Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian  self-rule authority has apparently succeeded in drawing a  prominent West Bank Muslim Brotherhood leader into participating  in the Palestinian Authority, conflicting with the position of  the Hamas Movement, which was set up in 1987 from the  Palestinian organization of the Muslim Brotherhood.    Hamas did not deny that this Islamic personality is  currently  in Tunis, but emphasized that Sa'id Bilal was fired from the  Muslim Brotherhood and has no links with Hamas. Hamas said  Bilal's invitation to Tunis was made within the framework of  'Arafat's preparations to detonate a media bomb by announcing  the participation of this person in the Palestinian authority.    Hamas recalled how 'Arafat had given Palestine National  Council [PNC] membership to five Islamic personalities, and then  reports said that they were Hamas representatives in the PNC.  Hamas added 'Arafat wants to repeat the same tactic now and  allege that Hamas is with the Palestinian Authority. [passage  omitted]</p>

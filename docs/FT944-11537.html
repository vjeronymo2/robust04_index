			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Coles Myer debt rating lowered by S&amp;P Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailing group, has had its long and short-term debt ratings lowered by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US-based credit rating agency, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The long-term rating was cut from AA- to A, and the short-term rating from A-1+ to A-1. S&amp;P said the retailer's financial risk had been increased by the ADollars 1.26bn (USDollars 941m) repurchase of the 21.45 per cent of its equity which had previously been owned by Kmart, the US stores group. Coles announced that the deal - in two separate parts - was completed yesterday and that payment of the ADollars 1.26bn had gone ahead. As a result, three Kmart appointees to the Coles board - Mr Joseph Antonin, Mr Thomas Watkins and Mr Thomas Murasky - resigned as directors of the Australian group. S&amp;P added that profitability and cash-flow from operating businesses reflected the strength of the company's market position, but noted if the entire block of Kmart shares was cancelled, the company's gearing - measured as total liabilities to total tangible assets - would exceed internal targets of 55 per cent to 60 per cent. Coles pointed out the possible downgrading had been taken into consideration when assessing the effects of the buy-back, and was expected to have a minimal impact on profitability.</p>

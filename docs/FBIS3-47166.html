			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Choe Song-chin] </F>   [Text] President Kim Yong-sam Thursday [6 January] declared  1994 as the year for strengthening Korea's international  competitiveness, a proclamation which surprised few. The  President's first year in office, despite many remarkable  achievements in political and social arenas, lost some of its  luster because of his failure to bring about the much-hoped-for  economic recovery.    Even the "new economic five-year plan" ambitiously launched  by Kim's administration could hardly turn the adverse economic  tide at home and abroad in its first year, which ended with  rather disappointing economic growth of 4.9 percent. On top of  this, the recent conclusion of global free trade talks will  expose domestic industry to fiercer competition than ever with  foreigners.    Taking the nation's economic helm at this difficult moment  was Chong Chae-sok, who was sworn in as the new deputy prime  minister and minister of the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in  last December's cabinet reshuffle, which also affected 13 other  ministers. Ever since his inauguration more than two weeks ago,  the 63-year-old new EPB minister, known for both his economic  expertise based on long experience and his strong personality,  has been the focus of attention within the government and  business circles. In a joint written interview with the EPB  press Chong stresses bolder internationalization and  deregulation as the keys to Korea's economic survival.    Q: Korea's internationalizing strategy, though appearing  quite innovative to Koreans themselves, still falls short of  meeting foreigners' expectations. Can't you come up with a  bolder market-opening program, including a complete lifting of  bans on capital movement?    A: To induce more foreign capital, we need to change our way  of thinking as a whole. Numerous administrative regulations on  direct foreign investments should be improved and complex  procedures simplified.    More fundamental problems are financial restrictions, poor  infrastructure and labor problems, which combine to make the  overall business environment here worse than that in industrial  countries. Our internationalizing strategy should start with  improving this business environment not only for foreigners but  also for domestic companies.    Q: Despite the continuous administrative deregulation  pursued by the Kim administration, businessmen say they hardly  feel the effect. Why so and how would you overcome the  bureaucratic resistance to bolder deregulation?    A: I have been briefed that out of the 966 targets for  deregulation, 751 have been completed. The problem is that  actual implementation of a new system takes some time to be felt  by business people.    With new approaches and resolve, the government will push  ahead with deregulation. It will soon come up with a more  systematic and comprehensive program, suited to the diverse  functions and sectors of businesses.    Q: You mentioned the need to raise prices, including public  service rates, to a "realistic level," which sparked speculation  among businesses that the new deputy premier had shifted the  keynote of economic policy from stability to growth. What is  your position?    A: Stability is a must for growth, and the most important  thing in economic operations is to balance these two elements.  I will pursue the objective of reinvigorating the economy while  working for price stabilization, a policy which will be  explained in detail in this year's economic operation plan to be  reported to the President next Tuesday.    Q: You have often expressed an intention to rectify the  distorted price structure by raising public service charges when  the need arises. Is there any change in such position?    A: I believe extreme caution is needed in raising public  service charges in view of their enormous effect on overall  commodity prices. It is true that the excessive curbing of  public service rates has resulted in distorting the price  structure, degrading the price structure, degrading the quality  of services and weakening our competitive edge.    Still, the government will keep the price of public services  to a minimum level by more efficient management of state-run  corporations. It also will try to ensure price stabilization of  daily necessities, minimize the price raise of manufactured  goods and crack down on illegal or unfair price hikes.    Q: Analysts say that limiting wage increases and prevention  of labor disputes will be the two biggest economic concerns this  year. What do you think?    A: To win in the unlimited competition in the coming era of  global borderless business, we must have industrial peace and  technological development. Because all of us know that wage  increases in excess of productivity gains have been one of the  biggest factors weakening the nation's competitive edge, I am  sure that both labor and management will cooperate now.    Q: What is your plan to revive the agricultural sector,  hardest hit by the successful settlement of the Uruguay Round  trade negotiations?    A: So far, farm policy has been a defensive policy of  protecting the weak sector. From now on, we will turn to a more  aggressive approach by helping the domestic farm industry  sharpen its competitive edge.    More specifically, the government will accelerate structural  adjustment, rationalize the farmland ownership system and  improve the farm administration to better suit the international  trends.    For this purpose, the "Rural Development Tax" will be  introduced as proposed earlier, and the government will, taking  the views from all sectors of society into consideration, come  up with a comprehensive policy package by the end of June.    Q: What change have you found in the government's role  between 1979, when you served as the last trade minister of the  late President Pak Chong-hui, and now?    A: We are now living in a democratized, deregulated and  internationalized era. The government's role should also change  from that of a guider to helper.    Particularly, it should play the role as the fair supervisor  of the economy, while supplying social infrastructure, fostering  human resources and protecting the environment.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY SCRAMBLES TO FIND BILINGUAL SCHOOLTEACHERS  </P> <P> As Orange County schools grow increasingly diverse with pupils of many  backgrounds and languages, school districts are struggling to find enough  bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> During the school year just ended, all 28 of the county's school districts  failed to comply with at least part of the state's bilingual education  requirements.  </P> <P> The results of the compliance review, done every three years, illustrate the  growing need for such teachers as well as the uncertainty that has reigned at  school districts statewide since California's stringent bilingual-education law  expired in 1987. But armed with new guidelines issued by the state Department  of Education earlier this year, school districts in increasingly polyglot  Orange County are racing to recruit teachers with bilingual credentials to meet  state rules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wooed With Bonuses  </P> <P> So intense is the competition that these specialized instructors are being  actively recruited and in some cases wooed with bonuses and stipends.  </P> <P> "I would say 1% of the school districts in the state got an A on their report  card, and 99% (had something) out of compliance," said Estella Acosta, who is  in charge of bilingual-teacher training for the Orange County Department of  Education.  </P> <P> The state Department of Education says 15.8% of Orange County's student  enrollment in 1988 was classified as "limited English proficient," meaning that  their primary language was something other than English. An update is due in a  few weeks, and local and statewide educators say the new data will undoubtedly  reflect an increase in limited-English speaking students in Orange County.  </P> <P> As the number of such students has increased, so has the number of different  languages spoken in local schools. In the Garden Grove Unified School District,  for example, administrators face the daunting task of teaching children who  speak 71 different languages, including Spanish, Cambodian, Tagalog, Laotian  and Hmong.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Summer Scrambling  </P> <P> For local school districts, summer is the time for scrambling to bring  bilingual programs into compliance with new state guidelines, either by more  aggressive recruiting of bilingual teachers or by submitting alternative plans  for serving their multi-ethnic student populations despite a severe shortage of  bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> For the small number of teachers with credentials to teach students whose  English is limited, the summer months are a time to be courted by districts  desperate to find more bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> Less than a month after he earned his teaching degree at Cal State Fullerton  and got his credentials as a bilingual-education teacher, Ruben Gonzalez has  had job offers from four schools, and he doesn't know which to accept.  </P> <P> "There are so many offers," he lamented. "But I have all summer to think about  it. I feel lucky, to tell you the truth. I feel wanted."  </P> <P> Another recent graduate, Ingrid Ragland, who also has a bilingual-teaching  credential, was offered a job by the Fullerton School District, where her  daughter attends elementary school -- even though Ragland never applied to work  there.  </P> <P> In the Santa Ana Unified School District, where more than half the students are  limited in English, administrators learned of a teacher from Central America  who was fluent in English and Spanish, and quickly tried to recruit her. They  were undeterred by her lack of the proper work visa and began working with the  U.S. State Department and other agencies to help the teacher get the proper  visa and emergency credentials.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Unified now has 230 teachers with bilingual certificates, 63 more  than the previous school year, district spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. But only  two of those are certified in a language other than Spanish. "We certainly need  more," she said.  </P> <P> In that district, 51% of the district's 40,000 students are considered limited  in English, a higher percentage than any of the large school districts in the  state, even higher than the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District,  where 27% of the enrollment is considered limited in English.  </P> <P> So great is the need for bilingual teachers in the Santa Ana district that  principals and assistant principals are sent to colleges in the Midwest to  recruit teachers, Assistant Supt. Don Champlin said.  </P> <P> But the situation is not limited to the more urban areas of Orange County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Specialist Hired  </P> <P> At the Saddleback Valley Unified School District in southern Orange County,  where students are predominantly Anglo, the number of limited-English students  has grown to 685 this year. An increase of about 150 students in the last year  alone prompted administrators to hire a specialist in limited-English  instruction. Maria Quezada, who began working for the district in April, said  there are now 36 different languages spoken among Saddleback's students, and  administrators have started refocusing their instructional program to ensure  that those children will be taught in the most effective way.  </P> <P> And they know the competition for qualified bilingual teachers is tough.  </P> <P> "In the past you could say, 'There aren't any bilingual teachers out there,'  and that was that," Quezada said. "Now you have to do a little more. . . . You  have to be very pro-active. . . . Some districts are even going into the  universities and offering contracts to teachers in their third or fourth year  of school."  </P> <P> Graduation tallies at Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine, the main sources of  new teachers for Orange County school districts, illustrate the problem.  </P> <P> At UC Irvine, only six to 10 of 150 teachers who graduated this year had  bilingual credentials, said Joan Bissell, assistant director of UCI's office of  teacher education. Only 20 or so of Cal State Fullerton's teaching majors who  graduated this year had bilingual credentials, said Prof. Carol Barnes, the  university's coordinator of elementary and bilingual education.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Snapped Up Quickly  </P> <P> "If a district just waits for somebody who is bilingual to apply (for a job),  they're not going to get them," Barnes said. "Our bilinguals are often snapped  up by school districts where they did their student teaching or where they  worked as an aide. I would think that many of our teachers are not even in the  (job) market."  </P> <P> And at UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton, all of the bilingual teachers who  graduated this year specialized in Spanish.  </P> <P> When schools cannot find teachers who speak specific languages, they cope by  hiring aides -- often parents in the community -- to work alongside the teacher  in the classroom.  </P> <P> When the state's bilingual law expired two years ago, the state Department of  Education issued an advisory saying that because of other legal requirements,  school districts were nevertheless obligated to comply with the intent of the  law, which was to help students acquire sufficient English language ability to  succeed in the regular school program. The bilingual law had required a  certified bilingual teacher for every 10 limited-English students.  </P> <P> Under current guidelines, school districts now have more flexibility for  training and qualifying their own bilingual teachers or language development  specialists -- instructors who aren't necessarily fluent in the primary  language that their students speak.  </P> <P> Even so, some districts have sought waivers from the state Department of  Education, saying they cannot meet the guidelines by the fall, usually because  of limited resources, materials or personnel. So far, seven Orange County  school districts have filed for such waivers, and four of those are still  awaiting state Board of Education approval.  </P> <P> Saddleback Unified is one of the four. Quezada said it had applied for the  waiver "to give us a little bit of time to come up with our resources," she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Flexibility  </P> <P> The Garden Grove Unified School District has tried to take advantage of the new  flexibility. Laura Schwalm, director of educational services, said that 25 of  the district's teachers have bilingual credentials but that several others are  in locally designed programs to get credentials or certification as language  development specialists.  </P> <P> With the wide diversity of languages spoken among the district's 7,000  limited-English students, Schwalm said, the district is exploring teaching  methods that do not rely so heavily on the state's bilingual-credentials  testing.  </P> <P> "One thing we are looking at is at what level of proficiency do (teachers) need  to learn the Spanish language if they are teaching at the kindergarten level,  for example," she said. "Now the district can set its own criteria."  </P> <P> The heavy demand for certified bilingual teachers has led some districts to  offer bonuses or stipends to entice job candidates. Los Angeles Unified School  District pays up to $5,000 extra for certified bilingual teachers. Santa Ana  Unified offers up to $1,400, and the Westminster School District gives up to  $300.  </P> <P> Some districts strongly oppose giving bonuses to bilingual teachers. "Why not  give physics teachers a bonus too?" asked Garden Grove Supt. Ed Dundon.  "They're hard to find too."  </P> <P> Others say stipends can help alleviate the shortage.  </P> <P> "If more districts did that, it might encourage more people to get into  (bilingual teaching)," Cal State Fullerton's Barnes said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooperative Spirit  </P> <P> Another solution to the teacher crisis is a new cooperative spirit between  institutions of higher learning and public schools. More and more, it involves  tapping the very people who have been helping teachers cope in their classrooms  with limited-English students.  </P> <P> Bissell said UCI has been working on a program with Santa Ana Unified, Cal  State Fullerton, Rancho Santiago Community College in Santa Ana and Chapman  College in Orange to encourage bilingual teacher aides to get not only their  bachelor's teaching degrees, but also their certification in bilingual  teaching.  </P> <P> Norm Gold, the state Department of Education's bilingual/bicultural consultant,  said there is no doubt that the need for special instruction for  limited-English students will continue to grow in California.  </P> <P> "We now have 10 to 12 years of data on limited-English students, and we know  the need will keep growing for at least the Spanish language," he said. "The  growth has been less predictable for languages like Hmong, but there are now  large numbers of students and kids in refugee camps all over the world, such as  the Philippines, who we know are in the pipeline and who are probably going to  end up here (in California).  </P> <P> "There are children who will probably come here soon from Afghanistan, from  Soviet Armenia and other areas of the world," he said. "The population in  Orange County now is not that much different than in the rest of the state, so  school districts there will also have to be prepared."  </P></p>

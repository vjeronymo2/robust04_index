			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Canadian group raises Dollars 550m HORSHAM, the investment holding company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, has raised USDollars 550m through a debenture issue as part of its groundwork for a major acquisition. Mr Munk has indicated for some time that Horsham was eager to add another leg to its controlling interest in gold producer American Barrick, its 100 per cent stake in Clark Oil, a US mid-west refiner and marketer, and its most recent foray into property development on the outskirts of Berlin, Germany. Barrick, whose most important asset is the Goldstrike mine in Nevada, has also indicated an interest in broadening its horizons. It has become increasingly active in gold exploration in Latin America, and is also seeking opportunities in Asia, including China and Indonesia. The debenture issue has been structured in a way which enables Horsham to use its stake in American Barrick to raise relatively cheap funds. The 25-year securities carry an interest rate of 3.25 per cent, but are indexed to Barrick's share price. They are convertible into Barrick shares or redeemable for cash after five years, at the option of the company. Horsham will retain its 20 per cent interest in Barrick for the time being, but it has deposited one-third of its 60m Barrick shares in trust in the event that it decides to allow debenture-holders to convert into Barrick stock. The debentures have been bought by an underwriting group led by RBC Dominion Securities. They will not be distributed in the US. Horsham has up to now had no debt at the parent company level. It also has cash reserves of over USDollars 200m. One US analyst suggested yesterday that the diversification drive has been accelerated by disappointment at the progress of the German property venture, which involves the development of a 600-acre business park.</p>

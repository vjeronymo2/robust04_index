			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Russia and Germany agree arms conversion venture GERMAN and Russian companies yesterday formed the first joint venture between the two countries to convert arms to peaceful purposes, spokesmen for both sides said, Reuter reports. 'This could also be the biggest such joint venture in the world,' a German industry spokesman said of the contract, signed in Schrobenhausen, near Munich, after a year of negotiations. Under the deal, 1.6m tonnes of conventional munitions from Soviet stocks will be destroyed in Russia in a manner sensitive to the environment in Russia. The components will be recycled. Munich-based Deutsche Aerospace AG and LUB Lurgi Umwelt-Beteiligungsgesellschaft, a subsidiary of metals and engineering group Metallgesellschaft in Frankfurt, sealed the deal with ARTA, a Russian grouping of defence industry companies. ARTA said disposing of 1.6m tonnes of munitions from bullets to missiles would take about 10 years. German spokesmen said they hoped the deal would pave the way for bigger ventures in arms conversion, an increasing market now that the east-west conflict is over, military budgets are being cut and weapons are being scrapped. The two German companies entered the joint venture through their newly established joint venture Entsorgungs und Sanierungstechnik, based in Schrobenhausen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Maria Elena Gil] </F>   [Text] Bridgetown, 7 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President  Fidel Castro tossed a floral wreath into the waters of Cross Bay  to honor the martyrs who died when their Cubana de Aviacion  plane crashed off the coast as a result of terrorist sabotage.    It is a very special moment for me, Castro told PRENSA  LATINA. From the very beginning, when this trip was planned, I  decided to come here and make this offering to the martyrs of  Barbados, Castro added.    Visibly moved, Fidel Castro walked along the shore for a few  minutes and overlooked the horizon where 18 years ago the  flaming plane fell with its 73 passengers.    Eleven Guyanese, six Koreans, and 56 Cubans, including the  entire Cuban National Youth Fencing Team, which had just won the  Central American and Caribbean championship in Caracas, were on  that Cubana de Aviacion flight.    After his visit to Cross Bay, President Castro told PRENSA  LATINA that he was very pleased with his first visit to this  English-speaking Caribbean country. They are a warm, friendly,  and very educated people, Castro said.    Regarding his meetings in the past few days with other  Caribbean leaders who also attended the recently concluded World  Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island  States, Fidel Castro said he received numerous expressions of  solidarity from the Caribbean heads of state. The entire  Caribbean is in favor of Cuba's integration to the region,  Castro said.    Today, the Cuban president met with Governor General Nita  Barrow, sister of the late Barbadian Prime Minister Erroll  Barrow. Just before his meeting with Nita Barrow, Castro told  PRENSA LATINA: It is my duty to meet with her because the  governor general is Barrow's sister, and he maintained excellent  relations with Cuba.    Castro's Saturday agenda includes meetings with  correspondents from CANA and the Caribbean Broadcasting Union  who report and broadcast to the region.    Fidel Castro will also visit the "Rainbow Warrior," a  Greenpeace ship that docked at the port in Bridgetown with an  exhibit on board on environmental protection technology.    Cuban President Fidel Castro arrived in Barbados on 4 May to  attend the conference. He is accompanied by Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban  National Assembly of the People's Government; and Rosa Elena  Simeon, minister of environment, science, and technology.</p>

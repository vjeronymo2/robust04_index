			<p>Article   Type:BFN   <F P=106> [See "Selected Video Reports" section for information on </F> ordering accompanying video footage]    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel in Russian at 1800 GMT on 19 March, during its regular  "Novosti" newscast, carries a 2-minute report over video by  correspondent Mais Mamedov on the Baku metro blast.    Mamedov begins the report from Baku, over video of people  entering a metro station, by saying that the capital was  particularly busy today because people were preparing for  tomorrow's Muslim festival. At 1355 hours local time, as a  train drew into the 20 January station, there was a powerful  explosion in the front carriage. Following clips of the mangled  wreckage, pools of blood, and rescue workers on the station  platform, Mamedov interviews Baku City Procurator Adil Agayev,  identified by caption, next to the wrecked train. Agayev says a  powerful explosive device was planted in the train and adds:  "And all these deeds that have taken place recently in the city  of Baku demonstrate that a group of saboteurs is permanently  operating in Baku. According to preliminary information,  according to the testimony of witnesses, it is evident that  there was a suspicious individual in the carriage where the  explosion occurred today. We have been given a description of  him and an identikit picture is being built up of him to  establish his identity in the city."    In the studio, the announcer adds that according to the  latest preliminary figures, 12 people died and 53 were injured  in the blast.</p>

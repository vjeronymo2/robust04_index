			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Government Has To Decide How </F> To Make a Profit on Latvian Oil"]    [Text] Riga, 5 Apr -- Today, the Saeima [parliament]  Commission for Economy, Agriculture and Regional Policy met with  officials of the Amoco Overseas Exploration Company, along with  representatives of the Ministries of Economy, Foreign Affairs,  and Environment Protection, and a group of geologists. The aim  of the meeting was to promote the concluding of a contract  between the Latvian Government and Amoco, granting the latter  drilling rights on Baltic sea territory belonging to Latvia,  where, according to geologists, oil can be found.    Provided the contract is signed, Latvia will be entitled to  a  part of Amoco's profits from selling the extracted oil. In  addition, the company will train Latvian geologists over a  period of five years. As DIENA was told by Aristids Lambergs,  member of the Economy Commission, there will be no expense for  Latvia; it is only a question of agreeing upon profits. If an  agreement is not signed, the company will drill on Swedish  territory, which would mean no profits for Latvia at all.  According to geologists, the oil deposit is like an underground  barrel straddling the Latvian and Swedish border, and it can be  reached by drilling on either side of the border. Amoco has  already signed a contract with Sweden.    The signing of a contract with Latvia is being impeded by  the  fact that until now the sea border between Latvia and Lithuania  has not been delineated. There are oil deposits situated where  the two borders meet, and Lithuania may be able to make claims  as well, depending on what the two governments decide.  Actually, Latvia has found the demands of Lithuania  unacceptable, but a compromise can be expected in a short time,  nonetheless.    Due to the preliminary agreement signed by the Latvian  Government and Amoco in 1993, the term for granting the license  is 2 July of this year. The Latvian Government established a  commission today which is to resolve problems connected with the  above mentioned contract. According to the company's proposal,  the license must be confirmed by parliament. A. Lambergs  emphasized that the Commission for Economy regards this project  as useful and important for Latvia. Amoco is a U.S. company  which extracts oil around the globe, and is the sixth largest  company of its kind in the world.</p>

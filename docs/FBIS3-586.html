Molusi] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 10 SAPA--African National  Congress [ANC] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday [10  March] called for immediate South African Government  intervention in Bophuthatswana to protect lives. Mr Ramaphosa  would not be drawn on the form of intervention.    ANC President Nelson Mandela would speak to State President  F.W. de Klerk on Thursday about the crisis in Bophuthatswana and  impress on him the urgency of taking decisive steps against the  homeland, Mr Ramaphosa added. He said the crisis in  Bophuthatswana was such that it could not wait for a  Transitional Executive Council meeting on Monday.    Mr Ramaphosa said an emergency session of the executive  council might be called, but the South African Government was  fully entitled to give protection to its citizens in  Bophuthtastwana -- in consultation with the ANC. "We are  concerned that unless action is taken immediately, we might be  facing a situation which could be worse than Bisho," he said,  alluding to a massacre in Ciskei in 1992.    "All indications are now that it is quite possible that the  security forces in Bophuthatswana will start panicking and open  fire at randonm at people who are protesting legitimately for  their human rights."    Mr Ramaphosa said: "It is quite clear to us that (President)  Lucas Mangope has put himself on a collision course with the  people of South Africa as whole."    The executive council had been approached by the Civil  Servants Association of Bophuthatswana for talks on  rationalisation, job prospects, salaries and pensions. Mr  Ramaphosa said Bophuthatswana would cease to exist after April  27 and it was important that administration and government  services in that area should continue.</p>

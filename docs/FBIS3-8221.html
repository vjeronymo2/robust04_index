			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] This morning, the chetniks again launched air  attacks on the Maglaj area. They really want to cause a final  show-down with NATO forces.    The chetniks are continuing the offensive on Maglaj, using  all weapons and targeting everything. [passage omitted]    The aggressors tried to use aircraft again at 0915 GMT but  failed to achieve the desired result. They let out their rage  on civilians in the town, dropping tonnes of their deadly load.  Howitzers, mortars, and tanks are pounding the town, and they  have fired more than 400 shells on residential areas. We have  learned that three civilians have been killed and six wounded.  The shelling of Maglaj is going on as I speak. The best  witnesses to the intensity of the shelling are NATO pilots who  have been actively patrolling the air space above Maglaj since  0900 GMT.    The war presidency of the Maglaj municipality has sent a  request to Michael Rose [UN commander for Bosnia] to immediately  dispatch UN Protection Force units to Maglaj to stop the further  killing of civilians and protect material goods from the bestial  shelling.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / People: Non-executive directors Tesco, the UK's second-biggest grocery retailer, has appointed John Gardiner (above), chairman of the Laird Group, as non-executive deputy chairman. Gardiner, 57, who has been on the TESCO board for five years, joins the existing part-time deputy chairman Victor Benjamin. The move is thought to be aimed at ensuring a smooth handover when Benjamin reaches the retirement age of 60 in two years' time. It will also strengthen the representation of the non-executive segment of the board. Gardiner has plenty of experience in the boardroom. After six years as a journalist on the Financial Times' Lex column in the 1960s, he joined the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation for two years. At 34, he was appointed chief executive of Cammell Laird, which later changed its name to the Laird Group. He added the position of chairman in 1987. He has been a non-executive director of corporations including British Airways, British Leyland, British Shipbuilders, Cambrian &amp; General Securities, ICL, Courtaulds and MAI. He has also been a part-time member of the board of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, a member of the National Enterprise Board, the South Bank Theatre Board, and the Council of the Open University. Gardiner is currently a non-executive director of Enterprise Oil, PowerGen and the Securities and Investments Board, and in September was appointed chairman of the School Teachers' Review Body.</p>

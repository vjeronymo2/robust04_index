			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER SIDE TO SCHOOL STORY  </P> <P> I'm an eighth-grade student at Oak Ridge Private School. I thought the story  you wrote about the school and its neighbors was unfair and inaccurate.  </P> <P> First of all, what's this about the shrill of whistles at 7:45 a.m. calling  children to class? No class starts before 8:30.  </P> <P> Anyway, you said yourself that the whistles aren't used anymore, so why bring  it up at all?  </P> <P> Another thing is the residential block situation. The neighbors block may be  residential, but the school faces Grand Avenue.  </P> <P> How could there be "constant" noise from the playground? The kids have to be in  class sometimes.  </P> <P> The alley behind the school is public. It's probably busy for a while in the  morning and in the afternoon when kids are being dropped off and picked up, but  that isn't all day.  </P> <P> Weren't City Council meetings held before the school moved in to discuss Oak  Ridge's role in the community?  </P> <P> Why didn't you print how much (resident Frances) Anderson paid for her house  and how much she wants to sell it for as long as you saw fit to print how much  the Burrys paid for the Toastmaster's building? And what does the cost of  tuition have to do with anything?  </P> <P> I'd just like to add that the Burrys are considerate, caring people, and I  think your story neglected the school's position.  </P> <P> JESSICA MELUGIN, Orange  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Roshchina: "Saturday Rally: Not the First </F> and Probably Not the Last"]    [Text] Saturday's rally in defense of human rights at  Vladivostok's central square attracted several thousand people.  It went under the banners "Down With OMON [Special Missions  Militia Detachment] Terror," "Shame on Provocateurs," and  "Defend the People's Mayor."    The main theme in the speeches of the former city  administrator V. Gilgenberg and a number of other former city  administration functionaries, as well as figures from the Voters  Association and city residents sympathetic to them, was that V.  Cherepkov became the victim of a crude provocation organized and  sanctioned by kray authorities and local court and low  enforcement bodies. As usual, however, not a shred of proof was  presented. Those who decidedly did not share this viewpoint--and  there were more than enough of them-- were not given the floor,  naturally.    Former Mayor V. Cherepkov's address to the citizens was  greeted with applause.    In conclusion, rally participants adopted an appeal to the  Russian Federation bodies of state power (the State Duma, the  Federation Council, the General Procuracy, and others), also  addressed to all Russian Federation citizens.    In addition, the Voters Association issued a statement that  in the event elections are not held on the original date of 27  March, it will hold another rally in Vladivostok at 1400 next  Saturday.    From the Editors: Monday morning the kray electoral  commission consultant G. Popov confirmed that, judging from the  speech yesterday by kray head Nazdratenko on local radio and  television (Channel 3), elections to the Kray Duma and local  self-rule bodies have indeed been moved, to 23 October of this  year.</p>

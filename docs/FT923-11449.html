			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Council pension funds beat RPI LOCAL-authority superannuation funds produced real returns of 4.1 per cent for the 1991-92 financial year, marginally above inflation and equal to the returns of private-sector occupational pension schemes for the same period, according to WM Company, a pension-fund performance measurement service. The survey found that smaller portfolios with less than Pounds 100m performed best, reversing a trend seen in the 1980s where larger portfolios turned in the best performance.</p>

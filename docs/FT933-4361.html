			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / People: Preacher to help the angels Venture capitalists tend to be snooty about accountants despite the fact that many come from the same background. A common complaint is that once an accountant gets involved deals become bogged down in reams of financial forecasts and scenarios. But few venture capitalists would deny the contribution that John Hustler has made to the industry over the years. As head of venture capital at KPMG Peat Marwick, Hustler, has been an indefatigable toiler in the many committees set up to consider arcane issues such as the valuation of unquoted investments and performance measures for venture funds. After Eton and accountancy training, Hustler, 47, became a partner at Peats in 1983. He has since helped the European Commission devise a venture capital scheme, advised three UK small firms ministers on venture issues and spent two years as treasurer of the British Venture Capital Association. He is now to practise what he has been preaching to many other entrepreneurs and is setting up on his own as a consultant. As Hustler Venture Partners he plans to advise entrepreneurs seeking funding. 'I want to look at the deals the venture capitalists don't back to see if I can help turn them into fundable propositions,' he says. One area he hopes to develop is that of helping 'business angels', wealthy individuals with a commercial background, to back new ventures. Hustler is particularly keen to get more money into early stage ventures. This could prove quite a challenge because the venture industry has moved away from backing start-ups and early stage companies in recent years. But Hustler is not afraid to stick his neck out. He has been a vocal defender of the role of the accountant in the venture capital process when others have kept their heads down.</p>

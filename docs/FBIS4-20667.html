			<p>CSO     [Text] As previously reported, the 1993 edition of the  Nuclear Power Safety White Paper was released on 30 November.  The special collection in this year's white paper is "Ensuring  Safety Regarding the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear Reactor  Facilities." Following last year's special collection, "Ensuring  the Safety of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle," the white paper is  expressing the concept that the safety of the fuel cycle and  nuclear reactor facilities is being adequately ensured. Just how  was the evaluation of the safety of fast-breeder reactors (FBR),  one type of nuclear reactor facility, carried out? This article  will present an outline of the description of the "Monju"  reactor, which was given as an example.  <H5>  "Monju" Safety Investigation </H5>   We will explain, particularly, the special aspects of  "Monju"  with regard to just what type of investigation was carried out  as part of the Nuclear Power Safety Committee's double check on  each of the following points: 1) site conditions, 2) nuclear  power facility safety design, 3) evaluation of exposure dose  during normal operating periods, 4) safety design evaluation,  and 5) site evaluation, as well as whether or not it was  confirmed that there were no problems with regard to safety  assurance.    Moreover, "Monju" has many unique characteristics which  differ from light-water reactors, such as:     -  it was designed  to operate at low pressure, but at high temperature, because it  utilizes sodium (which has a high boiling point) as a coolant;    -  because it is a reactor which uses MOX fuel and has a reactor  core which uses fast neutrons in its reaction, thus giving it  the ability to breed, the reactor's output density and burnup  rates are high; and,    -  a cover gas exists above the surface of  liquid sodium.       While giving adequate considerations to these particular  characteristics, an investigation was carried out into the  appropriateness of the safety design and into the safety  evaluation, based on previous experience operating FBRs and the  results of research and development.  <H5>  Nuclear Reactor Facility Safety Design </H5>   (1) Nuclear Reactor Facility--General    With regard to the design of construction materials,  systems,  and equipment which are important for safety, because this  reactor uses sodium (a high-temperature liquid metal) as a  coolant, there are areas in the design which exceed the  operational parameters used for light-water reactors. In such  areas, it was decided to use a structure design policy that was  created in consideration of the special characteristics  associated with sodium reactors, based on factors such as the  results of domestic experimentation and research and considering  foreign standards. We confirmed that this basic policy was  appropriate.    Moreover, regarding the chemical activity of sodium,  countermeasures have been taken, such as covering the surface of  the liquid sodium with an atmosphere of an inert gas (argon  gas). Furthermore, in regard to response to and burnup reaction  caused by leakage of the sodium, adequate measures have been  devised with regard to leak detection, burnup control, and the  minimization of thermal effects. We confirmed that the basic  policy was one which was designed so that the safety functions  of construction materials, systems, and equipment important to  safety were not harmed by the use of sodium.    (2) Aseismatic Design    Nuclear reactors are facilities which need to have adequate  earthquake-proofing to respond to the strongest possible  earthquakes conceivable. Therefore, we confirmed that, along  with carrying out a classification based on importance for  earthquake-proofing of facilities, systems, and equipment  important for safety, the facility was designed being able to  withstand the maximum calculated possible earthquake. This  calculation was based on factors such as a review of the records  of previous earthquakes in the region of the facility and of  surrounding regions, as well as a study of the region itself.  Moreover, bearing in mind the nature of the sodium, which is  used as coolant, we confirmed that the internal storage unit for  the large volume of liquid sodium was classified appropriately  in terms of aseismatic design.    (3) Important Systems and Equipment for the Safety of  Nuclear  Reactor Facilities    Regarding the nuclear reactor, considering the fact that it  utilizes MOX fuel, sodium coolant, and high-speed neutrons, we  confirmed that:     -  even though it was probable that, in the  case of a sodium void, the reaction coefficient in the  inner-reactor core would be positive, countermeasures for  contingencies such as the prevention of sodium boiling were  adequately thought out. Moreover, because of factors such as the  reactor's output power coefficient being designed to possess the  special characteristic of negative feedback (unique safety) and  because the reactor was designed so that, even in a situation  where the control rod which exerts the greatest influence over  the rate of reaction could not be inserted, the reactor core  could still be maintained within operational limits, we  determined that the nuclear reactor's design was appropriate.    -  Considering the fuel burnup and the control rod insertion  conditions, given facts such as, even in a situation  anticipating power distribution during a state of maximum heat  generation in each sphere, the fuel's maximum temperature would  remain below its melting point, we determined that the fuel was  sound and, additionally, that the temperature of the sodium  coolant would remain below its boiling point. Therefore, we  confirmed that the design of the nuclear reactor's thermal flow  power was appropriate.       Regarding the instrumentation control system, we confirmed  that this system was designed in a manner so that it could,  during periods of both normal operations and abnormal  transitional changes, operate to ensure the soundness of the  nuclear reactor and other facilities, along with being able to  monitor and/or regulate important parameters such as the  temperature and flow rates in the primary and secondary coolant  systems, the particle fluence rate, the liquid state of the  sodium in the reactor vessel, and the temperature of the  atmosphere beneath the nuclear reactor container floor, also  maintaining these parameters within appropriate operational  bounds.    Furthermore, we confirmed that the system was designed so  that, even during accidents, it could be able to continuously  monitor and record the temperature in the atmosphere beneath the  nuclear reactor housing vessel floor and measure and monitor the  density of radioactive materials within the primary argon gas  system and in the nuclear reactor housing vessel.    Regarding the nuclear reactor's coolant system, we confirmed  that it would be able to appropriately cool the reactor core  during both normal operations and abnormal operational  transitional changes, as well as during an accident. Along with  that, it was considered highly unlikely that the nuclear  reactor's coolant boundary (which acts as a barrier preventing  radioactive substances in the primary coolant etc. from leaking  to the outside) could be damaged. In other words, it was  confirmed that:     -  the machinery and piping that make up the  nuclear reactor's coolant boundary were designed, bearing in  mind the nature of the sodium coolant which is used in the  reactor (that functions under low pressure but with high  temperatures), with appropriate consideration given to the  material's special characteristics, including creep and factors  such as their transitional thermal response power. Further, the  system was designed so that, even during the period in which  materials were supplied, important parts underwent regular  necessary inspections; and,    -  even during a leak of the primary  coolant, the plant was designed so that there would be no  hindrance to the circulation of the primary coolant through  measures such as the placing of primary coolant (which is  essential for the reactor) in a guard vessel, which has adequate  capacity for the reactor vessel and other systems. Furthermore,  the system was designed so that, even during the period in which  materials such as the reactor vessel and the guard vessel were  supplied, important parts underwent regular necessary  inspections.       Moreover, we also confirmed things such as:     -  the  secondary coolant system is designed such that leaks from the  primary coolant system to the secondary coolant system are  restrained by maintaining the pressure in the secondary coolant  system higher than that found in the primary system.  Furthermore, even in cases where water/vapor leaks into the  secondary coolant system because of damage to the steam  generator heat transfer piping, the system has been designed to  prevent the buildup of excessive pressure in the secondary  coolant system through the automatic high-speed blowing  operation of internal water and steam and through the  installation of equipment to store the sodium/water reactive  substance, and    -  in order to prevent solidification of the sodium  in the primary or secondary coolant systems caused by excessive  cooling, the system was designed to include emergency heating  units. Even during periods when the reactor is shut down, the  temperature of the sodium can be maintained at around 180C  (the melting point of sodium is around 100C).       Regarding the reactor container, we confirmed that,  considering situations such as a primary coolant leak accident,  it could withstand the temperatures and pressures that would be  produced by the release of the maximum possible amount of  energy, and that its soundness would be able to be maintained  without exceeding the fixed leak rate.  <H5>  Evaluation of Exposure Dose During Periods of Normal </H5> Operations [omitted]  <H5>  Evaluation of the Safety Design </H5>   (1) Analysis of Abnormal Transitional Changes During Reactor  Operation    Regarding reactor operation, we confirmed that the analysis  and estimates were appropriately performed on the following  selected unusual transitional phenomena which could be caused by  factors such as the possible simple breakage of equipment during  the life-span of the nuclear reactor which could, at its worst,  lead to malfunction, or simple operator error: 1. abnormal  changes in the reaction rates or power distribution within the  reactor core; 2. abnormal heat generation in, or heat removal  from, the reactor core, and 3. phenomena associated with a  chemical reaction of sodium.    Further, we confirmed that the standard used for making this  evaluation was appropriate; namely, that in order for there to  be no excessive damage to the fuel or the nuclear reactor  coolant boundary, none of the following temperatures be  exceeded:     -  the temperature in the heart of the thick fuel  cladding would be less than 830C,    -  the temperature of the  sodium in the reactor core would not reach its boiling point,    -  the temperature in the reactor coolant boundary be 600C,  and    -  that the temperature never exceed 1.4 times the maximum  operating temperature.       Therefore, as a result of the analysis/evaluation regarding  any conceived abnormal transitional changes during reactor  operation, we confirmed that any phenomenon could be resolved  and the reactor could be returned to normal operational status  before any damage could be caused to the reactor core or to the  reactor's coolant boundary.    (2) Accident Analysis    There are cases of abnormal situations occurring which  exceed  those considered under "Abnormal Transitional Changes During  Reactor Operation," even though it is thought that the frequency  of such events occurring would be extremely small. The phenomena  which must be considered from the point of view of evaluating  the soundness of the reactor facility and the possibility of  release of radioactive materials from the reactor into the  surrounding environment, are: 1. an increase of the reaction  rate within the reactor core; 2. a reduction in the  functionality of the coolant in the reactor core; 3. an accident  occurring connected with the handling of the fuel; 4. an  accident connected with the waste-processing facility; 5. a  sodium chemical reaction, and 6. an accident associated with the  reactor cover gas system. We confirmed that the  analysis/evaluations performed in such cases were appropriate.    We determined that the standard used for making this  evaluation was appropriate. This standard was: 1. that no major  damage occur to the reactor core, and that adequate cooling was  still possible; 2. that the reactor container's leak rate remain  below specified values (the temperature and pressure at the  reactor container boundary be below the maximum operating  temperature and pressure); 3. that the temperature of the  reactor coolant boundary remain below 650C, and below 1.6  times the maximum operating temperature, and 4. that such a  situation would not pose a risk of significant radiation  exposure to the surrounding public.    Moreover, we confirmed that, given the fact that the coolant  used in the "Monju" reactor is sodium, adequate consideration  and analysis was given to factors such as the probable positive  reaction rates in the inner reactor core in case of sodium void  and the impact of a burnup reaction of the leaked sodium.    As a result of this evaluation and analysis of possible  accidents, we confirmed that an accident would not cause major  damage to the reactor core or impede the cooling of the reactor  core. We also confirmed that such an accident would not pose a  risk of significant exposure to radioactivity to the public  through the release of radioactive materials into the  environment.    Moreover, in the case of "Monju," in addition to performing  accident analysis, because our operating experience with  sodium-cooled FBRs is limited, we considered phenomena that  would have occurrence frequencies even less than those of  accidents, but which would have important results, and, as a  result of analysis/evaluation, confirmed that the release of  radioactive materials would be adequately controlled.  <H5>  Site Evaluation [omitted] </H5></p>

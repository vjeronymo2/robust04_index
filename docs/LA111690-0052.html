			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH FIRM AS HUSSEIN ASSAILS 'PRECONDITIONS'  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein insisted Thursday that negotiations with the  United States and Saudi Arabia are the only way to resolve the Persian Gulf  crisis, but President Bush said he will not back down just "so you, sir, can  have some face."  </P> <P> Speaking in separate television interviews, Bush blamed Iraq for the recent  slowdown in the U.S. economy, and Hussein said the Persian Gulf crisis could  end if the United States would stop insisting on "preconditions for  capitulation."  </P> <P> Bush, who leaves Washington tonight on a seven-day trip to Europe, Saudi Arabia  and Egypt that includes a Thanksgiving Day visit with U.S. troops in the gulf  area, said that fears of war notwithstanding, the world cannot endure an  indefinite stalemate in the region.  </P> <P> His remarks came only a day after he assured congressional leaders that war  with Iraq is not imminent and that he will give economic sanctions more time to  pressure Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait.  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush expressed confidence that, if war breaks out, "I think  the American people will support their President. I think they know I'm  prudent."  </P> <P> Speaking in a half-hour interview with Cable News Network in the White House  Map Room, Bush said he is to blame, to some extent, if the nation is uncertain  about why he has decided to send more than 400,000 troops to Saudi Arabia and  nearby waters.  </P> <P> "We're dealing with naked aggression, we're dealing with brutality  unprecedented in recent times, and we're dealing with a threat to the national  security of this country and other countries," he said, acknowledging that the  television interview gave him an opportunity to once again state his  objectives.  </P> <P> Attributing a share of the nation's current economic problems to war jitters,  Bush said: "Look what's happening in our own country right now. There's a  slowdown, an economic slowdown. And it's a disproportionate increase in the  price of oil that stems from what Saddam Hussein has done. . . . It does mean  jobs."  </P> <P> But, he suggested, the situation is worse in the Third World, where "the  have-nots . . . are being driven to their knees by these (oil) prices."  </P> <P> "The Iraq situation, with this speculative effect on the price of oil, has  complicated and worsened our own economy and the economies of our neighbors and  the economies of the rest of the world," he said.  </P> <P> The President held out little room for compromise with Hussein. Responding to  suggestions that a deal could be worked out by providing Iraq with access to  the Persian Gulf over land that lies within Kuwait, Bush said:  </P> <P> "When you rape, pillage and plunder a neighbor, should you then ask the world:  'Hey, give me a little face, give me a little face-saving, so I can do what I  should have done months ago?' Should we be saying to him: 'We're going to  reward your aggression by peeling off some part of somebody else's country?' "  </P> <P> Referring to the foreigners held captive in Iraq, some as "human shields"  against attacks on potential military targets, and to the Iraqi siege of  foreign embassies in Kuwait city, the President continued:  </P> <P> "Should we say the brutality to these hostages and the way you've treated these  embassies should be rewarded in some way, so you, sir, can have some face?  </P> <P> "The answer is no, there isn't going to be a compromise with this kind of naked  aggression."  </P> <P> Bush also said that once the crisis ends, there must be "some international  guarantees" regarding future limits on Iraq.  </P> <P> Referring to Hussein's chemical weapons and his efforts to develop nuclear  weapons, he said: "I don't think the rest of the world would say this is good  enough, just what they call the status quo ante, going back to where things  were before the invasion" of Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> "You'd have to have some international safeguards," he said.  </P> <P> The President has come under increasing pressure in recent days from Congress  to provide a clearer explanation of his intentions in the gulf.  </P> <P> On Thursday, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) called  Bush "an inept communicator" and said he should better explain his reasons for  the massive military deployment.  </P> <P> Bush "has failed to convey to the public why we are in Saudi Arabia," Aspin  said.  </P> <P> But Aspin, a supporter of the President's gulf policy, added: "In defense of  George Bush, this is not a simple thing to state. It's not a bumper-sticker  kind of rationale. It's not 'making the world safe for democracy,' like it was  in World War I."  </P> <P> In the televised interview, Bush expressed irritation with his congressional  critics, saying, "You can't have 435 commanders in chief.  </P> <P> "I've read the Constitution. They have the right to declare war, and I have the  right, as commander in chief, to fulfill my responsibilities," he said.  "Individual congressmen may look at this differently than I do, and some are  willing to tell me what not to do, but (they are) a little bit fuzzy and  unclear on what to do."  </P> <P> Although he refused to be pinned down on how long he would wait for the  economic sanctions put in place by the U.N. Security Council to force Iraq to  withdraw, he made clear that there are limits -- not only to his patience but  to the patience of the public.  </P> <P> "Holding public opinion forever in any country is very difficult to do," he  said. "In any country, I think there is a ticking of the clock. . . . I don't  think this matter is going to go on forever. As far as I'm concerned, it's  not."  </P> <P> Bush challenged assertions that there may be a parallel between the escalating  involvement in the gulf and the Vietnam War, which began in the late 1950s with  the deployment of small numbers of troops and grew over the following decade to  a deployment of 530,000 American troops at one point.  </P> <P> "There's not going to be any long, drawn-out agony of Vietnam," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in an interview with ABC News, Hussein insisted that there can be  peace in the region only if an agreement is reached that is "comprehensive,  complete and final."  </P> <P> Asked if Iraq's current position is negotiable, Hussein declared: "When I say  something, I mean it."  </P> <P> Just as Bush appeared to be holding firm in his insistence that there be no  reward for Iraqi aggression, Hussein seemed to be seeking to open a split in  the coalition against him by suggesting a readiness to bargain, as he has in  the past.  </P> <P> But he strongly rejected a pledge to withdraw from Kuwait as a precondition for  peace talks. Bush's call for a withdrawal, he said, is "not dialogue."  </P> <P> "These are preconditions for capitulation," Hussein said. "On what basis is  there to be dialogue. . . ? Will he (Bush) continue imposing this boycott, this  blockade, on us?"  </P> <P> The two presidents addressed the gulf situation as American and Saudi forces  inside Saudi Arabia began their most comprehensive joint exercise yet,  involving more than 2,200 Marines, hundreds of Army commandos and as many as  1,100 combat aircraft.  </P> <P> The large-scale maneuver, dubbed "Imminent Thunder," is intended to refine and  test communications and cooperative procedures between the massive U.S. forces  and their Saudi hosts, the Pentagon said.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials and independent military analysts have voiced concerns that  if the allies decide to go to war against Iraqi troops, confusion over command  relationships and complex lines of communication would hamper the effectiveness  of the U.S.-led forces.  </P> <P> The exercise includes a mock Marine landing 25 miles south of Saudi Arabia's  border with Kuwait -- a move some lawmakers criticized as provocative.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Melissa Healy and Karen Tumulty contributed to this report.  </P></p>

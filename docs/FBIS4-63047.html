			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Military Will Be Put on a </F> Starvation Diet"]    [Text] As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned, Viktor  Chernomyrdin has sent to the State Duma a draft federal law: On  Changes, Suspension, and Revocation of Some Legislative  Enactments Bearing on the Military Laws Package. In a cover  letter, the prime minister notes that owing to the existing  financial and economic situation, a shortage of funds and a  budget deficit, it is impossible to preserve privileges for the  military. It will take 90 trillion rubles [R] to implement all  the measures envisioned earlier and therefore it is essential to  reduce food ration compensations from R60,000 to the minimum  monthly wage level (R14,620) and fully to abolish credits for  housing construction programs for the military.</p>

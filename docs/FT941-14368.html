			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: New peaks for the FT-SE 100 and the Mid 250 - Market report Favourable data on UK inflation and retail sales combined with a buying frenzy among the second line stocks to take the UK equity market to a new peak yesterday. The FT-SE 100-share Index broke through to a new trading high at midsession before settling to a new closing peak of 3,475.1, for an advance on the day of 38.1. However, the 1 per cent gain in the Footsie was well outpaced by the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which bounded ahead by nearly 4 per cent, closing 135.5 points up at an all-time high of 4,148.8. Demand for the Mid 250 issues, swollen for the past week as investors searched for undervalued stocks, rocketed yesterday when a leading Swiss-based investment bank struggled to put in around Pounds 1bn as the preliminary move to issuing a covered warrant on the sector. The UK stock market came near to splitting into two halves yesterday. The Footsie blue chips opened firmly, spurred on by strong performances in Far Eastern markets overnight and by interest rate optimism across other European bourses ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank. With the market only one hour into official trading, the pace was put into overdrive by the announcement of the latest UK retail prices and sales data, which indicated that inflation was still under control while retail sales were disappointing - the perfect background for a cut in base rates, according to equity traders. The annualised rise of 1.9 per cent in December's retail price index and a surprising fall of 0.2 per cent in December retail sales was followed by a jump in the Footsie, which at midsession stood at a new intraday peak of 3,484.5, a gain of 47.5. Share gains were also fuelled by strong rises in UK government bond prices in response to the statistics on the domestic economy. Analysts were somewhat confused by the retail sales statistics which appeared to contradict other recent data. However, the unexpected fall in December sales revived hopes that the widely-predicted cut in UK base rates might now arrive earlier than the spring. Hopes of an early cut in base rates had been postponed in view of the impending impact of the UK budget measures announced last November. At least two trading programmes marched across the dealing screens, and prices were again driven forward by frantic activity by marketmakers whose stock books were repeatedly emptied, forcing them to join the rush of buyers in the marketplace. Investors were completely unwilling to part with stock, so prices were forced higher. Once again, the blue chips were led forward by the stock index futures market, where the December contract traded comfortably above 3,500 at its best moment. It was soon clear, however, that it was the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks which were capturing much of the interest. The Footsie stocks eased back, the Index shedding about 12 points of the early gain, before regaining its poise as Wall Street edged into a gain of 8.7 Dow points in early deals and continental European bourses extended their gains. Seaq volume of 1,320.7m shares, reflected the heavy trading in the smaller capitalised stocks; non-Footsie business made up around 66 per cent of the total. On Tuesday, 964.9m shares traded through Seaq for a retail worth of Pounds 2.17bn, one of the highest figures for the past twelve months.</p>

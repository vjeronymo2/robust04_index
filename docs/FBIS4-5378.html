			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 11 April that under the basic  policy of annually collecting reunification funds -- which may  reach hundreds of million and billion of won -- in preparation  for the approach of the immediate reunification of the Korean  peninsula, the government has begun to study concrete measures  on the form of fund collection, the principle for using funds,  and subjects of fund collection.    The government has decided to formulate a policy to prepare  for the period after reunification as they do not rule out the  possibility that the North Korean system may suddenly collapse  due to the recently increasing number of North Korean escapees.    A relevant government official in charge of security-related  affairs said that "the present confirmed position of the  government is to collect annually reunification funds in  preparation for the approach of the immediate reunification,"  and that "the government will decide on the total amount of  reunification funds only after studying concrete measures, such  as the method of collecting funds, principle for using funds,  and subjects of fund collection."    Another relevant government official in charge of  security-related affairs said: "The government has just  established a Unification and Security Policy Coordination  Council, which Chongwadae [presidential office] will directly  operate. We can say that this is related to the serious move  recently shown inside North Korea. The reunification funds can  be spent, in the form of emergency funds, on the fulfillment of  major projects that will be carried out during the period after  national reunification."    Although the government has studied plans to collect funds  --  which, so far, have been dependent upon people's donations -- it  has had difficulties making decisions due to President Kim  Yong-sam's proposed principle of prohibiting people from  donating funds in a quasi-tax form.    The official said: "It is difficult to estimate the funds  necessary for reunification, it is even more difficult to  appropriate funds -- which would total hundred millions and  billions of won -- from the government's budget or its reserve  funds. Therefore, the government will collect funds from people  in the form of donations or from bonds for national  reunification. It will carry out the plans as soon as possible  when there is consensus among people."    The government also believes North-South cooperation funds  would be needed more in case the North Korean nuclear issue is  resolved and progress is made in North-South relations.  Accordingly, it has studied plans to increase North-South  cooperation funds, which presently totals approximately 100  billion won.    Reunification funds are different from North-South  cooperation funds in that the former are funds to prepare for  the period after national reunification.</p>

Nothing is said in their applications that they  are resigning because they do not agree with the policy pursued  by heads of the ministry," Public Health Minister Eduard  Nechayev told ITAR-TASS, commenting on the resignation of First  Deputy Minister Aleksey Moskvichev and Deputy Minister Vladimir  Starodubov.    New candidates to the posts have already been found, a  ministry spokesman told ITAR-TASS. They are doctors of medicine  and, in the opinion of senior officials, they are skilled  professionals. According to the same source, the two resigning  deputy ministers will quickly find employment for themselves.  Starodubov will probably continue to work at the medical  institute. He combined that job with working as deputy minister.</p>

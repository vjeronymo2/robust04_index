"Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told his South Korean  counterpart Han Sung-chu that if the international community  applied pressure on North Korea, then North Korea would have no  choice but to take military action," the source said.    Qian was quoted as stressing China's belief that the  situation should not be allowed to deteriorate and that dialogue  among the countries concerned must continue.    Qian reportedly admitted that China would be put in an  awkward position if North Korea were slapped with economic  sanctions through a United Nations Security Council resolution.    The official quoted Qian as saying, "China does not want to  see a UN observation party deployed at the Chinese border with  North Korea to monitor whether economic sanctions on North Korea  are being implemented."    Qian, adding that such action might trigger an exodus of  North Koreans into China as well as compel North Korea into  provoking a war, suggested that China would oppose economic  sanctions against Pyongyang, the official said.    Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed at his  summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam the "four-party,  three- channel" solution -- that is, resolution through three  channels of talks between South and North Korea, between North  Korea and the United States, and between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Jiang told South Korean journalists that if tension  continued  to mount on the Korean peninsula, the first to suffer would be  the Korean people.</p>

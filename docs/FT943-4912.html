			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Card-sized video camera gives portable computers fresh image British technologists have created what they claim is the world's first commercially available miniature video camera able to capture and incorporate images directly on to a portable personal computer. The credit-card sized 'PC Card Camera', developed by VLSI Vision (VVL) of Edinburgh, and costing about Pounds 600 with connections and software, is seen as having widespread business applications in industries where employees use portable computers to collect information. Damage assessors working for insurance companies, for example, could add photographic images of wrecked vehicles or property to their reports. Mr Alastair Minty, the company's product manager, said the camera, available now, has been on trial with a number of large companies over the past few months. In its present form, the camera can take single black and white snapshots or sequences of stills and incorporate them into documents on the computer screen. The card is attached by wire to a camera, about the size of a walnut, consisting of a microchip and a tiny lens. Mr Minty said that with additional software full motion video was possible. The camera opens up new possibilities for companies with staff in the field who use porta-ble computers. Images of individuals, documents and events can all be captured and recorded by the card camera and incorporated into reports. Connected to a mobile telephone system, the card camera would make personal video conferences between the office and a field location possible. Mr Minty said the company would shortly be adding sound to the system. VVL, formed in 1990 by Professor Peter Denyer of Edinburgh University and Mr Roy Warrender, a computer engineer, is credited with developing the smallest and cheapest video cameras on the market. It has produced a video camera on a single microchip selling for less than Dollars 10 (Pounds 6.40). VVL is developing video systems for Donnelly Corporation, a large US-based vehicle components manufacturer, which holds a sizeable minority stake in the company.</p>

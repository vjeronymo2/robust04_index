			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> HARBOR HOLDS OFF COMPTON; SOUTHWEST BEATS WEST L.A.  </P> <P> Flanker Vini Bjazevich's 20-yard touchdown run on a reverse gave the Harbor  College football team a 24-22 victory over Compton Saturday afternoon at  Compton.  </P> <P> With the victory, the Seahawks (5-5) finished with the school's first .500 mark  since 1986.  </P> <P> "We've improved a lot in two years," Harbor Coach Don Weems said. "We won five  ballgames. Now we want to get to where we win eight or nine every year."  </P> <P> An inspired Compton team was simply trying to finish the season with a victory.  </P> <P> Compton (0-10) might have had it if not for two botched plays inside the Harbor  15-yard line in the first quarter, a fourth-quarter fumble at the Harbor 25 and  a 29-yard field goal attempt by Heuston Costello that sailed wide with 35  seconds left in the game.  </P> <P> But Compton's gutsy effort impressed Weems.  </P> <P> "They wanted to win," Weems said. "They showed a tremendous amount of courage  by playing hard through a tough season. We needed them to miss that last field  goal in order to win it."  </P> <P> Harbor quarterback Glenn Baham, who played with a sprained ankle, completed  seven of 11 passes for 140 yards.  </P> <P> Seahawk sophomore Bill Harris rushed 24 times for 145 yards, including a  19-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Bjazevich did the rest. He scored on a 43-yard pass from Baham in the second  quarter and kicked a 27-yard field goal in the third.  </P> <P> L.A. Southwest 33, West L.A. 8 -- L.A. Southwest ended its season with a  Western State Conference victory over West L.A. at Southwest.  </P> <P> The Cougars snapped a three-game losing streak and finished the year with a 4-6  record and 3-6 in the WSC.  </P> <P> Sophomore quarterback Craig Manigo completed 10 of 17 passes for 132 yards and  three touchdowns. Freshman wide receiver Mike Stephens caught three passes for  68 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught a two-point conversion pass.  </P> <P> George Sylvester and David Mack scored Southwest's other touchdowns. Mack  returned a West L.A. punt 60 yards for his score.

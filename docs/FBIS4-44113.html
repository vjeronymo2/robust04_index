			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Mainz ZDF Television Network in German  at 1705 GMT on 26 June in its "Heute" program carries 10 minutes  of live statements by leading party officials of Saxony-Anhalt  to questions by ZDF correspondent Barbara Friedrichs on the  preliminary results of today's Landtag election, which give the  Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 35 percent of the vote, the  Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) 34 percent, the Free  Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) 3.7 percent, the Party of  Democratic Socialism (PDS) 19 percent, the Greens 5.1 percent,  and the Republikaner 1.3 percent.    Minister President Christoph Bergner (CDU) describes the  result as "relatively positive." "For me it is important that  we have stuck to our political course," which is what was  honored by the voters. He expresses his thanks to those who  supported the CDU, adding that he was "sure" that the support  from Bonn in the election was important. "I have the impression  that the support by the federal chancellor was most effective  here" compared to the appearances of other party leaders from  Bonn in the Saxony-Anhalt election campaign.    Asked about a possible grand coalition, which now seems the  only possibility for a new government since both the CDU and the  SPD ruled out a coalition with the PDS even before the election,  Bergner says that the current "constellation" is "not very  good." He does, however, support coalition talks with the SPD,  "and then we will see how easy or difficult this is going to be."    Reinhard Hoeppner, chairman of the SPD group in the  Saxony-Anhalt Landtag, argues that coalition talks with the CDU  will not be easy since there are "a number of essential  differences" between the two parties. "The decisive thing,"  however is "to advance the country." He is optimistic that his  party will "overcome" the "difficult constellation." He is "not  particularly happy" about the apparently inevitable grand  coalition with the CDU, and adds that he is still "worrying"  about the fact that the Greens will be represented in the new  Landtag. Hoeppner then says: "I have my doubts whether it  would be good for the development of democracy in our country if  the PDS were the only opposition party." The SPD official notes  that, compared to the European election, "we have increased" our  share in the vote again.    Peter Kunert, chairman of the FDP group of Saxony-Anhalt,  which lost more than 10 percentage points from the 1990 results,  and will not be represented in the new Landtag, blames the poor  result on the "negative trend" in which his party has been for  some time. "The voters did not honor" the FDP's work in  Saxony-Anhalt, and we will have to "analyze" the result. He  does "not rule out" personal consequences.    Petra Sitte, chairwoman of the PDS group in the Landtag,  says  that her party's good result has "certainly" nothing to do with  a "nostalgia for the GDR," as suggested by the ZDF  correspondent. The high score is partly due to the "protest" by  the electorate, but she also believes that "the PDS has been  recognized" as an opposition power. "I also think that building  a coalition against the PDS, as was tried in the past few days,  has not worked out." She adds that "for us, political  responsibility also means responsibility as opposition."    Heidrun Heidecke, spokeswoman for Alliance 90/Greens, argues  that the result "clearly shows" that the reformist forces in  Saxony-Anhalt are "not as strong as in the old laender."  Nevertheless, one must not forget that Alliance 90/Greens is  still "a young party." She assumes that her party can continue  its work in the opposition in the next four years and will be  able to set its own "accents."</p>

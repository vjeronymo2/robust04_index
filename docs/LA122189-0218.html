			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IMPORT PRICES INCREASE A LITTLE  </P> <P> The average price for imports increased slightly from October to November while  the price of exports fell, the Labor Department said today.  </P> <P> The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said import prices increased 0.3%,  the third consecutive monthly gain, while export prices slipped 0.4%.  </P> <P> The increase in import prices was led by more expensive capital and consumer  goods. Capital goods increased 0.5% in price in October after slipping in the  previous two months. The price of imported consumer goods rose 0.9% in October.  </P> <P> The monthly slip in export prices, which followed two consecutive monthly  increases, reflected declines in agricultural and non-agricultural prices, the  department said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Pay Scale Recommendations -- "The issue of politicians' pay-  packets in the new South Africa...will not go away. Nor should  it." So begins an editorial in the Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 23 May on page 10. The editorial argues that it is  wrong to justify the pay recommendations with comparisons to  what previous government leaders or corporate executives or  leaders of foreign countries are paid. It concludes by calling  for President Mandela "to take the lead in suggesting that the  Melamet proposals be scaled down -- not to the point of punitive  austerity, but to be in line with South Africa's economic status  in the world."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Credit Responsibilities -- An editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 23 May begins by noting  that accepting the responsibilities "that will come with the  granting of an international credit rating will be central to  gaining access to international capital markets." It goes on to  argue that South Africa must convince the credit rating agencies  "that excessive government spending will not derail the economy  and that the money we borrow will be used to generate the  economic growth needed to underpin our capacity to service our  domestic and foreign debt." Noting the importance of both the  Reconstruction and Development Plan and the way it is to be  financed, the editorial concludes: "Just as President Mandela  will need to reassure the electorate that government's domestic  responsibilities will not be shirked so, too, will he need to  guarantee to the rest of the world that the country's  international responsibilities will not be subordinated to  domestic political expediency."    Land Transfer -- An editorial in the Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on page 10 on 23 May examines the "surreptitious KwaZulu  land transfer," which, it argues, "was a cynical attempt by the  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to secure and expand its power base  and deny an ANC-dominated central government a sphere of  influence in a major part of KwaZulu-Natal." The editorial  characterizes the role of former President de Klerk in the deal  as "somewhat inexplicable" and says that the motive of the IFP  should have been obvious to him and should have caused him to  balk on the deal. The editorial concludes: "A reversal of the  transfer is an obvious option but not necessarily the correct or  only one. We urge President Nelson Mandela to make a careful  study of the situation and not be rushed into a response or  decision."    Affirmative Action -- The Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English  carries an editorial on page 8 of its 18 May issue in which it  addresses the need for an affirmative action program. It argues  that "affirmative action should be enforceable by law" because  leaving it to the discretion of employers would result in  tokenism. On the other hand, it advises against "a blanket  scheme with specific quotas." The editorial continues: "A  comprehensive policy of training must be embarked on. The  training must be from the bottom up, so that black employees are  not promoted beyond their own levels of experience or  qualifications....Nothing can be more damaging to the  self-esteem of promising black employees than to find themselves  in positions with which they cannot cope. Merit must be a major  criterion, even if it is not the only one."</p>

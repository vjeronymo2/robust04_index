			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Thinking about a possible recovery Currency dealers, faced with the sudden surge in the dollar at the end of last week, gave their standard imitation of the police chief at the end of Casablanca who ordered: 'Round up the usual suspects'. Their explanations were widely assorted, and often mutually contradictory. The dollar rose because Mr Bush said he felt fine. It rose because the Japanese had failed to endorse an expected devaluation of the dollar, or because the Group of Seven was expected to push it up. It rose because US unemployment had risen (on the principle that bad news leads to Fed easing, and is thus good news), or because employment had risen. The only reliable lesson is one which experience taught me many years ago; never ask a dealer to explain prices, because he is much too close to the action. The only entirely convincing answer I ever heard came from a man reputed at the time to be the shrewdest operator in London when he said he knew what was what on a particular occasion: 'Because I was getting more bids than I could handle on my book.' The wisdom-after-the-event, or chartist, version of this is also quite convincing this time round: 'Because the dollar is oversold.' All else is speculation, but at least on this occasion there is something to speculate about. For some time now, the Wall Street equity market and some of its more impressive gurus have been suggesting that the next big event in the US economy will be not only a recovery, but one that will be quite vigorous and will start quite soon. The new optimists are still a minority, but they include some of those who gave the most accurate warnings of the strength and duration of the recession, including, from opposite ends of the financial spectrum, the Bank Credit Analyst, which concentrates on the financial economy, and Robert Brusca, of Nikko Securities, whose readings of the official indicators of the real economy have been notably uncoloured by dogma or wishful thinking. When these two agree, there is at least something for the rest of us to think about. Their two bullish views have a common thread: that the structural adjustments which have caused the US downturn are now well advanced, so that normal business growth can resume. On the financial side, the severe over-leveraging which made the market so fragile has been substantially reduced, while the massive reduction in short-term interest rates has made the remaining debt burden quite manageable. Above all, perhaps, the restoration of banking margins should have revived the confidence of banking lenders. Abandoning growth for growth's sake is one thing, but turning your back on profitable business quite another. This financial restoration, however, merely removes a major barrier to recovery; something more than a six per cent real growth rate in exports is required to start solid growth in this largely closed economy. Here it is the adjustment in the real economy which is encouraging, if you are in any mood for encouragement. It points to rising domestic sales, despite flat incomes. The consumer-debt-to-income ratio is now about half way from its peak to its normal level. Inflation is low and still falling, to the benefit of real incomes, and job losses have slowed down sharply, if you believe the seasonal adjustments, which should lead to some revival of consumer confidence. Most important, the first stirrings of revival are already visible in the consumer market. Turnover in the market for existing houses has been quite solidly up ever since midsummer, and now the downturn in new buildings seems to be over, though growth is feeble so far. This should lead to a matching revival of sales of household equipment and furnishings. Finally, there is something of a famine in recent used cars; as trade-in prices harden, sales of new cars should at last revive. This catalogue seems to me to establish that there is a bright side to the US economic picture. The latest employment figures are almost certainly a false dawn, because they owe everything to the seasonal adjustment of government employment, and almost nothing to the market economy. Further, the optimistic picture leaves out some forbidding details - defence cuts, a low savings rate which suggests continuing financial strain, and renewed weakness in surveys of industrial sentiment. All the same, the optimists have some current evidence to cite, and rely on no wishful thinking about fiscal kick-starts. A consumer-led revival in US demand is at least possible, if not yet probable; one can see why the markets may be excitable (if it has not just been a Bush rally). And thinking about a US upturn at least provides a check-list of factors which could justify the British Treasury's obstinate faith in a similar recovery here. To start with the bright side, real income growth here has remained strong, and the current price war in the retail side should make it it still stronger. The high personal savings rate suggests prudence, not strain. The very low stock levels at all stages of production and distribution mean that any revival in sales should feed through very quickly to orders for current production - or imports (and probably both). Meanwhile, export growth does provide some basic support - slower than for the US, but more important in a more open economy. The real economy could justify some nervous optimism - nervous mainly about the balance of payments. It is the financial picture which is remains as forbidding as ever. This is not so much because of the record bankruptcy rate, which makes people insecure in their jobs but could be consistent with an upturn. Although when one hears, as I did last week, of accountants failing because more than three quarters of their clients cannot pay, we have clearly reached grim altitudes. It is the consumer debt ratios being still at their peak, a housing market stuck in nervous debility and the funereal tone in which bankers still discuss their prospects which show how far we still have to go.</p>

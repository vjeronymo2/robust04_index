			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["55th Anniversary of Victory in Musan Area Battle Marked" </F> -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was  held at the People's Palace of Culture today on the occasion of  the 55th anniversary of the victory in the Musan area battle  organized and commanded by the great leader President Kim  Il-song.    Present at the meeting were Pak Song-chol, member of the  Political Bureau of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the Workers'  Party of Korea [WPK] and vice-president; Choe Kwang, member of  the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK and chief of the  general staff of the Korean People's Army; and other party and  government officials.    Kang Sok-sung, member of the C.C., the WPK and director of  the Party History Institute of the Party Central Committee,  delivered a report.    He said the battle, which recorded a shining page in the  Korean people's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle, was  a historic operation of advance into the homeland which was  organized under an outstanding plan of the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song to lead to a constant upsurge the Korean revolution  as a whole with the anti- Japanese armed struggle in its centre,  thus promoting the cause of national liberation, and which was  waged under his wise guidance.    He quoted President Kim Il-song as saying:    "...The Musan area battle was, indeed, a significant one  which greatly helped further inspire the people in the homeland  with the spirit of the anti-Japanese struggle and lead the  revolutionary movement to a higher tide."    The reporter said:    Grave difficulties were created before the Korean revolution  in the period around the Musan area battle, with the Japanese  imperialists intensifying the reactionary offensive as never  before.    In those days President Kim Il-song called a meeting at  Beidadingzi in April 1939 and indicated the policy of dealing  one strike after another at the Japanese imperialist aggressors  through a vigorous counter-offensive and advancing into the  homeland again.    Under this policy, the great leader advanced into the  homeland across the Amnok River, leading the main unit of the  Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) on May 18, 1939.    The members of the KPRA including Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an  indomitable communist revolutionary fighter, conducted political  propaganda in various forms, renewing their firm determination  to bring earlier the day of national liberation.    President Kim Il-song made a historic speech "Let Us Rise Up  Vigorously in the Anti-Japanese Struggle To Hasten the  Liberation of the Homeland" before Sinsadong people.    In his speech, he clarified the character and mission of the  KPRA and said that the entire nation must unite closely as one  on the anti-Japanese front, turn out courageously in the sacred  war against Japanese imperialism and actively support the KPRA.    Upset by the advance of the KPRA into the Musan area, the  Japanese imperialists mobilized a large force and desperately  chased the unit.    Seeing through the enemy's intention, the great leader, with  a superb operation of allurement and ambush, wiped out at one  stroke the enemy attempting to "encircle and annihilate" the  KPRA on the Taehongdan plain on May 23, thus concluding the  historic operation of advance into the Musan area with a  brilliant victory.    In his report, Kang Sok-sung said "the advance of the KPRA  into the homeland and the historic victory in the Musan area  battle were a brilliant fruition of the chuche-based military  idea and commanding art of the respected leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, an ever- victorious iron-willed brilliant commander and  great military strategist, and a historic event which led the  Korean revolution as a whole centering on the anti-Japanese  armed struggle to a constant upswing under the banner of chuche."</p>

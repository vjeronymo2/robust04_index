			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (2): Touchstone of an industrial revolution - Responsible Care, born in Canada, is turning into a world-wide code of practice Win over the workforce and you will have done much of the hard work on implementing Responsible Care, the industry's international code of practice on environmental protection. That's the advice of Ray Grainger, the UK Chemical Industries Association director of Responsible Care and sector businesses. He adds: 'While there are a number of important target audiences for the Responsible Care message of improved environmental performance, the employees can be a company's best ambassadors and advocates.' It is hardly surprising that, as a North American creation, it is the Canadian and US industries that are blazing the trail to Responsible Care. Initiated in Canada in the mid-1980s and embraced by the US in 1988, Responsible Care is now catching on throughout the rest of the world, South Africa being the latest to join the converts. Canada has in place all its codes of management practice, and clearly most US companies are in the advanced stages of implementing the programme. Indeed, the US Chemical Manufacturers Association is pushing ahead with third party verification of management systems and has said the companies that fail to implement the programme properly would eventually be candidates for expulsion from the Association. Responsible Care reflects a cultural revolution that has taken place within the chemical industry. The glossy environmental brochures that are now being published by the major chemical companies would not have been possible five to 10 years ago. Some chemical companies shied away from providing what they regarded as sensitive information, others argued that regulatory compliance was enough, while others said the information would be far too technical to broadcast. However, it soon became clear to the most far sighted industry executives that there was a danger that companies could lose their licence to operate if they did not demonstrate a commitment to improving environmental performances. Consequently, the concept of Responsible Care was developed to provide a framework for companies to achieve policies of self improvement in key areas of safety, health and the environment. Success, however, requires support from all in the company and this is not so easy to achieve. Some sections of the chemical company are regarded as more difficult to convince of the merits of Responsible Care. 'It is easier to convince chief executives and those involved in direct implementation such as those workers in production. More difficult is the middle management which tends to be more conservative than other sections of the workforce,' an industry executive noted. Surveys done by the US Chemical Manufacturers Association and others in the US are sending out confused signals. A poll conducted by the CMA of shopfloor workers suggested that half those polled actually doubted the industry's commitment to Responsible Care and that one third claimed to be unfamiliar with Responsible Care. Yet a poll of top executives conducted by Chemical Week and Andersen Consulting came up with greater support for the programme. More than two thirds of executives polled said that meeting Responsible Care objectives will make a significant contribution to company success, and that their companies would meet or surpass those objectives. Just over half the sample agreed that Responsible Care was having an impact on the company's environmental performance and the public image with neighbours had improved. Only one in 10 executives said they believed that Responsible Care would be more effective if enforced by regulations, with almost three quarters opposing the view. Part of the problem may be that employees are aware of the good practices associated with Responsible Care. It's just that they haven't got used to the label yet. 'Responsible Care is consistent with what we do. It might not be clear what the codes are called but the workers do recognise that there has been a sea change of working practices and know what to do,' explains Charles Keene, of the Swiss multinational Ciba. 'Years ago people thought environmental management was something to do with the environment department but now it's all embracing and influences all decisions throughout the company.' This view is supported by Math Heynens, head of DSM's corporate environmental department. 'At the manual level there are still some people that haven't made the link between our safety, health and environment practices and Responsible Care. Although there are plenty of Responsible Care themes in our own care system we are looking at both to see where there are parallels.' John Bishop at BP Chemicals believes that staff education and training is one answer to Responsible Care recognition. In the most recent employee attitude survey, 74 per cent of staff agreed with the statement that BP Chemicals has a clear environment policy - with 10 per cent disagreeing. On the question of awareness of Responsible Care, 55 per cent of BP staff claimed to be aware of the programme to at least some extent. 'I was pleased with how high the awareness is. The process of linking health, safety and the environment with responsible care has been going for some years and we are now explicitly trying to make that connection.' Full success, however, will require that connection to be made. Cefic senior director Louis Jourdan believes that industry's commitment to Responsible Care is borne out by the support it has in spite of the recession. 'Responsible Care, even in the recessionary times of the past few years, has been maintained as a high priority. It has not been relegated to the backburner.' He concedes, however, that the speed of implementation in Europe is variable. The UK is way ahead of the rest of Europe with the Chemical Industries Association taking a very active role in promoting the programme both within its membership and in public. Although still in its early days, Federchimica, the Italian Chemical Industries Association, has managed to get a great deal of media coverage for the programme. France's trade association, UIC, on the other hand, is taking a more timid approach, while VCI, the German association, considers Responsible Care to be an internal matter for companies and has not been too public in its own pronouncements. Dow Europe's Claude Fussler believes that continental Europeans find it harder to embrace the basic tenets of a voluntary system that seeks continual improvement than the North Americans and British. 'The Anglo-Saxons are able to capture the mood for such continual improvement more easily.' Fussler is clearly a vocal advocate of Responsible Care and is seeking to introduce the concept to Dow Europe's customers. 'Our programme Responsible Care in action has been designed to help our customers assess their environmental performance and develop plans for continuous improvement,' he says. Among the areas targeted for improvement are product stewardship and pollution prevention. Responsible Care is not without its critics. Dr Michael Braungart of the Hamburg Environment Institute believes the chemical industry is missing a great opportunity to show what a valuable contribution chemists can make to society. 'Responsible Care is almost a religion to companies they are addicted to it yet all it will do is shore up old products. What society needs is new products that are greener.' He suggests that companies developing technologies for plastics recycling are wasting the talents of their scientists and their money. 'They are investing in high tech solutions for low tech products.' Clean technologies, he says, must embrace a new business approach. Focus should be on providing services rather than selling products. 'With Responsible Care there is no incentive for companies to produce better products.' He cites as an example the use of chromium in leather tanning. In the last century, leather was tanned using oak extracts and the shoes were recyclable. Use of chromium means recycling is not possible unless expensive chromium extraction procedures are employed. Rather than investing in such recovery technology, Braungart thinks a more sustainable solution would be to make a synthetic chemical that mimics the action of the oak extract, provide better quality shoes that can be easily recycled. 'The chemical industry has the potential to provide many solutions.' In a bid to explore the potential of clean technologies, waste minimisation projects and other pollution prevention schemes, Cefic has been acting as a catalyst in the establishment of research and development consortia in the areas of sustainable technology. So far, Cefic's Dr David Bricknell has managed to get companies to agree in principle to the idea of cooperating with other companies and academic researchers in pre-competitive R&amp;D and select some potential areas for work. Possible projects that could emerge from this Sustech programme include waste minimisation technologies embracing internal process recycling, new process technologies based on biotechnology and the development of tools for environmental management such as product design, life cycle assessment and improvement. 'Introduction of product stewardship measures - that is, the management of safety, health and environmental impact of products from their development, production and use to disposal - is one of the most difficult features of Responsible Care. 'We have to know more about what happens when customers dispose of our products after they have finished with them,' explains Ciba's Keene. Responsible Care could, however, come to grief at the hands of the Commission's competition directorate, DG IV. 'We have been informed recently that DG IV is against voluntary proposals because they are worried they may have anti-trust implications. A voluntary industry/government initiative in Denmark on volatile organic compound emissions is now being investigated by DG IV officials. It is possible that Responsible Care could suffer the same fate,' Jourdan warned.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Survey: CHEMICAL COMPANIES' ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING  -------------------------------------------------------------------               Operating     Capital      Total              Spending                   Costs       Costs      Costs       Sales    as a %  Company      dollars m   dollars m  dollars m  dollars bn  of sales  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Hoechst         943.17       307.74    1250.91       27.84      4.49 BASF            635.43        88.27     723.70       10.53      6.87 Bayer Group      81.62       285.97     367.59       24.79      1.48 ICI             120.12       120.12     240.23       12.66      1.90 Dow             400.00       157.00     557.00       18.06      3.08  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Rhone-Poulenc   188.20       135.94     324.15       14.23      2.28 Du Pont        1000.00       500.00    1500.00       37.84      3.96 Ciba            201.07       512.49     713.56       15.33      4.65 Akzo (HSE)         n/a          n/a     266.62        8.89      3.00  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Sandoz          236.95        85.30     322.25       10.22      3.15 Roche           204.45       162.48     366.94        9.69      3.79 HULS            210.52        35.19     245.71        6.14      4.00  ------------------------------------------------------------------- DSM              80.75        53.83     134.58        4.33      3.11 Exxon              n/a          n/a     156.00       10.06      1.55 Monsanto        233.00        53.00     286.00        7.90      3.62 Union Carbide   149.00        51.00     200.00        4.64      4.31 Elf Atochem        n/a          n/a     389.65        8.00      4.87  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was due to meet with Canadian  Prime Minister Jean Chretien on 25 January.    Following an initial meeting with Canadian Minister of  Foreign Affairs Andre Ouellet, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on 25  January, also met with a Canadian delegation led by Mr. Ouellet.  The two delegations, Haitian and Canadian, discussed a number of  subjects, agreeing on the following points:    The imposition of a total embargo to relieve the situation  in  Haiti as soon as possible.    The training of a police force, outside of Haiti, with the  collaboration of the United Nations or with the participation of  several friendly countries. According to the agreement concluded  by the two governments, this force will be trained not only in  maintaining order and security, but also in respect for the laws  and Constitution. [passage omitted]    During the talks, the two delegations also reviewed several  areas of activity in which Haitian-Canadian cooperation would be  broadened, including education, literacy, cooperatives,  communication, and energy, following the return of democracy to  Haiti.    It should also be noted that the possibility of a radio  station broadcasting to Haiti has also been discussed.</p>

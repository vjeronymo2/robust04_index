			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / US Money and Credit: Investors indulge in odd behaviour as election nears US BOND investors have been behaving in a most contrary fashion over the past few days. This is as much a reflection of confusion over the likely outcome of tomorrow's presidential election, than it is the result of a clear-eyed investment strategy. Take Tuesday's release of a much stronger-than-expected third-quarter gross domestic product report. GDP grew by 2.7 per cent between July and September, not 1.5 per cent as forecast by most analysts. The news did not depress prices, as it would have done under normal circumstances. Instead, the markets chose to focus on the inflation component within the GDP figures, which showed a further slowdown in the rate of price rises, and on some additional, if minor, bad economic news. On Friday, Treasury prices again confounded established wisdom by falling sharply in spite of two pieces of gloomy economic news - a very weak Chicago purchasing managers' report and an unexpected drop in September new home sales. While the market's odd behaviour had something to do with technical factors, such as the effect of new supply, the chief influence was the election. The selling at the end of the week, for example, was primarily the result of dealers and investors either squaring or lightening their positions ahead of the election day. More importantly, the confused nature of trading last week mirrored the bewilderment felt throughout the financial markets in the face of last-minute shifts in the opinion polls. The comfortable double-digit lead in the national polls enjoyed by Governor Bill Clinton at the start of the final week of the campaign had dwindled to between one and five points by the end of the week. Although this would normally be cause for celebration in equity, and especially bond markets, investors appeared unwilling to respond positively to the changing dynamics of the election race. This is not necessarily a grudging endorsement of Mr Clinton, but rather a reluctance to reassess the judgments, and reverse the tactics, adopted several weeks ago when it looked as if the Democratic candidate was going to coast home. During the discounting of a Clinton victory, prices dropped sharply and the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond jumped more than 30 basis points. Yet since then, prices and yields have barely moved, in spite of the sharp narrowing in the national opinion polls. This is because given the choice, investors would rather leave their positions as they are and be caught out by the rally that would follow an unexpected Bush win, than load up with bonds in the hope of a stunning Republican comeback, only to be caught out by the sell-off that would follow a Clinton victory. Of the two, the second scenario would probably inflict greater losses than the first. For those who want to look past tomorrow's election, the week offers plenty of economic news to digest. The National Association of Purchasing Management publishes its October index later today, and in the wake of the big drop in equivalent surveys in Chicago and Philadelphia, analysts are expecting another decline in the national gauge of manufacturing activity. The leading economic indicators for September are released tomorrow and they are slated to show a drop of 0.3 per cent, while factory orders data the following day are forecast to reveal a modest rise. The most important statistics of the week will be reported on Friday when the October employment data are published. Analysts are at odds over what the figures will show, although the consensus is for an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 20,000 and for a rise in the unemployment rate from 7.5 per cent to either 7.6 per cent or 7.7 per cent.</p>

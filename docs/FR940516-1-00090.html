			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the appropriate level of emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to propose, EPA initially considered, as required in the CAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable motor vehicle standards. Due to technological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constraints present in small engines, EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating emission standards comparable with motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards in a Phase 1 rule is not technologically achievable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See chapter 1 of the draft RSD for further discussion of small SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine technological constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proposing these emission standards, EPA has also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered potential safety and noise issues. Of concern is 36  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 261.52 which directs the Forest Service to prohibit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation or use of any handheld internal or external combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine without a spark-arresting device properly installed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained, and in effective working order. The Forest Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also requires that multipositional small engines used on federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> park lands have exposed exhaust system surface temperatures not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding 550  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C. Exhaust gas temperatures may not exceed 475  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The type of engine changes EPA expects as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed emission standards will not present a safety concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only catalytic converters designed to produce high conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiencies can generate sufficient exotherms to raise exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system skin temperatures to a level that might present a safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem. Manufacturers have indicated that they will not use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalytic converters to meet the proposed emission standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most product lines. EPA estimates that up to 30 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines in Class I may need low efficiency catalysts to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. However, one manufacturer stated that the exotherm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated by these low efficiency catalysts will not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust system skin temperatures sufficiently to warrant more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advanced heat dissipation and heat shield technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Noise levels of small SI engines will not be allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase as a result of the proposed emission standards. The type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of engine changes EPA expects to see among current engine designs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the proposed emission standards are not expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact noise levels. The primary source of noise from nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small engines originates from combustion and the moving parts in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the engine, such as the piston, valve train, and so forth. Noise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from combustion is controlled primarily through the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> muffler. EPA believes the principal method to be used by all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine manufacturers to meet the proposed emission regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be leaner air/fuel ratios. Noise levels in future engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which meet the proposed regulations must, therefore, not exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that of current production engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on the possible impact of this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation on both engine noise and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In EPA's judgment, section 213(a)(3)'s requirement that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulate emissions from those classes or categories of new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines which cause, or contribute to concentrations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone in nonattainment areas allows EPA to set emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for HC, rather than VOCs in general, as EPA believes that HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from small gasoline engines are those that cause or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to ozone nonattainment concentrations. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating HC rather that VOCs would be consistent with on- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway practice. EPA requests comment on this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Nonroad Study, EPA described VOCs as any compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing carbon and hydrogen or containing carbon and hydrogen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in combination with any other element which has a vapor pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1.5 pounds per square inch absolute or greater under actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCs contain both hydrogen atoms and carbon atoms but no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other atoms and are a subset of VOCs. For small SI engines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on engines tested by Southwest Research Institute under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract with EPA, HCs make up more than 99 percent of the VOCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitted from these engines. Less than one percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured VOC emissions are from constituents other than HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions (aldehydes and ketones were the measured non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbon constituents in this case).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the types of emission controls employed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce HC emissions also reduce emissions of non-hydrocarbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOCs. Therefore, in the case of small SI engines, setting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limits for HC emission accomplishes essentially the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall reduction in VOC emission as would setting emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits for VOCs. Of course reductions in the individual non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbon VOC species varies, as does the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbon species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Engine Classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The category of small SI engines is very complex and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprises a wide range of engines used in a broad spectrum of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. EPA proposes to adopt a ``class'' structure for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase 1 regulation. In determining which class of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards a particular engine must meet, an engine's end use or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application must be determined. This rule proposes two broad use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories_nonhandheld and handheld. Nonhandheld engines would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to meet either Class I or Class II standards while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handheld engines would have to meet either Class III, IV, or V  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards. Once the applicable use category is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined, the engine class would be selected on the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine displacement as measured in cubic centimeters (cc).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each engine class would have unique emission standards. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is proposing five engine classes: Class I_small nonhandheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines less than 225 cc in displacement; Class II_small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld engines greater than or equal to 225 cc in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displacement; Class III_small handheld engines less than 20 cc  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in displacement; Class IV_small handheld engines equal to or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than 20 cc to less than 50 cc in displacement; Class V_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small handheld engines equal to or greater than 50 cc in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In Kunsan, protesters took their demands to the main gate  of a U.S. Air Force base. About 2,000 demonstrators battled riot police at  Konkuk University in eastern Seoul after they were prevented from protesting in  the streets. "Drive out the Yankees," they chanted, charging that cheap U.S.  imports threaten their livelihood.  </P></p>

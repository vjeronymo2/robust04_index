			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Allies accused of agreeing to a 'carve-up' of Bosnia MR Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia, yesterday lashed out at the international community for abandoning his country to a carve-up, after the US, Russia and their European allies announced a plan aimed at preventing future territorial gains by Serbs. He pledged to use all means to defend the sovereignty of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'We are not going to waste time any longer in futile negotiations,' Mr Izetbegovic said in a statement broadcast on Sarajevo radio. 'The world has not left us with many choices.' Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday welcomed the plan as the recognition of Serb victory. He said it was clear that the allies 'have shrunk from interfering in the civil war and that Bosnia should be transformed into three states'. The US, Russia, France, Britain and Spain agreed at the weekend on a joint strategy aimed at containing the war. The US backed off from earlier pledges to arm Bosnia's outgunned Moslems and roll back Serbian war gains. The allied foreign ministers announced measures including the offer of US air power to protect United Nations troops in 'safe areas' being created within the republic. The viability of 'safe areas' was, however, called sharply into question by the leaking of an internal document of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees revealing a breakdown of law and order in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. The document describes heightened tension among defeated Moslem fighters, local inhabitants and refugees in the enclave, one of six Bosnian government strongholds which have been designated 'safe areas' under international protection. Crime and unrest have become commonplace, and a Canadian commander complained that he must 'use more manpower to control the local population than to police the frontline'. Last week a group of 15 armed men broke into a warehouse and stole part of the UNHCR assistance, the document says. 'A crowd of some 200 people started to march towards the warehouse to take the rest of the food.' The black market price for a packet of cigarettes has soared to DM30 (Pounds 12). Teenage girls turn to prostitution for the price of one cigarette. Traffic has increased in the town after 1,000 litres of diesel were stolen from the Canadian battalion. Moslem fighters have refused to surrender their guns, handing over only about 10 per cent of their weapons to the peacekeepers, says the document. Only 2,000 local inhabitants remain, but the population has trebled to 19,000 as Moslems have sought sanctuary from Serb troops elsewhere in eastern Bosnia. 'Srebrenica at this moment is a big refugee camp without the resources,' said Mr Laurens Jolles, a senior UNHCR official. Trapped in their enclave, its people depend on the whims of Serb commanders who decide whether to allow the passage of food relief. When the concept of 'safe areas' was proposed, UN officials feared that without military muscle, these would fall to their hostile neighbours. Now they worry that Srebrenica remains cut off from the outside world with no possibility of a normal life. A US-led air drop earlier this spring was initially welcomed. But relief workers say it has become 'nothing but ridiculous'. The most recent air drop included chlorine for water purification. Srebrenica is afflicted with chronic shortages of most supplies, but it has enough chlorine to last four years. Stop-gap agreement on Bosnia Page 3 Editorial Comment Page 15</p>

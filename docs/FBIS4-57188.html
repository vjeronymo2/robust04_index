Candidate for the Presidency of the Republic of Mexico.    Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD].    From: The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-EZLN  General Command.    General Headquarters. Mountains in the southeastern  sector of Mexico, Chiapas. Mexico.    Mr. Cardenas:    We hereby respectfully address you to invite you to come to  an area in the Zapatist zone. We have learned that you are one  of the candidates for the office of president for the six-year  term between 1994-2000. We believe you know what brought on the  just struggle of the Zapatists and the 11 basic points we have  presented as necessary for Mexicans in our country to once again  be human beings: homes, land, work, bread, health, education,  independence, liberty, democracy, justice, and peace. We wish  to know what you think of the EZLN's demands and hear what you  will do to comply with these demands should you be elected  president of the republic.    The EZLN will meet with any of the candidates for the  Presidency who wish to meet with us. All we ask is that you  publicly declare that you and your party are receiving nothing  from us for this visit, that you have not paid us, in money or  in specie, and that you will enter, remain, and leave our  territory at your own risk.    Should you accept this invitation, we ask that you reply  through one of the members of your campaign group, stating date  and place.    For all. Liberty! Democracy! Justice!    From the mountains in the southeastern sector of Mexico.    Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-EZLN General  Command.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READ ALL ABOUT IT;  </P> <P> FROM ONCE-OBSCURE ASIAN CUISINES TO CLASSIC FRENCH TO THE LASTEST GRAIN CRAZE,  THE VARIETY OF COOKBOOKS AVAILABLE FOR GIFT GIVING SWELLS AS CHRISTMAS  APPROACHES. TO HELP CULL THE BEST FROM THE REST, THE TIMES' FOOD STAFF HAS  REVIEWED THE YEAR'S MOST INTRIGUING COOKBOOKS.;  </P> <P> CLASSIC TECHNIQUES OF ITALIAN COOKING BY GIULIANO BUGLIALLI, (FIRESIDE PRESS:  $19.95, 526 PAGES, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Here is the Italian version of Jacques Pepin's French La Technique. Fine and  dandy. We needed one. And no one could do it better than Buglialli, an Italian  historian, with an unusually rich perspective of cuisine. Italians, who have  been blanching, wrapping, sifting, carving, boning, stuffing, slicing, sieving  longer than any Western European culture, are the forerunners of modern  culinary technicians. Indeed, Renaissance paintings by mannerist  (gastronome-painters who were followers or students of Michelangelo), depict  them. Famous artist-cooks of the Baroque period composed banquets filled with  ice sculptures, sugar works, napkins folded into complex animal and geometric,  and floral shapes.  </P> <P> Tricianto, a treatise on the Art of carving was printed in Venice in 1580, and  remains a valuable reference work to this day, Buglialli reminds us. So once we  are given an incredibly detailed description of equipment for the Italian  kitchen, we are taken through the step by step techniques for using the  half-moon chopper, blanching and grinding nuts, preparing ravioli and passing  food through the food mill.  </P> <P> Then we get to the frittatas, and other doughy preparations for batters, pastas  risotti. You get details about preparing food in clay or paper bags (which go  back to Renaissance cooking), larding meat, grilling, boning, stuffing,  handling fish and shellfish, galantines, yeast doughs, molds and aspics,  pastries and ice creams. The book is actually a must for any serious home  library where cooking is actually done or talked about. ROSE DOSTI  </P></p>

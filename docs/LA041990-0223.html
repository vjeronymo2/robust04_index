			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR FACES CHARGES OF MAKING PATIENTS 'JUNKIES'  </P> <P> A Newhall physician has been arrested on charges that she got her patients  addicted to painkillers and wrote prescriptions that enabled one patient to buy  up to 900 codeine pills in one month, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dr. Sandra Soho, who was Dr. Stanley Soho until a 1986 sex-change operation,  was arrested Tuesday and charged with 10 felony counts of illegally furnishing  restricted substances -- prescription painkillers -- to patients who  subsequently became addicted.  </P> <P> She had purchased the practice of Dr. Milos Klvana, a home-birthing advocate  who was arrested in 1986 on charges that he killed eight infants and a fetus.  </P> <P> Soho could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A receptionist in her office  said the doctor had planned for weeks to be out of the office Wednesday for  surgery.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Bradford E. Stone said investigators found no evidence that  Soho received kickbacks from pharmacies for the prescriptions, but said she  profited from the $25 consultation fee she charged patients for each visit.  </P> <P> "She was turning these people into prescription-drug junkies by prescribing  them incredible numbers of pills," Stone said.  </P> <P> Most of her patients came to Soho's office with legitimate medical problems but  became addicts after following her advice, Stone said. She conducted only a  minimal exam before writing prescriptions, he said.  </P> <P> He said there was no evidence that patients were reselling the drugs for their  own profit and said some are now experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  </P> <P> Since 1986, Soho has practiced in the Newhall offices of Klvana, the  obstetrician who was sentenced in February to 53-years-to-life in prison for  nine counts of second-degree murder.  </P> <P> Soho, a 1967 graduate of the University of Oregon Health Sciences School of  Medicine, was hired by Klvana's wife to keep her husband's medical practice  alive after his arrest in October, 1986.  </P> <P> Vicky Boone, an analyst for the Medical Board of California, said Soho was  prohibited from practicing medicine from 1981 until 1984 after the physician  failed repeated oral examinations.  </P> <P> The Medical Board in 1981 required that Soho take the exam after investigators  found that the doctor had abandoned patients in hospitals and nursing homes and  had falsified medical records and death certificates, Boone said. Medical  regulators at the time had found Soho's professional conduct "grossly  incompetent . . . dishonest and corrupt," according to authorities.  </P> <P> In May, 1984, Soho passed the exam and was placed on five-year probation, Boone  said.  </P> <P> Jerry Sanders, regional director of the state medical board, said Soho's  physician's license could be revoked if she is convicted of the charges pending  against her.  </P> <P> But Sanders said Soho, who is free on $50,000 bail, may continue to practice  medicine until the board concludes its administrative proceedings, unless state  officials decide to seek a court order restraining her from seeing patients.  </P> <P> "The board doesn't have authority for interim suspension of a license. We would  have to go to a magistrate and request a temporary restraining order, and I  don't know if we are going to do that or not," Sanders said.  </P></p>

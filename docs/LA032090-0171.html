			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> KRUKOW CITES SHOULDER, RETIRES  </P> <P> Pitcher Mike Krukow, the San Francisco Giants' only 20-game winner in the last  17 years, announced his retirement today because of continuing shoulder  problems.  </P> <P> Krukow, 38, became a free agent last October after a torn rotator cuff injury  that ended his season in June.  </P> <P> He was 4-3 with a 3.98 ERA during his shortened 1989 season and finished his  career with a 124-117 record and a 3.90 ERA in 369 major-league games with the  Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies and Giants.  </P> <P> After going 20-9 in 1986 to become the Giants' first 20-game winner since Ron  Bryant in 1973, Krukow was limited by recurring right shoulder problems and  went only a combined 16-13 in his final three seasons.  </P> <P> "I tried to get my shoulder back into shape this winter, but I just don't think  it was meant to be," Krukow said from his Pasadena home. "I have no problem  with this decision."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Carter's Success, the White House's Incompetence"]    [Text] The tense situation on the Korean peninsula has  eased following former U.S. President Carter's mediation in  Pyongyang, and U.S. President Clinton has also changed his tone.  Contrary to Carter's assertion, it is hard to say whether the  crisis is over. There may yet be a relapse. As a matter of  fact, however, this once again reveals the weakness of the U.S.  Government's diplomacy.  <H5>  Washington Is Neither Cold Nor Hot </H5>   Carter was the U.S. President for only four years. He  entered the White House bemoaning the state of the universe and  pitying the fate of mankind like a preacher. He did not achieve  very much despite arduous efforts in administration, so he was  not reelected president. After he withdrew from office, he ran  a peanut farm while silently devoting his efforts to peace.  Unlike other retired U.S. presidents, he has frequently been  involved in seemingly ordinary activities which were actually  quite meaningful. This frequently earned him praise.    His shuttle mediation between Seoul, Pyongyang, and  Washington was a rare activity which showed a magnanimous  attitude. He obtained a positive response from Pyongyang, and  preparations are being made for a historic summit meeting  between the two Kims. Washington was suspicious in the  beginning, but later admitted that "there are indications of  hope," thus softening its stance.    Viewing the responses of White House officials and Clinton,  there is still a gap between the U.S. Government, Carter, and  Seoul in their assessment of the situation. Carter said that  "complete agreement" had been reached with Pyongyang on major  issues, whereas Seoul nimbly responded to Kim Il-song's proposal  for a summit meeting, immediately agreeing and actively making  preparations. Comparatively speaking, Washington is neither cold  nor hot.  <H5>  Washington Does Not Intend To Have a Dialogue </H5>   On one hand, Washington warmly welcomed some of Pyongyang's  positive actions, such as not expelling the two International  Atomic Energy Agency inspection personnel. On the other, it  coldly responded to Pyongyang's proposal to freeze its nuclear  program, asking Pyongyang to make a written guarantee apart from  allowing nuclear inspections. Washington neither objected to  nor supported the proposal for a summit, indicating its  unwillingness to participate in a dialogue.    Washington and Pyongyang have conducted two rounds of formal  talks. In Washington's mind, the talks are a method for putting  pressure on Pyongyang, not improving understanding and reducing  misunderstandings. Taking advantage of the DPRK's hope to  rebuild its relations with the United States, it has set many  preconditions for the talks and has "raised the prices." After  Carter reported on the results of his Pyongyang tour, the United  States revoked its demand that the DPRK explain its previous  replacement of nuclear materials. This may be considered a kind  of progress.    Carter's Pyongyang tour precisely suggests that dialogue is  the most important element. Carter conducted his mediation  effort as an "ordinary civilian." His success shows the White  House's incompetence.  <H5>  Rumors About Washington </H5>   Washington's method of handling the crisis was clumsy. If  Carter had not appeared on the scene and reversed the  development trend, Clinton would have found himself in an even  more awkward position. The U.S. threat of sanctions is baffling.  The United States has no economic or military relations with  the DPRK, and its sanctions must be enforced by a third party.  Countries which can play a role in this respect are China,  Japan, Russia, the ROK, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The U.S. allies  in Europe cannot help. China is opposed to sanctions; Japan and  the ROK are hesitating; Iran, Iraq, and Syria will not take  instructions from the United States; and the only one left is  Russia. When working out a UN Security Council resolution, the  United States did not consult Russia, which made it so angry  that it was not willing to cooperate with the United States. As  a result, their relations were tense for some time. When Carter  said in Pyongyang that sanctions had been put aside, Washington  immediately denied it. As a matter of fact, Carter had hit the  mark quite by accident.    At a time when U.S. diplomacy is in a mess, rumors are  spreading in Washington that the secretary of state will be  replaced, and the candidate is said to be Secretary of Treasury  Bentsen. These rumors have been spreading for months. Even if  Clinton does not have this intention, it also suggests that  people in and outside the government are dissatisfied with U.S.  foreign policy.</p>

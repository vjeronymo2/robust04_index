			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Zardusht Alizade by Eynulla Fatullayev; </F> place and date not given: "`SD's Do Not Make Coups'"]    [Text] "Political Palette of Our Times" is a new  column which we offer our readers. The material of this column  will describe the various parties functioning in Azerbaijan and  their leaders. Here you will learn about the republic's  politicians and their views of the political situation. Today's  guest is a colleague, editor of the newspaper ISTIGLAL, and a  leader of the Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan.    [Fatullayev] Zardusht bey, you were a pioneer of the  Azerbaijan Popular Front in 1989. But on the threshold of the  January events you and a group of APF [Azerbaijani Popular  Front] activists declared that you were withdrawing and forming  a social democratic party. What were the main disagreements that  brought about this split?    [Alizade] Yes, I was the first to begin to gather people  around myself and to campaign for the creation of a democratic  organization for perestroyka, glasnost, and the defense of our  Karabakh. I provided the name of the organization and its  slogan, and I wrote the first version of its program, albeit  very imperfect. It is not a question of an idle "I this and I  that" here, I am still proud that at that time I yielded to a  sincere summons of my heart and found within myself the resolve  to make a break with the settled measured tenor of life of an  armchair scholar and to throw myself into the thick of political  struggle. People of Baku, professionals with pure intentions,  gathered in the Provisional Action Center of the APF in 1988.  Subsequently, following its association with the Varlyg  organization in March 1989, the APF became soiled by party-mafia  clan intrigues. My first shock occurred in the fall of  1989--people who had pioneered the Front and who had sworn  fealty to the Motherland and the people broke. Since then the  APF has become something alien to me. I protested against the  troglodytic anticommunism, unbridled nationalism, and moral  relativism of the "bey's" with plebeian mentality. On 7 January  1990 I quit the APF, but remained true to the ideas of  democracy, human rights, liberty, and justice that had been  embedded in the APF's precongress program. The program of the  SDPA [Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan] is, in fact, the  first version of the APF program. A two-sector economy,  political pluralism, and pluralism of the forms of ownership, a  return to national sources, and openness to world culture and  experience--this is the essence of our program.    The reason for the split may be expressed very concisely.  Those who fiercely resisted implementation of the KGB's "20  January" plan and the rest, who subsequently became social  democrats, who deliberately, and unquestioningly, led the people  to slaughter [sentence as published]. The social democrats have  never led and will never lead the people to the slaughter.    [Fatullayev] The SDPA is one of the leading parties in our  republic. There is no doubt that the party's assertive activity  throughout all the previous political peripeteias has attracted  the attention of the community of the republic. How do you, a  leader of Azerbaijan's social democrats, evaluate your party's  activity?    [Alizade] I believe that the SDPA has performed an  exceptionally important role in the enlightenment of the masses.  Our party had and has now the courage to rise up against the  opinion of the majority and to not only say but also shout the  truths, by disregard for which leaders relying on the blind  support of people they have deceived are leading people to  disaster. I consider the party's main merit our consistent  campaign for national reconciliation, which has now become the  prevailing political idea. It is the SDPA that, by its realistic  policy, has contributed to our people resisting xenophobia and  not sliding, like the Armenian people, into the abyss of  fascism. After all, the blind, total denial by one nation of  another is fascism. We may speak boldly of an anti-Turkic  fascism that has conquered in Armenia, but in Azerbaijan the  people have not succumbed to the vain hankerings of various gray  "animals" and have not fallen into the trap of anti-Armenian  fascism.    [Fatullayev] Many leaders of right and ultra-right parties  have stated repeatedly that Azerbaijani social democracy does  not have a chance of winning party influence among the  population of the republic any time soon since contemporary  Azerbaijani society has not reached the corresponding stage of  development.    [Alizade] Many leaders of right and ultra-right parties of  Azerbaijan are distinguished by a utopian nature of their views  bordering on caricature. These people, blindly carrying out the  orders of their masters, are incapable of understanding the  normalities of social development. They are unwilling to be  reconciled with the idea of the exhausted nature of their  function of destroyer of the totalitarian state. Their extreme  approach is the wedge that dislodged the other, Bolshevik,  wedge. The time for creation is nigh, and, as the experience of  almost all the post-socialist countries testifies, social  democrats are performing not at all the least role in this  process. Of course, everything depends on the specific  conditions, but the leaders of the SDPA see this normality and  are working to ensure that the predictions of the false oracles  not come to pass. The idea of the exclusiveness of the  Azerbaijani people, to which normality does not extend, is a  foolish idea, and I do not believe that it has a chance of being  realized. The people long for social justice, and the social  democrats will fight for it.    [Fatullayev] In the opinion of many foreign politicians,  present-day world social democracy has taken a step to the  right, having thereby renounced some of its strategies to some  extent. How do you evaluate such changes in the purposes and  tasks of world social democracy?    [Alizade] The political success of the European social  democrats and the high standard of the peoples in Europe testify  that this is the right course. As far as "fidelity to  principles" is concerned, this is an invention of limited  conformists. Social conditions in a particular era may engender  "principles" that are very useful for the defense of the  interests of the working people. But societies develop, and the  new conditions could create a dilemma: either to remain loyal to  the "principles" and lag behind life and become detached from  the interests of those same working people or, on the other  hand, to adjust the "principles" and continue to uphold the  interests of those same working people. Of course, the processes  of stratification in Western societies differ from ours, but on  the path toward the social market economy Azerbaijan will  inevitably pass through the stage of "national accord" for the  sake of the efficiency of the transition from one system to  another. This is why the SDPA has not a clear-cut "class-based"  program but an orientation toward the accomplishment first and  foremost of national goals. This is why the SDPA is not  "struggling" against "capital" but struggling to ensure that  national capital stand on its own two feet and begin to work.  After all, without the "employer," there is no "wage worker."  Under the conditions of total state ownership, on the other  hand, struggling against the national state is meaningless. The  SDPA is struggling against the corrupt and predatory state  bureaucracy, for denationalization and privatization, and for  government protection of the population. The tasks coincide, as  you can see, with the goals proclaimed by the state. The entire  problem is that the state proclaims goals and in practice does  everything the other way about; we, on the other hand, are  trying to ensure that state tasks be accomplished correctly.    [Fatullayev] The press organ of the SDPA--the newspaper  ISTIGLAL--of which you are the editor, is at the present time  one of the most popular print publications among the republic  press. What would you like ISTIGLAL to become in the future?    [Alizade] I would like to see ISTIGLAL become a more diverse  newspaper with information on world politics, culture, sport,  the home, the environment, and such. Unfortunately, ISTIGLAL is  currently the canvassing organ of the social democrats. No  money, that's why. We are writhing in the grip of a financial  crisis.    [Fatullayev] Zardusht bey, when will Azerbaijani democracy  come to power?    [Alizade] Answering this is very easy. The social democrats  do not make coups. Consequently, we have to wait for the  parliamentary elections. At these the social democrats should  increase their representation. Then work in parliament. The  people, primarily "people working for wages," small-time  entrepreneurs, and people of the free professions, have to see  for themselves that this small faction is consistently defending  their rights. Serious success should be expected at the  elections of the year 2000. This is my forecast. But in life  anything can happen. It cannot be ruled out that crime bosses  could physically eliminate party leaders. Or that the right and  ultra-right leaders could plunge the people into such a morass  of misfortunes that the country's very existence is in jeopardy.  The SDPA will fight against such a development of events. The  SDPA will fight for the realization of our optimistic forecast.</p>

The Foreign Committee believes air strikes do not represent  a  solution in themselves if the warring sides do not reach  agreement. Consequently it recommends the opposing sides to  accept the NATO resolution as an emphatic call for the search  for a durable solution to the crisis, the Foreign Committee  resolution reads.    The NATO ultimatum requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw  their artillery from surrounding Sarajevo and turn them over to  UN control by February 21. If they do not comply they face  bombing by American, French and British aircraft.</p>

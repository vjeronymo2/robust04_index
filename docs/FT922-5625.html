			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Thai political failures reach economy: Growth will be affected but investors will not be scared off THE widely held notion of the last two decades that business could be conducted in Thailand without too much thought for the antics of the politicians and generals running the country appears comprehensively discredited by last week's violence. Government officials, economists, bankers and foreign investors have hurriedly revised their economic forecasts downwards since Thai troops killed at least 48 pro-democracy demonstrators at the height of a political crisis which finally forced the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister. Financial institutions which had been predicting real gross domestic product growth close to last year's 8 per cent are now talking of a figure below 7 per cent, while at the bearish end of the scale one stockbroker has reduced his growth estimate to 5.3 per cent from 5.9 per cent. Such predictions are of questionable value when the gap between the guesses of different forecasters is greater than the gap between the new and old guesses of each, but all are agreed that tourism, foreign investment and the fragile property market will be hard hit by the sudden reduction of confidence in Thailand. Speculative investments based on assumptions of high growth are particularly at risk. Interest rates are likely to rise - the interbank rate has already risen to 10.5 per cent from 6 per cent in the last 10 days - as foreign creditors restrict their exposure to Thailand, moderately increase risk premiums and force Thai companies to borrow more domestically. An anticipated increase in corporate profits will be restrained by the crisis, with hotels, property and finance companies likely to suffer the most. Factory output, exports and imports were only briefly disrupted by last week's chaos. The most immediate blow is to tourism, which provided some Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in income for Thailand last year, one of the largest foreign exchange earners. The industry was recovering only hesitantly from the Gulf war in the first quarter, and although it is now the low season in Thailand anyway, economists are predicting an exceptionally poor full year. Hotels have started cutting their rates and Thai Airways International has reported heavy cancellations of bookings on flights into Bangkok, especially from Japan. Loss of tourism revenue will affect the current account, and a sharp drop in investment inflows will damage the balance of payments as a whole. Many economists and bankers, however, dismiss fears of a balance of payments crisis, saying that the violence has simply aided the necessary process of slowing down an overheated economy. Exports have been buoyant so far this year and if an expected slowdown of imports compensates for the loss of tourism revenue, the current account deficit could drop to just over 5 per cent of gross domestic product this year from a dangerously high ratio of more than 8 per cent in 1991. Thailand has not suddenly lost its fundamental economic attractions. 'People didn't come here because of good government,' says Mr Mechai Viravaidya, a former minister. 'You ask investors. They came because of skilled workers and relatively cheap wages.' But the violence has reminded investors - albeit with unpleasant abruptness  -that the failings of Thai politics were already affecting their operations. Years of inadequate planning, a lack of infrastructure, a shortage of skilled workers, and corruption were all choking the development of industry, while environmental degradation reached the point where it started to put off potential tourists. 'People now realise they can't just leave politics alone and carry on doing business,' says Professor Kasem Suwanagul, another former minister. 'Business depends much on politics. You've got to have a good government.' Good government and foreign investment will be required if Thailand's development is not to be stunted in the next few years - Bangkok's Dollars 8bn of transport projects, for example, need both foreign money and government decisions - but it could take weeks or months before the country has either. There are two main threats to stability. First, there was by yesterday no coherent government following Gen Suchinda's resignation, and second, the military are resisting demands that those who ordered the shootings of demonstrators be brought to justice. Either through negotiations between the various political parties or new elections, a prime minister will emerge, although not necessarily one with the authority to begin solving the country's economic and political problems. But the issue of retribution over the killings could take longer to resolve. Gen Issarapong Noonpakdee, the army commander, was quoted as saying menacingly this week: 'Don't force me into becoming a cornered dog.' Some Thai businessmen are hoping that the generals concerned, including Gen Suchinda, will quietly leave the country. The alternatives of public trials or continued confrontation, would, in the words of one senior Thai executive at a multinational company, leave the whole economy under a shadow.</p>

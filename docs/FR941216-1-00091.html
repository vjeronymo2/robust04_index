			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Examples where minimum fragment and firebrand distances for division 1.1 and 1.3 need not be applied follow: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Recreation or training facilities, if these facilities are for the exclusive use of personnel assigned to the PES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Between PES and relatively static inert storage areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Between facilities in an operating line, between facilities and holding sites in an operating line, between operating lines, and between operating lines and storage locations normally separated by inhabited building distances to protect workers and ensure against interruption of production. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The minimum distance for protection from hazardous fragments shall be based on the debris producing characteristics of the PES and the population density of the ES. For populous locations, the minimum distance shall be that distance at which fragments, including debris from structural elements of the facility or process equipment, shall not exceed a hazardous fragment density of one hazardous fragment per 600 square feet (56 m2). If this distance is not known, the following shall apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For all Hazard Division 1.1 A&amp;E, the minimum distance to exposures shall be 670 feet for 100 pounds NEW or less. In quantities of 101 to 30,000 pounds NEW, the minimum distance shall be 1,250 feet. These distances may be reduced when it can be shown by test data that reductions are warranted or when other alternatives, as described in &sect;184.52 (f)(6) through (f)(9) are used. For items that have been evaluated adequately, different minimum distances may be used. (Facilities sited at 1,235 or 1,245 feet in accordance with past requirements shall be considered to be in compliance with the 1,250 foot minimum requirement.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For public traffic routes that are not probable sites for future construction, and for other exposures permitted at public traffic route distances from PES, fragment and firebrand minimum distances for Hazard Divisions 1.1 and 1.3 may be reduced to 60 percent of these requisite distances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) For sparsely populated locations on or off the establishment, the minimum fragment distance can be reduced to 900 ft. if certain specific conditions exist as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) No more than 25 persons are located in any sector bounded by the sides of a 45 degree angle, with the vertex at the PES, and the 900 ft. and 1,250 ft. arcs from the PES, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The NEW of the PES does not exceed 11,400 pounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Minimum fragment distances may extend onto uninhabited areas such as wildlife preserve, desert, prairie, swamp, forest or agricultural land, adjacent to contractor facilities but not within control of the contractor. However, without a restrictive easement in effect, construction of inhabited buildings or other exposures in these areas, would reimpose minimum fragment distance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) In lieu of the minimum fragment distances prescribed, other alternatives, which reduce or eliminate the fragment hazard, may be used for requirements compliance, per &sect;184.51(b). Examples include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Use distance demonstrated by testing, accident experience or engineering studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Use protective structures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Use containment facilities or suppressive shields or other fragment control devices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Design/locate equipment to reduce fragment generation or to control the direction of fragmentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Use barricades or terrain where possible to stop low angle, high velocity fragments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Fragment distance need not be applied when it is demonstrated by structural analysis, shielding test or other documentation that building construction and volume shall confine fragments and debris resulting from an explosives accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) In the application of inhabited building and public traffic route distances, the property boundary shall be treated as the governing target. In interpreting application to navigable waterways as public traffic routes, occasional small fishing and pleasure boats may be ignored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;184.53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Hazard Division 1.1_mass detonating. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

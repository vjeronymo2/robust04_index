			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: VSEL shareholders resolve to keep 'playing fields level' Shareholders in VSEL, the nuclear submarine builder which is the subject of competing bids from GEC and British Aerospace, last night voted unanimously for a resolution enabling GEC to buy more than 15 per cent of its shares - but only if and when an unconditional offer from the company is accepted by a majority of VSEL shareholders, writes Our Financial Staff. The resolution, passed at an egm, was similar to one passed which allows BAe to acquire more than 15 per cent if its offer is accepted. VSEL chairman Lord Chalfont said the latest move was an enabling measure to keep the playing fields level. Lord Chalfont said his company was still advising shareholders to take no action over either bid until competition issues are settled by the Office of Fair Trading. He said he hoped that a simultaneous decision on whether to refer bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would be taken by December 7. Shareholders are awaiting a response from GEC to the revised Pounds 573m bid made for VSEL by BAe last Friday, topping GEC's bid by Pounds 41m.</p>

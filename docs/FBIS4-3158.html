			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S.  President George Bush expressed here today his objection to the  Clinton administration's policy of linking human rights issues  to the most- favored-nation trade status.    China should not be bullied and isolated, he said, adding  that no one could insult China without harming the interests of  the United States and the whole world.    Bush, U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, made the comments  when addressing Citibank customers, prominent government  officials, diplomats, and leading businessmen and bankers.    He arrived in Singapore on Thursday on a two-day visit to  the  country as part of Citibank's Asian Leadership Series, which was  launched in 1992 in celebration of Citibank's 90th anniversary  in Asia.    Bush also clashed with President Bill Clinton in opinion  over  the case of Michael Pater Fay, an American teenager, who has  been found guilty for vandalism here last month and sentenced to  imprisonment and six strokes of caning.    Clinton had expressed his objection to the caning sentence,  describing it as too "severe." He had reportedly sent a  personal letter to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong, pleading  for clemency.    Bush said that when one was in someone else's country, he  must follow the law of that country.    A country could not establish a set of laws for its  citizens,  but another set of laws for Americans, and another one more for  people from other countries, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with OAS Secretary General Joao </F> Clemente Baena Soares on 2 June; place not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [AGENCIA ESTADO] The first test  of the OAS resolution signed in Santiago to punish attacks  against democracy was the coup d'etat in Haiti, but the  organization has subsequently been relegated to the sidelines.  Why?    [Baena Soares] People say the OAS had three opportunities to  apply the Santiago Resolution No. 1080, as if it were a soccer  game. They say the OAS lost the first game in Haiti, tied the  second in Peru, and won the third in Guatemala. But things are  not like that. This is not a game. These are political  situations with changing circumstances that require individual  treatment. The OAS reacted to the coup immediately. The other  positive aspect is that not one member country recognized the de  facto government. The third positive result was the  organization of an OAS mission under Augusto Ramirez Ocampo  which created a favorable climate in the OAS for the signing of  two commitments. Nothing new happened subsequently. Everything  was included in those two documents. The crisis could have been  solved five months after it started.    [AGENCIA ESTADO] Why did it not conclude?    [Baena Soares] Because of ambiguous behavior, rhetorical  support attitudes, and disagreements over OAS decisions, we have  not faced the real cause of the problem yet, that is, the  coalition between Haitian military and entrepreneurs. That  association of interests never accepted the election result of  President Jean-Bertrand Aristides. Everything we have done has  been peripheral. I think it was not necessary to resort to the  United Nations. Compulsory sanctions or recommendations yield  the same result or they have no result because both depend on  the political willingness to apply them. OAS measures on Haiti  were not fully implemented. There was a lot of enthusiasm at  the time of voting, but very little enthusiasm to implement them.    [AGENCIA ESTADO] There are indications that the United  States  could be preparing an invasion of Haiti. You made your  opposition to the initiative clear. Why?    [Baena Soares] The OAS mission in Haiti is a civilian  mission. That was the mandate I received from member countries.  It is also necessary to see things from a practical point of  view. Haiti was invaded and occupied (by the United States) for  19 years. The result was the Duvalier era and General Avril.  The consequences of this continue to affect the country today.  Therefore, I doubt there is a more effective solution than a  peaceful solution, a negotiated solution, to encourage Haitians  themselves to define what they want.    [AGENCIA ESTADO] We were already negotiating with the  Haitian  generals but at the moment of surrendering power they went back  on their word.    [Baena Soares] Why did they go back on their word? Because  they felt they had support. I have already seen this film on  Haiti three times. We must attack the causes of the problem.  [passage omitted]</p>

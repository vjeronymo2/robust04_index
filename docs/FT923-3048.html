			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Victory claimed for Maastricht - Cut could slice both ways in poll THE bowing of the Bundesbank to international pressure to cut German interest rates could slice both ways in the French referendum campaign on the Maastricht treaty, now entering its final week. The treaty ratifiers were yesterday swift in putting their gloss on the German move. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, claimed that 'the spirit of Maastricht had won out over purely national considerations'. He went on to forecast that 'this gesture of European solidarity will continue provided that the construction of Europe stays on track'. It is reading too much into yesterday's decision, taken at a time of instability on world financial markets, to suggest that if the Maastricht pact is ratified, it will become the norm for Germany's central bank to pay real heed to its EC partners' monetary desires. 'Maastricht will be a step forward in monetary co-operation', said Mr Francois Hollande, a leading socialist member of the National Assembly's finance committee, 'especially because there will be no need  - as today - to ask the Germans to lower their rates so that others' rates can follow.' Yet collective action on rates would only come once a single currency and bank existed. Maastricht provides for an interim European Monetary Institute, representing all 12 EC states, but still leaving monetary policy in individual central banks' hands. But the Frankfurt rate reduction provided welcome ammunition for the Yes campaign to counter the argument that the treaty would insulate the planned European Central Bank from all political control. This was where Mr Philippe Seguin, champion of the No campaign, pushed President Francois Mitterrand onto very weak ground in their TV encounter 10 days ago. Mrs Simone Veil, the centrist UDF deputy, argued that yesterday's financial moves showed 'that it is the politicians who are able to bring pressure to bear on interest rates', contrary to the anti-Maastricht arguments that 'it is the monetary authorities who will dictate to the politicians once there exists a (European) central bank'. Mr Beregovoy yesterday stressed the same line. But he also hit out at right-wing politicians, who were now campaigning against Maastricht but who had called in the mid-1980s for the Banque de France to get the same type of independence from the French government as Maastricht proposes for the European central bank. This highlights the French government's awareness of the awkward ambiguity in the EC treaty. Maastricht clearly leaves EC governments control over the 'broad outlines' of their economic policies, but equally forbids them to influence the directors of the future central bank, whose highest priority in setting monetary policy is to be 'price stability'. The No campaign may yet seek to exploit the fact that the Bundesbank has cracked, even if ever so slightly, under EC-wide political pressure.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / 'Work of commission should cease to be legislative' Extracts from Mrs Thatcher's speech at The Hague yesterday: THE GERMAN QUESTION If I were a German today, I would be proud - proud but also worried. I would be proud of the magnificent achievement of rebuilding my country, entrenching democracy and assuming the undoubtedly preponderant position in Europe. But I would also be worried about the European Community and its direction. The German taxpayer pays dearly for his place in Europe. Britain and Germany have a strong joint interest in ensuring that the other community countries pay their fair share of the cost - and control the community's spending more enthusiastically - without leaving us to carry so much of the burden. Germany is well-equipped to encourage such financial prudence. Indeed, I would trust the Bundesbank more than any other European Central Bank to keep down inflation . . . A reunited Germany can't and won't subordinate its national interests in economic or in foreign policy to those of the community indefinitely. And sometimes Germany will be right, when the rest are wrong, as it was over the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Nevertheless Germany's power is a problem - as much for the Germans as for the rest of Europe. Germany is too large to be just another player in the European game but not large enough to establish unquestioned supremacy over its neighbours . . . What follows from this is that German power will be best accommodated in a looser Europe in which individual nation-states retain their freedom of action . . . EUROPE FREE AND DEMOCRATIC Now - with the commission exploiting the Single European Act to accumulate powers of greater direction and regulation - Europe is reaching the point at which it must choose between these two approaches. Is it to be a tightly regulated, centralised bureaucratic federal state, imposing uniform standards throughout the continent? Or is it to be a loose-knit decentralised free-market Europe of sovereign states, based upon competition between different national systems of tax and regulation within a free trade area? The federalists at least seem to be clear. The Maastricht Treaty met the commission's requirement for a 'single institutional framework' for the community. Yet, before the ink was even dry on the treaty, it was reported that the president of the European Commission was seeking more money and more powers for the commission which would become the executive of the community - in other words a European government . . . Nor is there any mystery about the urgency with which they press the federalist cause . . . A half-Europe imposed by Soviet tyranny was one thing; a half-Europe imposed by Brussels would be a moral catastrophe depriving the community of its European legitimacy. THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION In 1996, when the arrangements agreed at Maastricht are due to be reviewed - and probably a good deal earlier - the community should move in exactly the opposite direction to that proposed by the European federalists. A community of sovereign states committed to voluntary co-operation, a lightly regulated free market and international free trade does not need a commission in its present form. The government of the community - to the extent that this term is appropriate - is the council of ministers, consisting of representatives of democratically elected national governments. The work of the commission should cease to be legislative in any sense. It should be . . . administrative. CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE Why need every new European initiative require the participation of all members of the community? It will sometimes be the case - especially after enlargement - that only some community members will want to move forward to another stage of integration. Here I pay tribute to John Major's achievement in persuading the other 11 community heads of government that they could move ahead to a Social Chapter, but not within the treaty and without Britain's participation. It sets a vital precedent . . . If the European Community proceeds in the direction which the majority of member state governments and the commission seem to want, they will create a structure which brings insecurity, unemployment, national resentment and ethnic conflict.</p>

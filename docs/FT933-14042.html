			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UN threat of Unita arms ban THE UN Security Council last night threatened comprehensive sanctions, including an arms embargo, against Unita rebels in Angola unless they lay down their arms within two months and abide by a peace accord. The unanimous resolution was the first such measure against an insurgent movement seeking by force to topple the government of a UN member state. South Africa and Zaire have both been accused of backing Unita, which is led by Mr Jonas Savimbi. The Security Council reiterated its demand that Unita accept unreservedly the results of last year's UN-supervised elections, rejected as fraudulent by Mr Savimbi. It also renewed until September 15 the mandate of the small UN observer force.</p>

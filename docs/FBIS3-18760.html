			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yalcin Dogan from the "Diary" column: "Fifty </F> Billion From King Fahd for Prosperity!"]    [Text] King Fahd and Necmettin Erbakan are so close that  nothing can come between them. Unless, of course, the money that  is now ready to flow from "every sort of amenity" that has been  made available could be called "coming between" them. What a  windfall -- "50 billion lira coming between them" for going on  the hajj before the first step is even taken! If they can double  the hajj quota, Saudi Arabia's contribution to the Prosperity  Party [RP] will then rise to "100 billion lira."    Saudi Arabia was "very generous to the Prosperity Party"  before the local elections in Turkey. The Saudis think of their  "Turkish brother in religion" first and foremost. To think of  their Turkish brothers in religion means to think first of the  Prosperity Party. Indeed, when we are heading into regular  elections, at a time when all the world needs money, why should  Saudi King Fahd not think of his "religious brother" Necmettin  Erbakan, his religion, and his entire party, Prosperity?    CUMHURIYET published a report yesterday, a report about  "hajj  memo given to Saudis." I know there are other dimensions to it  because I have been following it closely for several days. Those  dimensions give certain clues to the "RP's sources of income," a  topic often discussed and wondered about.    It is necessary to follow these clues closely to avoid  getting tangled when the threads all come together to make a  ball!    The incident is actually also an international scandal.  Saudi  Arabia gives Turkey a quota each year for the hajj, as it does  every Muslim country. Right now this quota is 60,000 a year.  There is an official protocol between the two countries that  governs this.  <H5>  "Special" Quota for RP! </H5>   For the past 3 years, 39,000 of the 60,000 have gone on the  hajj through Department of Religious Affairs channels, and the  remaining 21,000 have been sponsored by private business.    Each hajj candidate pays $1,700 for cost of travel, food,  and  accommodations. If full accommodations for two weeks, the  difference if it is a five-star hotel, and communications costs  are added to this, it can reach $4,920 per pilgrim. Moreover,  money must be allocated for sacrifice and other expenses, which  may vary between $500 and $1,000. All of this money for expenses  and visas is handled "through official channels."    Now comes the "Prosperity Party-Saudi Arabia connection"  right in the middle of all this. In addition to the  60,000-pilgrim quota that Saudi Arabia assigns to Turkey, "an  additional quota of 5,000 people is being assigned to the  Prosperity Party" -- as opposed to the protocol between the  countries.    Although it was officially reported earlier that Turkey  wanted to increase its pilgrim quota, Riyadh denied this  request. Nevertheless, a 5,000-person quota is granted to  Prosperity... plus a promise "to raise this figure to 10,000  later."    What does this mean? It means "the significance of the  5,000-person quota is 50 billion lira, and the significance of  the 10,000-person quota is 100 billion lira."    According to Department of Religious Affairs figures, a  source of 50 billion lira has been created for the Prosperity  Party for the visa and other expenses of 5,000 people. That is,  Saudi Arabia is saving the RP from the trouble of finding money  for elections!  <H5>  Note to Arabia </H5>   Minister of State Necmettin Cevheri is looking into the  matter. He held meeting after meeting during the past several  days at the Department of Religious Affairs. Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin entered the picture later.    And two days ago, Riyadh's charge d'affaires in Ankara was  called to the Foreign Ministry and given a note. It stresses  that the "matter is governed by protocol between the two  countries, and contrary behavior violates the diplomatic rules."  It adds that the quota assigned the RP is "invalid."    But it is not this simple or easily dismissed. One country  is  clearly "indirectly increasing the resources" of a political  party of another country! While most parties are certainly  struggling for "money" during elections, the RP is solving this  problem through Saudi Arabia!    There is no intrinsic difference between ILKSAN [Primary  School Teachers Health and Social Assistance Fund], ISKI  [Istanbul Water and Sewer Authority], or the hajj quota. There  was corruption in the first two, and the truth came out only  later. Now there is awareness of the matter beforehand and it is  being prevented. The ILKSAN and ISKI incidents are, in the term  so beloved by Erbakan and the Prosperity Party, "national" in  nature. This, however, in other terms they are equally fond of,  is "antinational, foreign."    If the RP were to come to power, it is now clear "how it  would protect our national and moral values, how and with whom  it would establish the order of justice." "National view" is now  clearer! Prosperity's mask has slipped.</p>

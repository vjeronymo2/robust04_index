			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] presidency  held its fourth session in Zagreb last night with President  Franjo Tudjman in the chair. Here is a report:    After an exhaustive discussion on the current political  situation in Croatia and Croatia's policy concerning efforts to  establish a just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, all members of the  presidency voiced their support for Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman's present policy, in the spirit of the stands adopted at  the second HDZ congress.    For this reason, all misinformation about divisions within  the HDZ leadership and about an alleged rift in the HDZ is  malicious and false. Equally false is the speculation, carried  by some media, that some high-ranking state officials,  especially Messrs [Stipe] Mesic, [Josip] Manolic, and [Gojko]  Susak have been replaced. The changes already made were carried  out in line with HDZ policy.    In addition, the spreading of misinformation about major  changes in the interior and defense ministries, and claims that  [Defense] Minister Susak is to be replaced by Franjo Greguric  are especially harmful.    The presidency heard a report about allegations that the  president of the republic has called for the resignation of  Assembly Chairman Stipe Mesic. The truth is that Stipe Mesic is  on annual leave and will be spending some time abroad.    The presidency made political assessments of some examples  of  opposition to the implementation of state policy, such as the  unnecessary clash of views concerning foreign investments in  Valpovo, which harmed Croatia's foreign relations, despite the  repeated stand of the Croatian leadership encouraging foreign  investments.    A tribute was paid to Osijek municipality, the county's HDZ  branch, the county leadership, and county prefect Branimir  Glavas for their positive initiatives directed toward  normalizing relations with the Serbian ethnic community and  gradually introducing Croatian authorities in UN Protected Areas  [UNPA].    By contrast, a statement issued by the Karlovac HDZ city  committee on 12 January this year was assessed as harmful and  unacceptable. The statement called on the remaining Croats to  move out of UNPA's. However, the HDZ presidency maintains that  it is the duty of all state and other institutions to help all  Croats in every possible way to preserve their homes and stay  there, while making efforts to normalize relations with Serbs in  Croatian territory under UN protection as soon as possible.  This policy has never been demagogical, but reflects the  sincerity of the Croatian leadership in its consistent efforts  to establish Croatia's full sovereignty in all territories of  the Republic of Croatia.    The presidency assessed that some opposition parties' moves  and demands geared toward creating a constitutional crisis and  early elections are clearly failing to contribute to the  consolidation of Croatia's internal stability and international  position. On the contrary, they are aimed at destabilizing the  democratic system. Their purpose is to cause dissatisfaction and  unrest among the people, encourage strikes, and, as they  themselves admit, cooperate with a moderate faction within the  HDZ in order to bring about a constitutional crisis and topple  the authorities. All this should be viewed within the framework  of opposition and foreign speculation about a need to look for  acceptable successors in the Republic of Croatia and in other  states created after the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia.    The HDZ presidency is consistent in its efforts to establish  a law-governed state, protect human rights and press freedom.  At the same time, it warns that some of the media are clearly  working to destabilize the government using various methods,  even inhumane and uncivilized ones. For instance, some media  are publishing articles and manipulating the results of opinion  polls in order to create a false picture of the public mood and  a favorable climate for the destruction of the  democratically-elected government.    The presidency voiced its support for implementation of the  government's stabilization program, which has been and remains  the program of the HDZ. It will resolutely overcome resistance  to the implementation of government decisions; this phenomenon  is found at all levels of the old bureaucracy. The presidency  urged a serious and consistent implementation and further  elaboration of this program, as final success and the  realization of Croatia's economic renaissance, as outlined in  the president's address to the assembly last year, depend on  this.    All members of the presidency once again expressed their  joint resolve to persevere in implementing HDZ policy under the  leadership of President Franjo Tudjman. It is this that led to  the establishment of the Croatian state and its international  recognition. It will result in the full liberation of all  Croatian territories, help bring about a just peace in  neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, and secure the strategic  interests of the Croatian state.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / France may pull out troops FRANCE may withdraw its 5,000 troops in former Yugoslav republics unless the United Nations clarifies the role of the peacekeeping force, Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said yesterday. The defence minister, who recently caused controversy with his threat to recall General Philippe Morillon, commander of the UN force in Bosnia, said in the National Assembly that the UN needed to improve its organisation of the peacekeeping operation and to define the force's role more clearly. Mr Leotard said there was 'no question' of an immediate withdrawal of French troops. However, he said that unless there were improvements in the running of the UN operation the French government would be forced to draw certain conclusions about the obscurity of the UN's conduct. The defence minister's comments reflect previous criticism of the UN's handling of the peacekeeping operation from the French military. The UK government has also criticised the UN's role.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Miguel Angel Toma (PJ [Justicialist Party]), the  Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee chairman, cast doubt on  the possibility that Argentina would have a "lasting  association" with the United States if the U.S. Government does  not approve the sale of radars for the Douglas A-4M planes  purchased by the Air Force.    Toma stressed: "The United States has an excellent chance to  send an unmistakable signal, not only to Argentina, but to other  Latin American countries that its call for integration and  joining in is genuine and not mere words."    The Buenos Aires lawmaker expressed support for the sale of  sophisticated U.S. radars requested by Argentina to equip the  Douglas planes for training Air Force pilots.    In a press communique, the ruling-party deputy also deplored  UK "pressures" to prevent this operation from materializing.  Toma stressed: "The United States must choose between sending  a concrete signal to Argentina on its decision to be reciprocal  with us or, otherwise, continue bowing to British pressure and  interests."    Toma warned: "There is no lasting association in which one  partner alone has privileges." He expressed his hope that those  who "still think like in Cold War times" will no longer sway the  U.S. political "establishment." [preceding word in English]</p>

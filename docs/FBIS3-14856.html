			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) has  started an investigation to conjecture the possible effects of  the case of the Ames couple, accused of spying for the Soviet  Union and subsequently Russia, a source close to the FIS said.    The source told Interfax on Monday that one of the aims of  the investigation was to reveal sources of possible information  leakage from the FIS.    "I don't think we have any 'moles' or 'rats' in our service,  but extra caution will do us no harm," he said.    He declined to either confirm or deny that the Ameses had  been Soviet and Russian intelligence agents.    "The investigation has nothing to do with the apprehensions  that somebody penetrated our intelligence files and found the  Ameses there," the source said.    He said the West was bound to make the most of the Ames case  to disorganize Russian intelligence and its networks abroad. He  also said the CIA and other Western intelligence services are  paying closer attention to Russia, and that there exists "a  growing spy mania in the United States, comparable to that of  the Cold War times."</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cigna falls sharply in final term CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurance companies in the US, has announced a sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 50m, down from Dollars 108m a year earlier. Full-year 1992 profits of Dollars 311m were also well down on the previous year, when the company earned Dollars 449m, although the latest results were depressed by a Dollars 26m charge to cover the adoption of new accounting standards. Earnings would have been worse but for realised investment gains, which brought in Dollars 19m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 192m in the year. In comparison, investment gains in 1991 netted only Dollars 52m. The company, which described its results as 'unsatisfactory', said its property and casualty operations incurred a loss of Dollars 374m last year, despite investment gains of Dollars 111m. The bulk of the losses were due to a big increase in catastrophe losses, which jumped from Dollars 68m in 1991 to Dollars 251m, largely as a result of Hurricane Andrew which devastated parts of southern Florida and Louisiana in August. Earnings from Cigna's employee life and health benefits business also fell sharply in 1992, although income from its financial services division rose slightly.</p>

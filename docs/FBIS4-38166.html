			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman -- The Islamic Action Front (IAF), suggesting  that the government is operating without a vote of confidence  from the Lower House of Parliament, has urged Prime Minister  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali to seek the confidence of the House on  the basis of a new policy statement.    If Dr. al-Majali fails to obtain a mandate from the House, a  "national unity" government representing all shades of the  political spectrum should be formed, the IAF said in a statement  Thursday [16 June].    The IAF said the change of more than half of members of the  Cabinet in the recent reshuffle left only seven ministers who  enjoy "the weak mandate" the government won from the House when  it sought its confidence in December, Accordingly, the  government should seek the confidence of the House anew, it said.    Criticising the government for changing the Elections Law  and  dissolving the 11th Parliament last year, the front charged Dr.  al- Majali reshuffled the Cabinet instead of fully changing it  to avoid a confidence session in the House.    The front, which has 16 deputies in the House, also charged  that the government reversed an earlier decision to exclude  lawmakers from the executive authority in order to win support  for its drive to conclude a "surrender" treaty with Israel.    "Deputies who withheld confidence from the government of Dr.  al- Majali but joined it in the reshuffle" also came under fire  from the front, which questioned "how those deputies would  support the policies of the government while their no confidence  vote in it indicates they reject the policies?"    Deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah had cast a no confidence  vote in the government, but he agreed to join it as minister for  state and minister of education.    The reshuffle, which brought 18 new ministers to an expanded  31-member Cabinet, also portends the government's  underestimation of the role of political parties as they were  not consulted about it, said the front, whose deputies remain in  the opposition.    The reshuffle also caused confusion to the House and its  blocs, which were kept out of the negotiations over the  reshuffle, said the front.    The front demanded that lawmakers and political parties and  activists cooperate to "consolidate national unity and...prevent  normalisation with the Zionist enemy."    The front also urged lawmakers to work against the  "marginalisation" of the role of the House. Many deputies  expressed discontent with the government for failing to consult  with parliamentary blocs before introducing the reshuffle and  vowed to reassert the role of the legislature in the government  structure.</p>

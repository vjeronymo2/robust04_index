As far as this is  concerned, the export volume was $10.17 billion, an increase of  6.4 percent, and this accounted for 14.7 percent of the  country's total export volume; whereas the import volume totaled  $11.49 billion, an increase of 26.2 percent, accounting for 15  percent of the country's total import volume.    With each SEZ considered separately, all the five major  SEZ's  have witnessed a growth in both imports and exports. The  Shenzhen SEZ's export volume totaled $5.4 billion, an increase  of 4.2 percent; while its import volume totaled $5.4 billion, an  increase of 11.3 percent. Thus Shenzhen's export and import  volumes was 53.1 and 47 percent of total import-export volume  respectively. The Shantou SEZ's export volume totaled $1.27  billion, an increase of 1.5 percent; while its import volume  totaled $2.01 billion, an increase of 75.2 percent. The Xiamen  SEZ registered a more rapid growth in the export volume, which  increased by 18.7 percent to reach $1.61 billion; while its  import volume increased by 19.6 percent to reach $1.31 billion.  The Zhuhai SEZ registered an export volume of $1.18 billion, an  increase of 10.5 percent; while its import volume totalled $1.47  billion, an increase of 10.9 percent. The Hainan SEZ's export  volume totaled $710 million, an increase of 7.3 percent; while  its import volume grew by a wide margin to $1.3 billion, an  increase of 100.8 percent.    In terms of the trade mode, general trading and the business  of processing with imported materials have continued to grow,  while the business of processing with supplied materials has  declined. As far as exports are concerned, general trading was  $3.86 billion, an increase of 1.4 percent; processing with  imported materials totaled $4.75 billion, an increase of 15.9  percent; while processing with supplied materials was $1.37  billion, a decrease of 15 percent. With regard to imports,  general trading accounted for $4.3 billion, an increase of 40.7  percent; processing with imported materials accounted for $3.82  billion, an increase of 6.1 percent; processing with supplied  materials accounted for $1.03 billion, a decrease of 17.4  percent; while the value of equipment import by foreign  investors totaled $1.44 billion, an increase of 50.5 percent.    If classified by the nature of enterprises, the  import-export  volume of the foreign-funded enterprises in the SEZ's has kept  on increasing, although the growth margin was narrower than that  for the import-export volume of foreign-funded enterprises of  the whole country. The export volume of foreign-funded  enterprises in the SEZ's amounted to $4.68 billion, an increase  of 16.1 percent; their import volume amounted to $5.79 billion,  an increase of 19.9 percent. For the same period, the average  import and export growth margins for all the foreign-funded  enterprises in the country were 42.9 and 63.4 percent  respectively.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [75-page 1992 Annual Report from the Luxembourg PTT] </F>   [Excerpt]  <H5>  Foreword </H5>   For the first time, the turnover of the Postal and  Telecommunications Services has exceeded the 10-billion-franc  threshold, coming in at 10.35 billion [Luxembourg] francs  [LuxF], by including projected revenues for paying out returns  on funds on deposit with the government, representing the assets  of private third parties with postal checking accounts.    If one takes into account the drop in revenues owing to the  decline in telex use and the reduction in international  telephone rates, which went into effect on 1 March 1992, it can  be considered that the growth in gross revenues from  telecommunications (LuxF7.4 billion, representing an increase of  5.7 percent) is very favorable within a rather depressed  economic context, while postal [account] revenues leveled out of  LuxF2.2 billion.    Operating expenses increased by 7 percent, reaching LuxF4.1  billion including, as in years past, the total amount of  expenses for retirement pensions. Payments to foreign  administrative bodies, subject to the exchange rate hazards of  international accounts, may increase by 28.4 percent, attaining  a sum of LuxF1.7 billion.    Subject to these conditions, the cashflow generated by the  present exploitation of postal services, of postal financial  services, and of telecommunications services, is set at LuxF4.3  billion. The 2.2-percent drop, relative to the preceding year,  has no profound significance, for the reasons cited above. This  cashflow level made it possible to finance the investment  program which, at LuxF2.7 billion (+16.2 percent, has just  broken all previous records.    In order to insure the transition of budget accounting to  commercial accounting by 1 January 1993, for determining  allocations for depreciation, the reassessment of the property  of the new Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise by  independent experts, within the context of establishing an  opening balance, was taken into account. In terms of this  reassessment, the allocation for depreciation may go from  LuxF765.7 million to LuxF1.848 billion, such that the surplus,  to be considered as a pre-tax profit beginning in fiscal year  1993, is being reduced to LuxF2.5 billion.    With regard to the lag in telephone connections, accumulated  over the last few years, significant progress has been made  during fiscal year 1992. While the number of requests for new  telephone connections again increased by 3.7 percent to attain a  figure of 17,677, the waiting list for new service connections  not feasible owing to technical reasons was reduced by 25  percent to 2,347 units in late 1992.    The noteworthy event in 1992 was surely the vote, on 9 July  1992, on the part of the Chamber of Deputies, on the draft law  to amend the status of the Postal and Telecommunications  Services Administration. This law, dated 10 August 1992, sets up  the new "Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise," a  public establishment having a legal character and enjoying  financial and administrative autonomy. This law went into effect  on 1 September 1992, the Enterprise thus functioning once again  within the framework defined by the law regarding the State  revenues budget and expenses for 1992. The Enterprise has been  enjoying financial autonomy since 1 January 1993.    This reform, while according the new entity the freedoms to  act which it shall require, at the same time fulfills the  separation of regulatory and operational functions required by  European directives, in light of the liberalization of postal  and telecommunications services. Thus, these services continue  to be regulated by the laws of 4 May 1877 and 20 February 1884,  respectively, anticipating amendment of those laws, in  conformity with European directives currently being drafted.    In that context, it ought be mentioned that the Commission  published a "Green Book Concerning the Development of a Single  Market for Postal Services," dated 11 June 1992, as well as a  new "Report Concerning the Status of the Telecommunications  Services Sector," dated 21 October 1992. In the meantime, the  session of the Council of Telecommunications Ministers, which  took place in Luxembourg on 16 June 1993, has given the go-ahead  for liberalizing the complement of public telephone services,  slated for 1 January 1998 at the latest.    Now, it shall be up to the Enterprise's new managerial  echelon and the entire personnel staff to again take up the  challenge of competition while safeguarding the interests of a  quality public service accessible to all.    Luxembourg, 16 July 1993    [signed]    Edmond  Toussing, General Manager    In 1991, the rapid increase of requests for connection to  the  telecommunications network, infeasible owing to the lack of  available lines in local networks, was the major discernible  problem. During fiscal year 1992, the measures brought on line  were intensified and quickly bore fruit. Thus, the number of  requests pending was reduced by about 25 percent, leveling out  at 2,300 at year's end.    When one deducts from this figure the underground  connections  that are pending, because the corresponding building  construction is not yet completed at the end of 1992, one  arrives at a figure of 1,703 requests not honored owing to a  paucity of available lines. It follows that, during 1993, the  effort should be maintained within these bounds.    As regards requests that can be serviced, it has been  possible to maintain an average lag time of 3 weeks, despite a  considerable upsurge in the volume of work. For 1993, some  measures applied to simplify operations and a streamlining of  procedures shall be brought into play and shall make possible  even more expeditious service.    Within the domain of the interface network, work at  important  building sites to be equipped with fiber-optic cable has been  pursued in such a manner that, at the end of 1992, more than 60  percent of the centers were already being served via fiber-optic  cable.    The tempo assumed over several years should be maintained  through the end of the decade in order to keep pace with the  conversion to digital technology and [state-of-the-art]  switching and for ensuring a network sufficiently in consonance  with the goal of guaranteeing sufficient operational security,  even in the event of a major failure. In this regard, a  global-level plan has been sketched out and subjected to  discussion.    The number of building sites where the postal and  telecommunications services are participating, coordinating on  the initiative of the administrations, public services or  distribution enterprises, has remained at the same level as over  the last fiscal year, while the number of residences, large  buildings and residential developments has continued to grow.    In the field of radio communications, efforts geared to  establishing a directional radio link to Belgium, slated to  become operational during 1993, have progressed.    The prototype configuration of a radio network, using  near-border resources shared with the FRG, was defined in 1993,  with an eye toward a 1993 startup under the designation  "Commobil." It is destined to cover the domestic mobile radio  communications needs of companies having a fleet of vehicles on  the move.    The LUXGSM network was put into play in such a manner that  it  was possible to effect the first few test communications by the  end of 1992, with an eye toward a commercial-level startup in  1993.    Other radio engineering services such as Semphone and ATF II  continue to enjoy the favor of the consumers.    Finally, during the last quarter of 1992, the  Telecommunications Division was able to begin its move to the  new site [called] "Cloche d'Or" [The Golden Bell], leaving  behind the divers constraints and disadvantages resulting from  the level of scatter in the train station district.  <H5>  Telecommunications </H5> <H5>  I. Telecommunications Infrastructure </H5> <H5>  1. Local Subscriber Networks </H5>   Some projects for expanding some of the local networks have  been implemented in the following areas:    Rodange, Alzingen, Fentange, Hesperange, Bertrange, Mamer,  Capellen, Dudelange, Bettembourg, Esch/Alzette, Oetrange,  Moutfort, Contern, Senningen, Reckange, Heiderscheid, Reisdorf,  Garnich, Schuttrange, and Feulen.    In Luxembourg and its environs, some expansion projects have  been implemented in the districts of Gasperich, Siechenhof,  Dommeldange, Eich and in the Kirchberg Plain.    Finally, at the request of property developers, the local  network was installed in residential districts, in commercial  zones, artisans' districts or in industrial sectors. Some  fiber-optic links were implemented in the networks for greater  Luxembourg, Gare, Belair, and Kirchberg.    At present, fiber-optic cabling is used in the local  networks  only to the extent that transmission needs exceed the capacities  of conventional copper conductor cables. Here, it is a question  of all the digital data rates exceeding 2 MBits/sec, be it for  the interconnection of computers, image transmission, etc., or  that the total demand for 2 MBit/sec and n x 64 kBit/sec  circuits exceeds existing capacities. It is in this context that  the links cited above were planned and implemented. Since  several clients needing this sort of gear are often located in  the same district (Kirchberg, peripheral [commercial] activity  zones, the downtown area), the formation of veritable islets of  fiber-optic networks, having a mesh or loop structure offering  the operational security required for the utilization of this  type of gear, is at the advanced planning stage. The initial  implementations are expected in 1993.    Moreover, the installation of a local fiber-optic cable link  was implemented between Wecker and the industrial district of  Potaaschberg. Two other links, between Bourange and Bettembourg  and between Belvaux and Sanem, are in the process of being  implemented, for replacing saturated primary conventional cables.  <H5>  2. Interurban Networks </H5>   Within the context of interface cables between centers using  fiber-optic cables exclusively, the links listed below have been  brought on-line:    Luxembourg-Garnich    Luxembourg-Oetrange    Burange-Tetange    Esch II-Belvaux    For the links listed below, preliminary work, viz.,  excavations and the installation of pipelines, has been  completed and the laying of fiber-optic cables has begun:    Consdorf-Echternach    Ettelbruck-Heiderscheidergrund    In the north of the country, work on the Diekirch-Vianden,  Diekirch-Beaufort, and Heiderscheidergrund-Neidhasuen links is  progressing.  <H5>  3. International Networks </H5>   The Luxembourg-FRG link via a 140 MBit/sec directional radio  link was augmented by a supplementary channel so that this link  can continue to serve as an adjunct to the fiber-optic cable.    The installation of a new trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable  with TAT9 fully digital transmission, comprising 30 MAUO's to  AT&amp;T, 70 to Teleglobe Canada, 30 to MCI, and 30 to Sprint  International.  <H5>  4. Digital [Operations] Centers </H5>   The investments made during 1992 in the field of telephone  communications has made it possible to pursue the program for  the replacement of electromagnetic and electronic switching (old  generation) with digital switching gear.    Along with the progress in replacing outdated switching gear  with new generation switching equipment, it was possible to  expand the availability of 2 MBit/sec interface connections to  most public switching facilities.    At the end of 1992, 79 private telephone communications  centers were connected to this equipment.  <H5>  II. Telecommunications Services </H5> <H5>  A. Telephone Services </H5> <H5>  1. New Service Connections </H5>   At year's end, the number of primary connections increased  to  206,502. Disregarding the 3,935 lines for receiving data  packets, direct [channel] selection lines and service  connections, which up to now have not figured in the number of  primary service connections, the net increase in 1992 amounted  to 10,807 units, that is, 5.64 percent.    Thus, the density of main lines reached 53 per 100  inhabitants. During 1992, the Postal and Telecommunications  Services Enterprise was confronted with 17,677 requests for new  service connections to the telephone network (+3.7 percent).    Despite this new record in terms of the number of requests,  the number of requests pending dropped from 4,924 (at the end of  1991) to 4,101 (at the end of 1992), amounting to a 16.7-percent  drop. This number at once includes requests that can be  fulfilled and those in the process of being fulfilled as well as  those requests that cannot be fulfilled for technical reasons.  Disregarding requests that can be fulfilled with an average lag  time of three weeks, the waiting list, which includes requests  that occasion technical problems, contains 2,351 requests, all  told. Thanks to exceptional efforts, it was possible to reduce  this figure by 25 percent, relative to the corresponding figure  last year (3,153).  <H5>  2. New International Telephones Rates </H5>   The Postal and Telecommunications Services authorities have  made some significant reductions in rates, effective 1 March  1992, to wit:    --a 30-percent reduction in rates for telephone calls to the  United States and Canada    --a more economical telephone rate zone for Australia, Hong  Kong, Japan and Singapore    --reduction in rates for all other non-European countries    --the automation of 92 additional linkups, including the  Azores and Madeira  <H5>  3. Telephone Repair Service </H5>   In 1992, the "17" telephone repair service recorded a total  of 176,482 calls, of which 34,428 required technical  intervention. Of the outages reported, 78.6 percent were  corrected, at the latest, within a day following report of the  outage.  <H5>  4. New Telephone Handsets </H5>   In response to customer demand for cordless telephones that  cannot be easily monitored and which guarantee every security  against fraudulent use, the gamut of full-feature telephone  handsets, available for sale to consumers, was rounded out by  two cordless models meeting the stipulations of the CT1 European  standard.  <H5>  5. "Telekaart" Service </H5>   To commemorate its sesquicentennial anniversary, the Postal  and Telecommunications Services offices issued a series of three  telephone calling cards, two of which evidence a commemorative  design and are available for sale at PTT windows, and a third  which is distributed on certain occasions.    The full complement of public telephones and card-operated  telephones currently comprises some 100 units. Preparations,  envisioning enhanced device compatibility, particularly in that  they allow the posting of public operating instructions in a  variety of languages, have been initiated.  <H5>  6. International Leased Circuits </H5>   The rapid expansion of leased digital circuits continued  over  the year 1992.    Beginning in 1992, the acquisition of signal mixing gear  shall make it possible to offer the entire spectrum of signal  transmission rates, in 64 kBit/sec increments from 64 kBits/sec  to 2 MBits/sec.    We note that analog circuits are gradually being replaced by  digital circuits, thereby occasioning a diminution of some 9  percent during 1992.  <H5>  7. 0800 Service </H5>   0800 service, making it possible to bill calls to the party  being called, has continued to enjoy the success of years past.  Toward the end of 1992, 874 [0800] numbers were in service. Of  these, 26 were nationally recognized toll-free numbers, 750 were  0800 numbers usable in calls directed abroad, and 98 were for  use when making calls from abroad. This amounts to an increase  of 66 percent vis-a-vis the preceding year.  <H5>  8. Serviphone </H5>   This information service, permitting telephone service  subscribers to gain access to information for a fee, by means of  special caller numbers, is used for the dissemination of  information, from computer software distribution via modem, to  current cultural event information, to entertainment programs.  <H5>  9. Direct Operator Access Service </H5>   The "direct operator access service," making it possible to  gain access to operators abroad by dialing a toll-free 0800  number in Luxembourg is in operation to 17 different call  destinations.    Service in the reverse direction, making it possible to call  a Luxembourg operator from abroad, was initiated during 1992. By  year's end, this service was available from 15 countries.  <H5>  10. New Emergency Numbers </H5>   Pursuant to the initiative of the European Community, the  sole pan-European emergency assistance number, 112, was put into  operation on 1 January 1993. This new number presently operates  in tandem with 012, which latter number it could totally replace  at some point in the future, once the new number has gained  general acceptance.    Along with the emergency assistance number 112, another  number, having as its destination the Force for Law and Order  (police and gendarmerie) became operational. This is 113, which  is reserved for emergency calls requiring these services.    Of course, both 112 and 113 are toll-free to the calling  party.  <H5>  11. Private Postal and Telecommunications Services Centers </H5>   In 1993, a network having three private digital telephone  exchanges (PBXs), for the telecommunications needs of various  services of the General Directorate of Postal and  Telecommunications Services, the Postal Division, and of the  Telecommunications Division, was put into service.  <H5>  12. Telephone Information Services </H5>   In late 1992, the Postal and Telecommunications Services  authorities put into operation a system of computerized access  to telephone directories, thus permitting their "016"  international information operators to gain access to foreign  information databases, by means of terminal displays.    Questions and answers are routed via the public data packet  switching network, in the form of formatted messages, in  accordance with Technical Recommendation Tph 28, drafted by the  former CEPT (European Conference on Posts and  Telecommunications) and later adopted by the CCITT (Consultative  Committee on International Telegraph and Telephone).    From the time the service came on-line, it was possible to  implement a linkup with the following countries:    Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Great  Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.    The average turnaround time for the nearly 120,000  consultations made since the service was inaugurated is less  than two seconds.  <H5>  13. ISDN [Integrated Service Digital Network] </H5>   Pursuant to the demand, on the part of some users and in  view  of the introduction of a public ISDN service in 1993, an  intermediate approach was implemented in 1993. For the  subscribers in the local sector of downtown Luxembourg, access  to the international ISDN network was installed in collaboration  with France Telecom. At year's end, 12 clients had access to  this service.  <H5>  B. Long-range Telecommunications and Data Services </H5> <H5>  1. Luxpac </H5>   In 1992, the extensions to the Luxpac network improved the  quality of the service offered to the users. New features were  introduced, for example, gates for assisting in error detection  and correction routines.    A direct X75 link with Spain was established. The data rate  for all international lines was set at 64 kBits/sec. For the  primary links, the number of lines was increased and the X75  multi-link protocol, which reduces considerably the effects of  line perturbations, was installed.  <H5>  2. Telex </H5>   Along with the telephone rates, telex rates over links with  non-European countries were reduced on 1 March 1992. However,  the drop in subscribers and in the number of minutes charged was  discernible in 1992. This is due, above all, to the introduction  of new features and the rapid growth of facsimile services  which, in the long term, shall lead to the total elimination of  telex services.  <H5>  3. Videotex </H5>   The efforts of the Videotex 200 group, which latter body is  made up of representatives of the Postal and Telecommunications  Services bureaus, of the Videotex Association in Luxembourg, of  the Ministry of Communications, and of the Ministry of State  have managed to reach a consensus with regard to the technical  structure and the overall philosophy of the videotex system of  the future. The Postal and Telecommunications Services  authorities have developed and presented a prototype of this new  system. International videotex links have been expanded and  adapted to the new international environment.  <H5>  4. Electronic Message Forwarding and Directory Service (X400 </H5> and X500)    Preliminary efforts, for permitting the Postal and  Telecommunications Services authorities to participate in an  X500 research project, within the context of the CCE's (EC  Commission's) Value II program, in conjunction with the RESTENA  (National Education Telecommunications Network) project team and  other partners from the private and public sectors, were  integrated in 1992. X500 represents a collection of standards  defining the implementation of international electronic  directories in conjunction with electronic message distribution  system (X400 standards).  <H5>  5. Public-access Network for Alarm Transmission </H5>   The efforts of a working group made up of representatives of  the Ministry of the Treasury, the Ministry of State, the Forces  for Law and Order, and the Postal and Telecommunications  Services authorities have managed to reach a consensus with  regard to the status of a future public alarm network which  would eventually replace the present Postal and  Telecommunications Services network (RPTA). The Center for  Telecommunications and Public Alarms, attached to the Ministry  of State, has inaugurated a study to define the needs of future  users of the new network.  <H5>  6. Domestic Network for Alarm Transmission </H5>   Over the last few years, large-scale efforts have been  undertaken with the aim of improving the availability and  security of telecommunications services. In this context, a  system for transmitting alarms generated by different  telecommunications equipment as well as by auxiliary  installations or surveillance equipment was put into operation  in July of 1992. All alarms are forwarded to a central dispatch  area that is manned around the clock and from which the  necessary intervention is inaugurated in the event of an  incident.  <H5>  7. European Multi-protocol Service (EMPS) </H5>   The installation of EMPS on a European scale in 1992 is the  follow-on to the Cosine IXI (Cooperation for Open System  Interconnection Networking in Europe - International X25  Infrastructure) pilot network managed by the Associated European  Research Networks (RADE), under the aegis of the European  Commission.    Management of the EMPS was entrusted to the PTT Telecom of  the Netherlands, which latter body subcontracted the operation  of the Luxembourg EMPS node to the Postal and Telecommunications  Services bureaus. Some public and private research centers are  connected to that node by means of digital links rated at 64  kBits/sec. The node is tied into the EMP topology by means of 64  kBit/sec links connected to the nodes in Geneva and Brussels,  and by a 64 kBit/sec X75 link to the Luxpac network.  <H5>  C. Radio Engineering Services </H5>   In 1991, preparatory efforts were begun for putting into  operation a new mobile digital telephone network called LUXGSM.  The order to provide and install the network went forth at  year's end. [The network] is slated to go into operation in  mid-1993.    The radio electronics services, Semaphone and  radiotelephone,  are posting continual progress.  <H5>  1. Radiotelephone </H5>   System 1 public ground-based mobile radio telephone service,  in operation since 17 February 1975, currently comprises 5  channels divided between two base stations. At year's end, 174  radiotelephone links were in operation.    System 2 public ground-based mobile radiotelephone service,  open to the public on 12 November 1985, currently comprises 58  channels distributed among 7 base stations. At year's end, 946  radiotelephone links were in operation.  <H5>  2. Semaphone </H5>   The public radio calling service, called Semaphone, was  opened to the public on 12 November 1981. This service, covering  the Benelux countries, made it possible to service only those  receivers programmed to eight codes.    This service was replaced by a new Semaphone service which  has been in operation since 7 June 1989 and, likewise, provides  coverage of the Benelux countries.    The Semaphone service permits the use of receivers keyed to  four codes, receivers with digital displays, and receivers with  alphanumeric displays. As of 31 December 1992, 5,786 receivers  were in operation. Of those, 2,078 were installed by the  government.  <H5>  3. Luxpaging </H5>   The Luxpaging service, introduced in tandem with the new  Semaphone service, uses alphanumeric receivers with an  80-character reception capacity, exclusively. At present, this  service's zone of coverage encompasses the city of Luxembourg  and its environs.    This service numbers 134 subscribers.  <H5>  4. Shielding </H5>   The service for shielding premises against radio  interference  was saddled with 135 complaints.    In 45 of the cases, it was a matter of interference from  television transmissions. On 18 occasions, audio emanation from  radio broadcasts were to blame. Low-frequency high-fidelity  equipment accounted for 7 cases, video equipment for 15, private  radio network emanations for 10 instances, and, in 6 cases,  television broadcast networks were found to be at fault.    The perturbations were occasioned particularly by 22 MHz  transmitters, unauthorized radio broadcasting stations,  defective or improperly connected receiving antennas, heating  system thermostats, unregulated or defective television sets,  and appliances not equipped with anti-interference gear.    In 34 cases, the problems have yet to be definitively  controlled.    During an in-depth examination of non-public radio stations,  62 reports having to do with reception were filed.  <H5>  D. Documentation and Design Service </H5>   This service was faced with 2,042 requests for information  regarding the layout of underground telephone cables. The number  of hours dedicated to troubleshooting were 7,017. Some plans and  diagrams for the implementation of 1,930 new extension projects  were drafted. The number of topographical surveys carried out  while new underground cables were being installed increased to  2,704.  <H5>  E. Electrical Workshop </H5>   The electrical workshop has carried out numerous works and  service calls during 1992. We cite the following:    --the reconditioning of 1,698 telephone handsets    --the reconditioning of 134 different terminals    --the installation of 9 pay telephone booths    --the installation of 6 temporary telephone booths    --the establishment of the press center for the Tour de  France    --replacement of 47 telephone handsets in public telephone  booths    --1,927 service calls for telephone booth outages    --the installation, maintenance and repair of electrical and  telephone equipment in the building of the Telecommunications  Division (125 service calls)    --the remodeling of a post office    --maintenance and repair of alarm network equipment (65  service calls)    --installation and deployment of 53 line concentrators    --57 occasions of the repair and transfer of telefax gear    --repair of public telephone booths at post offices (141  service calls)    --the manufacture of some 130 different printed circuits for  meeting the needs of the various services    --repair of information microsystem materiel (42 service  calls)    --development and manufacture of 9 electronic equipment  complexes  <H5>  Logistics </H5> <H5>  I. Regulation </H5> <H5>  1. Regulation of Post Offices </H5>   No significant changes, from the standpoint of regulation,  took place during 1992, since the acts stemming from the XX  Congress of the Global Postal Union, in Washington, D.C., and a  new general regulation covering the postal service went into  effect last year.    From the European side, the scenario is marked by the  publication of the Green Book of the EC Commission, regarding  the development of a single postal services market.    The Enterprise shares in the global approach of the  Commission which, by means of balanced liberalization and  harmonization, intends to guarantee EC citizens and  organizations a reliable, high-quality, global postal service.    The Enterprise is always available, time and time again,  even  before some interlocutors who vary dramatically on the topic of  certain propositions in the cited book that could occasion  serious economic consequences for the Enterprise. Moreover, a  liberalization of intra-EC and international mail would bring  with it a skimming of the mail exchanged and would reduce the  volume of mail to be distributed, where the rates are the  highest.    Last September, the European Conference of Postal and  Telecommunications Services (CEPT) administrations, divided into  two section--postal services and telecommunications--adapted its  structure to the requirements of the EC. Thus, the organization  does not encompass more than the administrative authorities of  the member countries and has become a regulatory body.    For their part, the postal service operators, including the  Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise, have come to  make up an independent and specialized association. It is within  this renewed framework that the postal service operators are  called upon to cooperate with the [provisions of the] Green Book  and in its perpetuation.  <H5>  2. Telecommunications Regulation </H5>   On 17 February 1992, two regulations, emanating from the  echelon of the Grand Duke and concerning public telex and  teletex services, went into effect.    These regulations take into account the Grand Duke's  regulation of 3 August 1990, establishing the general provisions  applicable to public telecommunications services, while  respecting the structure adapted by the other interconnected  public services.    In terms of the schedule of rates, the regulation governing  telex service brought with it a noticeable drop in rates for  international communications.    The Grand Duke's regulation of 17 February 1992, amending  his  regulation of 8 October 1990 concerning public telephone  service, is accompanied by a significant reduction in rates for  international communications and inaugurates the automation of  telephone service over 92 supplementary links.  <H5>  II. Personnel </H5> <H5>  A. Employee Management </H5>   For 1992, the Government released no new authorization for  new hiring, so that the total manpower strength of the Postal  and Telecommunications Services Enterprise remained constant.    Taking employment vacancies into account, during 1992, the  processing of 90 new hires was initiated. During this same  fiscal year, the Enterprise was obliged to register the  following:    --33 resignations    --18 retirements    --1 death    --4 dismissals    --10 changes in administration    --36 occasions of leave-without-pay    --5 occasions of leave-at-half-pay    On the topic of accrued leave, the situation has not  improved, so that the number of hours of leave reportable for  fiscal year 1993 increased to 153,717 hours for the entire  personnel staff.    The 1 September 1993 effective date of the 10 August 1992  law  setting up the Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise  had significant repercussions for the management of personnel.  As of that date, all administrative proceedings involving  personnel fall within the purview of the Enterprise's management  committee. This change, which necessitated some significant  preliminary efforts for adapting management of the personnel  staff to its new circumstances, occasioned certain procedural  simplifications, particularly with respect to the replacement  and recruitment of personnel.    Finally, a new personnel services station, concerned with  disbursements to postal workers was set up for ensuring,  beginning with fiscal year 1993, the payment of salaries,  allowances, wages, etc., operations heretofore ascribable to the  competence of the Ministry of Public Affairs.  <H5>  B. Professional Training </H5> <H5>  1. The Training of Trainees </H5>   The service has trained 35 new recruits, in the career  fields  of engineer-technician, technical copyist and craftsman, to take  up their duties in the various services.    Thirteen participants took a course expressly designed for  agent-trainees in different administrative career fields.  <H5>  2. Retraining and Advanced Training Courses Held Within the </H5> Cadres of the IFA    During the year, 11 courses introducing agents in different  career fields to new services and different technologies were  organized.  <H5>  III. Materiel and Buildings </H5> <H5>  A. Materiel </H5> <H5>  1. Equipment </H5>   The equipment complement was rounded out by the acquisition  of calculating devices and electronic typewriters.    Some 100 metal mailboxes were replaced by others fashioned  of fiberglass reinforced polyester.  <H5>  2. Security </H5>   In 1992, the post office security program was defined in  terms of the installation and improvement of security zones,  this latter by means of the installation of armored doors and  windows. Twenty-seven safes were replaced.    The video surveillance installations were improved and the  CFM building was integrated into the video surveillance system  for the buildings at the Luxembourg Train Station.    At the Postal Center and at the CFM building, additional  doors, serving as fire walls, have been installed. The fire  alarm system has been extended to all the buildings at the  Luxembourg Train Station.  <H5>  3. Customer Service </H5>   In order to permit the public to obtain stamps, outside of  established business hours, some additional postage dispensers  have been put into operation.    Out of concern for the continual improvement of customer  service, the Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise  has inaugurated the installation of 12 additional telephone  booths, including 5 for handicapped users.    Apart from that, the post office at Roodt/Syre was equipped  with an access ramp for the handicapped.  <H5>  B. Buildings </H5>   The activities of the Public Buildings Service, in close  collaboration with the Public Buildings Administration, are  outlined as follows:    --expansion efforts at the Roodt/Syre post office    --efforts toward the construction of a building for the  Telecommunications Division at Gasperich    --efforts toward cleanup and refurbishment at the  Telecommunications Center at the Luxembourg Train Station    --construction of an auxiliary cable depot at the  Reckange/Mess Telecommunications Center    --installation of climate control equipment at the  telecommunications centers at Kirchberg, Luxembourg Train  Station, downtown Luxembourg and Steinfort    --the outfitting of key stations for mobile ground-based  radiotelephone service, at Hivange, Howald, Kehmen, Mondorf,  Neidhausen, Redange/Attert and Wiltz    --the initiation of efforts to outfit mobile ground-based  radiotelephone stations at Beaufort, Binsfeld, Burange,  Diekirch, Echternach, Hamiville, Harlange Poteau, Potaaschberg,  Quatre-Vents, Riesenhof, and Vianden.  <H5>  IV. Data Services </H5>   Once again in 1992, efforts were actively pursued toward  setting in motion and developing a data system in response to  requests for new connections, cancellation of subscriber  services or conversion of an installation to the telephone  network. Computerized data capture from telephone directories  has been modernized. However, we note that it was not possible  to implement those applications as quickly as desired, due  consideration being given to the fact that part of the computer  services personnel in charge were obliged to concern themselves  with the shift in the ongoing applications toward another  version of the operating system.    The release of SAP accounting software, whose application  was  imposed subsequent to the change in status of the Postal and  Telecommunications Services Enterprise, requiring that business  accounting be set up, turned out to be a success.    We note that the study concerning the installation of a  personal computer network in the post offices was actively  pursued and the startup of the first offices [equipped with PCs]  is expected in late 1993. Again, it is at that juncture that  connection of the CCP service to the international Eurogiro  network shall take place.    The installation of individual PCs is proceeding in  accordance with a sensible fiscal envelope established by the  management echelon.    Early in the year, an IBM System ES 9000 replaced the  timeworn computer at the Postal and Telecommunications Services  Computer Center.  <H5>  V. Postal Services Garage </H5>   At the end of 1992, the motor pool for the Postal and  Telecommunications Services [Enterprise] was comprised of:    --cars/vans: 562 units    --trailers/rescue-emergency vehicles: 51 units    --antique vehicles: 3 units    Taking into account the 75 vehicles put into service in  1992,  at the end of 1992, the motor pool numbered 613 units. One  hundred eighty seven units were equipped with a 3-way catalytic  converter and 57 with a diesel engine.    For fiscal year 1992, 52 units were phased out.    Throughout the year 1992, the Enterprise's vehicles logged  6,880,000 kilometers.  <H5>  VI. Public Relations </H5>   In the domain of public relations, 1992 was marked by the  150th anniversary of the creation of the Postal and  Telecommunications Services Administration in the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg and the change in its status, transforming it into a  public Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise.    The activities planned for the commemoration of the  anniversary provided the ideal setting for presenting the new  Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise to the general  public.    Also, on 27 August 1992, during a press conference, the  program "150 Joer Post" [The Postal Service: A Sesquicentennial]  was presented to the public.    From this program, whose final phase is slated for late June  1993, we present to you in this report but the three principal  thrusts that are being developed in 1992.    "Wir entdecken die Post" [[Ger., "[we are] discovering the  postal service"]] is the title of a booklet specially designed  for children, by instructors and specialists of the Postal and  Telecommunications Services bureaus. This booklet was  distributed free of charge to pupils of the third grade of  primary school, by the postal authorities and mailmen in all the  country's schools.    Among the various sporting events [concomitant to] "150 Joer  Post," the cycling event, "10 Stonne Velo an der Stad"  [probably, "All-city 10 Stonne (likely a unit of measure)  Cycling Event"], organized by the friends of the Bureau of  Posts, Telephone and Telegraph (PTT), enjoyed such success that  the authorities within the organization decided to stage an  encore event in 1993. This event has a good chance of becoming  an established event in the country's calendar of sporting  events.    The presence of the Postal and Telecommunications Services  Enterprise, represented by a pavilion at the Luxembourg  International Fair in the autumn of 1992, marked the turning  point in the year's events. At this pavilion, the Enterprise,  while showing off its significant past and its role in the  development of the country, certainly manifested itself as a  modern, efficient and operational undertaking.    In order to introduce you to the musical competition, "Die  Letzebuerger Postmarsch," the academic session, the public  holidays, the historical tome, "Eis Post," etc., we refer you to  the 1993 management report of the Postal and Telecommunications  Services Enterprise of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.  <H5>  1992 Revenues </H5>   1. 1992 Revenues   82.0.16.070             Postal services: fees for      2,007,470,197                          correspondence and other                          revenues   82.0.16.071             Telecommunications services:   5,947,405,156                          subscriptions, fees and                          other revenues   82.0.38.050             Net proceeds from additional   3,056,936                          charges levied upon the                          issue of stamps for sale and                          upon postal telegrams                          credited to public works,                          groups or [other] collective                          entities pursuing social or                          cultural goals, or of                          national interest   82.0.39.030             Share of International         4,493,755                          Satellite Telecommunications                          Consortium (INTELSAT)                          revenues devolving to the                          Grand Duchy of Luxembourg                           TOTAL                          7,962,426,044      2. 1992 Nominal Budgetary Expenses   22.1.11.000                 Salaries for officials        2,268,296,460   22.1.11.0l0                 Compensation, permanent       152,171,389                              party staff   22.1.11.020                 Compensation, temporary       33,238,291                              hires   22.1.11.030                 Salaries, laborers,           396,370,491                              permanent party staff   22.1.11.040                 Salaries, laborers,           39,689,560                              temporary hires   22.1.11.130                 Compensation, special         4,193,923                              services (non-restrictive                              credit)   22.1.11.131                 Allowances for domestic       6,420,472                              damages [payable to] agents                              responsible for the                              security of the                              telecommunications network                              (non-restrictive credit)   22.1.12.000                 Compensation, for                              third-party services                              (unrestrictive credit)   797,366   22.1.12.010                 Travel/accommodation          21,994,999                              expenses;

The preliminary  conditions seem to be in evidence: the standardization of ISDN  on the European plane, called EURO-ISDN, and European  coordination for its introduction. It was with those  considerations in mind that European service carriers signed the  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in May of 1989, committing  them to the implementation of a European ISDN service in 1993.    EURIE 93, to run from 14 through 16 December 1993, is the  event that shows not merely that EURO-ISDN is now a reality on  the public networks level, but, besides that, that a multitude  of EURO-ISDN products and services is already available. Twenty  European countries and 64 participants are involved in EURIE-93  at more than 70 sites. In Luxembourg, the event is organized by  the Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise of  Luxembourg, in collaboration with ACOTEC-AEG of Luxembourg,  Alcatel-Bell Business Systems, Comptoir Electrotechnique,  COMTECH, CTTL Ericsson, IBM of Luxembourg, Olivetti, Philips of  Luxembourg, SIEMENS, Telenorma, Telephonie, and Telindus.  <H5>  Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) </H5>   ISDN combines the idea of digitizing the network up to the  consumer end and using the same network for all the  telecommunications services. Thus, ISDN represents a global  telecommunications network providing high-speed transmission and  a standardized user interface.    ISDN represents an improvement over existing services  (better  quality and facilities for telephone [communications], better  resolution and a higher transmission speed for telefax, etc.)  and opens up an entire universe for new  applications--videotelephony, LAN-to-LAN connections, on-demand  pass band allocation, high-quality audio transmission, photofax,  etc.    The public ISDN network with all its attendant services  (bearer services, teleservices, and supplementary services)  constitutes the basis for an entire series of applications that  can be effected using terminal equipment.    Two types of connection are available for access to the  public ISDN network: basic rate access (BRA) consisting of two  channels at a rate of 64 kBits/sec and a 16 kBits/sec signaling  channel (2B + D), and primary rate access (PRA) consisting of 30  channels with a rate of 64 kBits/sec and a signaling channel  also at a rate of 64 kBits/sec. Both connection modes use the  standardized E-DSS 1 protocol.    The compatibility between the existing telephone network and  the new ISDN network is guaranteed, so long as the persons  communicating wish to use the same service, i.e., telephone  service.  <H5>  The Introduction of ISDN in Luxembourg </H5>   The pre-commercial introduction of ISDN service, that is,  the  inauguration of the testing phase, is slated for March 1994.  During this test phase, only national-level traffic will be  possible.    The commercial-level introduction [of the service] is slated  for May 1994. ISDN service shall be offered on a nationwide  basis. Rates have not, as yet, been definitively set.  <H5>  Direct Link Communications </H5> <H5>  Leased Lines </H5>   To have the necessary information at one's disposal when one  needs it is an advantage of size in an era when one must be  armed to make decisions rapidly. This is why modern enterprises  depend upon a continuously available communications network,  particularly a sure and reliable one. These are some needs to  which the Postal and Telecommunications Administration is  responding via a special service--leased lines.    This service permits you to lease fixed, point-to-point  telecommunications lines for your telecommunications traffic.    'Round-the-clock Service...    Leased lines offer you numerous advantages:    --they are available to you 24 hours a day    --links are very quickly established    --large quantities of data can be easily transmitted  <H5>  Directly Hooked Up to the World </H5>   The possible applications of leased lines are numerous:    --telephone calls between your corporate headquarters and  its  branch offices --communication via telex, telecopier, and  electronic mail    --data exchange (bulk data transfer/real-time computer  connections)    --transmission of radio broadcasts and telecasts    --alarm transmission  <H5>  Categories of Leased Lines </H5>   --Analog leased lines offer two levels of quality: nominal  quality (CCITT M 1040) and special quality (CCITT M 1020).    --Digital leased lines for telegraphy having rates of 50,  100, and 200 bits/sec are planned.    --Compared to analog lines, leased digital lines offer the  advantage of better transmission quality and very high speed.  They make it possible to transmit data at rates of 64 kBits/sec  or 2 MBits/sec, and eventually n x 64 kBits/sec, where n ranges  from 1 to 30.    --Leased lines for the transmission of audio radio signals  are offered with normal telephone tone quality at 3.4 kHz (CCITT  M 1040), musical tone quality with a 7 kHz pass band (CCITT M  1020), or with musical tone quality or stereophonic musical tone  quality with a 15 kHz pass band (CCITT M 1020).    On the one hand, you may choose the leased line capacity  that  you require; on the other, you may select the type of  information that you wish to transmit:    --voice communications    --telegraphic communications    --data transmission    --radio signal transmission    --alarm signal transmission, etc.  <H5>  Subscription Requests and Rates </H5>   The request for a subscription is tendered by means of a  special form available at any post office. The form must be  signed by one or both of the individuals or corporate entities  linking up their remote facilities via the leased line requested.    For international leased lines, the subscription request  must  be signed by the individual or corporate entity whose terminal  is on Luxembourg territory. The monthly leasing fee charged in  Luxembourg is collectable from the Luxombourg user party. The  Postal and Telecommunications Services Administration remains at  your disposal for any additional information. Be so good as to  call 4991-422 (analog lines) or [4991]-722 (digital lines) or  4765-219 (international lines).  <H5>  Installation and Service Initiation </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Installation and Service Initiation                                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Installation and service initiation f-|5,000-                                |  |ee, regular subscription, one leased  |                                      |  |digital telecommunications line usabl-|                                      |  |e for telegraph and analog communicat-|                                      |  |ions, 2-line access                   |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |One leased digital telecommunications |10,000-                               |  |line usable for telegraph and analog  |                                      |  |communications, 4-line access         |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |One leased digital telecommunications |30,000-                               |  |line, high-speed transmission rate up |                                      |  |to 64 kBits/sec, 4-line access        |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |One leased digital telecommunications |120,000-                              |  |line, high-speed transmission rate up |                                      |  |to 2 MBits/sec, 4-line access         |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

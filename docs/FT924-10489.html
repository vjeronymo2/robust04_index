			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Liechtenstein's prince looks to the future: The last European monarch with real power has no plans to shed it 'IF THEY want some who will just do representational work, they must look for someone else.' With those fighting words, Hans Adam II, the reigning prince of Liechtenstein and the last European monarch with real power (pictured left), dismissed suggestions after Tuesday's confrontation with his parliament that his considerable powers be curbed. In an interview in his palace office overlooking his tiny principality, the soft-spoken 47-year-old prince also claimed responsibility for drafting the compromise that solved the dispute over when to hold a referendum on Liechtenstein's entry into the European Economic Area. The EEA will group some 20 countries from January. The crisis blew up early this week when the prince threatened to dissolve parliament because it refused to bow to his view to hold the referendum before a similar one in neighbouring Switzerland in December. On Wednesday night, nearly 2,000 citizens - out of a total population of only 29,000 - took to the streets of Vaduz to protest at the prince's tough stand, quaintly demanding both monarchy and democracy. 'It is clear to me that dissolution would not have been very popular,' the prince said. Under the compromise, the referendum will take place after the Swiss one, as parliament wished, but the government has agreed to promote a positive vote on the EEA and, if it is rejected, would explore joining the EC in co-ordination with the Swiss. However, he made no apology for his determined stance, claiming that a majority of his subjects still like having a reigning prince who has power. He said the clash with parliament and the government had been building up for some time as a result of a number of areas in which each side had been testing the other's willingness to exercise its powers. He said his main concern for over 20 years had been his country's over-great dependence on Switzerland, with which it has a customs and currency union. He knew the time would come when Switzerland would move towards European integration, and Liechtenstein had to be ready. 'I have been shaking the emotions of people for 20 years.' He pressed the principality to join the Council of Europe and to become the 160th member of the United Nations in 1990. His worry in recent months has been that if Swiss voters decide in their December referendum not to move towards integration, Liechtenstein risked being isolated, and its export-oriented manufacturing industry - mainly precision engineering - would suffer. He said the EEA was the best solution for his country and full membership of the EC was second best, even though it might bring a flood of tax refugees from neighbouring countries. 'It is better to have tax refugees than isolation.' Like a true monarch, he defended his role. 'I think we should consider carefully if we should throw out the way we do things. The reigning prince pays everything out of his own pocket.' But if the people wanted a purely symbolic monarch, he and his family would live abroad again, 'as we have in the past', and he would look after the family fortune. He had no fears of a decline of Liechtenstein's ability to act as a tax haven as it moved closer to Europe. 'It does not look as if we would move to complete harmonisation of direct taxes,' he said. Asked about Liechtenstein's involvement with Mr Robert Maxwell - many of whose interests were controlled by a foundation based in Liechtenstein - the prince said he was disappointed it took the British authorities so long to request co-operation in the investigation. 'Perhaps they were afraid to approach us because of our bad reputation.'</p>

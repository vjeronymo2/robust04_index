			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at a mass rally in Gharyan </F> on 26 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Brothers, we meet today with our kinfolk in  Gharyan, this historic town; Gharyan has a historic significance  regarding the lives of the people. Once again, our voices rise  from the lofty mountains of Gharyan. [passage omitted]    Libyan people have now realized the truth of what we have  said here brothers. Libyan people, brothers, are aware of all  that we have said. We have stated that what happened in Iraq  was bound to happen in every Arab country. They said no,  because Iraq occupied Kuwait.    We now have Yemen which is being divided and torn part as  was  Iraq. Did Yemen occupy Kuwait? Come on, answer me, you  reactionaries; you the agents of the United States. Why don't  you answer this question? This Yemen which is being torn part  by U.S. Arab reaction and Israeli plots, did it occupy Kuwait?  You claimed that Iraq was torn apart because it occupied Kuwait.    Now, Yemen is being divided, did Yemen occupy Kuwait? We  said that what happened in Iraq will take place in every Arab  country. This is now happening before our own eyes in Yemen.  What is happening in Yemen is a reactionary Arab-U.S. plot so  that Yemen will not be a strong country; so that there will not  be a strong republic in the Arab peninsula. This is an exposed  scheme; Arab reaction has been exposed in this plot. The role  of the United States is clear and exposed. Those who received  orders from Washington to divide Yemen admitted before the whole  world that they were in the United States and received their  order there.    Brothers, who can be fooled by these lies? Who can be fooled  by these fabrications? The Arab reaction, which is siding with  the United States, is responsible for the destruction of the  people of Iraq, the land and Iraq; the killing of the children  of Iraq, and the starvation of our people in Iraq. They claimed  that they did so because of Kuwait.    Now the Arab reaction, which allies itself with the United  States, is tearing Yemen apart bit by bit. It is killing the  children of Yemen. What will the cowardly reaction which is  allied with its imperialist master say? Will it say that Yemen  was implicated in Kuwait, that it occupied Kuwait? We say to  the simpletons in the rest of the Arab countries that your turn  is certainly coming. Arab oil which is under imperialist  control will be used to the last drop against the future, the  dignity, and the freedom of the Arab nation. It has been  decided to use the last drop of Arab oil which America controls  against the Arab nation. The turns of Syria, Egypt, Algeria, and  Sudan are coming, just as the blockade and the confrontation  that have now been imposed on Libya. [passage omitted]    The partitioning of Iraq will lead to the partitioning of  another Arab country. This has now been achieved. This is now  the conspiracy in Yemen. They provide justifications for each  Arab country which are different from those for a previous Arab  country.    We say to the stupid who think that they are safe by being  submissive and agents of the West, we say to them that western  imperialism, the coward Arab reactionary forces and Zionism,  this filthy bloc, are determined to tear the Arab nation apart  and to trample down every single inch of Arab land and divide it  again into states of factions.    History is repeating itself. It is only here that the voice  of freedom is raised. Here in Gharyan the homeland, with the  voice of the free people, we say to them, to the old and  contemporary Arab tribes who have populated Libya, that  confrontation starts here, preparation starts here, and we  accept the challenge. We do not bargain, we do not recognize,  and we do not give up.    We say to them that all their attempts and pressure to force  the free people of Libya to kneel down, are hopeless. We say to  them that free Libya, revolutionary Libya will not recognize the  enemy, will not yield to him, and will not give up the Arab  nation's future. We are prepared to pay with our blood for  every single particle of sand.    We are raiising our voice, here in Gharyan, with the sons  and  grandsons of the heroes and martyrs of the Jandubah and  al-A'aqib battles and the historic al-Jabal battles. [passage  omitted]    Now you can see everything. The reactionary and imperialist  alliance has been exposed. We told you that the United States  has controlled Mecca; they refused to believe us. Yet we found  Libyan pilgrims barred from travelling on board their planes to  perform the pilgrimage; they were forced to use camels because  of an order emanating from the United States, Britain, and  France. The sacred Qa'bah is now being subjected to an order  from the United States, Britain, and France. This is sad. It  is sad what has happened to the holy and sacred Qa'bah.    Brothers, the Qa'bah is no longer sacred because it is being  subjected to an order from the United States, Britain, and  France. It is being governed by orders decreed by nonbelievers  and Christians. We now find that the cross is more sacred than  the Qa'bah; the cross is more significant and important than the  minarets, no matter how tall they may be, I regret to say. The  sound of the church bells is now lounder than the voice of the  mu'ezzin in Mecca and holy al-Madina. The sound of the bells of  Christian churches, the churches of the United States, Britain,  and France is stronger and lounder than the voice of any Mecca  and Medina mu'ezzin. This is a bitter reality. Brothers, the  jihad has become better than pilgrimage, brothers.    Not a single one of those submissive people felt an iota of  shame when they saw Libyan women riding camels or walking to  perform the pilgrimage, because they were observing a resolution  that was adopted by anti-Arab states. They were implementing an  unjust resolution that was adopted by the United States,  Britain, and France by which they wanted to bring the Arab  nation to bow to their will. They seek to put on trial the sons  of the Arab nation within their homeland. They also want to try  them in the United States and Britain.    We would like to tell them no, and a thousand times no. We  are ready for the confrontation. We are ready for any ensuing  repercussions for the sake of our dignity, our future,  independence, and honor. We are ready for sacrifice. Forward  we go, and the struggle continues.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Weak pound helps Micro Focus rise 23% to Pounds 22.3m AIDED BY the weak pound, Micro Focus, the Newbury-based software company, maintained its record as one of the UK electronics sector's strongest performers with profits up 23 per cent and a cash reserve of Pounds 53m. Pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 were Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 18.1m), with turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 67.7m (Pounds 55.9m). The results were in line with City expectations and the shares closed down 80p at Pounds 25.15. At their peak last month they reached Pounds 29.98, after a steep ascent from 800p at the start of 1991. Earnings per share, fully diluted, increased by 28 per cent to 106.2p (83.1p). Most of the company's cash is held in dollars, the strength of which helped to increase reserves to Pounds 52.9m at the end of January, 71 per cent up on January 1992. Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, did not rule out an acquisition this year, but said it was unlikely. Micro Focus supplies software tools for programming in Cobol, internationally the most widely used data processing language. Shipments of Workbench, its leading package, were 29 per cent up, with maintenance accounting for 21 per cent of direct revenues. More than 40 per cent of the company's stock is now held in American Depositary Receipts and another 5 per cent in other forms of US stock. The group is traded on New York's Nasdaq market and has a foreign private issuer status with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. More than half of revenue comes from the US. Mr O'Grady said that despite the depressed market he expected Micro Focus to 'maintain or exceed its current growth rates,' with the company's new 32 bit technology released this year 'the foundation of our product strategy'. Growth in direct sales of software products was up 25 per cent in dollar terms, accounting for 80 per cent of total revenues. Sales to original equipment manufacturers were up 6 per cent. Contracts renewals included Data General, Motorola, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Siemens-Nixdorf and Bull. Staff numbers rose to 613, up from 445 two years ago. Average revenues per head are up from Dollars 382 to Dollars 580. COMMENT Micro Focus continues to dazzle a depressed electronics sector. Analysts expect the rate of increase in US earnings to slow slightly this year, but growth of 20 to 25 per cent remains impressive. With research and development spending up by nearly a third and a cash mountain of Pounds 53m  -which its chairman insists just lets him 'sleep easily at night' - nothing is being left to chance. Both the direct marketing of its software tools, and its maintenance contracts, offer sound prospects for medium-term growth. Pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 26.4m to about Pounds 34m for 1993, equal to earnings per share of 157p. With a prospective multiple of 16, it does not appear over-priced, although no change in dividend policy is expected.</p>

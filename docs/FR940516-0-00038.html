The Act also states that it is the policy of the United States to restrict the export of goods and technical data that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any other country or combination of countries that would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. Accordingly, and in compliance with the other sections of the EAA, the Department conducts a continuing review of commodities and technical data to assure that prior approval is required for the export or reexport of U.S.-origin commodities and technical data to Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Romania, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam only if the commodities or technical data have a potential for being used in a manner that would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. The general policy of the Department is to approve applications or requests to export or reexport such commodities and technical data to these destinations when the Department determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the commodities or technical data are for civilian use or would otherwise not make a significant contribution to the military potential of the country of destination that would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. However, in recognition of efforts made to adopt safeguard measures for exports, Bulgaria, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Mongolia, and Russia are accorded enhanced favorable consideration licensing treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) See parts 776 and 778 of this subchapter for foreign policy based controls governing exports to Country Groups Q, W, and Y.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Country Group Q. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Romania (Country Group Q) has been determined to present a lesser strategic threat, and has adopted safeguard measures to protect against the diversion of national security controlled items. In recognition of these facts, the Commerce Control List includes several Advisory Notes that indicate likelihood of approval or favorable consideration for export to satisfactory end-users in Country Group Q. Items not eligible for favorable consideration will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

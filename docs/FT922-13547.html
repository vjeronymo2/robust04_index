			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Intel blames AMD feud for fall INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported a drop of nearly 7 per cent in first-quarter net income. It blamed the fall on special factors, including an arbitration judgment against the company in its long-running feud with Silicon Valley rival Advanced Micro Devices. Net income totalled Dollars 184m, or 86 cents a share, down from Dollars 197m, or 95 cents, in the first quarter of 1991. Revenues were Dollars 1.24bn, up from Dollars 1.13bn a year ago. The figures included a Dollars 35m reserve to cover payments to Hughes Aircraft as part of a patent infringement settlement, and a Dollars 15m reserve for a possible payment to AMD. In February, an arbitrator gave AMD the right to all technologies embodied in its clone of Intel's popular 386 microprocessor. It awarded the company Dollars 15.3m in damages. Intel said these special charges were partly offset by recognition of Dollars 23m in deferred royalty payments previously received from AMD. Excluding these special events, first-quarter income would have been Dollars 18m, or 8 cents a share, higher. The company said North America was its strongest area for new orders. Europe and Asia-Pacific improved from the fourth quarter, but Japan remained soft.</p>

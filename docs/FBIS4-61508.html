			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 5 May, the "Details" program carries a  recorded 10-minute report on the planned departure of Russian  troops from Germany. Sergey Dorenko outlines the scenario over  video showing Russian troops loading their equipment on to  trains, and says: "The Germans have finally contrived to offend  the Russians: The Russians are given to understand, quite  clearly, that their presence here, unlike that of the Western  allies, is simply only tolerated." He goes on to ask what can be  done about the situation, and suggests that maybe Yeltsin can do  something.    A video sequence then recalls the entry of the allied troops  into Germany at the end of the World War II. Dorenko says: "All  the armies were regarded as liberators. Now they are leaving  Germany without explosions or counterattacks. But the Russian  withdrawal resembles the shameful retreat of losers. The heart  of the problem is that the farewell to the Russians is scheduled  to take place in Weimar. It is planned that on 31 August,  President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl will attend the ceremony  in the local theater. But a week later, widespread festivities  are planned in Berlin, the country's historical capital, at  which all Germany will say goodbye to the Americans, British and  French."    Dorenko then traces the assumed reasons for this situation,  saying that the Western allies were not just occupiers; they  were seen by Germans as their defense against the communist  aggression of the East, personified by the Russian troops in  their country and in the former East Germany.    Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces,  then presents his views, saying: "Probably the best thing would  be a joint farewell to all the allied troops in the anti-Hitler  coalition. And there are good grounds for this: On 7-9 July, a  G-7 meeting with our president, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, will  take place in Italy. It would be very good if, at that time,  after the end of the meeting, the leaders of those states came  to Berlin for a joint leave-taking -- in other words, they would  eliminate the consequences of World War II. We want to have a  farewell in Berlin. The war ended in Berlin. The Soviet troops  too should depart from Berlin. Unfortunately, I think that it  is the German leadership that has suggested a leave-taking  scenario that is not very acceptable, or rather, is unacceptable  to us. "First, as regards the venue, what is Weimar? During  the war, the town of Weimar was liberated or captured by  American troops.    It is 350 km from the places where our troops are stationed.  So they will have to travel all that distance, 350 km. We plan  to invite a large number of veterans from the Western Group of  Forces and from the war. Needless to say, transporting the  veterans there -- six hours there and six hours back -- will not  be much fun for them.    "Second, near Weimar is the huge Buchenwald concentration  camp, where 56,000 people perished, and a common grave was dug  for the peoples of Europe or even the world. I think it would  simply be sacrilege to dance on that common grave. So my  personal view is that I reject Weimar."    Dorenko then points out that no one wants to confuse relief  at the Russian withdrawal with gratitude to the Western allies.  The Russians are leaving not of their own good will, but  because communism has been defeated. Maybe Yeltsin can reach  some agreement during next week's visit.    Defense Minister Pavel Grachev tried to clarify the  situation. He said: "There are a few nuances on the German  side as regards the troop withdrawal issue. Boris Nikolayevich  is to pay an official visit to Germany 11-13 May. I will be  present as a member of a government delegation. One of the  questions to be tackled will be a final decision on the  procedure for the withdrawal, the ceremonial withdrawal, of our  troops from German territory. I am sure that the president and  the chancellor are quite...[pauses] will find a correct,  alternative...[pauses] not alternative, but correct decision on  the withdrawal, the ceremonial withdrawal, of the troops."    Dorenko then points to the difference between the American  and Russian troops, saying: The Americans are taking nothing  with them apart from their weapons. They will be replaced by  U.S. firms, since the premises they occupy have been purchased  from the Germans. The Russians are taking everything, even the  toilets. Many soldiers know that no accommodation awaits them  in Russia.    Grachev comments again, saying: "What is being done? A  great deal is being done. First, 7.8 billion Deutschmarks [DM]  were invested in us initially, then a further DM550 million.  With this money 32 military cantonments should be constructed  by foreign firms before the end of 1995. That is with all the  infrastructure. Thirty-two military cantonments with 34,590  apartments, of which three residential cantonments have been  constructed so far, and the construction of 22 is under way;  there will be 22 cantonments with between three and nine ready  every month, but in practice this year a further 22 cantonments  will be commissioned through the efforts of foreign firms,  although foreign firms are basically to blame for the delay, but  they cite the bad climatic conditions, the harsh winters and, in  general, the vast expanse of Russia."    Dorenko comments: "The officers in the Western Group of  Forces recall that a considerable amount of the aid has been  spent on putting up buildings in Ukraine and Belarus. One can  lament as much as one likes now: It is clear that there are no  apartments and no money, and that a further 32,000 military  personnel and their families have to be housed somewhere."    Toward the end of the program, Grachev says: "I sincerely  congratulate all veterans, all frontline troops, on the great  Victory Day. May the sacred day of 9 May be the start of our  spiritual unification for the sake of Russia's prosperity."</p>

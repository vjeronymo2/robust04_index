			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / BSkyB in talks over ITN supplying news British Sky Broadcasting is negotiating to have its 24-hours-a-day television news channel, Sky News, supplied under contract by Independent Television News. If the deal goes through it would re-create an effective BBC-ITN national television news monopoly in the UK. Talks are believed to be well advanced between the BSkyB satellite television venture and ITN, the ITV television news organisation. They have involved Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, Mr Michael Green, chairman of ITN and of Carlton Communications, and Mr Sam Chisholm, the BSkyB chief executive. Mr Chisholm said last night: 'We have plenty of suitors who want to get involved with us in a whole range of areas. ITN is but one.' Sky News is broadcast across Europe on the Astra satellite and is available to millions of viewers through satellite dishes and cable television networks. ITN, which supplies television news to ITV and Channel 4, already provides news programmes around the clock. For both sides, there are strong incentives to strike a deal. ITN is 90 per cent controlled by three groups - Carlton, which runs the London weekday licence and the Midlands ITV licence, Granada, and Reuters, the news and information group - and is ambitious to expand. Mr Murdoch controls 50 per cent of BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. He is committed to continuing to provide a 24-hour news channel as part of the Sky package of satellite channels. BSkyB has been trying for several years to find a less costly way of providing the news channel, but past talks with the BBC and ITN had come to nothing. Sky News costs about Pounds 30m a year to run and has never made a profit. It is believed that the deal on offer from ITN could save BSkyB about Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m a year. It is understood that a deal will be agreed only if ITN can show that its service will be better as well as cheaper. BSkyB would insist on retaining the Sky News name and editorial control. The talks come as BSkyB prepares for a stock exchange flotation. Although the negotiations about news provision are not believed to be directly related, an agreement would almost certainly be seen as positive for the BSkyB float, which is expected next month. Tuesday's announcement by the Independent Television Commission - that it is deferring until the end of 1995 the need for ITN shareholders to reduce their stakes to 20 per cent - was also probably a precondition for a deal. One large newspaper group yesterday expressed anger that UK television was being completely 'carved up'. The individual ITV shareholders in ITN could continue to hold on to larger stakes than the 20 per cent maximum specified in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, yet newspapers were still prevented from holding more than 20 per cent of an ITV franchise.

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Growth in magazines forecast MAGAZINES are poised for a decade of growth as consumer markets fragment and media audiences become more selective. This optimistic outlook will be unveiled by the Henley Centre for forecasting at the annual conference of the Periodical Publishers' Association in London today The Henley Centre believes that the fragmentation of markets and traditional lifestyles will boost magazines that are closely targeted at particular consumer interests or roles. 'Our forecasts for corporate profitability and consumer affluence and spending suggest that both parts of the magazine sector (business and consumer) will experience strong growth in the 1990s,' Henley says. In the 1980s the number of magazine titles in the UK increased by 75 per cent to more than 6,000. More launches than closures of magazines are expected throughout the 1990s. Magazines' share of total advertising declined slightly from 20.7 per cent to 20.4 per cent in the 1980s. However, there was an increase in spending on magazine advertising from Pounds 643m in 1980 to Pounds 951m in 1990 because of the overall growth in advertising spending. Demographic changes will produce new business opportunities for magazines aimed at parents and older people. 'The strength of the magazine sector in the 1990s will lie in the provision of specialist information and in targeting the roles in peoples' lives,' the Henley report says. According to Advertising Association forecasts, the business, or trade, press will remain the fastest-growing sector of the media, from estimated revenue of Pounds 783m this year to Pounds 2.13bn in 2004 at current prices.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEFORE THE WALL CRACKED;  </P> <P> RAPIDLY CHANGING TIMES DATE A SHOW OF 12 EAST GERMAN ARTISTS AT UCLA'S WIGHT  GALLERY  </P> <P> The tumultuous epidemic of freedom erupted of late in Eastern Europe should  make UCLA's current exhibition as timely as the headlines. Titled "Twelve  Artists from the German Democratic Republic" the show is the first of its kind  in the U.S. and purports to act as a revelation for any citizen laboring under  the delusion that art behind the Berlin Wall is nothing more than slavish  Soviet-style Socialist Realism with its illustrative superman Stakhanovites and  amazons in babushkas.  </P> <P> Actually the rush of real events races so far in front of the two- or  three-year lag-time required to organize an international traveling exhibition  that time conspires to make any such contemporary art show obsolete before it  gets on the wall. Art is fueling itself on extra-artistic shtick these days. It  may pack in the viewers but artistic quality is suffering thereby. Anybody who  looks outside our borders has known for several years that GDR artists have not  been under aesthetic constraints since the '50s and have been pretty well free  to do their own thing since the '70s.  </P> <P> Those who put themselves to the trouble of a little puddle-jumper jet ride to  San Francisco recently saw a show at that city's Museum of Modern Art called  "10 + 10" which proved that even Soviet artists don't do Socialist Realism  these days, if they don't feel like it.  </P> <P> Thus the trendiness issue is partly a red herring in these shows. But they do  contribute to the general realization that, if all this keeps up, we may have  to rejigger our mental map of the world and recast our interior certainties  about who the good and bad guys are and who practices which aesthetic. After  all, our currently fashionable media-based art in the Museum of Contemporary  Art's recent "A Forest of Signs" or the Whitney's "Image World" can plausibly  be construed as a form of social if not Socialist realism with its heavy  cultural and political commentary. Maybe all this real-world stuff is happening  because as they become more like us, we become more like them. There are  significant infusions of old Russian avant-garde agitprop and German Dada  yuppie-fied in current American work. Maybe it is an omen.  </P> <P> Transformative events move so rapidly in the GDR that the  dozen-from-Deutschland show at UCLA's Wight Gallery (to Jan. 21) might carry  the invisible subtitle, "The Way We Were." Organized by the Busch-Reisinger  Museum at Harvard University, it was selected by its curator Peter Nisbet,  veteran critic Dore Ashton and historian Peter Selz. Their catalogue essays  combine to contribute to the feeling that this art had slipped into the past  even before The Wall was breached.  </P> <P> There is something reassuring about the ensemble at first blush. It harks back  to artistic attitudes held here 30 years ago when careers in art were virtually  non-existent and people who wanted to be serious were perfectly willing to take  modest teaching posts and work like austere monks, nourishing art on history  and literature, the concerts and plays on campus, their private lives and  secret emotions.  </P> <P> The GDR work carries this kind of intellectual sobriety and dedication to  obscurity. Significantly the works are all painting and graphics searching for  the individual frisson in traditional form. It shows very little overt  political or social commentary given that German art is traditionally soaked  with Kunstpolitik. The closest approach is in the painting of Thomas Ziegler, a  handsome guy of 42, who lives in Schwerin and owns a dog who looks like Spuds  MacKenzie.  </P> <P> His "Soviet Soldiers" is a four-panel quartet of portraits joined by  Soviet-scarlet backgrounds, baby blue frames and a kind of teeter-totter bench  painted through the four panels. The big-headed soldiers pose in uniform  looking suitably intense but not threatening. What might be caricature is  transformed into humanism even touched with sentimentality. Just an  Expressionist figurative artist doing his thing.  </P> <P> Read between paint-strokes and this art does reveal life in the GDR. During the  period of the greatest forced artistic conformity, the hot artists in the West  were mainly in the mold of England's Francis Bacon. It seems these East block  artists wanted nothing better than to be able to probe this forbidden manner  and to get back the native German styles proscribed by Hitler's "Degenerate  Art" campaign -- the pioneering art that began with Dresden's Die Bruecke (The  Bridge) and ended with the late left-wing Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity).  </P> <P> There is something touching in the modest aspiration to practice in the shadow  of artists that represented the good old days. Veteran septuagenarian Willi  Sitte perpetuates a predecessor in his "Homage to Lovis Corinth" but the  original's animal charge gives way to a tenacious weariness.  </P> <P> Francis Bacon pops up again in the black paintings of Berlin's Heinrich Tessmer  whose brooding self-portraits alternate with drawn "rat sheets" where pairs of  rodents become metaphors of the relations between the sexes. The work recalls  what happened to the city of Alfred Doblin's novel "Berlin Alexanderplatz"  after it was pulverized by the war and everybody lived in ruined cellars.  </P> <P> Echos of post-war Existential Paris echo in another Berlin artist, Walter  Libuda. There are bits of Jean Dubuffet here along with an upside-down hat  tipped to his successful west-end colleague George Baselitz and hints of  British kitchen-sink humanists like Leon Kossoff.  </P> <P> Funny. At 39 Libuda is one of the youngest artists represented but his work has  spiritual contact with the senior figure, Dresden's 88-year-old Theodor  Rosenhauer. Both make an art about lives lived in quiet desperation.  Rosenhauer's seasoned vision sees a cemetery landscape in winter and brings it  an aura of metaphysical resignation. Desperation still makes Libuda a little  crazy.  </P> <P> Viewed artistically the Angst that joins all this work must come from its  shared awareness of stagnation. Everybody here works with shards and tatters of  German Expressionism whose great days ended a half-century ago. Leipzig's  Sighard Gille tries to get one more drop of juice out of a pastiche of Nolde,  Beckmann and Dix in the Christ-complex fantasy, "Party in Leipzig."  Miraculously he succeeds in patches where the paint is as sexy as the subjects.  Veteran fellow Leipziger Bernhard Heisig paints nightmare war fantasies and a  fascinating double-read picture that is both a memento mori still life and a  skeleton playing a trumpet.  </P> <P> In some ways Dresdener Max Uhlig sums up the problem. He makes figures by  painting with the abstract stabs and skeins of a Jackson Pollock. He works well  as do most of these artists -- too well. Results looks like they were painted  by a sleepwalker motel artist, skillful but bored silly.  </P> <P> Old German Expressionism grew out of a very bad patch in history but it was  also a time of immense creativity from the Danube to the Kurfurstendamm and it  crackled with sarcasm, jazz and tango. The GDR work is dignified and  discouraged behind its professorial caricature.  </P> <P> Several artists have drifted into near-autistic spiritual isolation. Gerhard  Altenbourg makes wispy works on paper that are heads becoming progressively  invisible. Carlfreidrich Claus does philosophical landscapes made up of  handwriting. Michael Morgner makes dark splash abstractions with gridded  figures of the crucified Christ. Wolfgang Smy makes innocent bathing figures  that add a touch of the sinister to Max Pechstein.  </P> <P> All seem close to running on empty while calmly aware of their plight. You like  these guys for sticking to their guns but you get the feeling they are aimed at  crumbling bastions whose disappearance may create a newness more frightening  that the dreary comfort of the familiar.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENORAH LIGHTING IS WELCOME RESPITE  </P> <P> In response to the "Menorah Display OK is Outrageous" letter from Douglas E.  Mirell of the American Jewish Congress (Westside, Nov. 18): I would like to see  Mr. Mirell write a letter protesting the lighting of the National Christmas  Tree or the Easter Egg Hunt at the White House. Until that happens, the  credibility of Mr. Mirell and his organization on the menorah issue will remain  close to zero.  </P> <P> I invite Mr. Mirell to come this year and observe the lighting of this menorah  he so objects to. He will be surprised to discover that a large portion of the  attendees are, like me, totally secular Jews who find this a heartwarming event  and a welcome respite from the public Christmas bombardment that we otherwise  are exposed to at this time of year.  </P> <P> DAVID TAMIR  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Arts: Revivals and rarities - Opera in London A recent Arts Council report complained that English National Opera had an insufficient stock of 'revivable productions'. There are no problems for the Royal Opera there: by taking fewer risks in the 1970s and '80s the company has furnished itself with a good number of productions that it can bring back again and again. The present production of Un ballo in maschera has been treading the boards since 1975. It has acquired some fussy stage business lately, but in visual terms its appeal grows. Verdi's opera is set emphatically in the 18th-century Sweden for which it was originally intended, a land of cold gloomy nights and plain interiors. It was a clever idea to design the sets in the style of those at Gustavus's own theatre at Drottningholm, finally revealed in the masked ball of the title. The theme of people in disguise is woven right through the plot, but it is no good any production hoping to dress up second-rate singers. With the Russian soprano Nina Rautio the only surprise is that such a small frame should hide such a big voice. She is not masquerading as a Verdi soprano - the top of the voice is tremendous, unfettered and powerful. Lower down a lack of Italianate colour is a hindrance, but her Amelia makes an undeniable impact. Unlike some sopranos, she has the grace not to dwarf Dennis O'Neill's short but sturdy Gustavus. This is one of the tenor's more effective roles, although crude Italianate effects still lie alongside phrases that are shaped with genuine style. Paolo Coni was overparted as Anckarstrom. His bright, youthful baritone has to stretch to its limit to reach the appropriate level of gravity. Both men sounded strained at the big moments, though for different reasons. There was an Ulrica of some class from Jane Henschel, the fast vibrato an unusual feature, but not unappealing. Judith Howarth has all Oscar's solos under her belt, but never really makes them sparkle. The music Verdi gives her asks to dazzle with its brilliance, which Daniele Gatti made sure it did in the pit. The liveliness of his conducting would be welcome if it was not bought at the price of exaggerated speeds. Unfortunately, the generation of Italian conductors born baton in hand with an innate command of Verdian style seems to be dying out, as are Italian singers with voices on a grand opera scale. Today they eat pizza in Moscow, but Russian singers sing Verdi at La Scala. That is the free market in the late 20th-century. ***** For London opera-lovers, the Chelsea Opera Group does indispensable service of a high order: it unearths, or dusts off, semi-forgotten pieces whose time may have come, or come again. It does that on best advice, with scrupulous preparation and a happy marriage of rising professional soloists with its own semi-pro orchestra and chorus. Sometimes its efforts inspire grander revivals; but the COG's thrifty concert-performances are still dependably rewarding in their own right. At the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday we heard The Nightingale, by the 32-year-old Stravinsky, and the 34-year-old Bizet's Djamileh: not really a close match, though both are Eastern-exotic exercises. Stravinsky's music for his fairytale China drifts between Slav folk-fantasy and percussive barbarism in the vein of Le Sacre - which he had composed between starting and finishing this miniature opera. The one-act Djamileh is pure French operetta. The Nightingale hardly needs rediscovering, for every few years somebody puts it on with the rich costumes and balletic ritual that are part of its conception. Despite its switch of styles in midstream, which used to be thought a decisive fault, it has come to occupy - hauntingly - its own unique niche in the canon. The plain COG performance, in English, justified itself through Michael Lloyd's well-paced conducting, Eileen Hulse's lovely, fluid delivery of the Nightingale's coloratura music, David Barrell's solid character as the Emperor and Philip Sheffield's coolly fervent Fisherman-narrator. Sheffield came into his own in Djamileh, as the hedonistic young Caliph of Cairo who smokes, drinks and gambles as if there were no tomorrow, and expects a new slave-girl mistress every month. If there are young French tenors who can match Sheffield's well-arched, period-stylish legato, bright diction and disarmingly fresh timbre, I have not heard them. He promises to be an invaluable performer in this repertoire. As Djamileh herself, the lovelorn current slave-girl who longs to stay on indefinitely, Margaret McDonald was tremulous and chaste as only a British mezzo can be. Barrell gave us a ripe Splendiano, the Caliph's cynical accountant-cum-procurer. The whole romance floated charmingly, and wanted only some tacky 'exotic' dancing to fill it out. If Bizet's score is lightweight, its chromatic inventions reach beyond anything in his earlier Pearl Fishers (currently at the ENO, and warmly recommended). Here Djamileh made a bracing listen, no less illuminating than engaging: another COG success.</p>

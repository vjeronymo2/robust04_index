Hamilton, Omniwave Electronics Corporation, RCM Corporation, Cherokee Electronics Corporation, Gloucester, Massachusetts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Raymond Tarr was President and Mr. Milton R. Hamilton was an authorized user and the Executive Vice-President of Omni-Wave Electronics Corporation (Licensee), the holder of expired Byproduct Materials License No. 20&hyph;05520&hyph;05 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 30 on November 15, 1985. The License authorized the possession and use of cobalt-60 in any form, up to 10 millicuries, and krypton-85 in any form, up to 500 millicuries, in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The License expired on April 30, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the expiration of the License, the byproduct material has remained at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts, 01930, in a building co-owned by Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton. It was represented to the NRC during a telephone conversation on August 20, 1992, between Mr. Milton Hamilton, Licensee, and Mr. Charles Amato, NRC, that there has been two successors of Omni-Wave Electronics, RCM Corporation and Cherokee Electronics Corporation. The Licensee did not submit an application for renewal of the License pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37 prior to its expiration, nor did the Licensee notify the Commission, in writing, pursuant to 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the License. On January 27, 1992, the NRC, Region I, issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to the RCM Corporation, ATTN: Mr. Milton Hamilton, as successor to the Licensee, for failure to request renewal, or to file a notice of non-renewal or transfer of the byproduct material, prior to expiration of the License. The letter forwarding the NOV directed RCM Corporation to place the radioactive material in its possession in secure storage until such time as it acquired an NRC license, and stated that no other use of that material or purchase of additional material was authorized. RCM Corporation applied for a possession license on March 19, 1992. However, in a telephone conversation with Mr. Charles G. Amato, Health Physicist, NRC, Region I, on July 29, 1992, Mr. Hamilton stated that RCM Corporation was undergoing reorganization and requested that the application be withdrawn. In a letter dated August 3, 1992, the RCM Corporation withdrew its application for a possession license. As of this date, you Omni-Wave, RCM Corporation or Cherokee Electronics Corporation have not applied for, nor obtained, an NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 11, 1993, the NRC, Region I, issued a Confirmatory Action Letter No. 1&hyph;93&hyph;004 (CAL) to Mr. Milton Hamilton of the Omni-Wave Electronics Corporation confirming the Licensee's commitment to develop and submit a decommissioning plan to the NRC Region I office by September 15, 1993, and that the decommissioning work be completed by November 15, 1993. The CAL also stated that Omni-Wave Electronics committed to prepare and transmit to the NRC by November 15, 1993, a report showing the disposition of radioactive material with copies of all shipping papers. On September 9, 1993, Mr. Hamilton requested an extension to the date stated in the CAL, in order to raise funds for the completion of the decommissioning. He stated that due to a very tight budget and the approximate cost for decommissioning, it was anticipated that the decommissioning would be accomplished within 30&hyph;45 days. As of this date, a report has not been transmitted to NRC describing the decommissioning of the facility, nor have copies of shipping papers been submitted to the NRC showing the disposition of radioactive material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 15, 1994, the NRC conducted a special confirmatory safety inspection at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts. The inspection was performed to identify licensed material still in possession under an expired license and to assure that the material was in safe storage. The inspection included the pump room area of the facility, the manufacturing area, and the storage area used for licensed material. The NRC inspector identified cobalt-60 and krypton-85 byproduct material, cobalt-60 contamination, and cobalt-60 waste, at the facility located at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton, as co-owners of the building at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts, remain in possession of non-exempt radioactive material without a license. This is prohibited by Section 81 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, and by 10 CFR 30.3, which state that, (except for persons exempt as provided in 10 CFR Parts 30 and 150), no person shall possess or use byproduct material except as authorized in a specific or general NRC license. Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton continue to possess the radioactive material contrary to Section 81 of the AEA and 10 CFR 30.3, without an NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improper handling of the byproduct material can result in unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic Energy Act and the Commission's regulations require that the possession of licensed material be under a regulated system of licensing and inspection. Given the circumstances surrounding Messrs. Tarr's and Hamilton's possession of the byproduct material and failure of Mr. Hamilton, whether acting on the behalf of the Licensee or RCM Corporation, as successor to the Licensee, or as an individual, to respond adequately to the NOV and CAL, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will be protected while Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton remain in possession of the radioactive material without the required NRC license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, in accordance with Sections 81 and 161b, i, and o of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 10 CFR Parts 20 and 30 the Commission's regulations, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton must: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Cease and desist from any further use of byproduct material now in their possession. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

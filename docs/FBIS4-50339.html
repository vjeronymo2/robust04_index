			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 17 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher today pledged international support for the  fledgling Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank area of Jericho  and the Gaza Strip while visiting the self-rule area, reports  reaching here said.    Christopher, the first foreign VIP to tour the self-rule  area  since Palestinian police took over control, said that the U.S.  had pledged 500 million dollars in aid to the autonomy  government over the next five years, and had started to equip  Palestinian police with 200 U.S. Army vehicles apart from  helping rehabilitate hospitals and schools there.    "Much remains to be done and one of the reasons that I came  here today is to make it clear to our Palestinian friends that  they have supporters," he said amid tight security.    "I must say that it is a tremendous thrill to see the  Palestinian police patrolling, to see the joint patrols, to see  the administrators begin to take over," the U.S. official told  reporters at the Jericho Police Station, which the Palestinian  police took over Friday [13 May].    Faisal Husseini [name as received], one of the members of  the  Palestinian governing authority, expressed welcome to  Christopher's visit to Jericho, saying it is the first step  toward building a new Palestine.    Also today, Israel formally handed over the government of  the  Gaza Strip to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),  although Israeli soldiers still remain in parts of the strip to  be turned over to the Palestinians.    Zakaria al-Agha [name as received], a member of the  Palestinian authority that will govern the strip and Jericho,  and Israeli Major General Dov Gazit signed a two-page document  to accomplish the transfer of power. No ceremony was held for  the takeover.    A similar handover of power in Jericho took place Friday.  Under the accord signed in Cairo two weeks ago, Israel is to  pull out of Jericho and Gaza, handing the areas over to  Palestinian self-rule.    Christopher, who is shuttling between Israel and Syria in an  effort to promote a peace treaty, met later today with Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on his  talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Opinion poll shows few back Mitterrand ONLY about one in four French - 26 per cent - are satisfied with President Francois Mitterrand, according to a weekend Ifop poll, writes David Buchan in Paris. This is the French leader's lowest score since last August. The lift which the Maastricht referendum campaign and public sympathy for his prostate cancer gave Mr Mitterrand has now clearly worn off. Ifop gives a slightly increased favourable rating of 32 per cent to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister. Both men score ahead of their Socialist party, which is expected to win only 20 per cent of the vote in the March parliamentary election.</p>

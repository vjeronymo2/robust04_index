			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (4): Design tool that too many ignore - Guest column / Ivor Owen, director-general of the Design Council, says the industry must realise that the key to survival is to make more high value added products that the world wishes to buy THERE has been a substantial improvement in cost competitiveness of manufactured goods since sterling left the ERM last September. Yet the trade deficit in engineering products is likely to widen during 1993, the Engineering Employers Federation has forecast. This shows that simply reducing product prices will not do much to reduce the deficit or to protect jobs. To do this, more companies must learn that the key to their own survival and to the health of the economy is to make innovative, high added value products that the world aspires to buy. Design is the key to this. It is the design process that controls the transfer of technology to the final product. It determines the quality, cost, manufacturing resources and time to market. Design has a vital role in establishing the commercial success of a product, yet the actual monetary expenditure involved in the design process is small in comparison to the overall project cost. In practice, the costs incurred are mainly those of brain power and labour in preparing designs and developing prototypes. These costs amount to no more than 20 per cent of the total. But it is at the design stage that over 80 per cent of the eventual product costs are determined. Companies have to get the design right first time to avoid those costly reworkings which erode added value. The Design Council has recently carried out a survey of the engineering sector, in conjunction with the manufacturing consultancy, EDS-Scicon, using 700 senior readers of the Council's publication, Engineering magazine. This benchmarking survey revealed that 50 per cent of all products were late to market and that this was fairly consistent across all sectors. The average lateness to market was 27 per cent. As a result, engineering companies are continuously losing substantial profit potential. The survey found that more than two-thirds of these companies overran the development budgets of more than half of their products. The average overrun was 19 per cent. While this is nothing to rejoice about, the impact of this cost overrun is far less serious than failing to introduce the product on time. Concurrent or simultaneous engineering (CE) is now widely recognised as a method by which companies can improve their performance, particularly in terms of cost and time to market. In truth, there is nothing new in CE. Fifty years ago, progressive managements recognised the need for cross-functional communication and simultaneous tasking between design, development, production and marketing departments to reduce overall product development time and to design products which more closely matched customer requirements. In essence, this is what CE is about. However, evidence suggests that British industry falls short in its understanding of CE as a design management tool and how attention to design and management of the design process determine a company's competitive and commercial position. The Design Council survey found that only 16 per cent of engineering companies claim to have adopted CE as the normal way of conducting product development, while 34 per cent had little or no understanding of CE. Companies that do use CE report shorter development times, lower costs and improved quality. The take-up of CE is worst in small manufacturing enterprises (SMEs). Of those companies with turnovers of under Pounds 50m less than 10 per cent practise CE, countering the popular view that smaller firms are more flexible and innovative in their approach to new product development. This situation reflects upon the relatively poor value added performance of UK SMEs. In the UK, only about a quarter of the total added value of manufacturing is produced by companies with fewer than 500 employees, compared with 35 per cent in West Germany, 41 per cent in France and 57 per cent in Italy. These shortfalls in performance are inflicting substantial losses on their balance sheets. Yet getting the design process right is entirely within the control of a company's management, unlike external national and international factors, which are not. One of the major impediments to the wider adoption of concurrent engineering is the cultural shift that it demands. People who have not worked together previously now have to do so on a day-to-day basis. They have to understand the functions of other people and how they affect company performance. The survey found that one oft-cited reason for not implementing CE within a company was difficulty in getting people from different areas to work together as a team. As the global marketplace becomes more competitive, the key to survival will be to integrate internal functions, together with suppliers, into a concurrent engineering operation. Successful implementation of the CE approach to product development docs not come easily. Managements must be prepared to persist, learn from their own mistakes and take a long-term view. The survey found that senior executive's pre-occupation with short-term 'fire-fighting' issues was the single most important factor hindering the effective implementation of CE. One UK defence equipment supplier initiated a pilot CE project about two years ago. After only six months, the team was disbanded because of the need to put more effort into winning immediate business with the current ageing products. At the time the team was disbanded, it had already identified Pounds 450,000 of annual savings through introducing better design for manufacture. At the same time, the team was in the process of laying down the foundations for a new and superior product which would have taken advantage of the latest electronics. The know-how, the revitalised product, the investment in competitiveness, were all lost. But it is not all bad news. An example of good practice is one of the winners of this year's Design Council British Design Awards, a microwave test set designed and manufactured by Marconi Instruments in the UK. Traditionally, up to four different instruments have been required to make measurements and determine a fault on microwave and radar systems: a scalar analyser, sweep generator, power meter and frequency counter. The challenge facing Marconi was to combine the functions of all four into a single compact device. Developments in broadband microwave technology made this possible and enabled a reduction in both the number and complexity of components. Combining the test functions of four instruments into one was not the only challenge facing the design team: the man-machine interface and control software for the transputer also had to be redesigned. Using concurrent engineering techniques, the software and hardware were developed side by side. From product specification to trial batch, the development process took only half the time expected with such a sophisticated piece of microwave hardware. Although the approach required a substantial managerial input, nevertheless it enabled faults and problems to be identified and corrected early on in the development process. Advances such as this will not produce long-term benefits unless they are repeated on every new product development exercise. Generally, however, continued attention to issues of short-term survival has left UK companies vulnerable in the longer term. Discussions suggest that the product development areas of many companies have been cut to the bone in order to respond primarily to current market pressures. When the market picks up, they will not have the capacity to compete. While south-east Asian companies have invested in understanding how to leverage competitive advantage from product development, some UK companies have viewed this as a distraction from their main business. So successful have many Japanese companies become in reducing the time to market of their products that domestic consumers are starting to complain; they are being overloaded with too many choices and products now have so many functions that they are too complicated to operate. What a nice problem to have to face] Taking these factors together indicates that, unless the UK improves its performance, many products will not break even during their projected life cycle. And this, it must be remembered, has little or nothing whatever to do with the external economy; it is under the control of the company's management team. The engineering sector must recognise that the development of products which are commercially viable and economic to manufacture is dependent on using the design process to determine the collective issues of price, product quality, customer appeal and service. Experience shows that the more that companies practise this, the more added value they generate and the less costly the process becomes.</p>

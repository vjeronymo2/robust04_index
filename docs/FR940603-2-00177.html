			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the description of the manufacturing process provided by the ITC in its final affirmative determination of injury (as discussed in the following paragraphs) concerning imports of steel wire rope from Argentina and Mexico (see Steel Wire Rope from Argentina and Mexico, Determinations of the Commission in Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;457 and 479 (Final) Under the Tariff Act of 1930, Together With the Information Obtained in the Investigations, August 1991, pages A17&hyph;A21), the manufacturing process for steel wire rope consists of three major steps: (1) Drawing rod into wire, (2) stranding wire, and (3) closing strands into rope. Camesa Inc. performs only the closing process in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the first step, steel wire rod is heat treated (called patenting), coated, cleaned, and reduced to a smaller diameter through a series of dies to wire. Depending on the amount of reduction during drawing (called the draft), the wire may also undergo patenting and re-drawing to a smaller diameter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the second step, strands are formed in a single operation from individual wires laid about a core so that all wires in a strand can move in unison to distribute load and bending stresses equally. This is achieved with ``tubular'' or ``planetary'' stranding machines. Strand used for making wire rope is generally lubricated as the wires move into the stranding die. After emerging from the stranding die, the strand is frequently ``postformed,'' a process that involves passing the strand through a series of straightening rollers in order to remove excessive twist. The strand may be die-formed or flattened, or coated at this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third step, the finishing operation, is called ``closing'' and is accomplished on a tubular or planetary closer, operating in a manner similar to tubular or planetary stranders. Spools or bobbins of strand are placed in cradles in the closer to dispense simultaneously all strands of a sufficient length needed to make a single rope without a splice. The closing die presses the strands together, forming the rope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above description of the manufacturing process for steel wire rope, we preliminarily determine that the finishing operation performed by Camesa Inc. in the United States represents a minor portion of the manufacturing process of steel wire rope, and adds minor value when compared to the production of the wire strand, as alleged by the petitioner in its anticircumvention inquiry request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has determined, based on BIA, that the quantitative difference between the value of the steel wire rope sold in the United States and the value of the wire strand produced in Mexico is small. Though not necessary for this conclusion, the Department further notes that a qualitative analysis of the manufacturing process for steel wire rope demonstrates that the finishing operation performed by Camesa Inc. represents a minor portion of the manufacturing process of steel wire rope. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the difference between the value of the strand produced in Mexico and the value of the wire rope sold in the United States is small within the meaning of section 781(a) of the Tariff Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 781(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, the Department considered the following factors in determining whether to include strand within the order: (A) The pattern of trade, (B) whether the manufacturer or exporter of the parts or components is related to the person who assembles or completes the merchandise sold in the United States from the parts or components produced in the foreign country with respect to which the order applies, and (C) whether imports into the United States of the parts or components produced in such foreign country have increased after the issuance of such order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Pattern of Trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the Department considers circumvention to be more likely when the imports of the merchandise subject to the order have decreased. To evaluate the pattern of trade in this case, we examined the timing and quantities of exports of steel wire rope from Mexico to the United States during the POI. We also examined the timing and quantities of Camesa's imports into the United States of steel wire rope produced by Grupo Camesa in Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau) statistics indicate that, during the nine months prior to the POI, steel wire rope imports from Mexico to the United States averaged 316.44 net tons per month. However, during the first half of the POI, imports of steel wire rope from Mexico dropped to an average of ten net tons per month. Census Bureau statistics for the second half of the POI were not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Camesa imported steel wire rope from Mexico to the United States prior to the POI, Camesa had no such imports of steel wire rope during the POI. Thus, the pattern of trade of imports of merchandise subject to the order indicates that circumvention may have occurred during the POI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the Department considers circumvention to be more likely when the manufacturer/exporter of the parts or components is related to the party completing or assembling merchandise in the United States using such imported parts or components. See, e.g., Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy, Final Affirmative Determination of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 26100 (April 30, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

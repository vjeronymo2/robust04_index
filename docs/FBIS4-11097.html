			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] Senator [Bernard] Sansaricq has decided to  implement -- with or without the support of the Chamber of  Deputies -- the resolution voted on 10 April by the Alliance  [for Parliamentary Cohesion] senators and the 18 January  senators, demanding the implementation of Article 149 of the  Constitution. The duty of a senator is to help his endangered  homeland, says Sen. Sansaricq, who has set a deadline for the  implementation of this resolution.    [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] "With or without the Chamber  of  Deputies, either we implement it or there will be a clean sweep  [table rase]." Something must be done. The nation is in danger.  The state is threatened to its very foundations. So, I cannot  play with such a situation. I can allow a certain amount of  time, set a deadline, but I think that after this deadline, all  political leaders in the country -- I received many calls  yesterday and today -- I think all truly lucid leaders in the  country will support the Senate in what it wants to do because  something must be done, regardless. [passage omitted] I have  given myself a deadline. This means that if this deadline passes  with nothing having been done, the Senate will provoke a crisis  one way or another, come what may.    [Unidentified reporter] By the way, this resolution is quite  constitutional, according to Bernard Sansaricq, who demands the  support of the Armed Forces. Otherwise, threatens the president  of the Senate's unofficial office, the Armed Forces have only to  get ready to assume power because the military authorities will  have no other choice, given the clean sweep policy.    [Sansaricq] We adopted a constitutional resolution. There is  the principle of requisitioning the Army. "It is up to the Army  to move along a constitutional path, or the Senate will withdraw  after a certain time. We will collectively resign. Then, the  Army will have to assume its responsibilities toward the nation.    [Reporter] "To hold new elections?    [Sansaricq] "Whatever they want to do." [end recording]</p>

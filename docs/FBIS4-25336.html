			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (AFP)--Shanghai police have  launched a formal investigation into prominent Chinese  dissident, Bao Ge, who was detained on the eve of the fifth  anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, a relative said  Wednesday.    Police told Bao's family that the dissident had "broken the  law" and said, without further explanation, that an inquiry had  been opened, the relative said by telephone. Bao was detained  last Friday, the day before the anniversary of the crushing of  the pro-democracy movement in Beijing.    The source said several police searched Bao's parents' home  late Tuesday, and his mother was called to the police station.  But it was not known on Wednesday whether she had been released.    The official detention and investigation papers released to  the family were dated June 5, two days after the dissident's  arrest, the source said.    "Detention for the purposes of investigation should only be  applied in cases where identity is uncertain, but it is the most  widely used method by the police to keep the political  opposition locked up for as long as possible," said Robin Munro,  the Hong Kong based director of Human Rights Watch/Asia.    He added that a measure adopted by the government in 1980,  stipulated that detention in such cases should not exceed three  months.    Police in Shanghai contacted by telephone refused to confirm  the reports and a spokesman for the public security bureau here  said he was unaware of the incident.    Bao, 31, a former teacher of medicine, is one of China's  most  active dissidents. He was detained after he unveiled a new human  rights organisation to mark the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.  The group, which was said to have 167 members, is demanding the  right to free trade unions, freedom of religion and compensation  for the descendants of people killed in the Japanese occupation  of China in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as for relatives of  protestors slain by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) five  years ago.    Bao's detention followed interrogations in April and May of  the leaders of the Chinese Human Rights Organisation, also  based in Shanghai.    The group's secretary general, Wang Fucheng, was questioned  April 14 and put under house arrest. Li Guotao, the group's  president was arrested May 2 and spokesman Yang Zhou, was picked  up ten days later.    "We haven't heard any news from Wang Fucheng for a month and  a half," a member of his family said Wednesday, adding that the  dissidents' telephone lines had been cut.</p>

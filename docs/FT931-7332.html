			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Building outlook varies by sector TWO contrasting outlooks for the construction industry emerged yesterday as housebuilders reported on the continuing revival in the housing market while contractors disclosed that orders for all types of construction fell steeply during the final three months of last year. Figures compiled from industry reports by the Environment Department showed that total orders received by contractors for construction work in Britain fell 10 per cent in the final quarter of last year, compared with the corresponding period in 1991. Private commercial work, mostly offices and shops, and private housing were worst affected, with orders 28 per cent and 18 per cent lower respectively. Total orders in 1992 were 5 per cent lower than 1991, said the department. Builders, however, have reported a revival in sales since the new year with a sharp rise in the number of buyers visiting show homes. A survey by the House-Builders Federation published yesterday showed that three quarters of builders expected to build more homes this year. More than half the builders questioned reported a 'marked improvement' in net reservations and site visits last month. Alfred McAlpine, Page 27</p>

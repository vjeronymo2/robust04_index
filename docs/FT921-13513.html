			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Shamir stands by policy on settlements MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, and his senior Likud party colleagues yesterday proclaimed a determination to maintain Israeli rule over the occupied territories, a stance likely to be the core issue in an impending early general election. With Washington expected to tie the issue of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Israel's request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in US loan guarantees, opposition leaders say Likud's commitment to the territories threatens distress for an economy already hard hit by mass Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. But Mr Shamir brushed this aside when he visited the Jewish settlement of Betar Illit a day after his coalition lost its parliamentary majority following the withdrawal of two extreme rightwing parties, almost certainly precipitating a general election in May or June. 'We see the new building of Betar - the building in all Judaea and Samaria (the West Bank) and the Gaza Strip. No power on earth will prevent this building,' Mr Shamir said. The Likud leadership, drawing confidence from opinion polls indicating that it is well ahead of the main opposition Labour party, has shown little sign it is worried by claims that its stance on the occupied territories will jeopardise relations with the US, damage the aid-reliant economy and prevent hope of a peace settlement in the current Middle East negotiations. Likud has promised to continue the peace process, making capital yesterday out of an ill-judged call by Mr Shimon Peres, the Labour leader, to suspend the talks until after the election. But Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, said: 'This government wants to bring about peace to the people of Israel, but not at the price of our rights to this land.' Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister, said he did not believe reports in US newspapers, widely circulated in Israel, that President George Bush planned to withhold the loan guarantees unless Israel promised to freeze settlement building. A report commissioned by Mr Moda'i to back Israel's loan guarantee request, leaked to the Israeli media on Sunday, points out that Dollars 10bn is only half of the country's external borrowing requirement if the expected 1m immigrants arrive by mid-decade. Reuter adds from Gaza: An Israeli military review panel yesterday upheld an army order to expel seven Palestinians accused of fomenting violence, Palestinian sources said. Israel had announced the expulsion of 12 Arabs on charges of inciting violence early this month after the shooting of four Israelis in ambushes in the occupied territories. The other five Palestinian activists due to be expelled are from the occupied West Bank.</p>

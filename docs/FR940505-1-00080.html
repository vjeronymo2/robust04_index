			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the South Coast FIP area, the proposed FIP rule will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct the gas leak definition in SCAQMD Rule 1173. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed correction defines a gas leak as total gaseous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbon in excess of the applicable parts per million limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured as methane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Sacramento FIP area, the proposed FIP rule will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish an inspection and repair program. In the Ventura FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, the proposed FIP rule will further strengthen the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to make it consistent with those adopted in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> districts and CARB's RACT guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's technical support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. Emission reductions expected from this proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are estimated at 0.8 tpd in the Sacramento area, 2.8 tpd in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast, and 2.1 tpd in Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)(2) Fugitive Emissions from Gas Processing Plants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refineries, Bulk Plants, Bulk Terminals, and Chemical Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Sacramento, South Coast, Ventura). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(i) controls VOC emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fugitive leaks resulting from valves, flanges, fittings, pumps,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compressors, open ended lines and/or other components at gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing plants, refineries, bulk plants, bulk terminals, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical plants. 1990 VOC emissions from these fugitive sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were estimated to be less than 0.9 tons per day (tpd) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento area, approximately 17.5 tpd in the South Coast, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.8 tpd in Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule builds upon current or proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and strengthens and improves existing rules through:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation of additional fugitive sources; lower allowable leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thresholds; correction of rule deficiencies; and improved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection and repair programs. The proposed FIP regulation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on: CARB RACT guidance for the control of fugitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of VOCs from oil and gas production and processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, refineries, chemical plants, and pipeline transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stations; Bay Area AQMD (BAAQMD) Regulation 9_Rules 18, 22, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25; SCAQMD Rule 1173; and EPA's proposed National Emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants (HON) from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry and equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaks from seven other processes (FR 52 62685). <FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although EPA's proposed HON is expected to be finalized soon, the proposed HON covers only emissions designated as hazardous air pollutants, which may make up only a fraction of VOC emissions from affected FIP sources. The proposed FIP fugitives rule is intended to reduce VOC emissions. In some instances, the proposed HON is less stringent than adopted SIP regulations in California and the proposed FIP measure. Although the proposed HON was considered, EPA's proposed fugitives rule relies primarily on current California regulations and/or guidance. After the HON is finalized, EPA will clarify the overlap between existing SIP and/or proposed FIP rules and the proposed HON. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule will establish and/or lower allowable leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels for affected components. Allowable leak levels for valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and connectors are proposed at 500 parts per million based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAAQMD regulations <FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>  and EPA's proposed HON. Allowable leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels for other components are proposed at levels based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB's RACT guidance and SCAQMD Rule 1173.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1997, BAAQMD Regulation 8, Rules 18 and 25 reduce allowable leak levels to 100 ppm for valves and connectors and 500 ppm for pumps and compressors. Although these lower limits are not being proposed as FIP limits at this time, EPA will continue to investigate the need for and potential reductions from leak thresholds consistent with the BAAQMD regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In all three FIP areas, the proposed measure will regulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fugitives from bulk plants and bulk terminals. Because only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of these sources have traditionally been regulated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their fugitive emissions (i.e., loading and storage of petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquids), fugitive emissions may have been underestimated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous inventory projections. Because emission factors were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not readily available for these sources, emission estimates were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made using fugitive emission factors for refineries. Preliminary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses have determined that bulk plant and bulk terminal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions may account for as much as an additional 2.9 tpd in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento area, 9.3 tpd in the South Coast, and 1.7 tpd in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura. Potential reductions from these sources alone would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.2 tpd in the Sacramento area, 4.1 tpd in the South Coast, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.4 tpd in Ventura. EPA requests comments and information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding appropriate emission factors to use for fugitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from bulk plants and bulk terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP rule will correct the gas leak definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in South Coast AQMD Rule 1173. The proposed correction defines a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas leak as total gaseous hydrocarbon in excess of the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts per million limit measured as methane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and other impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's technical support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. Emission reductions expected from this proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are estimated to be 0.7 tpd in the Sacramento area, 3.1 tpd in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast, and 0.7 tpd in Ventura. Fugitive emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions from bulk plants and bulk terminals are not included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the above estimates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Service Stations (Sacramento, Ventura, South Coast). Proposed rule 40 CFR 52.2961(j) reduces VOC emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline dispensing facilities. Gasoline service stations are a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source of VOC emissions created during vehicle refueling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage tank working/breathing losses. Service station VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions are estimated at approximately 3.2 tpd in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento area, 25.3 tpd in the South Coast, and 1.2 tpd in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura. Although service stations in the FIP areas currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have vapor recovery systems, the proposed FIP rule builds upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current Phase I and Phase II regulations and strengthens and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improves existing rules by requiring pressure/vacuum relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valves on open vent pipes and the phasing out of inefficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapor recovery system components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pressure-vacuum relief valves are expected to virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate breathing and working losses from the storage tank vent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pipe. Pressure-vacuum relief valves cost less than fifty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollars, are easily installed without underground construction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and improve efficiency of existing vapor recovery systems by one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to three percent. The pressure/vacuum relief valves typically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay for themselves within less than one year and result in a cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings. Additional emission reductions will be achieved through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elimination of exemptions and the replacement of remote check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valves in Phase II control systems. The Phase I efficiency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be increased through the combined impact of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for poppetted drybreaks in the Phase I vapor control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, the installation of the pressure-vacuum valve on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vent pipes, and the installation of CARB certified spill boxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase II efficiency is expected to be increased through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined impact of using proper tubing between the riser and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispenser cabinet, requiring a certified insertion interlock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism on all bellows-equipped nozzles, and replacing non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coaxial hose with coaxial hose. Many of the proposed revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are based on recent amendments to BAAQMD Regulation 8, Rule 7_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gasoline Dispensing Facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission reductions expected from this proposed rule are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated at 1.3 tpd in the Sacramento area, 8.9 tpd in the South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast, and 0.3 tpd in Ventura. Because fuel savings result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of the pressure/vacuum relief valves and because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inefficient vapor recovery components wear out and can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced by more efficient components during regularly scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance, the cost impacts of the proposed measure will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimized. The overall cost effectiveness is estimated at $1,600  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per ton of VOC reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Waste Burning (Sacramento, South Coast, and Ventura).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(k) controls VOC emissions from waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burning. Waste burning activities are defined as agricultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burning, range management burning, forest management burning, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> open burning. 1990 waste burning emissions <FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>  were estimated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.8 tpd in the Sacramento FIP area, 0.7 tpd in the South Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP area, and less than 0.1 in the Ventura FIP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These estimates do not include emissions from incineration and unplanned fires (e.g., structural fires and wildfires). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most waste burning activities are currently restricted by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissive burn/no-burn day program as specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California Health and Safety Code Regulations. This program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows the local air district office to declare a permissive burn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day or a no-burn day, requires that subject sources obtain a burn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit from the local designated county or state agency, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits burning to permissive burn days. Waste burning is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restricted to days with acceptable air quality based largely on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current and forecasted visibility and particulate levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP rule would complement and expand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current permissive burn/no-burn day program to incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambient ozone air quality considerations. The purpose of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal is not to ban waste burning but to restrict waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burning to days when ambient ozone concentrations are within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable levels. On days predicted to exceed the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambient air quality standard for ozone (0.09 ppm), all forms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste burning would be prohibited. EPA is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigating the methodologies used to predict ozone exceedances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and no-burn days. These methodologies could be used to predict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air quality conditions using current and forecasted weather,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meteorology, ozone levels, and other relevant criteria. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar forecasting strategy would be used as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed FIP waste burning rule. SMAQMD has a voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissive burn/no-burn program which takes into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predicted high ambient ozone levels. VCAPCD restricts burning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the California ozone standard of 0.09 ppm is expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not contained within the proposed FIP rule, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects to establish a notification system compatible with and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to those already in place for current permissive burn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day/no-burn day programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because poor visibility or high particulate levels can also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result during conditions conducive to high ambient ozone levels,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is expected to be some overlap between current no-burn days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and any additional no-burn days resulting from the proposed FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. During 1990 no-burn days were declared on 16 days in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento FIP area, 68 days in the South Coast FIP area, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 311 days in the Ventura FIP area. Using 1990 air quality data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule is expected to restrict burning on an estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional 45 days per year (dpy) in the Sacramento FIP area, 121  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dpy in the South Coast FIP area, 3 dpy in the Ventura FIP area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Sacramento area, the largest impact would occur on days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during July through September when ozone levels typically reach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their highest levels. In the South Coast, the largest impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would occur on high ozone days during March through October.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of Ventura's current policy on waste burning, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would have minimal impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

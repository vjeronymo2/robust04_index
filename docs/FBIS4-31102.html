			<p>CSO     [Text] The Finance Ministry has prepared the draft of the  bill necessary to establish building and loan associations.  Hopes are that the new institutions will provide depositors with  loans at less than 10-percent interest.    The head of the housing policy department of the Finance  Ministry, Pal Cseh, told NEPSZABADSAG that 15 years ago, when  youth savings accounts were introduced as a form of savings for  a purpose, they were patterned on Western building and loan  associations. By now it is possible to establish such  institutions in Hungary as well. However, to be able to do so,  the law on financial institutions must be amended. Banking  experts have already developed concrete ideas. According to Pal  Cseh, the bill can be submitted to parliament as early as this  year.    The building and loan associations will be specialized  financial institutions with special regulations on the  management of depositors' money and on who, when, and after how  many years of saving credit can be granted.    In this type of financial institution the participants  finance each other, Pal Cseh emphasized. In other words, the  depositors get low interest on their savings, but the conditions  of the loans are also formulated accordingly. In the department  head's opinion, the ideal would be if the interests on housing  loans did not reach 10 percent. However, he said, it is not the  task of the law to determine that.    Any bank already operating in Hungary will be allowed to  establish building and loan associations but--as Pal Cseh  pointed out--both the operation of these institutions and the  regulations concerning them are very complicated, and therefore  it will be beneficial to choose an experienced Western partner  for their establishment.</p>

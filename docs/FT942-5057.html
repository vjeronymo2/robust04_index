			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Major's man in Dorset plays the multi-speed card: John Authers finds allegations of dirty tricks have arisen in a closely fought Euro-seat Mr Bryan Cassidy, Tory MEP for the Liberal Democrat target seat of Dorset and East Devon, is clear about his attitude to Europe. 'I'm a Euro-sceptic,' he says, 'but not a Europhobe.' The distinction is important, he says, and lies at the heart of his campaign to hold on to the seat. His aim is to enthuse voters about Europe's importance, and the potential for local benefits - increasing the chance that they will turn out to vote - while also tapping distrust of the Brussels bureaucracy. Mr John Major's call for a 'multi-speed' Europe suited Mr Cassidy and he is quick to mention it to voters as his campaign Land Rover blares Beethoven's Ode to Joy, the European anthem. Keeping the campaign on European issues is the only way to avoid turning the election into a referendum on Mr Major's record at Westminster, and the 'multi-speed Europe' position, says Mr Cassidy, is one the party can defend on the doorstep. The Liberal Democrats are emphasising local issues. Last week saw the launch of a petition against the closure of rural post offices. Mr Philip Goldenberg, the candidate, has also helped to collect a petition against value added tax on fuel. Lib Dem election literature stresses Conservative 'broken promises' on VAT, income tax, education and the National Health Service. Meanwhile the party's national figures, including Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader, make regular visits. There have even been allegations of dirty tricks. Mr Goldenberg reported Mr Cassidy to the European Court of Auditors for 'alleged misuse of public money for electioneering purposes', while Mr Cassidy has complained of 'political hoodlums' stealing his poster boards. On paper, Dorset and East Devon is one of the Liberal Democrats' best hopes of victory. The party won Dorset County Council last year, and opinion polls predict that it will win the seat. Christchurch, scene of a sweeping by-election victory last year, was within the seat until its boundaries were redrawn earlier this year. But Dorset is not as fertile territory for the party as the Somerset and Cornwall Euro-seats, both of which have two Liberal Democrat MPs. All the Dorset Euro-seat's seven Westminster constituencies are held comfortably by Conservatives, and most of it is untouched by South West Water's high charges, which provoke bitter opposition further west. Socially, the seat resembles the Conservative heartlands of the Home Counties and the south coast more than it does the non-conformist west country. Apart from the conurbation of Bournemouth and Poole, the towns are predominantly agricultural market towns, while many residents in the east of the county are retired pensioners from the Home Counties. Mr Cassidy encountered plenty of anger on the placid streets of Bridport last week, but most of it - perhaps because the Ode to Joy was playing in the background - was directed at Europe, not at Mr Major. An elderly gentleman, asked if he would vote Tory, said: 'I don't think so somehow, not this time. I'm very anti-Common Market. It's cost me too much money.' He said he would vote for the 'anti-Common Market candidate'. There are two, a Conservative Anti-Federalist and the UK Independence party. A traffic warden was angrier: 'We're listening to people in Brussels telling us what to do. It interferes with me in my life, in what I have to buy. They try to stop us making our own cider and farmhouse cheese.' Mr Cassidy dismissed these as 'media myths'. Out on the stump, talking about Europe, the seat appears safe for the Tories, and yet there is a perceptible air of unease about the campaign. They know that if Dorset did opt for the Lib Dems, no special local factors could be blamed as would be possible in Cornwall or Somerset. It would be an unambiguous vote of protest against the Conservative government. One Tory-voting local businessman articulated the concern: 'How are you going to get people to vote for you on Europe as opposed to what they've seen in the country as a whole?' He added: 'As far as Westminster is concerned, there's been a lot of incompetence, I would suggest. It's unprofessional at best.'</p>

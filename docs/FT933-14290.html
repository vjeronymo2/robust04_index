			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht showdown brought forward MR JOHN MAJOR last night brought forward a crucial Commons debate on the Maastricht treaty as ministers began a last-ditch campaign to persuade Tory Euro-sceptics to abandon their efforts to wreck the treaty. Ministers said that the debate on Britain's opt-out from the treaty's social provisions would be held next Thursday, four days earlier than originally planned. The decision - which will be endorsed by the cabinet this morning - is designed to put as much time as possible between a threatened defeat on the social chapter and the Christchurch by-election the following Thursday. But it comes amid private warnings that whatever the outcome of the debate the government now has little prospect of avoiding a humiliating rout at Christchurch. The air of desperation in the Tory campaign was underlined by a warning from a senior minister yesterday that defeat could hasten the next general election - and the possibility of a Labour government. Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, later clarified his remarks, insisting that the Tories would win both the by-election and the next general election. But his apparent gaffe reflected deep pessimism in the government about its prospects in Christchurch. Ministers are predicting privately that the 23,000 Tory majority in the once rock-solid seat could be replaced by a Liberal Democrat majority of upwards of 10,000. The Commons debate will come after the Maastricht Bill has received the royal assent early next week. Hard-line Tory Euro-sceptics plan to vote with Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs for a motion which would call on the government not to ratify formally the treaty unless it abandons the social chapter opt-out. The cabinet has been told that a victory for the Labour amendment would not have legal force and the government could press ahead regardless with ratification. But Mr Major is aware that rejection by MPs of the social chapter opt-out would represent another damaging blow to his personal authority. Ministers have been told not to speak publicly about the government's tactics in the event of such a defeat. But the Tory rebels are to be told privately that they will not prevent ratification by voting with the opposition. At present about a dozen Tory Euro-sceptics are threatening to defy Mr Major, but Tory party managers are courting assiduously the support of Ulster Unionist MPs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, political </F> state secretary-designate of the Foreign Ministry, by Margit  Kocsi; place and date not given]    [Text] Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, who, in accordance with the  coalition agreement, will be the political state secretary of  the new Foreign Ministry, envisages good and substantial  cooperation between the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. Speaking to MAGYAR  NEMZET, the SZDSZ politician said that the new government's  foreign policy ideas will already emerge at the meeting of the  eight Eastern-Central European foreign ministers and the U.S.  secretary of state in Warsaw on 7-8 July, although Hungary will  probably still be represented by Geza Jeszenszky.    Istvan Szent-Ivanyi told us that efficient and correct  working relations had developed in the past four years between  him and Laszlo Kovacs, the foreign minister-designate. It also  transpired from Istvan Szent-Ivanyi's words that he was  preparing for the tasks of state secretary with great  expectations, because this position has the advantage of  providing a genuine role in direct foreign affairs activity and  in shaping foreign policy.    Therefore, it was only natural that he considered everything  thoroughly before deciding to accept the position.    As for the immediate tasks, he spoke about the handing over  of the ministry and various important international events, like  the foreign ministers meeting with Warren Christopher in Warsaw.  Istvan Szent-Ivanyi pointed out that they would prefer to see  the views of the new government gain ground. In his view, he  thinks it is legally acceptable to have Geza Jeszenszky still  represent Hungary at the aforementioned meeting. At the same  time, it is also important that a close coordination precede all  this, with the participation of Geza Jeszenszky, Laszlo Kovacs,  and himself, as well as the professional diplomats. Another  urgent task is the upcoming conference in the framework of the  Central European Initiative, also at the foreign ministerial  level. The most important international event to be directed by  the Hungarian Foreign Ministry is the CSCE summit to be held in  Budapest in the autumn.    In connection with the Hungarian minorities living beyond  our  borders, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi confirmed that the two-party  coalition committee has already formulated the major principles  in this area. They want to preserve the current level of support  by any means, but this support must be open, public, and  controllable through parliamentary means. Support for the  educational, cultural, and mass communication needs of the  minorities will receive priority. Answering a question, Istvan  Szent-Ivanyi said he did not know whether the current Hungarian  ambassador in Bucharest, Erno Rudas, will head the office of  ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders and of national  minorities living in Hungary. The Socialists will decide on  this state secretary position affiliated to the office of the  prime minister.    In conclusion, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi expressed his  satisfaction  that, according to the coalition agreement, the SZDSZ can hold  the position of chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs  Committee and, according to the plans, the concrete personnel  decision will be made at the meeting of the SZDSZ group in  Parliament on 27 June. Matyas Eorsi and Istvan Musto are  mentioned as prospective candidates.</p>

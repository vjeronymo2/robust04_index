			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: British Gas With the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into British Gas, the outlook for the shares is very uncertain. But investors can try to estimate what the shares would be worth under various possible outcomes, assuming that the government's doctrine of increasing competition is used as the MMC's guiding principle. One way to achieve this would be to split British Gas into a regulated pipeline business, which is a natural monopoly, and several marketing companies which could compete to sell gas. If the marketing businesses are assumed to earn returns similar to that of the regional electricity companies, and the pipeline company is allowed a higher rate of return than currently, then the value of breaking up British Gas could be over 300p a share. But there are problems. At present there is no sign that a demerged British Gas would be allowed to earn higher rates of return. Another approach, similar to that agreed with the Office of Fair Trading this year, would be to allow British Gas to remain intact, but separate its pipeline and marketing operations by internal Chinese walls, with outside companies providing competition in marketing. British Gas has already lost a substantial part of its firm contract market. Once again, unless the company were allowed to earn higher returns from the pipeline operation, the profits outlook would be poor and might not justify the current 240p share price. One difference between the two models is the ability to cut costs - a demerged company would have higher overheads, whereas British Gas as a single unit might axe regional centres. That pulls the two valuations closer together, but the central question remains the level of allowed earnings. Competition can only be encouraged through higher gas prices or slimmer profits on the pipeline. There can be little doubt which the government will choose.</p>

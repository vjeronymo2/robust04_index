			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE NEGATES $7.5 MILLION FOR VICTIM OF RAPE;  </P> <P> COURTS: ATTORNEY DID NOT PROVE PARALYZED WOMAN IN NURSING HOME SUFFERED DAMAGE,  JUDGE RULES. HOSPITAL STAFF FOUND NOT TO BE NEGLIGENT.  </P> <P> A judge Wednesday set aside a $7.5-million jury award to a paralyzed woman who  became pregnant after being raped at a North Hollywood nursing home, ruling  that the woman's attorney did not prove that she suffered damage from the  incident.  </P> <P> San Fernando Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter also found insufficient  evidence to support the jury's verdict that negligence by the staff of the  Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital led to the rape of Andrea Nerpel, 38, who had  lived there since suffering major brain damage in a car accident when she was  19.  </P> <P> "There was no basis for the jury's finding other than mere speculation,  sympathy, or compassion," Schacter said.  </P> <P> "All of us are aware that a terrible wrong was done to Andrea Nerpel by an  unknown person. Any rational person would have feelings of sympathy for the  plaintiff, and disgust and rage against the unknown perpetrator. However,  vengeance on the nursing home, which is the apparent basis for the jury  verdict, is not the solution," he said.  </P> <P> Nerpel's family sued the nursing home for negligence on her behalf and a jury  awarded her $7.5 million in damages after a month-long trial.  </P> <P> Unable to move or communicate meaningfully since the 1969 accident, Nerpel  became pregnant in 1982. Her grandmother, Elian Rose, learned of the pregnancy  about three months later during a visit to the nursing home. Nerpel, who is fed  through a tube in her stomach, had an abortion and was sterilized. The rapist  was never identified.  </P> <P> In his closing argument, the family's attorney, Alan J. Schultz, said the  cost-conscious nursing home did not provide security for its patients. He urged  them to punish the nursing home's parent corporation, Western Medical  Enterprises Inc., by granting Nerpel substantial damages.  </P> <P> Explaining his decision to overturn the verdict, Schacter chastised Schultz for  failing to produce evidence to support his contentions that the nursing home --  where Nerpel continues to live -- was negligent in caring for the patients,  hiring reliable employees, or maintaining security on the premises.  </P> <P> The judge called Schultz's closing argument "inflammatory" and said it violated  the judge's earlier order that he not ask for punitive damages. He also said  Schultz offered no evidence that Nerpel suffered damage as a result of the  incident. During the trial, nursing home attorney Richard B. Castle argued that  Nerpel was totally unaware of her surroundings and did not know she had been  raped.  </P> <P> "Even her grandmother admitted she did not know if Miss Nerpel knew or was  aware what had happened to her, either at the time of the sexual activity or  later," Schacter said.  </P> <P> Schultz said he plans to appeal the judge's ruling.  </P></p>

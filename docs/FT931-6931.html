			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Renison falls to ADollars 10m in first half RENISON Goldfields, the Australian mineral sands, tin, gold and copper mine which is 40 per cent owned by Hanson of the UK, yesterday posted a fall in net profits to ADollars 10.35m (USDollars 7.21m) for the first half to December, from ADollars 23.54m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Sydney. The group also said it would have difficulty matching the profits in the second half. Sales advanced to ADollars 328.9m from ADollars 299m; earnings per share fell to 5.2 cents from 11.9 cents; and the interim dividend is being halved to 2.5 cents. Mr Campbell Anderson, managing director, said: 'The company does not anticipate any significant market recovery in the second half.' He said that, to contain operating costs, plant rationalisation in mineral sands might require a limited write-down of existing plant and equipment. He said the first-half result was disappointing and reflected mainly depressed conditions in most of Renison's principal commodity markets. Mr Anderson said US dollar gold prices were below those of a year ago, and the price improvement experienced in copper and tin early in the half year proved to be short-lived.</p>

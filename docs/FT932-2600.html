			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Waste recycling scheme needs more paper money: Germans build garbage mountain GERMANY'S much-vaunted waste recycling system is collapsing under the weight of its own success, collecting four times more plastic garbage than it can recycle, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Duales System Deutschland (DSD), set up by German companies to collect and recycle household waste, said it urgently needed DM500m (Pounds 201m) just to keep going this year. Mr Wolfram Bruck, the company chairman, warned yesterday that DSD could not ensure the recycling of the garbage it was collecting and called for a complete rethink of the system. Rhineland-Palatinate withdrew from the scheme this week, complaining that it was 'collapsing under 8,000 tonnes of plastic garbage with nowhere to put it'. DSD was set up by industry two years ago after the introduction of an environmental law which forces manufacturers to take back and recycle packaging products. While DSD has been successful in dealing with paper, glass and aluminium, for which facilities already exist, it is failing to find adequate outlets for plastics, which is costly and difficult to process.</p>

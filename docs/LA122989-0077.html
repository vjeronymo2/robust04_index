			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL  </P> <P> TODAY'S GAMES  </P> <P> NONCONFERENCE  </P> <P> EAST TENNESSEE STATE (8-2) at UCLA (7-1), 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> TV -- Prime Ticket, 10:30 p.m. (delayed). RADIO -- KMPC (710).  </P> <P> This is the first meeting between the schools. UCLA, which has won three in a  row since losing to Notre Dame Dec. 17, shot a season-high 54.2% in Wednesday  night's 74-65 victory over Fresno State. Forward Don MacLean led the Bruins  with 25 points and nine rebounds. With Kevin Walker still struggling -- he made  one free throw and grabbed one rebound in 10 minutes Wednesday night -- Tracy  Murray has been playing more and responding well. The 6-foot-8 freshman had 18  points and five rebounds against Fresno State, and in the last three games has  averaged 26 minutes, 16.3 points and five rebounds.  </P> <P> East Tennessee State played in the Chaminade tournament in Hawaii, where the  Buccaneers beat East Carolina and Chaminade but lost to Maryland. All five  starters are back from last season's squad. The biggest victory for the  Buccaneers this season was over North Carolina State, 92-82, at Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> FAR WEST TOURNAMENT at Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE (4-4) vs. BOSTON UNIVERSITY (2-6), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KWNK (670).  </P> <P> In the first round, Louisiana Tech rallied in the second half to beat  Pepperdine, 76-73. Dexter Howard led the Waves with 17 points, while Shann  Ferch and Craig Davis scored 16 and 13, respectively. Tom Lewis, recovering  from a dislocated little finger on his right hand, had just three points.  Oregon State routed Boston University, 86-66, in another first-round game.  Steven Key, who had been averaging 17 points a game for the Terriers, was held  to seven points. The Terriers had 27 turnovers against the Beavers.  </P> <P> COWBOY SHOOTOUT at Casper, Wyo.  </P> <P> CS FULLERTON (5-2) vs. MIDDLE TENNESSEE ST. (4-3), 6 p.m., PST.  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KMNY (1600).  </P> <P> After a 5-0 start, Fullerton has lost its last two games, falling to Colorado  State by 29 points and to UCLA by 12 in the first of six road games in a row.  Fullerton had an eventful practice Thursday. Cedric Ceballos, whose 23.4-point  average leads the team, required five sutures after taking an elbow above his  left eye, but Coach John Sneed expects him to start. Center John Sykes, whose  eye has been irritated by an allergic reaction, practiced but is expected to be  replaced in the starting lineup by freshman Aaron Wilhite. And Sneed said that  junior reserve forward Ron Caldwell will not play after exchanges in practice  in which Sneed repeatedly called Caldwell "a loser" and Caldwell responded by  balking at running sprints and sitting out part of practice. Middle Tennessee  State has two starters back from a team that went 23-8 and upset Florida State  in the NCAA tournament.  </P></p>

These amendments are necessary to bring the practices and provisions established in part 68 into conformity with the provisions of the INA. Specifically, these amendments clarify the amount of time a party has to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is effective August 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Gerlad S.

After receiving comments, the Department published the final rule on November 24, 1989. 54 FR 48593. That rule governed all cases properly brought before an Administrative Law Judge that complied with the requirements of the INA. Then, on November 28, 1990, Congress enacted the Immigration Act of 1990, which amended sections 274A and 274B of the INA, and added section 274C. These amendments necessitated certain revisions to the practices and procedures established by part 68, which were set forth in an interim rule with request for comments, published October 3, 1991. 56 FR 50049. After receiving comments, the Department published the final rule on December 7, 1992. 57 FR 57669. The final rule, however, did not distinguish between the time the Administrative Law Judge issues an order and the time a final order is issued. This distinction is critical in clarifying the amount of time a party has to appeal a final agency order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals. A proposed rule clarifying this time period was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 18, 1994. 59 FR 2548. Although comments were requested, none were received. Based upon experience gained by the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer in implementing the hearing procedures and the statutory language regarding the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer's review authority found at sections 274A(e)(7) and 274C(d)(4), &sect;68.2 paragraph (i) is revised to reflect the reference made to the definition of ``entry'' in the revised definition of ``issued'' at &sect;68.2(k), and &sect;68.2 paragraph (k) is amended to account for the thirty (30) days the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer has to modify or vacate an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or 274C proceeding after the Administrative Law Judge enters the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, section 1(b). The Attorney General has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Attorney General, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

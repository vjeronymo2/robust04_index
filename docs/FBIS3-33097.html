From a talk with workers at La Catalina UBPC, he  learned that they expect to receive over 800 pesos per capita  profit at the end of this year, in addition to daily advances  for their work.    Machado noted the enthusiasm that prevails in La Catalina  because of the results obtained by this UBPC in the short time  it has been in existence, and emphasized the need to put into  practice the profitability schema, which will be able to  systematically measure productivity.    Machado Ventura also exchanged views with workers and  leaders  of the Camilo Cienfuegos livestock UPBC in Guane Municipality,  where he expressed appreciation for that UBPC's good performance.</p>

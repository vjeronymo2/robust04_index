			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Further talks over future of Colonia UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the leading player in the French insurance industry, may be approaching the end of its protracted negotiations over the future of Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire. Mr Gerard Worms, president of Suez, the French financial and industrial group which has a majority stake in Victoire, said yesterday that his group was orchestrating discussions between UAP, Victoire and Colonia to 'find a solution to this delicate problem'. He suggested the likeliest outcome would be for Victoire, which owns 78 per cent of Colonia, to cede half its shares in the German company to UAP so that they both held 50 per cent of the business.</p>

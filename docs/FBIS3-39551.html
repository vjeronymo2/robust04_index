The document, drafted during meetings to examine to U.S.  trade pratices, emerged as Washington was threatening Japan with  severe reprisals if Tokyo failed to open its markets to  U.S.-made portable telephones.    The United States has warned that it will prepare a list of  Japanese products on which U.S. duties will be increased if  Tokyo does not come forward with plans to give foreign portable  telephone manufacturers greater access to Japanese consumers.    Washington contends that Japan is violating a 1989 accord on  such equipment.    But the GATT report found that many parties to the agreement  see U.S. trade policy as "unilataralist" and contradictory.    "They point to what they consider the contradictions  inherent  in laws aimed at opening markets based on threats to close  markets."    They cited in particular U.S. legislation known as "Section  301."    "There is a growing number of complaints from trading  partners concerning the increased resort to these laws and the  methods used to determine dumping, subsidization and injury,"  the report said.    It noted that while the United States over the past two  years  has made "relatively restrained use of these laws," it has  nonetheless "introduced new procedures to maintain pressure on  foreign governments."    The study criticized those voices in the United States  urging  greater protection against "high-savings countries with which  the bilateral deficits are greatest" -- notably Japan.    It said that "pressure to take bilateral action against  these  partners threatens both the openness of the U.S. trade regime  and the multilateral system."    GATT found that the United States does not always apply the  lofty principles of free trade that it defends in debates with  its principal partners. While the United States maintains  restrictive legislation to protect its own producers it  pressures other countries to open their markets still wider,  according to GATT.</p>

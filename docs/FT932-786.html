			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities drift lower in light selling A WARNING from the UK chancellor of the exchequer that domestic taxes might have to be raised this autumn if the economic recovery fails to accelerate unsettled the London stock market yesterday. Share prices gave ground again but selling pressure remained light and the market steadied to hold on to the lower end of the new trading range which has emerged this week. Mr Kenneth Clarke also indicated, in an interview with the Financial Times, that there was no immediate prospect of a further cut in UK base rates and that he would take no risks with inflation. Although uneasy at the opening, the stock market left it to the stock index futures sector to set the pace for the day. An early fall in the September contract on the Footsie soon turned the underlying market downwards and by mid-session the index was down by 11.5. Distortions were caused by erratic movement in shares of Rothmans International as they returned from suspension following disclosure of details of the restructuring of Richemont, the Zurich-based parent. Trading volume in equities was thin, however, and the market rallied from the day's low of 2,883.2, which was the top end of the trading range broken at the beginning of the week. By the end of the session, the FT-SE Index had recovered to 2,887.5, a net loss on the day of 7.2 points. Seaq volume of 509m shares was focused on the Footsie list, with non-Footsie business dropping to only 54 per cent of the total. On Thursday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.14bn. Market strategists remained confident that the Footsie has established itself in a new trading range based on the 2,800 area. However, the equity team at SG Warburg yesterday maintained its year-end forecast at 2,900, commenting that there was 'little sign yet' of the earnings upgrades which had been expected by the bulls. The FT-SE 100 Share Index ended the week a mere 8.1 points up as fading hopes of reductions in German and UK interest rates took the heart out of a market encouraged at first by improvement in the latest UK economic data, especially the better employment figures. The week also brought profit-taking in the second line stocks which had been outperforming the blue chips. Yesterday's fall of 2.6 put the FT-SE Mid 250 Index at 3,215.8, compared with the all-time peak of 3,218.5 reached on Monday.</p>

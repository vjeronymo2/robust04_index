The purpose of the data collection is to obtain customer satisfaction information from those entities who are funded to be our partners in the delivery of services to the American public. ACF partners are those entities that receive funding to deliver services or assistance from ACF programs. Examples of partners are States and local governments, the territories, service providers, Indian Tribes and tribal organizations, grantees, researchers, or other intermediaries serving target populations identified by and funded directly or indirectly by ACF. The surveys will obtain information about how well ACF is meeting the needs of our partners in operating the ACF programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of the information collection may be obtained from Edward E.

This request is for the generic clearance for the Administration for Children and Families to implement Executive Order 12864 within the agency in relation to the satisfaction of those entities who are funded to be our partners in the delivery of services to the American public. ACF's partners are those entities that receive services or assistance directly from ACF programs such as State and local governments, the territories, the District of Columbia, Indian Tribes and tribal organizations, grantees, service providers, researchers, and significant other intermediaries serving target populations identified by and funded directly or indirectly by ACF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACF will conduct voluntary confidential surveys of our partners to identify strengths and weakness in the administrative management of ACF programs and to determine how we can better serve our partners so together we can better serve the American public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The generic surveys of our partners will provide descriptive and statistical information on ACF programs across at-least twelve (12) major domains: Welfare, child support enforcement, vulnerable youth, day care, employment training, Head Start, emergency assistance, family violence, foster care, adoption assistance, services to special populations, and refugee resettlement. For each domain, ACF intends to use information provided by out partners to determine the kind and quality of services they want and expect, their level of satisfaction with existing services an to implement improvements where feasible and practical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The voluntary partnership surveys will focus only on issues of direct concern to our partners regarding their relationship and opinions on the level of efficiency and quality of services provided by ACF. These concerns may include: Partnership arrangements in policy formulation and implantation of program strategies, considerations of Federal, State and local administrative management practices in policy formulation, appropriateness and timeliness of decisionsmaking, timeliness of funding allocations and grant awards, utility of information collection, efficacy of information sharing, the elimination of inoperable internal rules and guidelines, courtesy and cooperation of federal staffs with out partners, assessing the effectiveness of technical assistance provided and the need for additional technical assistance, adequacy of problem resolutions, multi-cultural sensitivity in the decision-making process, and the attainment of goals and outcomes that can be used to measure the efficiency and cost effectiveness of ACF programs in meeting the needs of children, youth and families at the ACF level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Estimate of the Burden of Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Estimates of response burden are outlined in the following tables: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 5,L2,tp0,i1,s100,10,10,xs50,10 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Annual number  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> respondents  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Average annual  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> frequency  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Average  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> burden per  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> response  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Annual  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> burden  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> hours <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> States gov'ts  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 51  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 10  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1 hour  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 510 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4706 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above figures are based on an estimate of approximately one (1) hour per response to respond and submit the information. The 51 respondents include the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The figure in the annual burden hours column takes into account State supervised, county administered (State supervised), and State administered programs where the county must submit data to the State prior to its aggregation and submission to the Administration for Children and Families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to select approximately 10 States per year. The ten (10) States will represent both large and small States and county and State administered units. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 --> </ADDRESS> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: In search of markets further afield - British Gas has embarked on a strategy of global expansion FOR MONTHS, British Gas has been running expensive advertisements proclaiming itself as 'a world class energy company', stressing the size of its global business. Yesterday it sold off the largest chunk of that business, the CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 612m) Consumers Gas company in Canada. Was this a change of tack? Certainly not, maintain British Gas' top executives. If anything, it represents a desire to attack world markets more aggressively than before. Although British Gas bought Consumers Gas only three years ago, the world market has undergone huge changes in that short time, says Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive. A liberalisation trend has swept through the gas business; countries are privatising state energy companies, and new markets are appearing. In this new world, the 11 per cent after-tax return that British Gas obtained from its Pounds 506m investment in Consumers began to look unexciting. Canada was a mature market where the gas distribution business was heavily regulated, so when an unsolicited offer arrived from Interprovincial Pipe Line System, British Gas was receptive. 'There's limited potential for upside growth there,' said Mr Brown. 'The world has moved on. It makes a lot of sense to take a very good offer, then we can use the money much more effectively elsewhere.' The reason for this optimism is that British Gas sees itself at the forefront of a dynamic world business. With gas now the fastest growing energy source, the company expects investment in both the upstream and downstream ends to total between Dollars 800bn and Dollars 1100bn (Pounds 740bn) over the next 20 years. Mr Russell Herbert, the director in charge of the global business, sees worldwide demand growing by 500bn cubic meters over the next 10 years. 'If you need to get a feel for the weight of that, it's the size of the entire UK market,' he said. The direction in which British Gas is looking for opportunity is towards changing markets and the developing world. One instance of the former is, ironically, Europe, where national gas systems are still fragmented, but ripe for growth, particularly once the EU unified energy market gets going. Further east, British Gas has bought a stake in a gas pipeline system in east Germany, and will be looking for opportunities in the former communist states. But the most interesting prospects lie much further afield. British Gas is now involved in a string of deals particularly in East Asia to supply and distribute gas and operate power generation projects. One of the largest involves a Dollars 3bn gas exploration and transmission project in Kazakhstan. Another announcement that came yesterday was a joint venture company to distribute gas in Bombay. Recently British Gas also signed an agreement to participate in a project to transport and distribute Argentinian gas to Chile through a new trans-Andean pipeline. The Dollars 600m venture comes alongside British Gas' acquisition last year of a 29 per cent stake in MetroGas, the newly privatised gas distribution company which serves Buenos Aires. The proceeds from Consumers Gas will help feed British Gas' investment budget which will be about Pounds 2bn this year. However, there are risks in British Gas' strategy. One is that it is striking out from traditionally safe markets into areas where the returns may be higher but the potential for political and financial trouble is too. Mr Brown says that sceptics should bear in mind that the bulk of British Gas' business is still in the UK, in a safe, regulated market. And though his company is now hunting for new gas supplies in exotic territories, a large part of its reserves lie no further from home than under the safe waters of Morecambe Bay. Another risk is that management may be taking on more than it can handle. Is Sid, who bought British Gas' shares in the 1986 privatisation, going to get his fingers burnt? Mr Philip Rogerson, the finance director, says the commitment was made clear in the prospectus that British Gas would be seeking to expand away from its domestic regulated business, and that strategy is now being pursued. Ironically, he says, the area of greatest uncertainty is currently the UK where the recent monopoly inquiry recommended that British Gas be broken up and its monopoly abolished. The company is hoping for an early decision from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               Global Gas                                                      Explor-     (over-                                                       ation &amp;   seas gas                                                      production  supply)                                      Stake   Country  Pounds m  Pounds m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1988     Bow Valley Industries         53      Canada    388 1988     Acre Oil                     100          UK    364 1988/89  Tenneco subsidiaries         n/a     Various    117 1989     Texas Eastern North Sea      n/a          UK    299 1990     Consumers Gas Company         85      Canada             506 1991     German gas distribution cos    *     Germany              12 1992     Ballylumford Power           100  N.

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Appointments: Experience as well as pedigree British Bio-technology's boss Keith McCullagh calls it 'the brain drain in reverse'; the young and innovative Oxford-based pharmaceutical company has lured Peter Lewis from Marion Merrell Dow, the big American drug company, onto the board as its new head of research and development. Lewis will oversee everything from basic research through to the registration of new drugs. Unlike many biotechnology company heads, McCullagh does not believe in hiring straight from academe - and Lewis has the industrial experience as well as the intellectual pedigree. At Merrell Dow since 1984, Lewis, who is English, was one of the few executives to be promoted to head office in Kansas City at the time of the 1989 merger - most of the senior management in the combine coming from Marion. He was latterly responsible for clinical, medical and development research. McCullagh says the new recruit, who is 47, complements the skills of research director John Gordon, a pharmacologist whose strengths are in pre-clinical development. 'As chief executive I had been acting head of research and development, so now I have more time to devote to the commercial development of the company,' says McCullagh. British Bio-technology has three drugs in clinical trial this year - p24-VLP, designed to delay the progression of Aids, which will shortly be tested on HIV-positive patients; a drug that may prevent the spread of primary cancers, and an anti-inflammatory treatment for asthma. And why would Lewis be interested in moving back to Britain and a small company with nothing actually on the market? 'Because he is enormously enthusiastic about the drugs we have in development,' is McCullagh's answer.</p>

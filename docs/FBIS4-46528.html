			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [V.A. report under the "Military-Industrial Complex" rubric: </F> "Industrial Capital Wants To Merge With Banking Capital"]    [Text] A press conference at the General Staff Academy was  held within the framework of preparation for the international  conference entitled "Integration of Banking and Industrial  Capital" scheduled for November. Its venue was perhaps supposed  to underline once more that the initiative comes from the  military-industrial complex enterprises. No wonder: They have  been faced with the fait accompli of a "precipitous conversion."  Very indicative in this sense was the question to participants  in the press conference: "Is there today a military-industrial  complex in Russia at all?" It was asked by none other than a  major general of the General Staff Academy.    Another general, Yuriy Yashin, chairman of the State  Technological Commission under the Russian Federation president,  stated confidently that there is a military-industrial complex  in Russia. What there is not is a program of conversion as  such. The present federal budget cannot provide sufficient  financing to all sectors, even less so to such a  capital-intensive sector as the military-industrial complex. At  the same time, commercial banking structures are making no  active motions in this direction. This, despite the fact that  they have invested in foreign banks approximately the worth of  today's budget deficit.    The planned conference according to the concept of its  organizers -- the Russian Federation Ministry of the Economy,  the State Committee on Defense Industry, the Ministry on  Economic Cooperation, the Association of Russian Banks, and also  a number of powerful state and commercial structures -- is  supposed to reverse this negative tendency. The conference is  expected to result in producing specific methods for the merger.</p>

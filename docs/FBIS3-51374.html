			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Christian Democratic Party [PDC] President Raul Ossa  accused Ruben Dario Carles, former comptroller general and  current presidential candidate, of surreptitiously paying off  the IFIS [International Financial Institutions] while forfeiting  the country's health, education, and economic stability.    [Begin recording] Our position has been quite clear. It is a  fact that Mr. Carles chose to pay off the IFIS, even to the  point of breaking the law. I have the letter he signed whereby  he surreptitiously paid off the IFIS behind the back of the  National Assembly Budget Commission. In doing this, he denied  equipment to schools, the 13th month bonus to public workers,  and medication to hospitals. He did all this while at the same  time he paid off the IFIS.    In this respect, we believe this is not the type of policy  which will be healthy for Panama. We believe Panama must honor  its commitments to the IFIS. At the same time, however, we must  honor the country's social debt, create more employment, provide  more equipment for schools, more education for the people,  medication to hospitals, and raise the retirement age. Carles  does not intend to do any of this. He represents the denial of  all of this.</p>

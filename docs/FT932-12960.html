			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: Kathleen Ferrier Awards - Singing competition The prize money at the Kathleen Ferrier Awards has gone up again this year. No doubt there is good reason in trying to keep the competition itself in first place ahead of its rivals - but the result is not necessarily as intended. A five-figure first prize does not just bring in high-quality students. It is enough to lure young professional singers, who could not earn as much in a couple of evenings otherwise. The result was a selection of finalists more experienced than in previous years, who fitted in the competition before flying off to engagements at San Francisco or La Scala, Milan (I jest not - the biographies of the eight touched that level). The main culprit is the Cardiff Singer of the World competition, which has pitched its sights at the international level, luring away the public's attention and a lot of the available finance. Other competitions have either closed down or been forced to raise their game. A gap has opened up, leaving the young, unfinished singer of 23 or 24 who really needs the money without much chance of winning a major award. Against that background the jury of this year's Ferrier Awards (chaired by Janet Baker) did a good job. The first prize went to Ruby Philogene, who was a finalist last year, but re-appeared at the Wigmore Hall on Friday much advanced. Her richly-coloured mezzo was better focused; her artistry was more mature, filling out the long lines of her aria from Massenet's Werther with skill and heartfelt emotion. She was the right choice - by a whisker. Second prize was taken by the mezzo Sara Fulgoni, already noted as a major talent at the Royal Northern College of Music. The size and range of her voice are remarkable. Had she sung her two songs at the final with a bit more variety of colour, she might have won. Ruth Peel, a contralto generous in tone, less forthcoming with words, came third. That left no prize for the baritone Peter Snipp, who had taken command of the stage with unabashed professionalism. In contrast, the soprano Eldrydd Cynan-Jones and tenor Toby Spence gave notice of genuine promise, deserving of recognition. There was no accompanists' prize this year (has it been dropped?) but with one or two exceptions the standard in that department was poor, as the jury rightly noted.</p>

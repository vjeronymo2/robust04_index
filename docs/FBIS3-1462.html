ANC Senior Legal Representative Penwell Maduna told SAPA an  agreement with police had been reached to cordon off the area.  The bodies of the nine people killed nearby had already been  removed.    Internal Stability Unit members aimed their guns at the two  buildings until the situation seemed normal while pedestrians  and journalists sheltered behind pillars and in doorways.  Running battles continued at a nearby taxi rank. About 200  people armed with sticks and wooden planks entered the taxi  rank, shouting "ANC, ANC". Almost immediately at least eight  armoured SADF [South African Defense Force] personnel carriers  pulled up and troops were deployed from the vehicles. A shot  was fired and the crowd dispersed only to regroup soon  afterwards. A peace monitor intervened to calm the situation.    SADF Witwatersrand Command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said  army units had been called out to assist the police in  Johannesburg to restore calm in the city centre. Soldiers were  gathering at a Witwatersrand Command rallying point and "were  awaiting further orders", Maj Visser said. Maj Visser declined  to give details on the number of troops in the area.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM plans computers based on MPP technology INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) is developing powerful supercomputers based upon massively parallel processing (MPP) technology. The company said yesterday it had established a new laboratory dedicated to bringing rapidly the new technology to market. Cray Research, the leading supercomputer manufacturer, also revealed this week that it was developing MPP computers, based upon a powerful new microprocessor chip designed by Digital Equipment. Unlike traditional supercomputers which are based upon one or a few custom-designed powerful processors, MPP computers share complex computing tasks among hundreds or even thousands of the same microprocessor chips that are used in computer workstations. Until recently, this approach to achieving very high speed computing was largely experimental. Worldwide sales of MPP supercomputers totalled only about Dollars 100m last year, less than one-tenth of the total supercomputers market, according to industry estimates. However, massively parallel machines are widely expected to eventually achieve speeds of almost 1,000bn calculations per second, outpacing traditional 'vector' supercomputers. The endorsement of IBM and Cray Research will bring MPP into the mainstream of computing. Some industry analysts predict that MPP sales could reach 50 per cent of the total supercomputer market by the late 1990s. The challenge that MPP technology poses to traditional supercomputing technology was demonstrated this week when Mr Seymore Cray, the best-known designer of supercomputers, announced that his company, Cray Computer (unrelated to Cray Research), must scale back plans to develop Cray-3 , a machine that would rival MPP performance, after losing its lone customer. IBM will base its MMP systems upon the reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessors that it employs in desktop workstations. The company said it planned to build 'scalable' paralled machines capable of performance in the range of hundreds of gigaflops (billions of floating point calculations per second). Ultimately, IBM aims to achieve teraflops (1,000bn of floating-point calculations per second) performance. 'Our key customers have told us that they need 'scalable' systems that enable them to build up performance on an incremental basis - as their individual needs allow,' said Mr Irving Wladawsky-Berger, assistant general manager for IBM's supercomputing, Enterprise Systems line of business. 'We plan to get these machines to market as quickly as possible.' Cray Research said that its first MPP systems would be introduced next year and that they would be based upon Digital Equipment's 'Alpha' microprocessor chip. The device is twice as fast as any other microprocessor in the world, Cray officials said. Digital engineers are scheduled to reveal details of the Alpha chip at a technical conference later this month.</p>

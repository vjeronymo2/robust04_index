			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Ontario will close trade offices The Canadian province of Ontario is closing all 17 of its foreign trade and investment offices as part of moves to hold down government spending, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. An official of the province's economic development and trade ministry said that, thanks to modern communications and air travel, the offices 'are seen as structures that have outlived their time'. Ontario will now promote its trade and investment interests through Canadian embassies, and through more sharply-focused visits by government officials. It also plans to work more closely with business associations abroad and consultants hired for specific assignments. Some of the money saved will be channelled towards providing advice within the province to companies seeking export opportunities.</p>

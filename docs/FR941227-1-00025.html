			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Time: beginning at 9:00 a.m. each day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons desiring to attend the conference should notify the Docket Clerk in writing at the above address or by telephone at (202) 366&hyph;2257 by close of business January 27, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Marina C. Appleton, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;0628); or Robert Finkelstein, Chief, Systems Support Division, Office of Safety Analysis, Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone 202&hyph;366&hyph;2760). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) History and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Following publication of the NPRM on accident reporting in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 42880), FRA conducted a series of public hearings to obtain the industry's views and comments on specific issues addressed in the NPRM. Public hearings were held in Washington, D.C. on October 5&hyph;6; in Kansas City, Missouri on October 19; and in Portland, Oregon on November 3. FRA examined the issues and interests involved and made a preliminary inquiry among the hearing participants to determine whether additional hearings or regulatory meetings could be successful in narrowing areas of disagreement and exploring possible accommodations. Most participants expressed interest in continuing the rulemaking process by holding additional or supplementary regulatory meetings, roundtables or workshops. After further deliberation, FRA decided that an informal public regulatory conference would prove advantageous in the development of the accident reporting regulations. FRA also believes that the quality of the agency's final rule will be improved by facilitating an exchange of ideas that may lead to solutions acceptable to all interested groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (II) Methodology <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the public regulatory conference is a continuation of the accident reporting rulemaking proceeding. A court reporter will take a verbatim transcript of the conference which will be placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. The format of the discussions will be informal and will employ a topical, interactive approach. The public regulatory conference is currently scheduled for one week. FRA believes the time allotted for this conference will prove more than adequate. Of course, the conference will conclude earlier than initially planned if a majority of participants in attendance agree that the key issues have been adequately addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (III) Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA invites all affected parties, including small entities, to participate in the public regulatory conference. FRA believes that extensive comment from all interested parties is necessary to develop the most effective and reasonable final regulation. For this conference to be successful, participants should come prepared to discuss, at a minimum, the key issues identified below and to suggest reasonable alternatives to the various proposals in the NPRM. FRA also encourages participants to bring supporting documentation where appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (IV) Key Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of issues were raised in the written comments received to date and at the public hearings. We encourage interested parties to come prepared to respond to the following questions and to make any other comments or suggestions regarding the issues presented. Please note that the conference is not limited to these issues. FRA does retain the authority, however, to limit the issues discussed at the regulatory conference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Internal Control Plans (Proposed Section 225.33) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation proposed by FRA would require railroads to maintain written internal control plans for the preparation of reports required under part 225. Most railroad commenters believe the internal control plan in proposed &sect;225.33 is burdensome and recommend that a performance standard of 99-percent be established to replace the internal control plan. Dividing the number of reported accidents or incidents by the number of actual reportable accidents or incidents would yield a number (percentage) that would then be compared against the 99-percent performance level to determine actual performance by the railroad. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Would a performance standard system, in lieu of the proposed internal control plan, ensure FRA receives reliable and consistent reporting data? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICIALS ORDER 'ABYSMAL' KENNEL TO CLOSED  DOORS  </P> <P> Humane society officials have ordered the closure of what they called an  "abysmal" kennel at a Gardena house, where 10 dogs and a cat recently died in a  fire.  </P> <P> Officials found pools of urine and feces collected at Fantasy Kennels on La  Salle Avenue and "declared the property uninhabitable for animals," said Sgt.  Cori Whetstone of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  </P> <P> The SPCA gave Kathy Schaefer and Sylvia Kelley, who live next to the kennel,  one week to remove several dozen purebred terriers, Shih Tzus and Lhasa apsos,  Whetstone said. No charges were filed.  </P> <P> About 21 dogs were transported to the SPCA shelter in Hawthorne and will be  available to the public later this month.  </P> <P> Both women were involved in a 1988 investigation of violations of state humane  laws at a North Hollywood kennel. Kelley paid $2,700 in fines and was put on  three years' probation.  </P></p>

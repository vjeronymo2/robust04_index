			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chung Nai-wen (6945 0035 2429), Ch'en Yung-yen </F> (7115 0737 3601), and Chung P'ei-ch'ing (6945 0160 0615): "With  China's Stock Markets in a State of `One Country, Five Systems,'  Type B Stocks Will Have To Be Abandoned"]    [Text] As China is going to administer the future Hong Kong  SAR in the form of "one country, two systems," China's current  stock world has set a precedent by practicing "one country, five  systems:" 1) Type-A stock transactions in RMB; 2) Type-B stock  trading in U.S. dollars; 3) Type-H stock trading and investment  on Hong Kong's stock market in Hong Kong dollars; 4) State-stock  issues; 5) Corporate-stock offerings. But as the type-B stocks  supplied for transactions by foreign investors in China have a  small trading volume and are inconvenient to trade, figures in  Chinese securities circles have been holding recently that the  type-B standing is very likely to be eliminated, to be replaced  by the type-H, or even for all five types to be consolidated  into one.  <H5>  China's Stock Markets: "One Country, Five Systems" </H5>   While Hong Kong's stock market is repeatedly setting new  records, China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets are  continuing to fluctuate at a low level, down nearly one-half  from their peaks. And China's type-B stocks have nothing good or  unusual to be reported about, performing even more weakly in  Shenzhen than in Shanghai, generally reflecting even less  strength.    On 18 October 1993, the Shanghai B-share index stood at  73.45, which closing price was down 24 percent from its high of  96.68 on 24 February, but up 43 percent from its low of 51.39 on  27 July. And the Shenzhen B-share index's closing price of  113.58 was down 38.75 percent from its high of 185.44 on 8  February, but up 40 percent from its low of 80.63 on 6 August.    K'uang Wei-t'ien [6782 4850 3240], managing director of the  New China-Hong Kong Finance Corp Ltd and the New China-HK  Financial Advice Corp Ltd, tells PAISHING, "As a commercial  bank, New China-HK can concentrate its attention to China's  stock markets only on A and H shares, with B shares having  limited growth prospects, so that the `one country, two systems'  is quite adequate, and there is no need for `one country,  multiple systems.' It would be best to replace B shares with H  shares while the B-share market has not yet grown to maturity."  <H5>  Shanghai B Shares Beat Out Shenzhen B Shares </H5>   Supposing a consolidated stock system, Huang Pin-yuan [7806  2430 0337], director of the New Hungchi Investment Service Corp  Ltd, holds that two conditions must be met: 1. The authorities  must allow A shares to be provided for trading by foreign  investors, to attract foreign investment funds. 2. The renminbi  must be made freely convertible to foreign currencies, so that A  and B shares can be merged. And the H shares listed in Hong Kong  must have a secondary-listing status equal to that of Chinese  enterprises outside of China.    B shares have never had a brisk trading volume on either the  Shenzhen or Shanghai stock exchanges. As to B-share prospects in  these two places, Huang Pin-yuan holds that the short-term  B-share prospects differ for Shanghai and Shenzhen.    He points out that as Shenzhen has a weaker economic  setting,  plus mostly real estate speculation business, foreign capital is  less interested. But as Shanghai has a 5- to 6-decade history of  economic development, as well as a better industrial and  commercial base than Shenzhen, it can attract a certain amount  of foreign investment capital.  <H5>  B Shares Are Only "Second-Squad" </H5>   Liu Wei-kang [0491 4850 0474], research department director  of the Paota Securities Corp Ltd (Hong Kong), also says that as  B shares per se have a low issue volume, an inadequate trading  volume, little fundraising capacity, and not much impact, they  should be gradually eliminated and replaced in the long term.    Liu Wei-kang explains that while B shares, just like on a  soccer team, originally wanted to be promoted to the "A team,"  they were too weak, being merely the first-kick "B squad," to be  promoted to the "A team" only at the right time in the game. So  B shares used Shenzhen and Shanghai as "practice fields," hoping  for further development only by waiting for growth to maturity.    Liu Wei-kang holds that as 1997 approaches, the already  low-impact B shares will have steadily less impact. So he  believes that B shares should be gradually replaced by H shares.    Huang Pin-yuan tells PAISHING that on 18 October in  Shanghai,  the market value was 83 billion yuan for A shares, but 5.8  billion yuan for B shares. In Shenzhen, this was 54.7 billion  yuan for A shares, but 6.95 billion yuan for B shares. This left  the B-share market value temporarily one-half to one-third that  of A shares.  <H5>  B Shares Are Likely To Be Replaced by A and H Shares </H5>   While China's economic drive comes from its own investors,  meaning that the status of A shares is most important, A shares  are subject to the temporary defect of not being able to compete  for foreign exchange. K'uang Wei-t'ien points out, "While  Chinese A shares cannot yet compete for foreign exchange, they  can use other forms, such as directly listing their companies in  Hong Kong, in either A or H form. In addition to Hong Kong, they  can also consider listings in London, England and New York,  U.S.A."    As Hong Kong's stock market system, time lag,  communications,  and transportation are all fine and suited to China, Chinese  stock listings should first consider Hong Kong. K'uang  Wei-t'ien says, "If A shares could be listed also in Hong Kong,  they would not only have a larger circulation volume, but also  would be subject to easier operation. Once Hong Kong reverts to  Chinese sovereignty in 1997, commercial banks should concentrate  on expanding A- and H-share markets."  <H5>  B Shares Should Be Eliminated While They Are Still Immature </H5>   The conversion of B shares to H shares is a general trend.  K'uang Wei-t'ien states, "As Chinese B shares number only some  30+, this means that it is necessary to use a better system to  handle their replacement in the current stage."    Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp holdings also include  the  two types of "Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp  London-registered" shares priced in either Hong Kong dollars and  British pounds, with some companies also having set the  precedent of converting preferred to common stock. K'uang  Wei-t'ien says, "The conversion of B to H shares is not as  simple as the conversion of preferred to common stock, as  China's conditions differ somewhat from Hong Kong's. And while  each company's structure and conditions also differ, meaning  that listings must conform to Hong Kong standards, the listing  of quality Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong is an inevitable  trend."    In addition, the market-profit-rate of Chinese B shares also  differs from that of A shares, with K'uang Wei-t'ien admitting  that the B-share market-profit-rate does not reflect market  conditions.    In the conversion of B to H shares, the prices of B shares  might come under pressure. K'uang Wei-t'ien points out that  "lower stock prices, as long as they are a normal market  activity, would not be too great a problem."  <H5>  Overseas Capital Does Not Favor B Shares </H5>   The listing of B shares is of a short-term nature, never  having had much circulation volume. As to overseas investors, a  larger trading volume causes sharp volatility in stock prices,  meaning also taking greater risks. Due to this inherent  shortcoming, B shares have never been preferred by foreigners.  But Huang Pin-yuan points out that as B shares bring nice  profits in Shenzhen, as well as having a lower market profit  rate, it is believed that they still have certain short-term  prospects. While Huang Pin-yuan predicts that achieving a  uniform shareholding system cannot be accomplished in a few  short months, he believes that it will certainly be resolved  within a decade. And state and corporate shares will also have  to be converted to A shares.</p>

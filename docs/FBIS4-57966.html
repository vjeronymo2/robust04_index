			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] The 39 deputies of the FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] unanimously threw their support behind Dr.  Sergio Ramirez Mercado to remain head of the Sandinist bloc  after Ramirez resigned from the post during a special meeting of  bloc members yesterday afternoon.    After meeting for three hours, Deputy Dora Maria Tellez,  member of the FSLN National Directorate, publicly announced  Ramirez's intention to resign from his post within the FSLN bloc  and the deputies' decision to vote down that resignation. "We  have not only rejected this resignation, but we have also  endorsed his mandate because his work as the chief of our bloc  has served the struggle in the interests of both the FSLN and  the needy sectors of society," Commander Tellez indicated.    According to Deputy William Ramirez, the Sandinist deputies  are convinced that to maintain the unity of the bloc and  relations within the National Assembly, it is not advisable to  accept his resignation.    It was reported that all 39 lawmakers concurred in voting in  favor of Ramirez. Damaso Vargas, who represents the interests  of the Sandinist Workers Federation in the FSLN bloc, confirmed  the unanimous backing for Ramirez's mandate.    "The statutes do not make the Sandinist bloc a component of  the FSLN structure and for that reason the bloc has the  opportunity to coordinate its actions and choose its directors.  What is vital is to carry out the resolutions of the Sandinist  Congress," he noted.    "Dr. Ramirez submitted his resignation for obvious political  reasons," Dora Maria Tellez added, explaining that the Sandinist  Assembly approved the bloc's internal regulations, which  establish the mechanism to elect its authorities.    Tellez added that the National Directorate does not plan to  submit the topic of the leadership of the Sandinist bloc to a  debate. "In the meeting held today (yesterday), the Directorate  said Directorate members do not necessarily have to be  well-liked by everyone," she added.    Ramirez, who from the moment he learned of his exclusion  from  the new Sandinist Directorate announced his willingness to  resign, saying he would abide by the decision of his colleagues.  "I think what lies ahead in the weeks to come is our  legislative work because the Sandinist bloc must continue to be  a key part in the complex machinery of national stability,"  Ramirez stated categorically.    Dr. Ramirez declined to comment on the topic of factions  because, at this time, he was still speaking as chief of the  Sandinist bloc. The public statement by Commander Monica  Baltodano on the possible change in the Sandinist bloc's  leadership was one of the events that hastened the discussion on  this topic among the FSLN lawmakers.    In the early morning hours, Dr. Ramirez said he will  continue  his struggle for the renewal and transformation of the FSLN from  the inside "and never from the outside," adding that battles are  not won in a single day. "I am already too old to let someone  else decide for me whether or not I am a revolutionary, or  whether or not my ideology is correct," he noted. "now, there  is a certain trend on the part of some FSLN comrades to grant  certificates of revolutionary legitimacy and to decide who is a  neoliberal and who supports or opposes the masses," the FSLN  bloc chief noted.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE WARNINGS QUESTIONED IN 2 LIVE CREW CASE;  </P> <P> RAP: ATTORNEYS ON BOTH SIDES SEE DANGER OF 'PRIOR RESTRAINT' IN PRESSURING  RECORD STORES AGAINST SELLING THE 'NASTY' ALBUM.  </P> <P> Attorneys on both sides of the 2 Live Crew obscenity furor in Florida are  questioning whether law-enforcement agencies in other states aren't guilty of  "prior restraint" by warning retailers that they may be arrested for selling  the rap group's latest album.  </P> <P> Police in San Antonio, Tex., Prince William County, Va., and in four counties  in South Carolina are the first authorities outside Florida's Broward County to  act on U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez's June 6 ruling that the group's "As  Nasty as They Wanna Be" album is obscene.  </P> <P> Gonzalez spent almost a third of his 62-page ruling admonishing Broward County  Sheriff Nick Navarro for the tactics his police used in a campaign to get  retailers to remove the "Nasty" album from shelves.  </P> <P> "The action of the Broward County sheriff's office in threatening retail music  stores with arrest for selling the Nasty recording and presenting them with a  copy of a probable cause order is hereby DECLARED unconstitutional as improper  prior restraint of free speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth  Amendments to the United States Constitution," Gonzalez wrote in his decision.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview this week, Nova University, Fla., law professor Bruce  Rogow, who is the rap group's attorney, criticized the media for being lax in  reporting the prior restraint provision of Gonzalez's ruling.  </P> <P> "Few people realize that 2 Live Crew won a significant victory at the federal  level," Rogow said from his home in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. "I suppose the reason  the press isn't covering that part of the ruling is that prior restraint just  isn't as sexy an issue as dirty language."  </P> <P> John Jolley, the Florida attorney who represented Navarro and takes credit for  the obscenity finding against 2 Live Crew, agreed that the prior restraint  provision was a key element of the decision.  </P> <P> He suggested that other law-enforcement agencies considering 2 Live Crew  obscenity prosecutions should consult the decision carefully before taking  action. While the ruling is only legally binding in Florida's Broward, Dade and  Palm Beach counties, Jolley said, its "psychological impact" has been spreading  across the country.  </P> <P> "For instance, I would say, based on the information that I've been given, the  actions that police have taken to alert record-shop owners in San Antonio would  not be consistent with what Judge Gonzalez laid out in his ruling," Jolley said  in a telephone interview Tuesday.  </P> <P> Prior restraint can be generally defined as any condition imposed by the  government on the publication of speech, according to the ruling. In recent  months, police in other counties in Florida and in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee and  Alabama have exercised tactics similar to those criticized by Gonzalez to stop  the sale of the "Nasty" album. In addition, the 47-store Toronto-based HMV  Corp., Canada's third-largest record chain, also pulled the "Nasty" album from  its shelves Monday following a warning from the Ontario Provincial Police  Morality Squad. Dan Brenner, a UCLA law professor and First Amendment  specialist, also criticized the media for failing to pay more attention to the  significance of Gonzalez's prior restraint comments.  </P> <P> "I think the reason local prosecutors (around the country) are continuing the  practice (threatening prosecution for selling the album) is that the press has  not printed anything about it," Brenner said. "The prior restraint information  as spelled out by the judge in this ruling is very significant, in that it  addresses the intimidating effect that police officers in uniforms brandishing  a magistrate's order can have.  </P> <P> "The same judge who found the album obscene, which is the only thing the press  has reported about, ruled that frightening retailers with such actions is  unconstitutional."  </P> <P> The 2 Live Crew case began on March 9, when a state circuit judge ruled that  there was probable cause to find the album obscene in Broward County. Following  the ruling, police visited area record stores warning employees that they could  be prosecuted under Florida obscenity statutes if they sold the record. As a  result, retailers in 40 Broward County stores pulled the product from their  shelves.  </P> <P> Gonzalez's federal ruling came as the result of a lawsuit filed on March 16 by  2 Live Crew in which the group sought to have the "Nasty" album declared not  obscene and to enjoin Broward County Sheriff Navarro from arresting merchants  who sold it to adults. The album, which 2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell  considers to be in the comedy tradition of Redd Foxx and Eddie Murphy and is  laced with graphic sexual references, comes with an imprinted parental advisory  warning that it contains "explicit language."  </P> <P> According to UCLA's Brenner, the judge states that police officers cannot use  the type of tactics reportedly being employed to pressure retailers in various  communities across the nation.  </P> <P> "What he is saying is that authorities must first go into court, have a hearing  and get a judge or jury, based on local community standards, to determine that  the record is obscene."  </P> <P> Dave Risher -- a San Antonio merchant who has defied attempts by local  authorities to pressure him to voluntarily remove the "Nasty" album from his  store -- accuses local police of intimidating retailers with the weight of a  federal obscenity decision while employing law-enforcement tactics specifically  rebuked by the judge who wrote it.  </P> <P> Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander of the San Antonio vice squad and the officer  handling the matter for the city, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "This is like some sort of ill-defined threat that they're waving like a club  over our heads," Risher, owner of Hogwild Records, told The Times on Tuesday.  "I go to work each day wondering if I'm going to get hit over the head with  it."  </P> <P> In a related move, the Sacramento district attorney's office said it did not  find "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" to be obscene as judged against "a  contemporary statewide standard." Also, a lieutenant in the vice squad of the  Dallas City Police told The Times that authorities had no intention of  prosecuting merchants for selling the "Nasty" album in Dallas and that media  reports to the contrary were unfounded.  </P></p>

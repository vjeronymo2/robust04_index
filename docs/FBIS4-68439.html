			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ilya Shkabara of the "Mercator Group": </F> "Preferential Credits Do Not Prevent Unemployment"]    [Text] By the beginning of 1994, according to official  data, 835,000 persons, or 1.4 percent of the able-bodied  population, were unemployed in the Russian Federation. Against  the background of countries in the West, where unemployment is  several times higher, the situation is quite favorable.  (American economists consider 5 percent of the economically  active population to be a normal level of unemployment; only if  unemployment exceeds this limit does it begin to have a harmful  effect on the economy of the state or a region.) The level of  unemployment in Russia as a whole is not high at present, but  some individual regions have already gone past the critical  point.    The following have gone beyond the 5-percent threshold:  Ivanovo, Kostroma, Pskov, and Yaroslavl oblasts and the  republics of Dagestan, Kalmykia, Mordovia, and Chuvashia.  Arkhangelsk and Kirov oblasts and the republics of Adygeya,  Ingushetia, Northern Osetia, Udmurtia, and Chechnya are coming  closer to that point.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-048-64A>      Unemployment in the Russian Federation (Beginning of 1994) </FIG>     There are various reasons why regions are led into such a  situation. The Northern Caucasus Republic, a region which  traditionally has a surplus of labor, has been exporting  manpower for a long time not only to the capital's markets, but  for construction organizations and seasonal work in practically  every part of Russia. Many of the unemnployed persons from the  Caucasus are working quite successfully far from home and are  more a subject of interest to the tax authorities than social  security organs. Some 60 percent of the unemployed in the  Northern Caucasus are under 30 years of age. The ranks of  criminal gangs and those involved in illegal businesses  throughout Russia are increasing precisely because of this  category. Unemployment in this region is reflected in crime from  Kaliningrad to Sakhalin. And for this reason, the creation of  jobs in the Northern Caucasus is more a struggle with the source  of personnel for organized crime.    The precipitous production decline in light industry,  shipbuilding, and sectors of the defense complex has been the  principal cause of the rise in unemployment in Central Russia  and the Volga region.    The crisis in domestic light industry led to mass firings of  personnel in Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma oblasts, and the  high concentration of enterprises in these oblasts led to a  sharp rise in unemployment. The situation is becoming critical.  Light industry enterprises do not have effective sectorial  management organs which could lobby for their interests in the  government. As a result, local administrations have been forced  to take extreme measures to surmount the crisis and the  unemployment which this crisis has caused.    The hasty extension of preferential loans and reduction of  local tax rates have not checked the rate of decline, but they  have had a substantial effect on the regions' budgets. As a  result, the budget deficit was 15 billion rubles [R] in Ivanovo  Oblast, R20 billion in Kostroma Oblast, and only Yaroslavl  Oblast made ends meet, according to the results for 1993. The  average wage in these regions is also lagging behind  substantially. In Ivanovo Oblast, it is 60 percent of the  average Russian wage and one of the lowest in the Russian  Federation. (According to Goskomstat [State Committee for  Statistics] data, the average wage in Russia in January was  R134,161.)    Most of the unemployed in Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Kirov, and  Pskov oblasts and republics in the Volga region and Udmurtia  were employees in the military-industrial complex who were  discharged. The difficult situation in the defense enterprises  led to a reduction of over 700,000 persons in 1993, and a  substantial number of them were added to the army of unemployed.  The "militarized" regions with a high proportion of the VPK  [military-industrial complex] in the structure of industry (in  Udmurtia, for example, every fourth resident was employed in  defense complex enteprises) have suffered the most. A further  reduction of military orders stipulated by the budget for 1994  will lead to new large-scale dismissals, which will aggravate  the acute social tension in these regions.    The rate of increase in unemployment varies in different  areas as well. The highest rates of increase are observed where  unemployment is already higher than the average level in Russia.  In 1993, unemployment in Mordovia rose by three times as much,  in Kalmykia by 2.4 times as much, in Ivanovo Oblast by 2.2 times  as much, and in Chuvashia and Udmurtia by two times as much. But  unemployment has declined since the beginning of the year in the  cities with the lowest level of unemployment (under 0.5  percent)--Moscow and St. Petersburg.    Depressed regions are being formed where a precipitous  production recession is combined with a high level of  unemployment and a low average wage. In due course, the  depression is deepened and negative socioeconomic processes  begin to intensify each other. A 1-percent rise in unemployment  in a depressed region leads to a regional decline of 2.5 percent  in the gross national product.    One-sixth of Russia's population is living in depressed  regions today, and an effective system for their support needs  to be established. Available experience in overcoming the  structural crisis in industry should form the basis of the  program. Nizhegorod, Samara, and Saratov oblasts, where the  proportion of the military-industrial complex is no less than in  Vladimir or Kirov oblasts, have resolved the problem by close  integration between industrial and commercial structures. The  use of commercial bank loans to supplement enterprises' working  capital, targeted financing, and the formation of  industrial-financial groups--this is far from a complete list of  promising types of collaboration. Incidentally, it is  characteristic that most of the territories which are going  through a depression are lagging behind in the voucher rating at  privatization auctions as well. A collapse is a collapse. On all  points!   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-048-65A>      Depressed Regions in Russia </FIG>     The opportunities of federal organs of authority are very  limited today. By transferring to the regions a substantial part  of its powers, the state has relinquished a significant part of  its obligations. The transfer of 90 percent of employment fund  resources to the regions has led to the point that the  government has deprived itself of the opportunity to  redistribute funds to the most needy territories. Because of the  situation that has taken shape, it would have been sensible to  make the federal organs of authority responsible for  redistributing all the employment fund assets and provide a  favorable environment for investments aimed at creating new jobs  in the depressed regions.</p>

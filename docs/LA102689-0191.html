			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY UPS ANTE FOR TRAIN TERMINUS;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: SYLMAR ENHANCED IN COMPETITION WITH ANAHEIM TO BECOME THE  SOUTHLAND LINK TO LAS VEGAS, CONNECTED BY A FUTURISTIC HIGH-SPEED RAIL LINE.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County on Wednesday sweetened its offer in the competition with  Anaheim to become the Southern California terminus of a futuristic high-speed  rail system to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> To raise the chances of a northern San Fernando Valley terminus, the Los  Angeles County Transportation Commission voted Wednesday to study speeding up  construction of a light-rail line linking Los Angeles International Airport to  Sylmar.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials said that link would significantly increase  ridership on a Sylmar-to-Las Vegas line because it would tie the high-speed  system to the county's network of rail lines, three of which are under  construction, with several more in the planning stage.  </P> <P> The rival terminal station site is in Anaheim and is supported by officials  from Orange and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> Ridership on the high-speed train has emerged as a key issue following release  of a consultant's report two weeks ago that said an Anaheim-to-Las Vegas line,  also stopping in Ontario, would draw 6.5 million round-trip passengers  annually. A Sylmar-to-Las Vegas line, also stopping in Palmdale, would generate  only 2.3 million round trips a year, the report said.  </P> <P> However, a separate commuter system operating on the same tracks would draw  nearly equal numbers of riders -- 433,000 round trips a year between Anaheim  and Ontario versus 418,000 annually between Palmdale and Sylmar.  </P> <P> The California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Commission, created by  the two states' legislatures, is to vote Friday on a Southern California  terminus.  </P> <P> But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who heads the bistate commission,  suggested late Wednesday that both Sylmar and Anaheim might survive Friday's  vote.  </P> <P> He also said that it was "conceivable the bistate commission might designate  Anaheim as the terminus but leave open the possibility of getting there through  Palmdale and LAX" by traveling through the San Fernando Valley and Westside on  the San Diego Freeway right of way.  </P> <P> Katz, who also chairs the Assembly Transportation Commission, agreed that the  16-member bistate commission is leaning toward Anaheim but said "the final  decision rests with the California Legislature, not the bistate commission."  </P> <P> Although the $4-billion system would be built with private funds, legislative  approval is needed because the trains would travel along the shoulder of  interstate highways.  </P> <P> Following the Transportation Commission vote to authorize $225,000 to study the  LAX-to-Sylmar rail line, which hitherto was not scheduled to be built for a  decade or more, Ray Remy, who represents Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on the  commission, expressed confidence that Los Angeles' bid for the high-speed line  would not be voted down Friday.  </P> <P> "I hope and expect that what we will see is a decision to conduct further study  on both proposals, especially in light of action taken here today," he said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles International Airport is close to capacity and "must be relieved or  we will face real serious problems," said Los Angeles City Council President  John Ferraro.  </P> <P> In another development Wednesday, Palmdale officials released a report that  conceded that a high-speed train passing through their desert city en route  between Sylmar and Las Vegas would not generate the ridership of a route  originating in Anaheim but said that the Sylmar line would be 45% less  expensive to build.  </P> <P> Also, a line traveling through Palmdale would have fewer environmental problems  and could be built in less time than one traveling through San Bernardino and  Orange counties, according to the report, which the city commissioned.  </P> <P> The report projected 3.76 million round-trip riders annually on a Sylmar-to-Las  Vegas line, about 50% higher than the bistate commission's consultant  projected, but still much less than the predicted Anaheim ridership.  </P> <P> Staff writer John Chandler contributed to this story.  </P></p>

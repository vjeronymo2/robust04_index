			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: VA Tech float to raise Sch5bn Voest-Alpine Technologie (VA Tech), Austria's largest engineering group, has lifted profits on slightly reduced turnover for 1993, and announced conditions for its privatisation next month. Domestic and international investors will be offered 7.65m shares, or 51 per cent of VA Tech share capital, through a five-day flotation on the Vienna stock exchange starting on May 16. The share price will be announced on May 13, and the government expects to raise at least Sch5bn (Dollars 414.6m) from the sale. According to an original valuation the sale was expected to raise Sch5bn-Sch6bn, but this was before last year's results were known, and developments since then should firm up the price, Mr Othmar Puhringer, VA Tech chairman, said. Group profits rose 6 per cent to Sch974m. Turnover fell to Sch22.5bn from Sch23.6bn in 1992, reflecting accounting changes. VA Tech was formed last November as part of a reorganisation of most of Austria's state-owned industries after heavy losses at Austria Metall, the aluminium manufacturer. OIAG, state holding company for the nationalised industries, will keep 24 per cent directly in VA Tech, and 25 per cent indirectly through its VA Stahl steel unit.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN SIGNS DFG MEASURES  </P> <P> Among the last official acts of an outgoing governor often criticized for being  soft on environmental issues was the signing of five bills worth $19.45 million  to the California Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> On the last day before bills passed by the legislature this year would expire  on his desk, Gov. George Deukmejian approved the DFG's so-called "bail-out"  package Sunday.  </P> <P> Developers had lobbied hard against a key bill -- AB 3158 by Assemblyman Jim  Costa (D-Fresno) -- that will require them to pay specified fees from $850 to  $1,250 for each environmental report required for a project.  </P> <P> That is expected to cost builders $8.2 million a year -- an expense that  otherwise would be borne by the DFG.  </P> <P> Another bill -- AB 2126 by Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) -- will cost  commercial fishermen an additional $3.5 million in licenses and fees each year.  </P> <P> Also, AB 3727 by Costa will provide $6.6 million in loans to cover a shortfall  in the fiscal year that ended July 1. The DFG was authorized to borrow $3.6  million from the Environmental License Plate Fund and $3 million from the  Off-Highway Vehicle -- or "Green Sticker" -- Fund.  </P> <P> Deukmejian vetoed a bill that would have changed the DFG's name to the  Department of Fish and Wildlife, shifting focus to the department's purely  environmental role for non-hunted species.  </P> <P> Before the funding bills were passed, DFG Director Pete Bontadelli had  indicated that shortages would require the department to close two fish  hatcheries and lay off scores of biologists -- or at best use them to fill  vacancies in the department where their special abilities might not be  utilized.  </P> <P> Now, officials said, nobody will be laid off or transferred and only one fish  hatchery will be closed -- the catfish hatchery at Imperial Valley, which loses  most of its fish to predatory birds, anyway.  </P> <P> The Mojave River hatchery at Victorville, which provides fish for Southern  California's freshwater fisheries, will remain open.  </P> <P> Bontadelli, a former legislative aide appointed by Deukmejian in 1987, was  believed to be the architect of the bail-out package, in concert with  Deukmejian, Costa and Felando.  </P> <P> Two other bills sponsored by Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata) will increase  annual revenue from hunting and fishing programs. One -- AB 2848 -- will allow  the DFG to auction up to three permits for the tule elk hunt apart from the  lottery drawing.  </P> <P> The other -- AB 3703 -- increases the minimum fine for fishing or hunting  without a license from $100 to $250.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CARTER, HERNANDEZ LET GO; LED METS TO SERIES  </P> <P> Catcher Gary Carter and first baseman Keith Hernandez, leaders of the New York  Mets' World Series championship club three years ago, have played their last  games with the team.  </P> <P> Both Carter and Hernandez said the Mets told them today that they would make no  effort to re-sign them. Both are free agents.  </P> <P> Carter batted .183 this year with two home runs and 15 RBIs. Hernandez hit .233  with four homers and 19 RBIs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Best for Me to Move On'  </P> <P> "He felt it would be best for me to move on to another ballclub," Carter said  after meeting with General Manager Frank Cashen. "This ballclub is going  through a transition. They're going to a younger trend of ballplayers."  </P> <P> Hernandez, who shared National League Most Valuable Players honors as a St.  Louis Cardinal in 1978, quoted Cashen as saying the club planned to rebuild.  </P> <P> "Now it's time to move on to the third stage of my career," Hernandez said.  </P> <P> Carter said he would like to play two or three more years.  </P> <P> "I know I can still play this game," he said. "I know there will be an  opportunity out there."  </P> <P> Carter, 38 games short of Al Lopez's National League record of 1,918 games  caught, also is 93 hits short of 2,000 and 45 runs short of 1,000.  </P> <P> He would like to eclipse the Lopez record, which means he would prefer to  remain in the NL.  </P> <P> "Atlanta is in need of a catcher," he said. "I don't like the idea that they  finished in last place.  </P> <P> "It would be basically a remodeling year. But, hey, the Baltimore Orioles  finished last last year (and a close second this year)."  </P> <P> Both Carter and Hernandez had emotional finales last Wednesday at Shea Stadium.  Carter even managed a pinch-hit double in his final at-bat.  </P> <P> "Those guys are the prime reasons why this organization has been successful in  the last six years," said Manager Davey Johnson, who thinks he will be let go  too. "They're consummate professionals, and I always felt secure putting their  names on the lineup card."  </P></p>

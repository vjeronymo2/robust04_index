			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The American movie "Mississippi Burning" is a box-office smash in Johannesburg,  South Africa, attracting both blacks and whites who previously were denied  access to such films about racial conflict. The film, which focuses on the  killing of three civil rights workers during the racial turbulence of the  1960s, has played to full houses since it opened in late April. The movie  "mirrors our times in South Africa," said the New Nation, a black-oriented  weekly. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

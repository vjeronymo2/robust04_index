			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOP NORTHRIDGE PERFORMERS TO MISS OPENING TRACK MEET  </P> <P> Although the track and field season begins today for Cal State Northridge, some  of the Matadors' top performers will not compete in the seven-team non-scoring  meet at CSUN.  </P> <P> Darcy Arreola and Will James, NCAA Division II All-Americans, will be among  those Northridge athletes who will not race until March 4. All-American hurdler  Tyrone Jeffries will compete, but in the sprints, not in his specialties.  </P> <P> In addition to Northridge, teams from USC (men only), Azusa Pacific, Cal  Lutheran, Cal State Fullerton, Westmont and Valley College have entered.  </P> <P> Field events will begin at 11 a.m. and running events at 12:30 p.m.  </P> <P> USC is sending a team, but it will not include freshman sprinter Quincy Watts,  who won three state titles during his career at Taft High.  </P> <P> "Because the recent weather caused a lot of people to alter some workouts,  everyone is treating this meet real tenderly," Northridge Coach Don Strametz  said. "I think you'll see some competitive races, but I don't expect to see a  lot of great times. It's just too early in the season."  </P> <P> Arreola, the NCAA Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000 meters,  redshirted the 1988 cross-country season because a long and arduous track  season left her injured and mentally fatigued. She is healthy again but will  not compete until a five-team meet at Northridge in two weeks.  </P> <P> James set the school record of 3 minutes, 43.42 seconds in the 1,500 meters  while placing fifth in the 1987 Division II championships but redshirted last  season because of an injury. He suffered a similar -- though less serious --  injury three weeks ago but also is expected to race in two weeks.  </P> <P> A fine group of Northridge freshmen will be on display today, including former  Saugus High standout Damiean Jenkins.  </P> <P> Jenkins placed third in the discus in last year's state championships at  Cerritos College with a personal best of 178 feet, 11 inches.

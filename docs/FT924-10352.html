			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gresham House problems mount with Pounds 1.5m deficit GRESHAM House, the investment trust with negative net assets after two years of losses, watched its problems mount in the six months to June 30. Gresham, unrelated to venture capital company Gresham Trust, reported losses attributable to shareholders of Pounds 1.5m during the period, compared to losses of Pounds 2.63m a year ago. In a statement, Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman, said losses would continue unless a refinancing, now under negotiation, could be concluded with banks and financial institutions. 'Slow progress is being made and there is no certainty that it will be successfully concluded,' he said. 'Failure is likely to prove fatal.' Gresham's troubles stem from investments in property and unquoted companies, two of the most dangerous areas for investment trusts during the recession. The company has been forced to sell most of its non-property assets to pay off debts, leading to a sharp fall in income. Net income fell from Pounds 420,000 to Pounds 270,000. But interest costs dropped from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 787,000. Exceptional losses totalled Pounds 982,000. But there was no explanation as to how the losses were incurred. No one at Gresham's offices was available to comment. Gresham is being sued for Pounds 1m for placing into receivership a subsidiary. Court rulings have gone against Gresham, which plans to appeal to the House of Lords next year. There was a loss per share of 35.3p, an improvement on last time's 61.9p. No dividend is paid. Group net asset value, which stood at minus 18p at December 31, continued to deteriorate, Mr Stirling's statement said. The shares fell from 3p to 1 3/4 p yesterday.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Numbers can be legally protected - European Court National rules which allow numbers to be protected as trademarks under certain speci-fied conditions are lawful under EC law, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The issue arose in the context of a dispute in Germany between carmakers Audi and Renault. Since 1980, Audi has been selling four-wheel drive cars under the trademark 'Quattro', which the company had registered under German law. In 1988, Renault began to sell its own four-wheel drive car, which was made in France and called the Espace 'Quadra', on the German market. Audi objected to this and Renault, in reply, submitted written applications to the German Patent Office seeking the removal of Audi's trademark protection of 'Quattro'. Before any decision was taken by the German Patent Office, Audi brought further proceedings against Renault seeking an injunction against the use of the term 'Quadra'. Audi claimed the two words 'Quattro' and 'Quadra' could be confused and that, under German trademark law, it was entitled to protect the term 'Quattro'. Audi won both at first instance and on appeal. Renault then appealed to the German Supreme Court, claiming that if it was prevented from using the term 'Quadra' in Germany, that would constitute an unlawful restraint of inter-state trade. The German Supreme Court referred the question to the ECJ. The court said the absence of Community trademarks legislation when the dispute arose meant the case had to be examined exclusively in the light of the Rome treaty rules on the free movement of goods. There were two points to decide: whether national provisions could give protection under EC law to the term 'Quattro'; and whether it was lawful to take into account the risk of confusion between 'Quattro' and 'Quadra'. The court first reiterated that under free movement of goods rules, quantitative restrictions on imports between member states and measures of equivalent effect thereto were unlawful, except insofar as they were justified by, among other things, the protection of industrial and commercial property. However, such restrictions could not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or disguised restriction on trade between member states. Given that there was no Community trademarks legislation at the time, it was for national law to determine the conditions of protection for the term 'Quattro'. On this issue, the court ruled that as the national law in question imposed very strict conditions on the trademark protection for a term such as 'Quattro' and as there was no evidence that the law could not be used to the benefit of a non-German producer, the rules in question, which allowed the registration of a term such as 'Quattro' under the particular conditions in this case, did not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or disguised restriction on inter-state trade. With regard to the confusion between 'Quattro' and 'Quadra', the court first held that it was the specific aim of trademark law to protect the holder of a trademark from the risks of confusion. The court then ruled that the criteria used to determine whether there was a risk of confusion between the two terms was a matter for national law. Again, it was necessary to examine whether such national provisions were compatible with Rome treaty rules on free movement of goods. The court said there was no evidence that the national laws would breach the Rome treaty rules, and in particular found no evidence that the German authorities would apply the rules in a discriminatory manner in favour of German producers. It thus ruled that national rules, such as those in question, which granted a right for the exclusive use of a term such as 'Quattro' in order to stop the use of a term such as 'Quadra' on the basis that the latter could cause confusion with the former, were lawful under EC law.

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: SSAB in loss after 8 months SSAB, the Swedish steel company recently privatised by the Swedish government, suffered a SKr119m (Dollars 22.5m) loss - after financial items  -in the first eight months of the year, it reported yesterday. This contrasts with a SKr114m profit for the same period of 1991 and an SKr87m profit for the first four months of this year. Operating revenues dropped drastically to SKr7.89bn for the first eight months, down from SKr9.23bn for the same period of last year. The company blamed the sharp deterioration on its performance in the second four months of the year to the outbreak of the fierce European price-cutting steel war as well as the reduced demand for steel in industry, particularly in Sweden. Mr Leif Gustafsson, chief executive, said that 1992 had turned out to be a tougher year for the steel industry than expected. He added that, despite a rationalisation programme that had slimmed its payroll by 7 per cent, SSAB would make a small financial loss in 1992 although normally the third four-month period is better than the other periods of the year. Mr Gustafsson added that the whole of the European steel industry would suffer large losses in 1992 but SSAB had shown it was more effective than others in adapting itself to straitened times.</p>

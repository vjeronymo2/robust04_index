			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although desert tortoise populations are not generally known to inhabit elevations much above 4,000 feet, tortoise burrows have been located at 4,800 feet in the Providence and Clark Mountains of the eastern Mojave (Luckenbach 1982; W. Yumiko, pers. comm., 1992). Reliable sources have recorded desert tortoises at 7,300 feet in Death Valley National Monument, California (Luckenbach 1982); at 4,800 feet in the Goodsprings Mountains (R. Marlow, pers. comm.) and the Spring Range, Nevada (C. Stevenson, pers. comm.); at 5,000 feet in the East Pahranagat Range, Nevada (C. Stevenson, pers. comm.); and at 5,200 feet on the Nevada Test Site (B. Burge, pers. comm.). In addition, numerous anecdotal reports place desert tortoises as high as 7,000 feet on Mount Charleston, Nevada, and in the Clark Mountains, California. Fossil remains from the Pleistocene to late Holocene (12,000 to 1,000 years before present) indicate the preferred habitat of the desert tortoise included elevations far exceeding those of today, perhaps in response to arid climatic episodes that occurred during this epoch (Morafka and Brussard, in prep.; Schneider and Everson 1989). This fossil evidence indicates that the species may have spent less than 10 percent of its taxonomic life span in the contemporary warm creosote bush desert, the remainder having been spent in more mesic, equable, and productive climates and ecosystems. This implies that contemporary tortoise populations in most of the Mojave region are likely to be vulnerable to adverse climatic conditions and to regional climate change (Morafka and Brussard, in prep.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout its geographic distribution, the desert tortoise exhibits trait variations in behavior, ecology, genetics, morphology, and physiology (Weinstein and Berry 1988, Germano 1989, Lamb  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1989, Brussard 1992, Brussard and Britten 1992). For example, three basic shell shapes (phenotypes) are indicative of desert tortoise populations in distinct geographic areas within their range (Weinstein and Berry 1988). Tortoises occurring in California and southern Nevada exhibit a boxlike, high-domed shell phenotype; Beaver Dam Slope tortoises have a short plastron (underside) and a low-domed shell phenotype; and Sonoran Desert tortoises have a pear-shaped, low-domed shell phenotype (Weinstein and Berry 1988). Furthermore, identification of the three phenotypes parallels results of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies that also ``type'' desert tortoises into the same three populations based on genetics (Lamb  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1989). It is because of such variability that six recovery units representing six distinct population segments of the Mojave population have been proposed in the Draft Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). These population segments should not be confused with subspecies or recognized populations, e.g., the Mojave or Sonoran populations. The six recovery units within the range of the desert tortoise, as outlined in the Draft Recovery Plan, mirror the biotic and abiotic variability found in the desert tortoise habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objective of the Draft Recovery Plan is the recovery and delisting of the Mojave population of the desert tortoise. Desert tortoise populations have declined substantially throughout the Mojave Region in the last 2 decades, primarily due to habitat loss. These populations grow slowly, and significant improvement in the status of the Mojave population will be a very long process, measured in decades or centuries in most parts of the Mojave Region. Nevertheless, delisting of the desert tortoise may be considered if the following criteria are met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) As determined by a scientifically credible monitoring plan, the population within a recovery unit exhibits a statistically significant upward trend toward target density or remains stationary at target density for at least 12 years (one-half of a desert tortoise generation); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Enough habitat is protected within a recovery unit and/or the habitat and desert tortoise populations are managed intensively enough to ensure long-term population viability; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Regulatory mechanisms or land management commitments have been implemented that provide for adequate long-term protection of desert tortoises and their habitat; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The population is unlikely to need protection under the Act in the foreseeable future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though the Draft Recovery Plan has not been approved, it represents the best available biological information on the conditions needed to bring the Mojave population of the desert tortoise to the point where listing under the Act is no longer necessary (i.e., recovery). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service would delist the Mojave population of the desert tortoise if the delisting criteria were met because protection under the Act would be unnecessary. With the delisting criteria met, the desert tortoise and its habitat would continue to be protected under other regulatory mechanisms outlined in a final recovery plan. Upon delisting, the interim protection afforded by the Act in the designation of critical habitat would be eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Management Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current and historic desert tortoise habitat loss, deterioration, and fragmentation is largely attributable to urban development, military operations, and multiple-uses of public land, such as off-highway vehicle (OHV) activities and livestock grazing. Historically, habitat reduction and fragmentation have not been uniform throughout the desert tortoise's range, but have been concentrated around populated areas, such as Mohave, Boron, Kramer Junction, Barstow, Victorville, Apple Valley, Lucerne Valley, and Twentynine Palms, California. Similar patterns are evident near Las Vegas, Laughlin, and Mesquite, Nevada; and St. George, Utah. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

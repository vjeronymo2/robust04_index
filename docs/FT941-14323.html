			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (32): Good news in rather short supply - Conditions in many western markets remained weak, and 17 of the 26 companies slipped down the rankings and six managed to rise / Sector Analyses - Engineering After a year of unprecedented recession for many continental European engineering companies, good news from the FT 500 rankings is, not surprisingly, in rather short supply. Mechanical engineering companies in particular have had a tough time, with demand in Germany falling through 1993 and showing only a few small signs yet of 'bottoming out'. Overall, demand for engineering products has recovered in the UK, but the upturn lacks conviction. Using a reasonably broad definition, there are 26 engineering companies in the FT 500. Apart from the 15 classed as engineering companies, it makes sense to add companies such as Siemens, General Electric Company, BTR and Alcatel Alsthom, which have big engineering interests, and companies such as Asea Brown Boveri and Electrolux, respectively Europe's largest electrical engineering group and white goods group. On this basis, 17 of the 26 companies slipped down the rankings and six managed to rise. There were two new entrants, Schindler, the Swiss lifts and escalators producer, and FKI, the UK electrical engineering concern. Significantly perhaps, four of the six companies that improved their position were British-based - BTR, GEC, Siebe and Lucas Industries. This partially reflects their relatively stronger home markets, but also the fact that their commitment to cutting costs, raising productivity and profits is more long-established than is the case with many continental companies. However, the relatively small declines in the rankings for many of the FT 500 companies is a testament to the importance now attached to drastic internal improvements aimed at enhancing their resilience against market downturns. ABB, which slipped from 40th to 47th, is a case in point. In November, the Swiss/Swedish group announced a 13 per cent increase in operating earnings after depreciation for the first nine months of 1993 - to Dollars 1.42bn from Dollars 1.26bn. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and expressed in local currencies, the rise is even more impressive at 27 per cent. Yet conditions in many western markets remained weak, especially in continental Europe, said ABB. The result illustrates the productivity gains achieved by ABB while large parts of the industrialised world have remained in a prolonged recession. Restructuring is being accelerated to reduce break-even points further. Perhaps the most surprising performance in the FT 500 rankings was that of Mannesmann, the German industrial, engineering and telecommunications group which has risen from 96th to 89th place. In August, the Dusseldorf-based company reported a plunge into losses of DM467m in the first half of 1993, down from a profit of DM15m in the first half of 1992. The group said it expects to make a substantial loss for all of 1993. Significantly, though, this reflects the costs of a one-off restructuring, which should lead to a large reduction in the group's break-even level. So Mannesmann expects a substantial improvement in the group's results for 1994 even if the economy continues to weaken - helping to explain the group's good performance in the rankings. Even so, Mannesmann's return on capital employed, based on 1992 figures, is low enough at 3.1 per cent to put it at 13th in the FT 500 list of 25 least profitable companies, so there is room for improvement. Fortunately Mannesmann is the only engineering group on this list, but SKF, the Swedish roller bearings producer, appears in 23rd place on the list for largest swings to losses. In fact, it suffered a much heavier loss in 1992 but there are now signs of an improvement in outlook - not soon enough, however, to prevent the company dropping from 278th to 328th. Only Lucas Industries of the UK manages to creep in at 12th in the list of largest increases in profit. Lucas, which recently ended a long search for a new chief executive by appointing Rover Group executive George Simpson, continued to benefit in 1993 from the extensive restructuring announced a year earlier. Cost-cutting enabled pre-tax profits to rise from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 50.3m in the year ended July 31, and the company's FT ranking has improved from 385th in 1992 to 336th. The new entrants have arrived via different routes. Schindler has rebuilt its position in the world escalator market over the past five years, while FKI has set out on a strategy of boosting profitability and achieved considerable success so far. The departures were Glasgow-based Weir Group, the well-regarded pump manufacturer which was ranked at 488th in 1992, and Trelleborg (466th in 1992), the Swedish mining and industrial group.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Engineering companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Company                           dollarsm    Rank   Sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Siemens                            22650.0      10      541 2   BTR                                19133.3      16      591 3   General Electric Company           14796.3      16      591 4   Alcatel-Alsthom                    18494.8      18      533 5   ABB Asea Brown Boveri              10987.7      47      541 6   Mannesmann                          6092.9      89      566 7   Sandvik                             3958.9     145      562 8   Linde                               3357.6     169      566 9   Siebe                               3172.4     180      591 10  TI Group                            2412.8     232      566  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 11  Electrolux                          2227.9     253      402 12  Man                                 2137.0     261      566 13  Incentive                           1893.5     285      541 14  GKN                                 1844.2     292      571 15  Legrand                             1784.4     306      541 16  Atlas Copco                         1694.6     317      566 17  SKF                                 1649.4     328      566 18  Smiths Industries                   1646.0     331      566 19  Sulzer                              1616.3     334      563 20  Lucas Industries                    1609.9     336      571  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 21  Electrowatt                         1597.8     338      561 22  Kvaerner                            1521.9     355      592 23  Schindler                           1212.9     425      566 24  Delta                               1210.2     428      563 25  FKI                                 1062.6     459      563 26  Glynwed International                970.9     486      566  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

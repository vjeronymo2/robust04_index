			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of a U.N. team of observers in Tajikistan  said that last month's group murders in the Central Asian  Republic (eight people being killed in Hissar District, five in  Dzhirgatal District and four in Tajikabad District) may not have  been politically motivated.    Liviu Bota, in an interview with INTERFAX, said it is the  economic situation in Tajikistan that accounts for the high  crime rate there.    However, "although many of the latest events of that kind  have no political motives behind them, they may grow into  political confrontations," he said.    Liviu said crime is a serious problem throughout the  Commonwealth of Independent States, and "Tajikistan is no  exception." But in Tajikistan "this is taking place against the  background of a political confrontation and may have undesirable  consequences," he said.    "The United Nations and states friendly to Tajikistan will  be  doing their best to achieve reconciliation in the Republic and  to make sure that goodwill intentions stated at the first round  of Tajik talks (negotiations between Tajikistan's government and  opposition) in Moscow at the beginning of April develop into  effective measures," Bota said.    He said the international community approved of the present  rapprochement between the conflicting parties in Tajikistan,  which was clear from some countries' declared readiness to  increase their humanitarian aid to the republic.    Bota said the conflict would take time to resolve, but  expressed satisfaction that "the parties have realized that the  problem cannot be solved by force."    He said preparations were underway for a second round of  talks, where many questions taken up at the first round would be  addressed more closely.    Asked whether the adoption of a new constitution, a draft of  which is currently under discussion in Tajikistan, would be  premature now, Bota said, "Since (today) a Soviet-era  constitution is in effect in the republic today, a new one,  whatever it is, would be a step forward." But he said there was  no reason to hurry up with the adoption of the document. "It  would be better to provide conditions for all Tajiks to take  part in the [discussion] process," he said.</p>

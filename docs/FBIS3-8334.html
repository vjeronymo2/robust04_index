			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Professor Dariusz Rosati, </F> Democratic Left Alliance candidate for deputy prime minister and  finance minister, in Geneva, by Krzysztof Skowronski at the  Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet"  program--live]    [Text] [Skowronski] What is the weather like in Geneva?    [Rosati] The weather is lovely, it is very warm.    [Skowronski] How warm?    [Rosati] Twelve degrees Celsius.    [Skowronski] Do you really feel like leaving such a warm  sunny city for Warsaw to fill such a difficult post in our  government?    [Rosati] Well, the proposal is definitely interesting and  attractive. Perhaps it will offset the losses resulting from  the change in the climate.    [Skowronski] Have you made a final decision yet?    [Rosati] I have agreed that my candidacy for the two posts  you mentioned be submitted to Prime Minister Pawlak. However,  it is really hard to tell now what the decision of the prime  minister and then of the president will be.    [Skowronski] When will you meet with Prime Minister Pawlak?    [Rosati] We have an appointment to meet in a few days.  During that talk, we are going to agree as to what our economy  should look like in the immediate future and what should be done  to maintain the growth trend and to ensure that the situation  gradually improves.    [Skowronski] What should our economy look like in the  immediate future?    [Rosati] Well, everyone wants it to look as good as  possible, everyone wants an improvement of the situation.  However, there are certain limitations: A budget has been  passed that imposes certain limits on this year's economic  policy. Certain legal solutions are in rather advanced stages;  they will decide what will be happening in the economy in the  next few months or half-year. However, a more long-term vision  of development should be given some thought--what should be done  so that the economy can start developing intensively and in a  balanced manner.    [Skowronski] Do you envision any changes in the economic  policy of our state?    [Rosati] Well, it is difficult for me to envision anything  now because, as I have said, the issue is still being discussed  by the coalition partners, as I understand it. Now, as an  economist I think that Poland is going through a stage when  certain growth trends should be strengthened; one should think  about some steps that would allow investment expansion to  increase, that would allow us to accelerate exports; only on the  road to economic growth are we able to resolve the problems that  we have now--the crisis of public finances, mass unemployment,  and so on and so forth.    [Skowronski] How can growth trends in the economy be  strengthened?    [Rosati] A number of steps can be taken that would simply  improve the investment climate, that would encourage investors  to invest their money, and that would make those investments  possible by increasing financial means, decreasing the  uncertainty concerning the future, and introducing a certain  stabilization of the rules of play.    [Skowronski] Does the increase in accessibility mean more  money on the market, or is it something else?    [Rosati] A number of solutions are possible here that do not  necessarily lead to increasing the quantity of money on the  market but that will create incentives to invest money. Of  course, these solutions also include financial policy  instruments. Because we are talking about money, let me tell  you that such solutions make sense and are effective in the long  run only when they do not accelerate inflation; this is a very  important limitation that I believe will be strictly observed.    [Skowronski] Are you going to continue the policy of  Former Deputy Prime Minister Borowski?    [Rosati] Even though he has not finished it, Mr. Borowski  started a certain maneuver in the area of economic policy that,  as I see and understand it, can be summed up as follows: A  restrictive, responsible, strict economic policy should be  continued, but it should at the same time be supplemented by  certain steps that would stimulate economic growth and decrease  as much as possible the negative social results of some steps  that are necessary from the point of view of economics. In this  sense, such a policy definitely deserves to be continued.    [Skowronski] How do you evaluate everything that has  happened in Poland since 1990--that is, mainly the Balcerowicz  plan?    [Rosati] My evaluation of the Balcerowicz plan is positive.  I think that generally it was certainly a correct decision. In  a further stage of the implementation of the program, let us say  that, after a year or two, certain changes could and should have  been made. These changes were not made; perhaps the evaluation  of the situation was different, or maybe I am wrong. However,  generally speaking, the direction of the transformations we  began in 1990 was absolutely correct.    [Skowronski] What is your evaluation of the privatization  process in Poland?    [Rosati] I would like this process to be much more advanced  and quicker. Privatization is the part of the transformations  that is of paramount importance if we want to increase the  efficiency of the economy, increase the sensitivity or the  manner of responding of companies to market signals. It is  certainly easier to carry out a macroeconomic policy in an  economy that has many private companies than in an economy, such  as ours, where there still are a lot of state-run enterprises,  which look at things differently, which have a different  hierarchy of purposes, and which simply operate with a different  configuration of motivations.    [Skowronski] That means that privatization is a very  positive factor in the economy?    [Rosati] Yes, privatization is very positive. It should be  continued, and I believe that there are possibilities of  accelerating it and perhaps employing more diversified methods  and means of accelerating it.    [Skowronski] What about the exchange rate of the dollar?  Has this exchange rate been correctly set in Poland? Or should  we change anything here?    [Rosati] Well, again, I understand that I should answer this  question as an economist...    [Skowronski, interrupting] Yes, certainly as an economist.    [Rosati] The decision concerning the exchange rate and the  exchange-rate policy is up to the president of the National Bank  of Poland [NBP]. I believe that the exchange-rate policy should  really be a little more active; however, I do not think that, in  these concrete conditions...[Rosati pauses] Again I will tell  you that I am saying this on the basis of...[Rosati pauses] I do  not have all of the information I would need to express my  opinion on this with full responsibility. However, as I see it,  at the moment more important for stimulating the exports and for  opening the economy are certain institutional solutions that are  beyond the exchange-rate policy. Now, generally speaking, the  effectiveness of the exchange-rate policy in the past years has  not been such as it should and could have been.    [Skowronski] And if you are indeed appointed deputy prime  minister, what will be your first priority in office?    [Rosati] Well, you know, I will familiarize myself in a  detailed manner with the budget and with those draft laws that  are now in the Sejm or on the finance minister's desk. I will  first of all find out what progress has been made in terms of  proposals for systemwide solutions that the current coalition  submitted [hesitating] before the elections or immediately after  the elections, and then I will deal with a good formulation of  certain principles having to do with long-term economic policies  and what our goals are for the next two to three years. I will  deal with that issue as the second-most-important priority.  Actually, I will deal with that simultaneously.    [Skowronski] And what about right now? Where are we heading  right now? I mean if you were to evaluate what we have been  doing in Poland for four years, where are we heading?    [Rosati] We are heading toward building an efficient market  economy, where the people's standard of living will be good. We  all wanted that to happen, beginning with the start of the  transformations in 1990. The process of transformation proved  more costly than had been expected; my view is that it could  have been less costly. My feeling is that the most difficult  part of the process is already behind us, and I think that--you  have already asked me about that--the former finance ministers  also greatly contributed to that, primarily Leszek Balcerowicz.  Nonetheless, I think the right conditions and a chance now  exist for an acceleration of economic growth trends.    [Skowronski] You just said the most difficult phase is  already behind us, but you know perfectly well that a wave of  strikes is just beginning in Poland. Today was the first day of  strikes and you probably have not received news on that--there  was not too much of that.    [Rosati] You know, of course, those social aspects that  result either from disappointments with regard to some necessary  cost of the transformation or from the fact that some specific  mistakes have been made--these are very important aspects of  development that cannot be ignored. Perhaps it is the case  that, in the past, one used to [hesitating] put too much stress  on conducting policies according to some textbook patterns and  ignoring, to some extent, certain social consequences of  applying these patterns. That does absolutely not mean that  social consequences will be a determinant factor in shaping  economic policies. Unfortunately, there are certain economic  principles that simply cannot be taken lightly, so the policies  will be--or at least should be, in my view--reasonable.    [Skowronski] Would you be willing to attempt to convince  those on strike that it is not worth it?    [Rosati] I think one should always make such attempts  because only....[Rosati pauses] I think that not enough social  communication was perhaps one of the reasons for all these  social conflicts that accompany these efforts aimed at  transformations and building a market economy.    [Skowronski] What kind of an argument would you use [in  talking to the strikers]? A lot of arguments have already been  used, and they ceased to be effective.    [Rosati] You know, I do not think at all that the strikers  just consist of people who have no idea of economic issues. I am  deeply convinced that rational arguments can be accepted. I am  also convinced that, even if there are rational arguments, a  whole lot of people--actually [hesitating], quite a lot of  people in Poland--have completely genuine and justified  grievances concerning the fact that their lots have radically  deteriorated. I think one can find such solutions that will to  some extent make life easier for some social groups, but one  must also be aware that, without some kind of firm concept of a  policy that would finally lead us to permanent growth, the  country will simply collapse.    [Skowronski] And you claim to have precisely such a concept?    [Rosati] I think a concept based primarily on a policy of  economic growth is one that may be formulated and that is not  just my personal one but is also shared by a number of  economists. That is actually the only chance to solve the  problems of unemployment, public finances, and low salaries when  you look long term--well, actually, not long term but let us say  medium term. These three problems I mentioned are striking a  lethal blow to the Polish economy right now.    [Skowronski] There are economists who say that the money  supply in Poland is not high enough. Are you among them?    [Rosati] You know [hesitating], the situation with money is  that one can only introduce as much of it into the economic  system, as much as society is willing to accept.    [Skowronski] I think people are willing to accept...    [Rosati, interrupting] No, no, I mean demand for money.  Demand for money is...    [Skowronski, interrupting] It is high in Poland.    [Rosati] Demand for money when we speak in economic terms  means demand for that money that people have in their pockets,  as opposed to that which is immediately spent on day-to-day  transactions. So this issue requires thorough research and  debates--of course, also with the NBP, which probably has more  information on that. My view is that [hesitating] perhaps there  is some possibility of increasing the money supply, while  meeting certain terms that could be helpful in terms of growth  and that would not necessarily have inflationary effects.    [Skowronski] Would you please remain on the line for a  moment while Michal Kowalewski reads a newscast during which he  will tell us what that is interesting has happened recently in  Poland and around the world? Would you please listen to it, and  I have two more questions for you that I will ask after the  newscast? Is that all right?    [Rosati] That is fine with me.    [Skowronski] Let me remind you that Radio Zet's guest  today is Prof. Dariusz Rosati, the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and  finance minister.    Is the same kind of news being broadcast by radio stations  in  Geneva right now? I mean you did not hear the one now, but let  us say from today's newscasts--was the news the same or similar?    [Rosati] In terms of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia, yes,  these are the main news items all the time.    [Skowronski] And now to return to Polish issues: What is  your view on the stock market and on everything that happened in  the Bank Slaski case?    [Rosati] The stock market is a very positive phenomenon in  what is happening in Poland; I think the incredible increase in  share prices over the past six months--I think that is not to be  repeated in the future, let me put it this way. It was linked  to an entire array of factors that simply caused, first of all,  the increase in share prices, and, second, they caused private  investors to go after shares immediately. Second [as heard],  there occurred such a shift in the prices of shares that we had  an opportunity of witnessing also in the case of Bank Slaski.  This boom or incredible growth will be slowed down, and I think  there will occur a certain cooling down of the heated  atmosphere, but I do not think any disaster will happen.    [Skowronski] And you think interference by politicians is  not called for in the stock market, and you would not be willing  to take the initiative when it comes to the stock market?    [Rosati] Of course, the government should keep its hands off  these issues as best it can. Stock market and capital market  measures in general are an extremely delicate mechanism that is  guided to a large extent, alas, by imponderables and certain  purely psychological factors, and so one must be aware of that  while making decisions or even declarations on that issue.    [Skowronski] Let us return to your future conversation with  Prime Minister Pawlak. What preconditions will you set?    [Rosati] I think I will begin by asking the prime minister  what he expects me to do in the government. Of course, if we  manage to come to some agreement or some common strategic policy  on program-related issues--that is a fundamental issue--it is my  intention to ask the prime minister to help me assure creating  certain conditions that will make it possible for the government  to act efficiently in the area of the economy.    [Skowronski] Could you give us a list of those items you  will definitely not give up? What kinds of concessions can you  not make? Of course, it is hard to speak about that because  first of all...    [Rosati, interrupting] It is hard to speak about it because  one probably has a number of principles, depending on what it is  that we are talking about. If you could phrase the question  more precisely, perhaps I could answer it.    [Skowronski] Well, in that case, perhaps I will give it up.    To end the interview, how would you describe your views: Are  you a social democrat, a liberal, or do they use completely  different terms nowadays with regard to economists and economics  professors?    [Rosati] Well, I am first of all an economist, and that is  how I view my role in the government.    [Skowronski] What about a liberal? Are you offended by such  a label?    [Rosati] No, I do not feel offended if someone calls me a  liberal. On the contrary, I think that the liberal doctrine, if  one perceives it the right way, and I want to say that  liberalism is perceived one way in Europe but quite another way  in America; these are completely different concepts, so,  generally speaking, I have nothing against using the term. But  of course, one would have to define the term with precision in  the first place, to find out what it really means.    [Skowronski] And how did Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski come  across you? How did the proposition come about?    [Rosati] The best thing would be to ask Mr. Kwasniewski  himself.    [Skowronski] When did you find out that you were a candidate  for deputy prime minister? How did it happen?    [Rosati] I was asked a preliminary question of whether I  would be interested in it at all. That was about three weeks ago.    [Skowronski] So three weeks have already passed. You see  how tight-lipped the SLD coalition is? There were no leaks at  all to the press, and so the press failed to find out about your  candidacy.    [Rosati] Perhaps that was just a simple question, without  any political ramifications.    [Skowronski] But it turned out otherwise. What are you doing  in Geneva?    [Rosati] I am working at the European Economic Commission,  and I deal with analyses and assessments of the macroeconomic  situation in East European countries.    [Skowronski] Thank you very much for the conversation, and I  wish you a good night.    Radio Zet's guest today has been Prof. Dariusz Rosati, the  SLD's candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and  finance minister.    [Rosati] Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fitting the office into a briefcase Most people are happy to forget their offices when they go home, but UK-based Vocom has a solution for those who cannot bear to leave their work behind. Vocom says its Micro-office is the first office-in-a-briefcase with a single power supply for all its computer and communications equipment. This cuts weight and allows more equipment to be included. The product includes a letter-quality printer, data and fax modem, removable mobile telephone and optional notebook computer. It accepts most common types of notebook computer. Micro-office weighs 17 lbs without the computer and costs Pounds 2,995 excluding value-added tax. Vocom: UK, 0793 784478.</p>

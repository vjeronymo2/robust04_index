			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke Since Ladbroke announced its results two months ago the shares have fallen by 23 per cent. Clearly the fall-out from the Queens Moat debacle has cast a pall over the leisure sector. Gun-shy investors are less inclined to give complex groups like Ladbroke the benefit of the doubt in such tough times. But there is more than poor sentiment at work. Ladbroke's high debt reduces flexibility, and the property division is something of an albatross. Despite the upturn in the UK there are still worries about competition in the DIY sector. The national lottery ups the ante for the betting division, and hotels are seeing only patchy demand. If the company wishes to counter market nerves, there are things it could do. Sentiment improved towards Forte when Lord Forte's diminishing influence allowed the dividend to be cut. Ladbroke could follow suit. An accelerated property disposal programme would cut borrowings faster, while the sale of Texas Homecare would also bring in cash. The company may set its face against such moves, arguing that this is not the stage of the cycle to sell. But the luxury of choice will be lost if Hilton starts to suffer from the more rapid expansion of its rivals. If Ladbroke cannot yet face drastic steps then it could at least strengthen its board and improve disclosure of information to the City. As a FT-SE 100 company yielding over 8.5 per cent, Ladbroke might also consider buying in its own shares if it is so confident of its story. Instead it has opted for an enhanced scrip dividend which looks like a mini-rights issue.</p>

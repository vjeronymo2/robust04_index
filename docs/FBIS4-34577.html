			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Panama has informed  the United States that it is impossible for Panama to receive  Haitian refugees because of the serious economic crisis the  nation is experiencing, the Foreign Ministry reported here today.    Acting Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero said: "We have  cooperated and will continue offering aid to the Haitians, but  at this time it is impossible to receive them." After noting  Panama's current high unemployment rate (15 percent), Cordero  said a mass influx of Caribbean refugees would only worsen the  Panamanian people's economic and social situation.    Last week the Panamanian Government denied press reports  announcing the arrival of refugees in Panama. Recently,  President William Clinton suggested to the nations of the region  that they receive Haitian citizens who are fleeing the island  because of the serious political crisis that threatens to end in  a U.S. military invasion.</p>

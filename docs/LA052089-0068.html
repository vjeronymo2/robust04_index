			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Birmingham fans who swarmed onto the field during a soccer game last weekend at  London's Crystal Palace, leading to 16 injuries and 17 arrests, were part of an  organized plan to cause trouble, according to results of a club investigation.  </P> <P> The English League game was halted for 27 minutes because of on-field clashes.  </P> <P> Crystal Palace chairman Ron Noades said the actions by visiting Birmingham fans  were "organized, orchestrated and premeditated."  </P> <P> The fan violence at Crystal Palace was echoed during and after several other  games around the country, leading to 255 arrests on the last full Saturday of  league soccer this season in England.  </P> <P> English clubs have been barred from playing in European competition since the  Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, in which rioting by Liverpool fans led to 39  deaths, but European soccer officials recently voted to allow England back in  1990-91.  </P> <P> However, those authorities have made the return of England to competition  dependent on continued good behavior by fans, as well as the government's  approval of English clubs traveling throughout Europe.  </P></p>

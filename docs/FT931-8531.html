			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UN members 'put own interests first' THE leading members of the UN are putting their own interests before the organisation's commitment to collective security in deciding how to act in Bosnia-Hercegovina, a UK foreign affairs select committee was told yesterday. Professor Rosalyn Higgins, UK representative on the International Human Rights Committee, said in written evidence it was not the intention of the UN Charter that member states should help countries under attack only if they felt they had a direct national interest to do so. Neither did such assistance depend on guarantees that no harm would come to their soldiers nor that the outcome of any action was clear at the outset. 'But all of these reasons have been offered over the last weeks as to why there should be no enforcement action by the UN in response to illegal action in Bosnia,' Prof Higgins told the select committee on the role of the UN. Unlawfulness and aggression were encouraged by 'the debates about national interest, the hesitations about military overstretching, and disputes between allies as to what should and should not be done' by the UN. Key members of the Security Council were insisting they could not do everything alone, while at the same time refusing to ensure a role for other member states. The US and the UK were understandably concerned about the limits to the burden each took in enforcing peace around the globe. But the burden could only be shared properly if the resources of all member states were available to the Security Council on call.</p>

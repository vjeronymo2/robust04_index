			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> CITY PUTS GRASS OUT TO PASTURE  </P> <P> Continuing its environmentally conscious bent, the City Council on Tuesday  adopted a landscape ordinance that will require new developments to use  drought-tolerant plants instead of lush, green lawns.  </P> <P> Single-family homes and agricultural areas are exempt from the law, which will  apply mainly to new condominium complexes and business developments.  </P> <P> The law not only restricts water-guzzling grass, but also dictates what plants  can be put next to each other based on similar climate, soil and maintenance  needs.  </P> <P> These and other restrictions were developed from studies showing that mowing,  mulching, fertilizing and watering of turf grass is ultimately more harmful to  the atmosphere than the benefits derived from oxygen-producing greenery,  officials said.  </P> <P> City planners call the law a "sustainability in landscape ordinance." Its goal  is to promote landscaping that can thrive on its own while minimizing water  consumption and maintenance costs. The program also helps reduce the amount of  greenery clippings that end up in local landfills, planners said.  </P> <P> A manual outlining details of the law will be presented for approval at a  future council meeting.  </P></p>

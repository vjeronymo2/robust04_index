			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Ciampi sets wages deadline: Italian premier raises stakes in union talks with employers MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, has tossed the survival of his fragile government into the ring in a last-minute attempt to force employers and trade unions to agree on a new wage bargaining system. Mr Ciampi set a deadline of July 5 for an accord. Failing an agreement, he implied that his two-month-old government could fall. Mr Ciampi said a wage deal was essential for Italy to maintain its fight against inflation and credibility in international markets. He made clear the negotiations would not be allowed to drag on and resume after the holiday period if the two sides could not reach a compromise by next Monday. The warnings followed a tense week during which neither unions or employers showed any sign of compromise, but with neither side wanting to take responsibility for a breakdown. The government will continue individual talks with union leaders and the Confindustria employers' federation this week in an attempt to bridge differences. Bilateral discussions with Confindustria are due today, and a new round of meetings with union leaders is scheduled for Wednesday. The discussions follow last July's agreement between employers and unions to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation system. The accord, hailed as a breakthrough in restraining inflationary wage rises, helped substantially to improve Italy's international competitiveness. However, crucial issues were put off pending further discussions between unions and employers and it is these negotiations which have now reached a head. Last week, fears of a breakdown started to affect share prices and the lira. Although there has been some narrowing of the differences, the two sides remain apart on the overall structure of the labour market and the details of new contractual arrangements for workers. The trade unions have fiercely resisted Confindustria's demands for greater labour flexibility, especially for young people. With membership under pressure in the recession and signs of a drift towards extreme splinter groups outside the main trade union structure, union leaders have been loath to dilute existing demarcation and job security provisions. The question of contractual arrangements is more complex. Employers want to simplify the present, multi-level bargaining system and gear pay more closely to companies' profitability. The unions are highly uneasy about such changes. Mr Giuliano Graziosi, a former managing director of the state-controlled Stet telecommunications group, has been arrested on allegations of paying kickbacks for contracts to the former ASST state telecoms group. Mr Graziosi is the latest senior telecommunications executive to be enmeshed in corruption allegations involving ASST.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Rowntree shuffles pension fund team Nestle Rowntree, the UK arm of the international food group, has dropped the three external fund managers of its pension fund and consolidated management of the Pounds 1.3bn scheme with its in-house investment team. The external managers were Mercury Asset Management, which had the single largest portion, PDFM and Barings Investment Management. The fund, one of the 50th largest in the UK, will be looking, however, for an external manager for its investments on the Pacific Rim and Japan. Mr Gordon Thomson, Nestle Rowntree investment manager, said that following a review the company found that the in-house team had outperformed the combined external managers over the past six years. He added that the company also wanted to have greater control over asset allocation, deciding what proportion of the scheme should be invested in which assets. New minimum solvency requirements were likely to require schemes with large numbers of current or deferred pensioners to invest a greater proportion of their assets in fixed-interest securities. Mr Thomson said Nestle Rowntree had not yet decided whether it needed to restructure its asset mix but would be meeting its actuaries this week to consider the matter. Mr Thomson said the review followed a consolidation of the Nestle and Rowntree pension schemes, which had been run separately since Nestle's takeover of Rowntree with the latter retaining its own internal fund management team.</p>

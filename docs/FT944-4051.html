			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Breaking with the inflationary past - The 1990s could yet turn out to be the decade of the bond Five years ago, I wrote an FT article considering the spectacular, but surely unrepeatable, returns on equities during the 1980s. Later, in a column in mid-1992 - a quarter of the way through the 1990s - I speculated on whether this would turn out to be the decade of the fixed-interest bond. Halfway through the decade, here is an update. Bonds are indeed still ahead and equities continue to struggle (they have had a bad week). It looks as though, in 1994, we are heading for the second year of equity price declines in the 1990s. Investment institutions stuck with a backward-looking orientation towards equities are grappling with the problem of whether they should re-shape their fundamental strategies. Remember that the world's stock markets delivered wonderful returns in the 1980s. For the British investor, the pre-tax total rate of return (dividend income plus capital growth) averaged 24 per cent annually on UK equities and about 23 1/2 per cent on overseas stock markets. The average annual return on UK government bonds was just under 15 per cent  - not bad in itself, but a yawning 9 per cent short of the return on equities. Here, though, are the numbers for the 1990s thus far. British government fixed-interest bonds have returned 11.8 per cent a year against just 9.1 per cent on the FT-SE-A All-Share index. Globally, the Salomon Brothers World Government Bond index has returned 9.8 per cent (in dollars) against a corresponding dollar return on the FT-A World index of no more than 4 per cent. Even as I calculated them this week the figures were shifting further in favour of bonds. The pattern is not yet repeated in the US, however, where the return on the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index has just beaten the return on US Treasury bonds - by a margin of 8.6 against 7.8 per cent a year. The reason is that dollar bonds have taken a much bigger caning than US equities in 1994. But Wall Street stocks are now looking very fragile. Why have equities generally proved so disappointing since the end of 1989? The simple answer is that they became over-valued in the 1980s as investors chased historical performance without proper regard to reasonable expectations of potential future returns. This was most obviously true in Japan. There has been a serious world recession, too. Economic growth in the OECD member states has slowed from 2.7 per cent in the 1980s to 1.8 in the 1990s (although a marked acceleration is under way). Inflation also has slowed sharply around the world, not least in the UK where it averaged 6.9 per cent in the 1980s but has fallen recently to the 2 to 3 per cent range. These economic trends generally have been favourable to bonds, although recent signs of economic over-expansion in the US have hurt bonds badly. The failure of equities to generate a higher investment return in recent years - the so-called 'risk premium' earned normally by investors from risky rather than safe assets - has led to considerable investment theorising. Last month, a paper called The Risk Premium on Ordinary Shares was published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. In it, David Wilkie discusses the reasons for the historical existence of an equity risk premium over bond returns as wide as 7 per cent. He points out that when actuaries make valuations of pension schemes, they assume a much lower extra return on equities - of the order of 1 to 2 per cent. Perhaps that reflects professional caution but, certainly, the 7 per cent figure is an historical aberration which is related, in broad terms, to unanticipated post-war inflation and (although Wilkie does not say this) to the isolation of the British capital markets during a 40-year period of foreign exchange controls. As for the future, Wilkie thinks it would be reasonable to expect 3 per cent in the long run. Such a future pattern of returns, however, could be assumed only from the starting point of an equilibrium relationship between bond and equity yields. Recently, though, the yield ratios have looked rather stretched and equities therefore over-valued, especially in the US, although there has been a degree of correction within the past two months. The UK yield ratio has dropped over the past few weeks from 2.3 to 2.1; this, to my mind, is still too high for a period of low inflation, but opinions differ. A fall in the ratio towards, say, 1.75 would generate further outperformance by bonds in the short to medium term. On the other hand, equity dividends are now growing strongly, which they were not in the early 1990s, and this is positive for shares. Certainly, the recent outperformance by bonds can be regarded as exceptional but it is not necessarily temporary. In UK terms it marks a definite break with an inflationary past. This change is putting pressure on investment institutions. The average UK equity unit trust, for instance, has performed rather worse over the past five years (when it has returned a modest 6.4 per cent annually) than the average gilt and fixed interest trust (which has returned 6.9 per cent). But unit trust companies are geared overwhelmingly to promote equity funds - which, counting only the UK sectors, are worth Pounds 45.5bn against merely Pounds 1.5bn for gilt funds. Similarly, many pension scheme trustees in the UK are wondering about the level of risks associated with their typical 80 to 85 per cent exposure to equities. Such an investment strategy might have made sense in the 1980s, when the equity risk premium was running at 9 per cent, but does not look so clever when the risk premium temporarily has gone negative and might be only 3 per cent in future. After five years, we are halfway to the millennium. In the 21st century, you can bet that equities will again outperform in the long run. But the 1990s could yet be the decade of the bond.</p>

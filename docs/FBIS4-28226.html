			<p>BFN     [Summary] "The fifth session of the Ninth National  Assembly entered its 12th day today. In the morning, deputies  studied documents in preparation for their afternoon group  discussions on the draft civil code.    "All the views aired focused on some major issues such as  the  issue of marriage and families, the issue of transfer of  land-use rights within areas stipulated by the civil code, the  substance of civil relations, the issue of ownership, and the  issue of civil contracts.    "Generally speaking, all the debaters favored the idea of  promptly approving the civil code since it is a very important  law that has great impact on general social activities."    Some deputies expressed the view that although many laws  have  been promulgated by our state over the past 10 years, numerous  issues have still been left unadjusted by the legislative  sector. This has created considerable difficulties for those  organs in charge of adjudicating civil disputes. "In reality,  many cases of violation of the rights and the legitimate  interests of individuals, collectives, and the state have  occurred and there has been a failure to clearly define the  legal position of foreigners in Vietnam. That is why a prompt  promulgation of the civil code is necessary."    The National Assembly deputies will continue their group  discussions on the draft civil code tomorrow morning. They will  work at the conference hall in the afternoon.</p>

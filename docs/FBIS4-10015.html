			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cristiano Romero] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- Following a suggestion by former Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Federal Administration  Secretary Romildo Canhim, President Itamar Franco decided to  withdraw an article from the provisional measure restructuring  the Budget and Finance Secretariat and the Public Spending  Control Secretariat, which increases the salaries earned by  officials of both secretariats who have been on strike for more  than one month. The president also decided to change the  provisional measure into a bill.    This decision has aggravated the impasse caused by the  strike, which has particularly impaired the amendment of the  1994 budget bill and the investigation of corruption charges in  various public bodies. Another consequence of the impasse is  that without the budget, newly designated Finance Minister  Rubens Ricupero will be unable to create the new currency, the  real.    During a tense meeting with representatives of the public  servants on 30 March, Franco said he recognized the employees'  right to strike, but he warned that if the strike continues the  government will adopt the "appropriate measures" to design the  budget. In retaliation, unions will not hold meetings to decide  on the government proposal until 6 or 7 April, thus delaying an  eventual return to work even more.  <H5>  Squandering </H5>   Finance and control analysts and budget technicians, all of  them high-ranking officials, earned salaries ranging from $460  to $827 in February. With the new increase, the largest salary  will stand at $1,600 this year and $2,300 in 1995. In an attempt  to convince Franco of the importance of restructuring the  Internal Control Secretariat -- a process also known as Cisetao  -- the civil servants delivered a dossier charging that the  government squandered $47.4 billion over the past six years  because of lack of controls and misuse of public funds.    Cardoso's position during the meeting, at which Canhim  recalled that 13 other public servant categories are striving  for improved salaries, showed that he, Cardoso, backed down on  the position he had upheld so far. The provisional measure was  drawn up by members of his team who estimated that increasing  salaries for those civil servants will cost the Treasury  approximately $50 million in 1994. In justifying the provisional  measure's text, Cardoso himself admitted that Cisetao is an  important supplemental measure for the economic plan since it  will again give the government the possibility of controlling  public spending and fighting corruption.</p>

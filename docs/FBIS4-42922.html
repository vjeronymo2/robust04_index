			<p>BFN     [Text] "The matter is closed", said Claudio Dematte, the  chairman of the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], who was  referring to the storm surrounding the recent remarks of Silvio  Berlusconi.    The prime minister "told me that his plan is very clear: The  RAI cannot be progovernment or antigovernment," said Dematte,  who along with RAI Managing Director Gianni Locatelli, met  Berlusconi at the Saxa Rubra television center. "We agreed to  see each other in order to begin work immediately on the  regulations governing the RAI and its reorganization plan.  That's all."</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> STATE OKS $127,151 MARINA PARK GRANT  </P> <P> The city of Ventura received backing for a $127,151 grant to help restore  Marina Park, a popular seaside playground and picnic spot that in recent years  has suffered from storm damage and sea erosion.  </P> <P> The Marina Park grant, one of 16 in California in the 1989-90 allocation from  the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, must be presented to the National  Park Service for final approval.  </P> <P> It got preliminary approval from the state Parks and Recreation Department.  </P> <P> Marina Park is on Pierpont Bay just north of the Ventura Marina at the southern  tip of San Buenaventura State Beach. Its main attraction for the dozens of  children who visit every day is an old pirate ship marooned on a sandlot.  </P> <P> The grant would be used to repair walkways, replace security lights, restore  dunes and do minor landscaping, said Rose Mary Bauer of the city Parks and  Recreation Department.  </P> <P> "The grant will help us complete the park restoration project we began two  years ago," Bauer said. The city also allocated $258,400 of its own funds for  improvements to Marina Park. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

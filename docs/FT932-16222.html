			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Computerisation fails to ease passport delays COMPUTERISATION has failed to cut the costs and time taken to issue passports by the extent expected, the National Audit Office says. The government expenditure watchdog says in a report published today that the time taken by the Passport Agency to issue a passport was supposed to have been cut to five working days. Although the new system has been installed in all passport offices, it takes 20 working days to process an application in peak periods and 10 days at other times. In spite of advertising to encourage applications in off-peak periods, they continue to be concentrated in the first six months of the year. The NAO says that the agency could improve its service by differential pricing to smooth the flow of work through the year - for example, by reducing the price of a passport in off-peak times. But the agency is reluctant to consider differential pricing because a cut large enough to be effective might shift all demand to off-peak months. The report also says that the Home Office Nationality Division has failed to achieve its target of processing citizenship applications within 12 months. Average waiting time in January 1993 was 20 months, down from 33 months in March 1991 but still higher than in 1987. Manpower Planning in the Home Office. HMSO. Pounds 6.70.</p>

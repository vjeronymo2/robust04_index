Today the prices of all foodstuffs in the republic, except  bread and milk products, are not under government control. The  government plans to introduce a system under which food will be  sold at fixed prices for special coupons. The prices of sugar  and alcoholic beverages will remain free from government  intervention.    Describing the proposed monetary union between Belarus and  Russia as a "salvation," Kebich said the opinions of its  opponents, Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, could not prevent  relevant documents from being signed.    "Effectively we are in a ruble zone even now," Kebich said.  He said CIS countries used Russian rubles in their mutual  transactions.    "For example, Kazakhstan is ready to sell us wheat for  Russian money," Kebich said.    "We've reached the peak of the crisis, after which we'll  start living better," he said.</p>

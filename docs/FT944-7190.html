			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Danone acquires controlling stake in Argentine group Danone, France's largest food group, yesterday took a significant step in its strategy of expanding in South America, announcing it was paying USDollars 240m for a controlling stake in Bagley, an Argentine biscuit manufacturer. Under the terms of the agreement, which gives Danone its first foothold in Argentina, the French group is to take a shareholding of just over 50 per cent in Bagley. The Argentine company, founded in 1864, has more than 30 per cent of the country's biscuit market. It has an annual turnover of about USDollars 300m, 80 per cent of which comes from biscuit sales. The company's principal brands include Criollitas, Traviata and Kesitas. It has two production sites, in Buenos Aires and in San Luis. According to Danone, the Argentine biscuit market is the most dynamic in Latin America, expanding by 11 per cent in 1993. In terms of size it is second to Brazil, where Danone is present in biscuits and yoghurt products. Yesterday's deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions by the French group, which is seeking to expand its presence in Asian and American markets and in fast-growing sectors. In May, when the group said it was changing its name from BSN, it announced that it was taking a 49 per cent stake in Campineira de Alimentos, the Brazilian biscuit group, establishing a dairy joint venture in Russia, and raising from 24 per cent to 100 per cent its holding in San Miguel, the Spanish brewer. Danone has subsequently expressed interest in acquiring the Colman's food and drinks businesses of Reckitt and Colman of the UK. A spokesman for the group said that it was not necessary to raise fresh capital for the acquisition of Bagley. He said that the gearing level of the company was about 25 per cent, based on net debts of FFr11bn (Dollars 2.06bn) at the end of June. Annual cash flow at Danone is about FFr3.5bn.</p>

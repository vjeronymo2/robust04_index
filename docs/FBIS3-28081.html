			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Il-hwa from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Japan's TOKYO SHIMBUN reports that a North Korean  high-ranking naval officer was involved in the DPRK's purchase  of submarines from Russia. Accordingly, there is doubt whether  North Korea will really use them as scrap material. North Korea  had said some time ago that it was importing used submarines  from Russia to use as scrap metal. The paper reported today  that the Russian submarines which will be exported to North  Korea (?are anchored) at (?Novik) Bay in Vladivostok, and that a  North Korean high-ranking naval officer was involved in  negotiations between North Korea and Russia regarding submarine  transactions. The paper also reported that because of the North  Korean naval officer's participation in negotiations on  submarine transactions, there are doubts whether North Korea  will really use them as scrap metal as it stated.</p>

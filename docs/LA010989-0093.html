			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT TO REVIEW MO. ABORTION LAW;  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPT. ASKING PANEL TO REVERSE ITS LANDMARK '73 RULING  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, acting in an appeal urging reversal of its landmark 1973  decision that legalized abortion nationwide, today agreed to review a Missouri  law regulating abortions.  </P> <P> The justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling that struck  down key provisions of the state law.  </P> <P> Even before today's action in the appeal filed by Missouri officials, the case  had become the most-watched battleground in the continuing political war over  abortion. Justice Department lawyers also are urging the high court to use the  case as a means of undoing its 1973 ruling, called Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> Nothing in the brief order issued today suggested that the justices will  reconsider Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolve the Missouri  controversy without significantly changing the 1973 decision or other past  rulings on abortion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5 Key Provisions  </P> <P> The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals last July 13 struck down, among other  aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these five provisions:  </P> <P>  -- A ban on using public hospitals or other government-run facilities for  abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.  </P> <P>  -- A ban on any public employee's performing or assisting an abortion.  </P> <P>  -- A ban on using taxpayer money for "encouraging or counseling" women to have  abortions.  </P> <P>  -- A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to be older  than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to determine whether the fetus  is capable of surviving outside the womb.  </P> <P>  -- A declaration that "the life of each human being begins at conception."  </P> <P> </P> <P> '73 Decision Challenged  </P> <P> In the appeal acted on today, Missouri Atty. Gen. William L. Webster said the  8th Circuit Court's ruling "expands (Supreme Court) precedents in favor of  abortion on demand, further contracts the state's compelling interest in the  life of viable, unborn children and disregards this court's holdings that  abortion is a private matter which government need in no way subsidize."  </P> <P> The 1973 decision "should itself be reconsidered" if it cannot be squared with  the disputed Missouri law, Webster said.  </P> <P> William Bradford Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department's civil rights  division, wrote to Missouri officials last summer urging them to include a  challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state's appeal.  </P></p>

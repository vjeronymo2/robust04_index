			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Motorway tolls 'could reap Pounds 700m a year' Bus fares may rise following a budget change that will increase bus companies' fuel bills. When Mr Kenneth Clarke put 3p a litre on petrol, he also announced that the bus fuel duty rebate, which usually compensates for such increases, would not be raised. London Buses estimated the move would add Pounds 3m to its costs in a year. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said it was like adding 2 to 3 per cent value added tax by the back door. 'This is a deplorable move which will drive yet more people off public transport,' he said.</p>

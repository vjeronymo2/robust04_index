			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Seven-year sterling issue for European Investment Bank The European Investment Bank (EIB) followed up Wednesday's Y50bn three-year offering yesterday with a Pounds 200m issue of seven-year eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield 5 basis points over the 7 per cent UK government bond due 2001. Syndicate managers questioned the timing of the issue, in view of Wednesday's sharp fall in the gilts market. Some reported subdued demand for the bonds and predicted that they would struggle in secondary market trading. However, the EIB and lead manager BZW said the recent fall in the gilt market had little impact on the issue. Indeed, the EIB said its bonds had benefited from the better tone in gilts yesterday. BZW said most of the demand came from continental European retail and institutional investors, attracted by the current coupon of 8.5 per cent and the significant discount to par. The EIB had also taken advantage of the lack of supply in the seven-year area. 'Because of the low level of swap spreads in the eurosterling market, there have not been any issues with a seven-year maturity this year,' BZW said. The EIB said the funds raised from the issue will be on-lent to projects in the UK. About 90 per cent of the EIB's sterling borrowings this year have gone back into the UK. Ontario Hydro tapped the short end of the Canadian dollar curve, raising CDollars 350m through an offering of two-year eurobonds. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 20 basis points over two-year Canadian government bonds, was seen to be fair, although some syndicate managers thought the issue was too large given its orientation towards retail investors. Joint lead manager Nomura said the wide differential between yields on Japanese and Canadian government bonds and the view that the yen was close to its peak made these bonds attractive to Japanese investors. Two-year Canadian government bonds currently yield around 8 1/4 per cent, compared with around 2.60 per cent on Japanese government bonds with the same maturity. Nomura reported a strong take-up from its regional offices while ScotiaMcLeod, the other joint lead, expected the balance to be placed in Europe over time. Soon after the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened out to around 23 basis points. Elsewhere, Morocco is believed to have asked several investment banks, including Paribas, Salomon Brothers and two other US houses, for advice about a possible return to the international bond markets following the rescheduling of its foreign debt last year. The country is thought to be interested in raising between Dollars 100m and Dollars 200m through a eurobond or a Yankee bond issue, or failing that, by means of a private placement. The maximum maturity would be five years, although three years was more likely to appeal to investors. Bankers said Morocco's debt had traded well since the restructuring and investors with holdings of emerging market debt were keen to diversify away from Latin American paper, but the difficult conditions in the international bond markets and the volatile situation in Algeria could hamper Morocco's return. A further disadvantage was that Morocco did not have a credit rating, although it might well seek one in the near future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 5 January (MTI) -- Hungarian Minister of  Defence Lajos Fur, in an interview in the breakfast television  program "Napkelte" (Sunrise), said he is unable to fulfil the  request of the opposition, namely to refrain from implementing  changes in the army leadership until the elections. Fur said  there is a valid measure which he wishes to observe, whereby  soldiers reaching the age of 55 should be pensioned off. This  rule will affect three or four generals until by the time of the  elections.    The minister did not mention names, however, Colonel-General  Kalman Lorincz, commander of the Hungarian Army, will turn 55 in  February, 1994. A decision on relieving him will be made by the  president of the republic, on proposal by the minister of  defence, as is set down in the Defence Law which came into force  on January 1. The new Defence Law also sets down that one  person can fulfil the positions of commander and chief of staff.  Observers believe that Lieutenant-General Janos Deak, the  current chief of staff of the Hungarian Army, would fulfil these  two functions in the future.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE FUND DRIVE TOPS $100,000  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge's six-week athletics fund-raising drive ended Thursday  with its mission accomplished -- barely.  </P> <P> When pledges and checks were added, the sum was $100,910 -- a little more than  the $100,000 goal -- but significantly more than had previously been raised by  the school for athletics.  </P> <P> And that figure could grow. Several four- to five-digit pledges are still to be  collected.  </P> <P> "When we hit close to 60 (thousand) last year I was drained," said Ran Railey,  CSUN's director of athletic development. "But this year I know there's more out  there. It's just a matter of going out and collecting and talking to a few more  people."  </P> <P> Ballooning along with the school's athletic scholarship fund was the enrollment  in CSUN's Athletic Assn. Membership swelled from 310 to more than 500 during  the drive.  </P> <P> Donations were taken for the general athletic fund but they could be earmarked  for specific sports. Railey said that football, soccer and track appeared to be  the big winners.  </P> <P> Almost $28,000 was raised by phone solicitation of parents of athletes, alumni  and others.  </P> <P> "The phone-a-thon was a gold mine for us," Railey said. "This is the first year  we've done anything serious like that. I guess it proved we should do even  more."  </P></p>

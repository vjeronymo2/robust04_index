			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa indirectly acknowledged Wednesday [19 January] that a  large portion of the 100 million yen payment in 1982 which he  claims was a loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin  trucking firm was to secure his election funds for a Kumamoto  gubernatorial election one year later. Hosokawa made the  remarks at a meeting of the House of Councillors Special  Committee on Political Reform.    Responding to a question from Liberal Democratic Party  member  Minao Hattori about 77 million yen of the 100 million yen from  Sagawa Kyubin, Hosokawa said the money "was not directly for  election," but that he "had to secure my own assets to prepare  for the gubernatorial election."    On the use of the 77 million yen, Hosokawa had said he used  the money to purchase a condominium in central Tokyo. As for  the remaining 23 million yen, the premier has said he used the  money to repair the front gate and wall of his residence in  Kumamoto, western Japan.    Hosokawa has said he repaid the loan by January 31, 1991,  using part of his retirement allowance, after stepping down as  governor of Kumamoto, in addition to using the proceeds from the  sale of a plot of land in Tokyo.    Hosokawa served as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture for two  consecutive terms from 1983 until February 1991.    Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, one of the Sagawa Kyubin Group firms,  was the central firm in the 1992 money-and-mob scandal. Former  kingpin Shin Kanemaru was forced to resign from politics after  admitting he had received 500 million yen in undeclared  donations from the firm.</p>

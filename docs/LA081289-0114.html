			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 23 JOIN BID FOR COUNCIL IN CITYHOOD ELECTION  </P> <P> Twenty-three candidates will compete for five city council seats in the Nov. 7  cityhood election for Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> The candidates include all five current members of the Laguna Niguel Community  Services District, an elected body that takes care of streets, lighting and  parks. The candidates also include seven of the 13 members of the Laguna Niguel  Community Council, an elected, advisory group to county government.  </P> <P> Friday afternoon was the deadline for filing for the election, in which Laguna  Niguel voters will decide if they want to become Orange County's 29th city. If  a majority of those voting punch the yes for cityhood option on their ballots,  a city council will also come into being.  </P> <P> The five persons receiving the highest number of votes will be elected to that  council but will take office only if the cityhood proposal passes.  </P> <P> Most south Orange County political observers predict an overwhelmingly  favorable vote by Laguna Niguel for cityhood. Opinion polls also have shown  strong voter sentiment for incorporation.  </P> <P> "I don't know of any group organized against cityhood," said Mike Walsh, one of  the candidates for the proposed city council. Walsh, who was at the registrar  of voters' office in Santa Ana as the 5 p.m. filing deadline approached Friday,  said he thinks that most Laguna Niguel residents want to become a city so that  they can better control development.  </P> <P> Paul Christiansen, a director of the Laguna Niguel Community Services District,  also predicted overwhelming voter support for cityhood. Christiansen, who is  among the 23 candidates for city council, said he had been "campaigning out at  shopping centers in Laguna Niguel, and I'd say that less than 1% of those I  meet are opposed to cityhood."  </P> <P> In the past two years, south Orange County has had a flurry of interest in  forming new cities. Last year voters approved cityhood for both Mission Viejo  and Dana Point. The proposal for cityhood narrowly lost last June in Laguna  Hills, which borders Laguna Niguel to the north.  </P> <P> Unlike the current Laguna Niguel situation, Laguna Hills had a community schism  over cityhood, with opposition coming primarily from the residents of Leisure  World.  </P> <P> Last month Laguna Hills pro-cityhood advocates were told by an official of the  Local Agency Formation Commission that they should wait until after the Laguna  Niguel election before attempting another try at cityhood. Residents in other  areas of south Orange County also will be watching the Laguna Niguel election  closely. If cityhood fails there, parts of the area could be annexed by nearby  cities.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel residents already are fuming over Dana Point's success in making  Monarch Beach a part of its incorporation into cityhood last year. Laguna  Niguel originally proposed inclusion of Monarch Beach within its borders.  </P> <P> There are two lawsuits pending that challenge Dana Point's right to the 1  1/2-mile coastal strip in Monarch Beach.  </P> <P> As proposed on the Nov. 7 ballot, the city of Laguna Niguel would be an inland  city, bordered by Dana Point on the south, Laguna Beach on the west, Mission  Viejo on the east and Laguna Hills on the north.  </P> <P> In addition to Christiansen, the other four incumbent members of the Laguna  Niguel Community Services District also filed for the proposed city council.  They are James F. Krembas, Larry A. Porter, Patricia C. Bates and Marc E.  Leever. Porter and Leever were appointed, rather than elected, to fill  vacancies.  </P> <P> Bates is also a member of the Laguna Niguel Community Council. In addition to  Bates and Walsh, the other community council members who filed for the proposed  city council are Thomas W. Wilson, Lynn P. Kentfield, Roger Lance, Eli Naffah  and Richard Steinhoff.  </P> <P> The other candidates who completed filing for the election were: Eddie Rose,  Neil Burns, Abel Armas, Dennis W. Fletcher, E.J. (Jim) Hinkson, Daniel Jeffrey  Cohen, Wilbur Davidson, Mark Goodman, Chris Devendorf, Maureen McManus, William  Thomas Doyle and Frank E. Hotchkiss.  </P></p>

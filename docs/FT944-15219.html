			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: GAN drops to FFr846m deficit at midway Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), the state-controlled French insurance group which is a candidate for privatisation, yesterday reported losses of FFr846m (Dollars 159.92m) for the six months to June 30, compared with profits of FFr372m for the same period last year. Group revenues rose slightly to FFr63bn, against FFr62.3bn last time. The group's property financing subsidiary, Union Industrielle de Credit, saw its losses deepen to FFr925m from FFr30m in the first half of last year as a result of substantial provisions for a restructuring agreed earlier this month. GAN's domestic life assurance profits were down slightly at FFr344m, compared with FFr355m. However, its fire and accident insurance division reported a sharp increase in losses, to FFr736m from FFr403m. The group's banking unit, Groupe CIC, continued to grow, reporting profits of FFr328m against FFr257m. These were the first results to be presented by Mr Jean-Jacques Bonnaud, who was appointed head of GAN at the end of June by the government, in succession to Mr Francois Heilbronner. Mr Bonnaud said the losses reflected a number of exceptional factors, including a deterioration in casualty insurance, a reduction in realised gains, a series of provisions and the restructuring of UIC. Mr Bonnaud said the situation should improve in the second half, although he warned that 'a return to profitability by the end of the year is not on the cards'. He conceded that losses were likely to delay prospects for privatisation, although his objective was to prepare GAN for sale 'with the shortest possible delay'. GAN is one of 21 state-owned groups slated for sale by the government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.</p>

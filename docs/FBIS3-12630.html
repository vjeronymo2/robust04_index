The public relations office of the Ministry of Commerce  reports that based on a joint proposal from the Ministry of  Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a committee will  soon be formed to study the Islamic Republic of Iran's  membership in GATT. This committee's duties include a careful  study of the pros and cons of GATT membership and its likely  consequences, appropriate recommendations, proposals and  policies to reduce the negative consequences of membership or  nonmembership, identifying the political and legal obstacles and  problems with membership or nonmembership in GATT and  coordinating the utilization of GATT's technical and specialist  resources.    Some of Tehran's newspapers have recently vigorously opposed  Iran's membership in GATT, and have seen it as a factor in the  destruction of the nation's production units. In a series of  harshly critical articles under the title "Consequences of the  GATT Agreement for Developing Nations," the newspaper RESALAT  questioned this organization's goals and wrote: "It appears that  ultimately GATT has targeted the economic independence of the  developing nations. If these nations submit to the GATT  agreement, it will damage their economic independence, which is  the foundation of their political independence and sovereignty,  and the developing nations will become second-class members of  the global village."    On the other hand the Institute for Trade Studies and  Research recently published a book called Understanding  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and a Study of  the Consequences of the Islamic Republic of Iran Becoming a  Member. Esfandiar Omidbakhsh and Mas'ud Taromsari, the  book's authors, write concerning the long-term consequences of  membership: "Iran's economy is in a state of transition and we  are in the phase of testing the effects of structural  adjustments on the nation's overall economy and trade. We are  still a long way from reaching an established and fully formed  economic system. Yet membership in GATT is basically a long-term  cycle and every nation desiring membership in this organization  must make decisions in this regard in terms of its long-term  economic and trade objectives. Therefore, the proper procedure  for studying the issue of GATT membership for a nation such as  ours, which does not have firm programs and policies--and, of  course, this is a characteristic of a period of transition--must  certainly be based on a long-term view."    The authors of the aforementioned book add: "An important  point is the question of what state our economy will be in after  this period of transition is over. What characteristics will our  economic structure have? In essence, Iran's foreign trade  structure in the years following the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, despite controls and deregulation, has more or less  followed the same pattern that was followed in the country  during the previous three decades. We have not yet succeeded in  making proper use of foreign trade as a tool for industrial and  economic development...therefore with this kind of foreign trade  structure, in the long term GATT membership will not benefit the  country that much."</p>

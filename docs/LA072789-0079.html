			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFFLUENT WOMEN TWICE AS LIKELY AS POOR TO HAVE CESAREAN BIRTHS  </P> <P> Affluent women are nearly twice as likely to have their babies delivered by  Cesarean section than are poor women, a study of 245,854 births in Los Angeles  County has found.  </P> <P> Women whose median household income was greater than $30,000 had a 22.9% rate  of first-time Cesarean sections, compared to 13.2% among women whose household  income was less than $11,000, the study reported today in the New England  Journal of Medicine. Overall, the rate was 17.8%.  </P> <P> The discrepancy in part reflects doctors' fears that affluent patients will sue  them if there are problems involving vaginal deliveries, according to one of  the UC Berkeley researchers who conducted the study. "I think that physicians  are under tremendous pressure from very articulate patients and also from the  threat of litigation," said Dr. Jeffrey B. Gould, professor and chairman of  maternal and child health at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health.  </P> <P> The disparity held up even when the researchers took into account age,  ethnicity, race, previous pregnancies, the baby's birth weight and whether  there were complications reported during labor. Indeed, a third of the Cesarean  births occurred in women whose doctors reported no complications at all, the  study found.  </P> <P> The report represents another indicator of what has been a widely acknowledged  problem in recent years, unnecessary Cesarean sections in the United States.  The rate skyrocketed from 5.5% in 1970 to 24.1% by 1986. In California, it was  24.5% in 1986.  </P> <P> Ralph Nader's Public Citizen Health Research Group, which has studied the issue  in depth, estimates an optimal Cesarean rate at 12%.  </P> <P> The latest study was done to try to shed light on "this topsy-turvy result of  affluent women who are supposed to be more healthy requiring more in the way of  medical intervention," Gould said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Specific on Reasons  </P> <P> Gould and co-authors Becky Davey and Randall S. Stafford were not specific in  their report about possible reasons for the socioeconomic differences in  Cesarean rates. In an interview, however, Gould suggested that the primary  reasons are doctors' fear of malpractice suits and delayed childbearing by  "yuppie" patients who are more inclined to sue if a birth goes wrong.  </P> <P> Although Cesarean operations increase the chance of infection and death in the  mother, in some situations they reduce the chance of damage to the baby during  birth.  </P> <P> "The norm among affluent women is to have as good a baby as possible, not to  take any risks. You wait this long to have a baby, you want the best possible  outcome," Gould said.  </P> <P> In addition, poor patients are more likely to deliver at a teaching hospital or  at a hospital with few resources, he said. Both are environments with positive  reinforcement for avoiding unnecessary surgeries.  </P> <P> A Times analysis last year found that 41 hospitals in California had Cesarean  rates higher than 30%, with these high rates more likely at hospitals serving  affluent patients. The lowest rates were at teaching hospitals, which often  employ second opinions, and in health maintenance organization hospitals. For  example, County-USC Medical Center had a 13.6% rate in 1986 and Kaiser  Foundation hospitals had rates ranging from 14% to 24%.  </P> <P> Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe of the Public Interest Health Research Group said he lays  more blame on the fact that, except in a situation such as Kaiser's, Cesareans  make more money for both physicians and hospitals.  </P> <P> Wolfe said he has confidence in the Gould study's results, but said he wishes  the researchers had used other available data to point out specific reasons for  the socioeconomic differences in Cesarean rates and to recommend remedial  action.  </P> <P> Gould does have advice for women who want to avoid unnecessary Cesarean  sections: "You should go deliver at a facility, or engage an obstetrician, who  requires a second opinion prior to a Cesarean section; where there is a very  clearly defined set of criteria for those circumstances that require a Cesarean  section, and where every case is reviewed by a panel of nurses and physicians."  </P> <P> These measures have been shown to reduce a hospital's excess Cesarean rate, he  and Wolfe agreed.  </P> <P> CESAREAN RATES  </P>

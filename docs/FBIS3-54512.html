Let us  now talk about other important articles in the document that  still concern the presidential body.    Article 8 says that the head of state will be sworn in  before  the higher institutions of the nation, in accordance with the  provisions of Articles 72 and 73 of the Constitution. The head  of state will have to declare his commitment to devoting himself  to the implementation of the contents of this document.    Article 9 says that the duty of the head of state is  incompatible with the exercise of any public or private  functions, even if they were electoral. [sentence as heard]  This duty is also incompatible with any responsibility within a  political party or association.    The other important article concerns the powers and  prerogatives of the head of state. These remain almost as they  appear in the Constitution: He is the supreme commander of all  the Armed Forces of the republic; he is in charge of national  defense; he decides and steers the country's foreign policy; he  chairs the Council of Ministers [the prime minister chairs the  council of government]; he appoints and dismisses the head of  government -- this is also a very important point -- he signs  presidential decrees and appoints people to civilian and  military posts in the state apparatus, and so on.    The other article that has been heavily amended concerns the  transitional National Assembly. The participants have  unanimously endorsed these amendments, particularly with regard  to the membership and number of seats. Thus, the number of  seats in the transitional National Assembly has been increased  from 180 to 200. These seats will be divided among the groups  that had been invited to the national conference of consensus  according to the following proportions: 15 percent will be  reserved for representatives of state institutions and the  remaining 75 percent [as heard] will be equally divided among  the political parties and the other social forces, including  associations and economic organizations. The installation of  the transitional National Assembly will take place within three  months. I apologize for my mistake: I meant the remaining 85  percent.    [Announcer] There is also the issue of the commitments,  which  had appeared in the preliminary documents and which now seem to  have been changed into "the general policy resolution."    [Correspondent] Yes, these commitments, as they had appeared  in the text of the document, have been incorporated into a  general policy resolution. Among these commitments, which have  now appeared in a general policy resolution, the participants  pledge and call for the preservation and consolidation of  national unity, by respecting the republican and democratic  character of the state; respecting the principles of Islam,  which is the religion of the Algerian state, the pillar of  society, and the basis of the personality of the Algerian  people; respecting the Arabic language and promoting it since it  is the national and official language of the Algerian nation;  entrenching multiparty politics as a method of organization and  political expression and a framework for alternating power;  respecting individual and collective liberties and promoting and  consecrating these liberties; respecting the Amazighi [Berber  language and culture] and promoting it since it is an integral  part of the national identity, alongside Islam and Arabism;  rejecting violence as a means of political expression or a means  to come to power or stay in power; refraining from using  religion for party propaganda purposes; and refraining from  using state resources, official institutions, and places of  worship for party purposes.    These commitments have remained almost as they were. The  only change is that they have been removed from the text of the  document, i.e. the document on national consensus, to be  incorporated into a general policy resolution.    I would like to remind the listeners that the parties that  boycotted the conference have boycotted it because they have  declared their readiness to contribute and take part in the  dialogue which, they are saying, will be starting soon. This  dialogue is supposed to really start at the beginning of the  transition period, according to the resolution issued by this  conference.    As regards the parties that initially took part and later  pulled out, they have said that they will participate in the  dialogue when it starts. However, in the light of the changes  introduced to the presidential body, public opinion would like  to know who the next head of state is going to be. The  amendment introduced to the presidential body is somewhat an  indication. But the question remains very important and public  opinion is waiting for a reply because time is running out and  the end of the month is near [when the term of office of the  Higher State Council ends].

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Paris certain farm talks will reopen FRANCE confidently expects the EC to reopen negotiations with the US on Blair House, the farm trade accord reached last November, when foreign and agriculture ministers of the Community meet at a special council in Brussels on September 20. Mr Jean Puech, French agriculture minister, said yesterday after meeting Mr Andre Bourgeois, farm minister of Belgium, which currently holds the EC presidency, that 'we are confident our position has now been understood'. However, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, warned France yesterday that its rejection of the EC-US farm trade deal risked blocking the Gatt Uruguay Round of world trade reform talks in Geneva. 'The Blair House agreement will not be reopened, in the view of the federal government,' he said after talks with Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister. Only if France could prove that the deal went beyond the agreed EC farm reforms would Germany be prepared to consider ways of finding a compromise, Mr Rexrodt said. Nonetheless, Mr Puech was adamant yesterday that the alternative to reopening the deal was 'a useless crisis in the Community'. He reiterated France's threat to exercise a veto which would wreck any chance of concluding the overall Gatt talks by their December 15 deadline. The minister underlined that 'France does not want this.' Mr Puech refused to confirm the accounts of senior officials from other EC member states that France had entered direct talks with the US on improving Blair House and the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round. These officials and senior Commission officers say that the French government, Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, and Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, have all been in negotiations with Washington to get a form of words on agriculture and other chapters of the Uruguay Round acceptable to France. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, is to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Washington on Monday in what officials say may be a critical part of these negotiations. Mr Puech said 'we have to change Blair House,' but on further questioning modified this to mean 'to complete and interpret' the farm trade accord. The European Commission has said that there can be no reopening of the accord. At the September 20 meeting, therefore, France needs the unanimous support of its partners if it is to go back into the detail of the deal, rather than try to improve it through side agreements.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shefqet Rexhepj on news conference given by </F> Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, in  Prishtina on 25 February: "We Do Not Want the Logic of Yalta To  Be Repeated"]    [Text] Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of  Kosova, began yesterday's news conference in Prishtina by  welcoming U.S. President Clinton's statement, which included the  question of Kosova and its settlement, as well as the issue of  repression in Kosova, as part of the package on the Bosni  ultimatum. This is very important, Ibrahim Rugova said, because  it means that Kosova is not being forgotten and will not be left  to one side in the context of the overall settlements that will  be achieved. He then returned to everyday life in Kosova, which  is extremely difficult and fraught with severe repressions, as  we see in the draconian sentences meted out to dozens of  Albanians, totalling hundreds of years, as in the trial the day  before yesterday in Prishtina.  <H5>  The Academy Exists for Us and the World </H5>   Unfortunately, the now familiar process of political show  trials, that has left behind such scars and trauma, is still  continuing in Kosova. Everything is being done in order to  discredit our peaceful movement of nonviolent resistance and to  erode the sympathy we enjoy in the world, a sympathy that will  contribute to a peaceful solution of the problem of Kosova. We  repeat these things in order to make clear the true aim of this  smear campaign, which will not have any success. Ibrahim Rugova  went on to mention the closure of the premises of the Kosova  Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Serbian police's  confiscation of its assets. We have nevertheless decided that  the academy will continue its work. For us and for the world,  the Kosova Academy still exists, and is linked with many world  academic institutions and universities.    Raids on Kosova villages are continuing as ever, such as in  the communes of Istog, Kline, Ferizaj [Urosevac], Shtime,  Lipjan, Fuse Kosove [Kosovo Polje], Malisheve, Peje [Pec],  Skenderaj [Srvica], Vushtrri [Vucitrn], and Kacanik. This  repression has been continuing particularly in the communes of  Kline, Podujeve, and Mitrovice, and its purpose is both to shake  the Albanians' out of their convictions and to harm them  economically. Repression is continuing against political  activists and especially against schools and teachers. All this  is raising political tensions in Kosova, and we appeal,  President Rugova said, for preventive measures against  repression in Kosova.    Talking about the recent initiatives for a settlement to the  problems of the former Yugoslavia, Ibrahim Rugova said that  Yeltsin's initiative should not supplant a comprehensive  settlement, or replace a conference for the overall solution of  these problems which all sides would attend. We do not want the  logic of Yalta to repeat itself and prevail again in the  Balkans, especially in the former Yugoslavia. We do not want  the reappearance of various spheres of interest, which would  hamper tendencies both toward fragmentation and integration, or,  we would rather say, the process of reorganizing the Balkans. I  think that the Russian role in the Balkans should not be biased,  but should be on the basis of the international standards and  principles of the United Nations and European institutions.  Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome Sali Berisha's visit to  Brussels and his signature of the Partnership for Peace  agreement, which is a very important step for Albania's  integration in Europe and the protection of her security. I  also appreciate highly and welcome the report of UN special  envoy Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who devoted an entire chapter to the  general situation and the discrimination in Kosova.  <H5>  The Political Parties Are Not Closed to Any Class </H5>   Ibrahim Rugova went on to reply to various questions from  journalists. Asked what he thought of Albania's participation  in NATO's peacekeeping work, Ibrahim Rugova replied that this  would be a positive development, because Albania is a  geopolitically interesting country, not only for the Balkans and  the Mediterranean, but for Europe. Besides having a positive  effect on the Albanians, this would also help to balance forces  in the Balkans. Asked what he thought of the proposal to create  a Muslim-Croatian confederation in Bosnia and how this would  affect Kosova, Ibrahim Rugova said that Christopher had proposed  this, although it was present as a suggestion even before, when  unavailing efforts were being made to create a Croatian-Muslim  coalition. If Bosnia is divided on ethnic lines, then  confederations of various kinds will be possible. Meanwhile,  drawing parallels with Kosova, he said that the Albanian  political parties possess documents about the three well-known  options on the status of Kosova. Of course, confederations of  various kinds would be open to the Albanians too.    Asked about the role of the Coordinating Council of  Albanian Political Parties and his own personal role in  surmounting various kinds of polarization in Kosova, President  Rugova said that the Coordinating Council agreed about overall  issues in Kosova and the Albanian territories. There also  exists a council of the parties from all the Albanian  territories of the former Yugoslavia. Important decisions have  been made about the status of Kosova and the Albanians in other  areas. I myself have been involved in this council. Of course,  it should be more active. We have done a great deal of work on  issues in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM]. Both the council and I myself wanted a common  congress to be held in order to overcome divisions, but the  congress took place with various fractions. We must not  overdramatize this, because such things are possible in  political life. Political parties must be in the swim of  political events, rather than being self-involved. There must  be greater understanding. A common language must be found over  the most essential issues, on the basis of democratic  principles. I say democratic principles, even though this has  become a little stale, but I want to say on the basis of human  decency. Work should be done on the basis of agreement, because  there can be no political life without agreement. Meanwhile,  talking about some of the Albanians' political organizations, he  said that the Albanians are in favor of political organization.  I have repeated several times that we have set out to be a  political nation in the positive sense of the word, not a  politicized people, but a political people, which means that we  have an organized and guided political life. Of course, there  will be minor upheavals, but we must work on all issues on a  basis of understanding.    Asked what he thought of the return of former Kosova  politicians to the Kosova political scene, President Rugova said  that the former Kosova politicians had been present, and they  can make their contribution if they wish. They can involve  themselves in politics, because the political parties of Kosova  are not closed to any section of Kosova society. Meanwhile, in  reply to a question about what he thought of the recent trial,  at which the personalities of the Kosova leadership were  mentioned, Rugova said that it is not true that a defense  ministry exists, as was claimed, or any other ministry. Anton  Kola and even myself were mentioned at these political show  trials, but facts demonstrate that these are shams whose purpose  is to discredit the personalities of the Kosova Democratic  Alliance and the other Albanian political parties.  <H5>  Kosova Will Be Open </H5>   Asked whether talks with the Serbian side are expected soon,  Rugova said that there are no signs of talks. We have  attempted, he said, within the framework of the Geneva  Conference, to talk about various specific issues concerning  people's lives in Kosova, such as education and health, but we  achieved no success. Meanwhile, our standpoints are well known,  and of course Serbia too has its own views. Our stand is for an  independent and neutral Kosova.    This [passage illegible] I often mentioned, Ibrahim Rugova  went on to emphasize, that Kosova will be open to both Serbia  and Albania, and we must inevitably reconcile ourselves to this  fact. This would be the compromise of the Albanian side. We are  all burdened with the past, with Berlin Walls here in the  Balkans. I often say that Kosova will remain here and will not  go to the moon. It will be close to Serbia, to the Serbs, to  Albania, FYROM, ETC. Meanwhile, concerning the question of a  parallel according to ethnic lines in Bosnia and Kosova, Ibrahim  Rugova said that ethnic lines are valid for other people too in  the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans; asked whether these lines  would stretch to certain communes in southern Serbia, Rugova  made no comment.</p>

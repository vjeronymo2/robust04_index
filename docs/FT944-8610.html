			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / EU sets deadline for telecom liberalisation EU member states last night set a strict deadine of January 1, 1998 for completing the liberalisation of alternative telecommunications infrastructures. At a meeting in Brussels, industry ministers from the 12 EU members and the four due to join at the beginning of next year agreed on the deadline by which alternative infrastructures such as cable TV, road, rail and energy networks must be opened up to competition. But a further five-year delay to 2003 was granted to Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece. The EU move will allow companies offering telecom services a much greater choice of network provider, and should lower prices within Europe's still highly regulated telecommunications sector. The decision falls short of Commission ambitions to press ahead with liberalisation of infrastructures next year. A number of countries - Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Austria - were wary of moving so quickly, arguing that the necessary frameworks were not yet in place. The main advocates of swift liberalisation were the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and France. Brussels has made rapid deregulation of telecoms a priority in the belief that competitiveness of European industry relies on efficient, cheap and advanced communications services, which currently lag behind what is on offer in the US and Japan. Services other than basic voice telephony have already been liberalised. The problem is that in most member states, service providers are obliged to use the traditional, largely monopolistic, telephone networks. Only in the UK are networks entirely liberalised, with service providers free to build their own if they desire. The opening up of infrastructures to competition in 1998 will coincide with a shake-up of voice telephone services. Under a previous ministerial agreement, member states are not obliged to liberalise voice telephony before then. Meanwhile, the competition commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, said he may try to speed up liberalisation by using special powers to open cable TV networks to competition before 1998. He has proposed that the Commission force governments to end restrictions on cable TV networks under Article 90 of the Rome Treaty, which allows the Commission to take action without a vote from ministers. This move is unpopular and it is not yet clear whether the Commission would support Mr Van Miert.</p>

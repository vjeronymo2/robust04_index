			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SET FOR TURKEY IN DESERT, ASSAD MEETING;  </P> <P> MIDEAST CRISIS: THANKSGIVING WITH TROOPS DESIGNED TO BOLSTER HIS GULF POLICIES.  AND TV WILL BE THERE TO COVER IT.  </P> <P> President Bush arrived here Wednesday night preparing for a Thanksgiving Day  extravaganza designed to shore up support for his Persian Gulf policies, while  announcing plans to meet with Syrian leader Hafez Assad, whose past connections  with terrorism could undermine Bush's program.  </P> <P> Bush's Thanksgiving in the desert, complete with handpicked troops, stirring  backgrounds and network anchormen, is a carefully designed television  production that the White House hopes will increase public approval for the  face-off against Iraq.  </P> <P> Bush's schedule has been timed to the minute -- five minutes to talk, four  minutes to walk through the chow line, 25 minutes to eat -- all to allow him to  "go live" having turkey with the troops on network morning news shows at  precisely 8:15 Eastern time (5:15 a.m. Pacific time) Thanksgiving morning.  </P> <P> But even as his aides planned for this major public relations effort, Bush's  announcement that he will meet Friday with President Assad is likely to  complicate the image of his anti-Iraq campaign, given Assad's history of  support for international terrorism.  </P> <P> Government terrorism experts blame the Syrians for involvement in the  destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 two years ago and in the bombing of the U.S.  Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. The truck-carried bomb in the Beirut attack,  which killed 241 American servicemen, was most likely assembled in Syria and  driven through Syrian-held territory in Lebanon on its way to its fatal  destination.  </P> <P> The juxtaposition of the trip to the desert and the meeting with Assad  underline the contradictions that Bush must try to handle to keep both his  international and his domestic coalitions together.  </P> <P> U.S. officials insist that the meeting with Syria is necessary to maintain good  relations with a key ally in the fight against Iraq.  </P> <P> Syria, which borders Iraq on the north and west, has sent about 4,000 troops to  Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials believe that the endorsement of Assad, a militant  Arab nationalist, helps blunt Iraq's claim that only "Western imperialists"  support the campaign against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein over his invasion and  occupation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> At the same time, many polls have shown declining support for Bush's Persian  Gulf policy, and experts in public opinion say much of the problem is that many  Americans have difficulty seeing the conflict as a clear issue of right versus  wrong. Part of that problem is due to the unsavory reputations of U.S. allies  in the gulf conflict, most notably Assad, pollsters suggest.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, debate continued about when, and under what conditions, the United  Nations might approve a resolution giving the green light to the use of force  against Iraq.  </P> <P> Leaving Paris at the end of the three-day Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told reporters  that the U.N. Security Council should consider the "very dangerous"  developments in the gulf and "take a decision there."  </P> <P> But Gorbachev did not detail exactly what sort of decision he would like to  see.  </P> <P> French President Francois Mitterrand, also speaking in Paris, said he was in  general agreement with the Bush Administration's desire to see a Security  Council resolution approving force against Iraq but differed sharply from the  U.S. line in two key respects.  </P> <P> First, he said, a resolution could authorize the use of force, but "as far as  its actual implementation is concerned, this cannot be automatic" -- implying  that a second Security Council vote actually triggering military action would  be needed before any attack could be launched.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has been seeking a resolution that would approve the  use of force in advance and leave the United States free to decide for itself  the timing of any action.  </P> <P> In addition, Mitterrand indicated that France would not participate in a  military action without an explicit U.N. resolution. Bush and his advisers  argue that although a resolution would be good to have, military force can be  used even if the United Nations does not act as part of Kuwait's right to  summon other nations to assist it in "self-defense."  </P> <P> "Mr. Bush said to me, 'Do you think that we need to adopt a new resolution  within the Security Council which would authorize the eventual use of force?' I  told him yes," Mitterrand said.  </P> <P> All that left Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has been traveling the  world seeking to line up Security Council votes for a resolution, somewhat  vague.  </P> <P> "It is an ongoing process, and we are in the process of continuing that  process," Baker said when asked by reporters in Jidda about what stage the  consultations had reached.  </P> <P> Baker plans to meet today with officials in Yemen, a member of the Security  Council and a pro-Iraq neighbor of Saudi Arabia, and will travel Saturday to  Colombia, also a member of the council, to consult with that nation's foreign  minister.  </P> <P> The Administration is hopeful that the Security Council can complete work on a  resolution sometime next week, before the United States loses its chairmanship  of the council Nov. 30 in the normal rotation. But some diplomats at the United  Nations have said that timetable may be overly optimistic. Baker was typically  elliptical when asked about the timing of a resolution. "This is the 22nd of  November, and November has 30 days," he said.  </P> <P> Baker spoke to reporters in Jidda after Bush held a dinner and a 1-hour,  45-minute meeting with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. That meeting, and a similar  brief talk with Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, the exiled emir of Kuwait,  constituted the only diplomatic business on Bush's Saudi Arabia agenda, most of  which will be taken up with the televised Thanksgiving Day dramatics with the  troops.  </P> <P> The preparations for that visit, particularly the needs of U.S. television  networks, have consumed both U.S. military authorities and Saudi government  officials over the last week.  </P> <P> Here, for example, the city's most visible landmark is a huge fountain that  shoots a plume of water into the air the length of a football field. Normally,  a Saudi official said, the fountain is turned off at night during winter  months, but the government agreed to keep it running so that NBC-TV could use  the dramatic sight as a backdrop for its correspondents.  </P> <P> Those same considerations have been very much at the center of the White  House's planning for Bush's Thanksgiving trip. Access to Bush's visit has been  tightly restricted for reporters who might ask too many questions of the  troops, but arrangements for televised coverage of Bush's remarks have been  made on a large scale.  </P> <P> After meeting with the troops, Bush plans to leave Saudi Arabia en route to  Cairo tonight and is scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak  there Friday before flying on to Geneva for his meeting with Assad. Bush is  expected to return to the United States early Saturday morning, only to leave  again on Monday, this time for a two-day trip to Mexico.  </P> <P> Asked if he is at all uncomfortable about the meeting, given Assad's record on  terrorism, Bush said he had "no problems sitting down with him" to discuss "our  common objectives in the gulf."  </P> <P> "It's important that this coalition stay together," Bush said. "It's important  that everybody that's a part of it feel a part of it."  </P> <P> Many experts on the Middle East, however, have warned that the United States,  in trying to get closer to Assad, may be on the verge of making the same sort  of mistake with Syria as U.S. officials made with Iraq during the 1980s.  </P> <P> "We looked the other way when we knew that Iraq was carrying out a terrorist  operation," Vincent M. Cannistraro, a recently retired CIA official, told  reporters Tuesday in Washington.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the meeting was "not initiated by  either" Bush or Assad but was arranged by other leaders in the region.  Administration officials say the President was urged to meet Assad by Mubarak  and by Turkish President Turgut Ozal, whom Bush met Tuesday in Paris.  </P></p>

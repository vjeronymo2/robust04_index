Defense Ministry units were deployed in  Tbilisi and carried out a number of single-minded measures  immediately against the Security Ministry employees; in  particular, they detained without any grounds two operational  vehicles armed with special equipment and the employees sitting  in the vehicles. They confiscated the employees' duty arms and  uniforms. They physically assaulted the employees, one of them  by the defense minister himself. One truck was also detained.    Additional Defense Ministry forces were ordered to occupy  two  adjacent Security Ministry buildings and deployed at the  military academy.    A blast took place at 0437 [0137 GMT] 25 December on the  Security Ministry gruonds. A large amount of explosives was  detonated and two Security Ministry employees were wounded, one  seriously.    Extensive material damage was sustained: the Security  Ministry buildings, the military academy, the  hydrometeorological center, and some adjacent buildings, as well  as some special operational equipment and private cars were also  damaged.    In connection with the blast, the Procurator's Office of the  Republic of Georgia has launched a criminal investigation.    The Security Ministry of the Republic of Georgia is  appealing  to the head of state, parliament, the government, and the  general population to condemn such single-minded provocative  actions aimed at the special service. Moreover, the ministry  wants to give this instance a political qualification and charge  the organizers of the illegal actions with criminal  responsibility. The ministry says that this action was directly  or indirectly intended to interfere with the Security Ministry's  work in combatting crime at this critical stage of Georgia's  statehood.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by PRENSA LATINA contributor Jose dos </F> Santos: "Cuba-Mexico: The Path Is Made as We March.  Cuban-Mexican Relations Face a Very Complex, but Also  Promising, in More Than One Way, Future"]    [Text] Havana -- Passing over hurdles and skirting  stumbling blocks and snares, Cuba and Mexico have consolidated a  relationship that, due to its duration and fruitfulness, is  unique: above empty rhetorics, the times, differences in  projects, foreign pressure, and circumstantial emergencies.    Forefather Benito Juarez' expression "peace is the fruit of  the respect shown for the rights of others" had shaped the  already lengthy period that began when Mexican President Adolfo  Lopez Mateos refused to break relations with Cuba when the rest  of the Latin American governments obeyed an order to that effect  from Washington.    At that moment, the already excellent relations ascended to  that of exceptional relations, and this was the diamond that  topped the tiara of a historic phase of respect for Cuba's  decision to take its own road in exercise of the principle of  self-determination, and the Mexican decision served as a lesson  and example for others who, in due time, decided to follow suit.    This recounting is timely in view of the visit to Cuba by  Mexican President Carlos Salinas, the fourth Mexican president  who by his visit, a very brief one, will endorse ties and  nurture feelings that transcend authorities and promote a sense  of brotherhood and not just unite neighboring nations.    Salinas' visit upholds a tradition that was initiated by  Luis  Echeverria in August 1975 and preserved by Jose Lopez Portillo,  in July 1980, and Miguel de la Madrid in 1981. On those  occasions, the rejection of the isolation the United States  wants to impose on the Cuban process was made evident.    Today's situation is more complex for the two nations: Cuba  is enduring an intensification of the blockade that has  compounded a crisis produced by the vanishing traditional and  unfaltering trade partners. Mexico is facing a massive process  of integration with two big economic powers, one of which is  Cuba's main antagonist.    Domestically, Mexican authorities are facing what is,  perhaps, the most rickety election process in its history, with  unprecedented political tension (the armed uprising in Chiapas  and the assassination of the presidential candidate of the  governing party, among others).    In this context, Salinas' visit to Cuba can be interpreted  as  a diplomatic gesture or, perhaps, as a tactic, or as an  expression of a more important and profound will.    The visit could represent all of this. The truth is that the  visit has come as a U.S. legislator, who has the airs of a  proconsul, has launched overseer-type demands against Mexico's  rights to self-determination the same way he headed the  anti-Cuban campaign in the U.S. Congress to make Cuba yield to  its particular vision of what democracy and liberty mean.    It could be the sight of stable and promising relations that  are unaffected by eventual problems have moved the industrious  inquisitor Robert Torricelli to aim his guns at a government  that definitely does not yield to blackmail despite powerful  economic commitments and remains firm to a tradition that has  overcome all types of pressure.  <H5>  Current Situation and Outlook </H5>   Salinas will find in Cuba a situation different from what he  found when he visited the island in March 1987 on the occasion  of the 6th Conference of Ministers and Chiefs of Economic  Planning of Latin America, when he was the Mexican Government's  programming and budget secretary.    Although the island's current economic situation is more  difficult than ever, Cuba's relations with Mexico during this  period have been most intense in the fields of cooperation,  investments, and cultural, sports, scientific and technological,  and educational ties, among others.    One recent example is the celebration of the 11th plenary  session of the Bilateral Business Committee, in which 50 Mexican  firms participated. This session strengthened the decision to  increase Cuban exports and promote negotiations capable of  benefiting trade between the two countries.    As Cuba imports food, chemical products, and raw materials,  Mexico buys tobacco, rum, marble, construction materials,  equipment, and products from the health and veterinary sectors.    Since the trade balance favors Mexico, the challenge of  increasing these relations is being met by balancing the  difference "through the creation of patrimonial interests," read  investments, by Mexican businessmen in Cuba.    Luis Miguel Porras, who was Mexico's commercial adviser on  the island until his recent death, reported that in 1993,  Mexican annual exports to Cuba, which in the 1980's had been for  $60 million or $80 million, reached a record high of $150  million.    Porras once told newsman Fernando Davalos that "Mexico is  interested in Mexican investors getting settled in Cuba because  as Cuba's agricultural, industrial, and services sectors  increase their activities and are able to export, the island  will be resolving its trade balance deficit."    This is why here there is talk about the possibility of  exporting to Mexico goods such as sea products, essential oils,  zeolite, citrus, and computer software, and about joint  productions, reestablishing industrial production using Mexican  raw material, and servicing markets from Cuba.    There is a hush about this because there are abundant  examples of how Washington's anti-Cuban paranoia and meddling  have worked to frustrate more than one important deal for the  two sides.    This is why it is not possible to give details about the  growing patrimonial links being established here by Mexican  businessmen whose interests are linked to the development of  Cuban products intended for Mexican markets. For example,  investments in tourism, such as Varadero's Tuxpan Hotel, and in  textiles and tourism.    The same diplomat said that there is work going on on  projects such as the refining of oil and mining and that there  are studies "for participating in the exploitation and  processing of nickel."    In some important operations, he said, it has become  necessary to consider the problem of the Cuban foreign debt (the  amount of which he did not report but that some believe is  around $400 million, peanuts compared to others that exist  throughout the world).    There is a tacit understanding on this between the two  countries. This has been confirmed by Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina. He has said: "There are many ways of resolving the  debt, and we are in no position to say which ways these are"  because "there is all sort of pressure" on whoever tries to  trade with Cuba.    In February, the Cuban foreign minister told LA JORNADA of  Mexico that he has "much evidence on how Mexico is capable of  overcoming pressure." He noted that "the situations of the  world, of Mexico, and Cuba are different."    Bilateral ties have checked facts that were not appreciated  here, such as President Salinas receiving Cuban  counterrevolutionaries, and episodes of boat people and of  persons who forced their departure from the country with illegal  actions.    Robaina would explain this in a few words: (With Mexico)  "there are exceptional relations, respect, and understanding..."    The fact is that beyond the ups and downs of politics there  is progress in projects in key sectors such as agriculture and  livestock, industrial, telecommunications, fisheries, and food  sectors and the importance of the recent visit by an significant  Mexican Parliamentary delegation to the island cannot be ignored.    It is almost commonplace to report that 90 Mexican sportsmen  have participated in eight disciplines in competitions held in  Cuba during the first four months of the year, that university  rectors from the two countries will meet in Mexico during the  second half of June, and that cities like Monterrey and Holguin  have become sister cities.    It is also commonplace to report that Foreign Secretary  Manuel Tello fully agreed with his Canadian counterpart in  condemning the U.S. blockade on Cuba, or that he told Warren  Christopher that the Cuban issue is one of the differences his  country has with the United States.    In a recounting of this we cannot fail to mention the  powerful and active movement of popular solidarity with Cuba in  Mexico, a movement that serves as a liaison for the breaking in  U.S. territory of the blockade against Cuba.    Cuban-Mexican relations are a very complex issue, but  promising, in more than one sense. This situation is endorsed  by those who, like colleague Luis Soto likes to say, no longer  fear U.S. Government threats and dare "pull the tiger's  whiskers," even if it gets angry.    One does not have to be a sorcerer to imagine how the White  House sees Salinas' visit to Cuba only a few weeks after William  Clinton raised the tone of his anti-Cuban discourse to almost  the regressive level of his predecessors. The Mexican gesture  will be interpreted in many ways, but it cannot fail to be seen  as a sign that Cuba and Mexico continue blazing a trail as they  march on.</p>

The  plant will serve 15 of the region's communes.    This plant, unique in France in many respects, aims at "zero  pollution." Once it goes into service--it is scheduled to begin  operations in late 1996--it will process each year about 100,000  tons of household waste "produced" by the 200,000 inhabitants of  the 15 communes that have joined in partnership under the  umbrella of an intercommunal syndicate headed by the deputy  mayor of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Mr. Michel Pericard.    Its standards for waste purification are 2 to 12 times as  strict as those currently required in France. "For some ejecta,  pollution levels are not even measurable today," said Mr.  Pericard. For example, even the water-vapor plume released  through the plant's smokestack will be eliminated with the help  of condensation equipment. "We have accepted a financial  sacrifice to obtain these results," admitted Mr. Pericard,  noting that the cost of waste processing would be 498 French  francs [Fr], versus Fr370 in the past.    Dubbed "Azalys," the project was developed by Novergie (a  part of the Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez economic interest group) at  a total cost of Fr355.8 million. It also takes special pains  with "final residues": the sludge that will be used in laying  road underpaving, and treated oven-smoke residues. Those  residues will be rendered "inert" before storage.    Described by Mr. Pericard as a "technological showcase," the  project was approved after 10 years of negotiations among the  region's communes and represents a step toward meeting the  target of eliminating all discharges of untreated waste by the  year 2002 set forth in legislation enacted on 13 July 1992.</p>

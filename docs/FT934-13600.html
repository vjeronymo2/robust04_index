			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Lottery bill wins final approval THE National Lottery Bill last night completed its passage through parliament, clearing the way for the first Pounds 1m prize draw to take place on schedule late next year or early 1995, David Owen writes. The bill now goes for royal assent some three months later than the government had originally hoped. Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, told MPs that in spite of this he was still hopeful that the first draw would take place on time. In last night's proceedings, MPs approved a Lords amendment enabling the Tote to take part in the lottery. Later Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, moved amendments aimed at preventing funds from the lottery reaching terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland. The amendments would close a loophole which might have allowed money to be channelled through seemingly respectable organisations to paramilitary groups, Mr Brooke said.</p>

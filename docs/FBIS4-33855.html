			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan de Dios Hernandez; from the "Telemetro </F> Reports" Newscast]    [Text] President Guillermo Endara will travel abroad and  will leave Vice President Guillermo Ford in charge of the Palace  of the Herons, in keeping with the Constitution and a decision  made during a Cabinet Council meeting.    The formal ceremony was held at the Presidency. President  Guillermo Endara placed the presidential sash on Vice President  Guillermo Ford, who will be president for 11 days. In the  presence of ranking officials of the three state branches, the  president said that he is leaving power in good hands as he  travels abroad.    [Begin Endara recording] These summits are perhaps the most  important international events that a president can attend,  because I will not only meet but also hold talks privately and  publicly with my colleagues from all of Latin America, Spain,  and Portugal. [end recording]    Endara will head for Costa Rica where he will fine tune  details of a proposal that he refused to elaborate on. He said  that it will be presented at the Fourth Ibero-American summit.  He will then travel to Cartagena de Indias where this summit  will be held on 14- 15 June.    Meanwhile, Guillermo Ford said that he will maintain the  country while Endara is abroad and added that he is indebted to  the Panamanian people.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Mr. President, what will be  done in these 11 days? What are your plans for this period?    [Ford] I do not want people to have exceedingly high  expectations because 11 days is a very short period. First, I  am responsible for maintaining peace and tranquillity in the  country. Second, I have a few programs that will benefit the  most needy classes. I prefer not to give details at this time  because we will be working on them this afternoon and tomorrow.  I want to create some optimism for the people. The best raw  material available to this country is its people. Thus, we must  offer them some benefits and the tools to help them take off.  [end recording]    Guillermo Ford, then, is occupying the presidency. He will  enjoy the same powers that the president has. After the fourth  summit, Endara will travel to Argentina along with Argentine  President Carlos Menem on an official visit.</p>

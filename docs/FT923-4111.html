			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Old suspicion of bureaucracies Le Vicomte Philippe Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon, UDF member of parliament for the Vendee. THE aristocratic Mr Philippe de Villiers, 43, comes from a traditionally Catholic corner of France, which has been conservative for hundreds of years. The Vendee fought against the French revolution and has ever since been suspicious of centralising bureaucracies, whether in Paris or in Brussels. Mr de Villiers plays on this tradition to the full and fulminated against Brussels 'technocrats' in the Figaro newspaper yesterday. Although he is a member of the centre-right UDF, Mr de Villiers is closer to the far right wing of the Gaullist party and campaigns for a Europe of loosely co-ordinating sovereign states, based on 'moral, religious and family values.' A former junior culture minister in the 1986-1988 Gaullist government, Mr de Villiers is also out for President Francois Mitterrand's blood. He has irritated even his own party leaders by calling on voters to use the referendum to oust the president, as they did when General Charles de Gaulle called a referendum on decentralisation in 1969. His style is aggressive and enemies accuse Mr de Villiers of using the campaign as much to further his political ambitions as to oppose Maastricht.</p>

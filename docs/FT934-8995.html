			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Burton shares slip on sales fall SHARES in fashion retailer Burton Group slipped 14 per cent in spite of the group's return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.5m against a loss of Pounds 800,000 last year. Although the group returned profits largely in line with expectations, analysts were disappointed at a decline in sales from the chain stores businesses in the second half. The shares were marked down 11p to 66 1/4 p. Profits were also held back by higher than expected exceptional costs for restructuring of Pounds 19.6m. This included a Pounds 5m loss on the sale of the sports chain Champion and a Pounds 14.6m charge for the reshaping. Mr John Hoerner, chief executive, said any return to Burton's former profit levels would be slow. 'I have always said it would take time,' he said. The introduction of a November budget was also less than helpful. 'We do not think it is a particular inducement to have a budget at this time of year,' he said. 'Apprehension is not a great emotion when you are trying to get customers wound up for Christmas.' Mr Hoerner said current trading was mixed, with the first 10 weeks showing sales down by 1 per cent. However, since the middle of September sales had been 1 per cent ahead of last year. The chief executive insisted that, given the tough trading environment and the group's determination to control discounting, 'I am not disappointed with these results.' Overall, Burton returned a 7 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 1.9bn for the year to August 28. Mr Hoerner blamed a second-half decline in the chain store division on 'trying to do something to our business in the worst possible environment'. There had also been a stronger than expected trend towards price competitiveness in the fashion market, he said. Gross margins declined for the year as a whole by 1.2 percentage points. The best performer was yet again the department store Debenhams, where sales rose 11 per cent to Pounds 854.4m. Profits were 82 per cent higher at Pounds 57.7m. Sales in the chain stores division grew more slowly, by 5 per cent to Pounds 1bn, with profits rising 20 per cent to Pounds 7.3m. The dividend was maintained at 1p, for an unchanged total of 2p. Earnings rose from 0.8p to 2.3p. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (2): Starting down a bumpy road to the market - After the fumblings of the Gorbachev era, Boris Yeltsin's government of young technocrats at last takes reform in hand YEGOR GAIDAR, Russia's dynamic young deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, deserves sympathy. Working with his team of equally young ministers, under the leadership of President Boris Yeltsin, he is engaged in perhaps the most difficult and ambitious programme of economic and social reform ever undertaken. Yet not only are the people at large sullen and the apparatchiks of the former regime volubly opposed; but even the small band of westernised intellectuals criticises the government at every turn. They complain of the failure to start structural reforms before price liberalisation; they complain of the failure to privatise housing; they complain of the failure to de-monopolise industry; they complain of the failure to sustain monetary coordination throughout the the former Soviet Union; and they complain of the harshness of the monetary squeeze. Soon they will convince the people that their difficulties are owed to the present government, not to its predecessors. Indicators of acute economic crisis They will not convince the government itself. As it told the International Monetary Fund in its Memorandum of Economic Policies of February 1992, 'by the beginning of this decade, the economy was in a state of acute crisis, marked by declining output, accelerating inflation, obsolescent capital stock, pervasive distortions in the relative price structure, serious structural imbalances, and severe ecological problems.' This is, if anything, an understatement. Russia is the largest remnant of a defeated and bankrupt empire. Of that there is one nigh on perfect indicator: so despised has the Soviet ruble become that at present market exchange rates, Russia's annualised gross national product in the first quarter of 1992 was smaller than Belgium's. Consider the government's short term inheritance: Falls in the former Soviet Union's measured gross national product of 4 per cent in 1990 and 13 per cent last year. External debt of over Dollars 80bn and virtually no foreign exchange reserves. Rapid declines during 1990 and 1991 in production and export of oil, Russia's most valuable single commodity. Real industrial wages up by over 20 per cent between 1987 and 1990, and by still more in 1991, if only on paper, despite falling productivity. Years of fiscal profligacy, culminating last year in a budget deficit for the Union of 20 per cent of GNP. A monetary overhang at the end of 1991 of large, but unknown dimensions. A debauched currency shared by 15 largely uncoordinated central banks. And a breakdown of economic relations among enterprises and, still more, among republics. No government would wish to start from here. But reform could hardly have started from anywhere else. Only the bunglings of the Gorbachev era could have made radical reform inevitable. How, other than in the name of perestroika, could the command system created by Stalin have been so thoroughly dismantled? Yet that very bungling makes successful reform exasperatingly difficult. For, as was the case in Poland in 1989, though to a still greater extent, the Russian government starts with a severe stabilisation crisis, itself a symptom of the breakdown of the Soviet state. As Mr Gaidar remarks with justified bitterness, 'we have had three years of strongly negative growth from 1988 to 1991. We paid for the absence of reforms: now we must pay for reforms. We cannot stand three more years of that: one year only (1992) is possible.' Mistakes should be judged with tolerance So bleak an inheritance means that the efforts of the government should be regarded with sympathy and its mistakes judged with tolerance. But it also offers a ray of hope: can a country so rich in resources, yet so extravagant in their waste, not do better? On 28 October 1991, President Boris Yeltsin, freed by the failed August coup from both the communist party and the Soviet government, announced a programme of radical reform focusing on economic stabilisation, financial reform and privatisation. Then, on 19 December the government approved the liberalisation of most prices, except only for a few staple foodstuffs (including vodka), energy (particularly oil) and housing. The decision to liberalise prices was, and remains, controversial. It violates, for example, the sequence recommended in the 500 day programme for radical reform put forward at the end of 1990 by a group headed by President Gorbachev's close adviser at that time, Stanislav Shatalin. That programme recommended starting with structural change, including radical privatisation, before price liberalisation. The government started with price liberalisation for four main reasons: Reduction in the huge budget deficit would be impossible if subsidies were not dramatically reduced. Shortages, queues, and grey and black marketeering were social cancers. Both greater competition and reductions in waste require sensible prices. The easiest thing for a government that wishes to show it means business is to stop doing things that are harmful, like controlling prices. Yet the best indication that formal price liberalisation is, indeed, not enough is the chaotic expansion of street trading that followed the government's controversial decree on freedom of trade. This was a crisis measure, which allowed people to take goods from the official distribution chain - be it by the front or the back door - and resell them. As a result, the pavements of Moscow now host one of the world's most densely thronged street bazaars. Surge in prices has eliminated queues As happened elsewhere, notably in Poland, prices rose by far more than expected: three and a half times in the first month even on official figures. The surge in prices has lowered the unrealistic official estimates of real incomes by 40 per cent. But it has also eliminated the shortages and queues that reflected not only the gap between wages and the value of output, but also the 'monetary overhang', or unspendable store of roubles. At the end of last year the stock of broad money (M2 on the Russian definition) was about 80 per cent of GDP. By the end of March 1992 that ratio had fallen to below a quarter. Inevitably, money became very short, particularly cash, the demand for which (at the present face value of the notes) surpassed the capacity of the four printing plants (all located in Russia): many workers have been told that there is no cash for their wages. Substantial progress has been achieved on the budget deficit. Mr Gaidar insists that in the first three months of the year the budget was balanced: the Ministry of Finance says there was a deficit of about 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product on an expenditure basis and 5 per cent on the basis of commitments, although international financial institutions suspect it may be over 10 per cent. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Finance has achieved something that has eluded most post-Communist governments: the establishment of a reliable source of revenue independent of profits in the state enterprise sector. Revenue from value-added tax has risen from Rbs10.5bn (roughly Dollars 80m at the market exchange rate) in January, to Rbs54bn in March. To this will soon be added taxation of both domestic consumption and exports of oil and gas as their prices are raised towards world levels. After initial difficulties in January, following the introduction of a new system of export taxation, export performance has also recovered. Postponement of the export taxes, introduction of a market exchange rate for hard currency and curtailment of administrative regulations reversed the decline in exports at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, rescheduling of payments of principal on medium- and long-term loans due in 1992 has saved Russia Dollars 11bn of the Dollars 21bn that comes due this year. The action so far has had a high, if predictable, price: industrial output is estimated by the government to have fallen by 13 per cent in the first quarter of 1992 below the level of a year before. The behaviour of Russian large enterprises has been similar to that in other post-communist countries. The failure of such large enterprises to respond in ways that would make sense in a market economy is the central problem of post-communist reform. The problem for government is that it can do almost nothing with these enterprises, but can also do little without them. Soaring debts The combination of price liberalisation with credit control has been greeted by higher prices, lower output, non-payment of debts due to other enterprises (with such debts soaring to some 20 per cent of GNP within a little over three months) and screams of anguish. The response has been made worse by the collapse in military expenditures. These were once somewhere between 15 and 25 per cent of Soviet GDP, but are now down to a mere 8 per cent of Russian GDP in the first quarter of 1992. The catatonia of the larger state enterprises is predictable. Since the 'reforms' embodied in the Law on State Enterprises of 1987, enterprises answer almost entirely to their managers and, still more, to their workers. Russia is no longer a country of 'state capitalism'. Yugoslav self-management is a more relevant parallel. The principal concern of such enterprises is with meeting their wage bills and preserving employment. In the short term, their behaviour can only be changed by starving them of money. But the problem with starving enterprises of money is that they are little more frightened of the government than it is of them. They, too, have a sanction: the social consequences of their own collapse. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, says he has noticed an encouraging shift in the petitions of the steady stream of enterprise managers he receives in his office in the former Gosplan state planning commission building in the centre of Moscow: they no longer assume he can help them with supplies, but want him to dole out cheap money. He claims he tells them to cut their prices, wages and staff, instead. Mr Nechayev also expects Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to sign a decree on bankruptcy. This will allow the government to force 10 or 15 companies into liquidation, he says: a small beginning, but an important demonstration to others of the consequence of failure. But can the government force, or even permit, more than a handful of enterprises to close, when the result will be huge increases in open unemployment? Inextricably linked to the behaviour of enterprises is that of wages. 'Given the rapid growth of wages in the material sphere in the latter part of 1991 and early 1992', says the government in its memorandum to the IMF, 'which risks fuelling inflation and may cause unnecessary unemployment, the government is prepared if necessary to introduce measures to prevent excessive growth in wages.' The chances are that it will have to. Here too, however the question is whether the government will be prepared to allow the bankruptcies that alone would make the envisaged wage tax effective. Macroeconomic control is, in fact, almost impossible without changes in the structure and ownership of enterprises. It is largely because of the scale of inter-enterprise indebtedness that the government has felt it necessary to authorise Rbs200bn in extra investment credits from the Central Bank of Russia over the next six months. Mr Nechayev has also put aside Rbs42bn to assist defence conversion and another Rbs40bn for social protection of displaced workers in the military sector (neither being very much, given the scale of the problems). Pressures from the economy (and the budget) are more likely to undermine monetary control than the widely discussed policy differences between the government and the central bank. Mr Gyorgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, for example, insists he has no fundamental disagreement with government. Mr Nechayev says that 'we don't fully believe in the top managers of the Central Bank, but if they resign now, it won't necessarily be better than if they stay.' Mr Gaidar himself now argues that the Russian economy needs to be 'remonetised'. Unfortunately, the monetary grease is to be provided by the central bank. The Central Bank of Russia is expecting an increase in the money supply of between 50 and 120 per cent this year. Some of that will come from monetisation of the budget deficit, expected by the government to be about 5 per cent of GDP. A credit line to the Ministry of Finance of Rbs67bn has just been established. Far more will come from the Rbs200bn promised to enterprises. Applying the multiplier of 2-2.5 on central bank credit deemed normal in Russia, the total credit expansion already agreed is Rbs700-850bn, or about 50 per cent of recent levels. Russia's central bankers do, indeed, tend to see their job as providing credit to the economy. The effect of the rate of interest on the willingness to hold money, for example, is outside their customary way of thinking. It was with reluctance, therefore, that the central bank was persuaded to raise its discount rate to over 50 per cent in early April, even though inflation was estimated at almost 20 per cent in March alone (an annual rate of over 700 per cent). With huge energy price rises in prospect, inflation is likely to continue at a torrid rate. Programme ahead The government's programme for the rest of the year and beyond covers: Privatisation by auction of small-scale shops and enterprises (now started in just a few cities) in 1992. Private ownership of land; privatisation of food production and distribution. De-monopolisation of industry; commercialisation of larger enterprises and their mass privatisation in 1993. Creation of an adequate social safety net. Further price liberalisation, including the raising of energy prices to world levels. Liberalisation of international trade. And resident convertibility of the rouble on current account. None of this will be easy. Some of it will be hugely difficult. Small scale privatisation is feasible and desirable. Privatisation of large scale enterprise will turn out to be far more difficult than the government imagines. If experience elsewhere is any guide, ministers will be driven to industrial policy, but will fail to make a success of it. Meanwhile, any safety net could be swiftly broken by a large increase in unemployment. Energy prices must be raised if the economy is to be more efficient (not to mention less polluting). The government has announced its intention to raise the of oil from Rbs350 price per tonne to between Rbs1,800 and Rbs2,200 and achieve parity with world energy prices by the end of 1993. Domestic taxation of oil and gas is expected to amount to 4.7 per cent of GDP and taxation of exports, largely of oil and gas, to 9.1 per cent of GDP in the last nine months of 1992, according to the government's February memorandum to the IMF. These taxes - up from very little in the first quarter of 1992 - will be paid by domestic consumers and, above all, by those in other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Offsetting subsidies or credits will be necessary, at least for a transitional period, if output is not to collapse. The planned convertible and fixed exchange rate will increase competition in the economy as well as provide a degree of monetary stability. Equally, the government is right to believe the present market exchange rate is highly undervalued. To give only one indication, at recent exchange rates of Rbs123-130 to the dollar, Russia's exports are almost as large as its GDP. Should the nominal rate not appreciate before it is fixed, the result will be real appreciation through domestic inflation. This is what has happened since December 1991. The real value of the market exchange rate for the cash ruble has appreciated more than six times, but only because of domestic inflation. Exchange convertibility demands monetary control and monetary control demands curbs on emission in other republics of the CIS. But this Gordian knot the government has decided to cut, by the simple expedient of making the rouble Russian. Key questions Nothing is easier than raising questions about the likely performance - or, indeed, survival - of the Russian government: Can a legal culture supportive of private enterprise be established in Russia's barren soil? How high might unemployment go and how well will Russians cope with it? Can Russia finance a politically and socially adequate safety net? Will it be possible to create the minimum needed cooperation over trade and payments among the main members of the CIS? Can small enterprises and farming be privatised quickly? Can large state enterprises be restructured and privatised and, if so, how much time will it take? How long will it be before economic growth resumes? How far can one rely on the patience of the Russian people? With IMF membership agreed, how soon will the West's Dollars 24bn be available and how much difference might it make? The questions come easily. So do criticisms. It is not true, for example, that there are no alternatives to what the government is trying to do. There are. But few offer anything other than disaster. This is at the least a dynamic and convinced reforming government, if one starting on a long and difficult road. It will need much help from abroad and much patience at home. It will need luck as well. But it offers a chance, inevitably no more, of what the world wants: economic recovery and political stability in Russia.</p>

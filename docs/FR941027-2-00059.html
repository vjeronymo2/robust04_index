The site is bordered by H Street to the North, I Street to the South, 5th Street to the West, and 6th Street to the east. The purpose of the new USCT-FB is to relieve overcrowded conditions at the existing court facilities in the City of Sacramento and to provide space for anticipated future growth. The proposed project is anticipated to be ready for occupancy in 1997&hyph;98. The existing courthouse facilities are too small to meet the year 2000 and 2020 space requirements. Additionally, the existing facilities do not meet guidelines for court facilities set forth in the ``U.S. Courts Design Guide'' (February 1993). Structural restrictions such as obstructing columns and inadequate ceiling heights prevent the use of full-size courtrooms in the existing facilities. There is not sufficient space in the current courthouse to accommodate an increase in the number of courtrooms and the configuration of courtrooms to meet the court design guidelines. In addition, security in and around the building is inadequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Criteria for Evaluating EIS Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of an alternative site involves the weighing and balancing of many complex, interrelated and often competing policy factors. An alternative superior to others in one environmental respect may be otherwise inferior in another. Several factors were of key importance in evaluating each of the alternatives. These are identified below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The first project criterion is to provide for the expansion of the federal courts in the Sacramento vicinity. Current facilities housed in the John E. Moss Federal Building-US Courthouse are insufficient. Leasing additional space to make up for the shortfall at the Moss Building would not be an efficient means of providing court space. Alternative project sites were therefore examined for their ability to meet existing court needs as well as their suitability for future expansion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The second project criterion is to promote local government redevelopment goals, which can often be greatly assisted by the implementation of large projects such as the high-profile federal building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The third project criterion is the minimization of adverse environmental effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The fourth project criterion is attractive location. Some sites are more attractive due to their proximity to public amenities, the City's Central Business District, and retail areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Alternatives Considered <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), GSA has considered a range of alternatives to the preferred alternative that could feasibly attain the basic objectives of the proposed project. In addition to the preferred alternative, four other alternatives (a reduced intensity alternative, the Lot B alternative, the expansion alternative and the no action alternative) have been analyzed within the EIS and are representative of a reasonable range of alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Preferred Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preferred alternative site, which is owned by both the Southern Pacific Railroad and the City of Sacramento, encompasses approximately 2.50 acres. The site is bounded by H Street to the North, I Street to the South, 5th Street to the West and 6th Street to the East, within the City of Sacramento. The block is currently irregular in shape and must be reconfigured as a standard city block by realigning and extending 5th and H Streets. The site is a full City block, which provides the space required to meet both current court facility needs and the projected court needs through the year 2020.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preferred site is located within the boundaries of the Merged Downtown Redevelopment Project Area, and is also within the boundaries of the proposed Railyards Specific Plan. This alternative is consistent with redevelopment plans for the Railyards area and will provide a catalyst for development in the Railyards. The project site promotes local land use and redevelopment goals. It is located in proximity to existing and light rail transits system and is near the path of its planned extension. This location will promote use of a transportation means that is environmentally superior to single occupancy vehicle. By virtue of its proximity of the County Jail and the Hall of Justice, the location presents the potential for operational efficiencies that are not present at the other alternatives. The proximity of these buildings to each other would make the transportation of incarcerated individuals both easier and safer. Additionally, the preferred alternative is located in proximity to the City's new Central Library, located at 8th and I Streets, Downtown Plaza, a regional shopping center located between 4th and 7th Streets along K Street and Plaza Park, located at 8th and I Streets. These locational amenities add to the attraction of the preferred alternative site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are no wetlands on the project site nor is the site within the 100-year floodplain. Sacramento is located within Seismic Zone 3 on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 as having the highest risk of seismic events and potential severity. No known active faults or Alquist-Priolo Special Study Zones occur in or adjacent to the City of Sacramento. An Alquist-Priolo Zone is a designation given by the State Geologist who assures that homes, offices, public buildings, and other structures for human occupancy are not built on active faults. The designation requires that a geological investigation be conducted before a local government can approve a development project located within the special study zone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. The Reduced Intensity Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reduced intensity alternative is identical to the preferred alternative except that a wing or annex would not be constructed. The building constructed under this alternative would remain at approximately 380,100 square through the year 2020. As new courtrooms are needed by the Eastern District, approximately the top seven floors would be converted from office space to courtroom space as under the preferred alternative. Under the reduced intensity alternative, however, the federal workers displaced by this conversion would move into lease quarters in the Sacramento area instead of being accommodated on site. The reduced intensity alternative is found to be infeasible because it does not provide for long-term growth of the federal courts. The building proposed under the reduced intensity alternative would not provide adequate space through the year 2020. In addition, as conversion from office to courtroom space takes place, federal workers would have to move into leased space or additional space would have to be constructed off-site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Lot B Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this alternative, a building similar to that described in the ``Preferred Alternative'' section would be constructed on the City of Sacramento's Lot B, which is bounded by H Street on the north, I Street on the south, 10th Street on the west and 11th Street on the east. This site, which is owned by the City of Sacramento is currently used for City employee parking. Land uses surrounding the two story parking structure include residential and motel uses to the north, City Hall office buildings to the west, a high rise parking structure with ground level commercial structures to the south, restaurant, commercial and residential structures to the east, and Plaza Park and the Sacramento Central Library to the southwest. Like the preferred alternative site, the Lot B site is owned by the City and is of adequate size to meet current and future court needs. It is also located within the City's Central Business District and is in proximity to light rail, the City's new library and Plaza Park. The site is not, however, located as conveniently close to the County jail as the preferred alternative site. The Lot B Alternative is, however, infeasible as the State of California has recently selected this site for the location of a new State office building and the City has agreed to sell the property to the State. The Lot B site is, therefore, not available for the Courthouse. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

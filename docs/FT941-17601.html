			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Private View: Love, marriage and Penrose Is marriage going out of style in the west? On the face of it, the answer must be yes. In most west European countries, the marriage rate has declined gently over the past decade while the rate of divorce has risen sharply. The number of babies born outside marriage has increased astonishingly. In Sweden, it is nearly half of all births; in the US, Britain and France, from 25 to 30 per cent. In 1960, these figures were 10 per cent or less. The British are (after the Portuguese) the most assiduous marriers in the European Union and second only to the restless Danes in divorce. Yet, there is evidence of parental stability. Half of Britain's out-of-wedlock babies are born to co-habiting couples and three-quarters are declared by the father and mother together. To find out more about what is happening to the institution of marriage, I climbed a shaky staircase to the offices of a leading London marriage bureau at a 'good' but down-at-heel address just north of Oxford Street. I walked into what looked like a love nest. A simulated coal fire burned optimistically under the mantel in the outer room. Beyond was a cosy parlour, as tasteful as a country tea room, in which, I presume, the lonely pour out their hearts to the match-maker. Penrose Halson is a handsome advertisement for her unusual trade. She has a soft voice, is feminine to the point of girlish, and has a seductively melodious laugh. It was easy to imagine distraught clients of both sexes being gathered, metaphorically speaking, to her bosom. But I was on other business. I quoted the statistics and asked: does this mean marriage is dying out? 'There are still an enormous number of marriages,' she said. 'The figures don't mean marriage is not a good institution. Like democracy, it's the best we've got. It could be modifying and changing but not dying. If it is, it's the greatest pity.' Do you say that because you were brought up to think so? 'Yes, but I didn't marry myself until I was 48 (she is 53 now) and I don't think it's necessarily the answer for everybody. But I do think it's probably the answer for the large majority, provided it's entered into for good and solid and proper reasons.' Why didn't you get married until 48? 'Late developer,' she laughed. You can't get away with that. 'No, I was much too ungrown-up, I think. I'm jolly glad I didn't. Any fool can get married. Sure, I thought I wanted to. All my brothers and sisters did, and all remained so.' There was a bit of bloody-mindedness in it, too, she said. 'I never wanted to be Mrs Wife, and I think probably the people who wanted me to marry them saw things in that way. In reality, I was probably quite frightened of it. I was very muddled.' Her mother, a former Girton girl, sent her to this self-same marriage bureau when she was 27. At 37, she was on the brink of getting engaged, but the man died. She returned to the agency. She met husband Bill Halson, a divorced management consultant, years later when advertising for a lodger. 'Bill turned down the room and contacted me several weeks later and asked me out to dinner. And I was frightfully upset because I thought: if I go out with this man and like him, then I can't have him living in the flat. And if I don't like him, I couldn't, either.' If marriage was less popular, it was for lack of church and family support, she said. The social cachet had gone, along with the stigma of divorce. The Church of England no longer gave a positive lead while government ministers sent confusing signals, saying one thing but doing another, like cutting the married person's tax allowance. Marriage was no longer the passport to sex, nor even to child-bearing. Expectations were higher but 'very woolly,' especially among women. And people were living much longer, which made a lifetime commitment daunting. Perhaps people have just decided it's not such a good thing after all? 'But they're not coming up with any good alternative. If co-habiting were a satisfactory answer, one could kiss marriage goodbye. But I have seen people who have tried both and they find co-habiting unsatisfactory.' Why is that? 'I think it's the lack of commitment - the fact that, in marriage, if you have a bumpy time - which we all do - the commitment is what helps you ride it out. You're much less tempted to say: 'Oh well, it's not working, I'm off'.' Why should they want that depth of commitment? 'A lot don't. But I think it is the only practical way of organising ourselves as a society. We need structures, just like the infrastructure of the sewers and the roads and the railways. You can't have a society based on people pursuing their own requirements and not obeying certain rules.' According to a London University study, a successful marriage is the best guarantee of a happy life (a poor marriage, on the other hand, was found to bring unhappiness). Moreover, as Halson says, stress, illness and mortality rates are higher among divorced people, even if co-habiting. Her observations are based on seven years' experience running the Katharine Allen bureau, which caters for about 1,000 educated, middle-class, presentable professionals (60 per cent women, 40 per cent men) at one time. But marriage bureaux are few, while dating agencies have proliferated. Is this fact alone not significant? Feminism might have something to do with it. I quoted one feminist theory that western women are merely reverting to biological type. Do women want a man, perhaps, but not a husband? 'I suspect they do, however emancipated and successful. They want a husband in name or effect. Whether they are legally married or not is not really the issue.' The bureau, she said, is trying to foster marriage or 'equivalent relationships'. So, you are not a marriage bureau but an ongoing relationship bureau? The match-maker laughed. 'You could call it that. We did consider changing the name to 'marriage and partnership bureau' - but not too seriously.' Rather than 'marriage', I suggested, she could employ a more zoological denotation, such as 'permanent monogamous co-habitation' or PMC. She giggled at the thought, and said: 'No. PMC stroke M . . . for marriage.' If PMC became the norm, would that matter one jot? 'But it's a rotten way to live, with the feeling one day you are going to part. I don't see how you can have a really positive life together.' Don't married couples live like that, anyway? 'They know they can be divorced but they don't dwell on it. In co-habitation, the more vulnerable probably will, and, in middle age, that means the woman. Co-habiting is so difficult to define. And I do think people need definitions and structures as a basis.' Penrose Halson, nee Colyer (her first name is from a village in Cornwall) has an extra-mural degree in modern languages, wrote and edited language teaching books, and taught Spanish at a school in a poor area of London. She was also academic headmistress of a recognised but 'very eccentric' local ballet school. What are your qualifications for this job? I asked, unkindly. She was unmoved. 'What would be the qualifications?' I don't know, I mumbled. Psychology, psychiatry, a PhD in social studies . . . 'I'm a trained teacher, which is a help.' Do you think there should be publicly-supported marriage brokers or advisory agencies? 'Pre-marital counselling would be a very good idea. The problem with that is people accepting they need it - especially at a time when they're feeling good about life. One has great doubts about making it compulsory.' And there would still be the problem of finding partners for the 40 and 50-year-olds, especially women. 'But I do think if one could make getting married a little bit harder, it would help.' (It would not help to make divorce harder, she added). 'Maybe if they had to go and see the registrar for an hour . . . But it's not going to stop people. 'It's a very interesting idea. If you could get good people to run them, yes . . . I think I'd need notice of that question.'</p>

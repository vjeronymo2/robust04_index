			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATE'S RAPE 'JOKE' CAUSES STIR  </P> <P> Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton W. Williams, preparing for a cattle  roundup at his ranch Saturday, compared the rainy, cold weather spoiling the  event to a rape. "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it," Williams said  to ranch hands and reporters.  </P> <P> Williams later apologized and said: "That's just a joke . . . . It wasn't a  serious statement."  </P> <P> Williams will face state Treasurer Ann Richards or Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox in the  November general election after one of them wins an April 10 Democratic runoff.  </P> <P> "Just because you're in the barnyard doesn't mean you have to act like Clayton  Williams does," Mattox said.  </P> <P> Richards' spokesman, Monte Williams, said: "It's unfortunate and disturbing  that the Republican nominee would joke about violence against women. It's an  insensitive and reprehensible remark."  </P></p>

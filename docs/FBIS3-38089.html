			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>   [Excerpt] Lillehammer (Norway), 27 Feb -- Oleg Soskovets,  first deputy head of the Russian Government, paying an official  visit to Norway today met Norwegian Minister for the Economy,  Oil Industry and Power Sector Jens Stoltenberg.    Oleg Soskovets told ITAR-TASS that the meeting focused on  cooperation between the two countries to exploit offshore oil  deposits. Norway has unique experience in this area and the  future of the Russian generating industry lies precisely in this  kind of extraction of oil and gas. A month ago, Russia and  Norway signed a memorandum on cooperation in oilfield  development. This is now being put into effect and a legal  framework is being drawn up. Norway is interested in partnership  with Russia and is planning close cooperation with it also as  part of the European energy charter. Our interest is in  management experience in oil and gas extraction with foreign  investment, Oleg Soskovets stressed.    Commenting on the outcome of his meeting here on Saturday  with Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Godal, he said that Norway  is closely following the reform process in Russia. The  Norwegian foreign minister was told that no changes to the  Russian government's reform policy are planned and that the  reforms are irreversible. It was also stressed that Russia is  in a special situation by virtue of its involvement in the CIS.  This refers primarily to the credits for fuel purchases that  Russia extends to CIS states because of economic and political  circumstances. These credits are considerably more than the aid  being planned by the G-7 and the IMF. This circumstance defines  the specific nature of relations between Russia and the other  CIS states, the first deputy prime minister emphasised. [passage  omitted]</p>

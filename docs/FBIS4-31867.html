			<p>BFN     [Text] Plitvice, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- If talks between  delegations of the republic of Serb Krajina and the Republic of  Croatia take place, initially scheduled for 16 and 17 June, they  will start at about 1600 today, a TANJUG reporter has learned in  Plitvice.    The negotiations were expected to start this morning but, as  is known, they were postponed because the Croatian side demanded  that the number of attending reporters be higher than the number  admitted in Zagreb. The Croatian side is demanding that five  Croatian reporters and all Zagreb-based U.S. reporters come.  Moreover, the reporters should be enabled to travel by car via  the border crossing of Turanj near Karlovac.    Letters were exchanged this morning, via the UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR], between the governments of the republic of  Serb Krajina and the Republic of Croatia, thus bringing about a  possibility of the negotiations taking place at 1600. As is  known, the negotiations are expected to focus on economic issues.    One of the contested issues, as demanded by the government  of  the republic of Serb Krajina, is the withdrawal of Croatian  forces from western Slavonia, Mt. Velebit, and some other areas  in keeping with an agreement signed on 29 March this year in  Zagreb.</p>

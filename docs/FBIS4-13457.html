The symposium, to discuss means of encountering current  challenges facing women and the dangerous impact of the  oppressive embargo on Iraq on the basic human rights and family  and the responsibility of the world community in putting an end  to this embargo, will also be attended by representatives from  several regional and international women organizations.

The symposium also has on its agenda objectives of the  Nairobi strategy focused on equality, development, and peace and  the challenges facing women in performing their rights and  participation in development and work.    The federation chairwoman added that the symposium will also  shed light on the legal status of women in Iraq and impact of  environmental pollution resulting from the American-led  aggression on Iraq.    Addressing the opening session, Vice President Mr. Ramadan  said the United States and its allies which trade with the  slogans of human rights maintain strong animosity and hatred to  the human. They had employed against this human the most brutal  means of annihiliation, starvation, disease, and death  represented in the 30-state aggression on Iraq and destroying  the basic prerequisites of the Iraqi human including schools,  hospitals, electric, and water systems, and even civilian  shelters.    Mr. Ramadan also referred to the perpetuation of the  unjustified embargo on Iraq and the U.S.-led invasion of Somalia  and the crimes being carried out against the Palestinian people  by the Zionist occupiers.    Mr. Ramadan expressed confidence that the symposium would  reach positive results contributing to realizing aspirations and  rights of the human, the world over and in the manner of facing  the challenges of the current critical international situation.    Mr. Ramadan said that conditions facing women and children  in  Iraq from the U.S. Administration and its allies represent a  flagrant breaching to the human rights and that that is  regrettably being done in the name of the United Nations, which  should boost and protect human rights. He said the symposium  should focus discussion on this issue and work out urgent  treatment to this inhumane grave phenomenon.    Mr. Ramadan further said that since the imposition of  sanctions on Iraq in August, 1990, the woman and family in Iraq  suffered from dangerous conditions that had led to the increase  of mortality among infants and women because of the severe  shortages of food and medicines. This embargo has intensified  the burdens of women in Iraq in addition to her basic tasks of  the care extended to the family, he pointed out.    Mr. Ramadan said the symposium should discuss the social,  economic, and political challenges facing the woman exercising  of her rights and reaching practical results so that the woman  could play her role in defending human rights and not only those  of woman.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander heads for peak profits Banco Santander is heading for record profits this year after the Pta281bn (Dollars 2.2bn) acquisition last April of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled bank whose board was sacked by the Bank of Spain late late year. Santander yesterday reported profits for the first nine months of Pta107bn including Banesto, by far the highest result posted by a Spanish banking group for this period. Without Banesto, Santander's pre-tax profits stood at Pta100.5bn, 5.9 per cent up on the same period last year. The consolidation of Banesto, formerly the fourth biggest Spanish bank, raised Santander's average total assets to Pta16,827bn from Pta9,270bn, outstripping those of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the next biggest domestic banking group by more than Pta4,000bn. Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said the subsidiary bank's performance over the past two months (Banesto was consolidated in August, after the completion of the acquisition) had 'confirmed the favourable forecasts of Banesto's future and vindicated a strategy designed to consolidate a wide and solid client base in the Spanish market'. Santander's return on equity stood at 19.58 per cent without Banesto and 19.73 per cent with Banesto's inclusion. The group's return on assets stood at 1.01 per cent without Banesto and dropped marginally to 0.98 per cent with it. Non-performing loans as a percentage of the group's total amounted to 6.37 per cent against 3.19 per cent if Banesto is not included in the consolidated results. In spite of the higher figure resulting from Banesto's inclusion, coverage stood at 79.14 per cent and at 100.61 per cent if real guarantees are taken into account. Santander posted a net interest margin of Pta220bn including Banesto. Without Banesto, it was Pta188bn, up 6 per cent on last year's third-quarter figure. Without Banesto, Santander raised its operating profit 10.8 per cent to Pta118bn. Banesto's addition to the consolidated account lifted the group's operating profit to Pta126bn. The high totals posted by Santander came in spite of strong losses in treasury operations. Income from fixed income and currency dealings fell to Pta7.5bn for the nine months, including provisions of Pta13.5bn, from Pta74bn in the first nine months of 1993. The results indicated Banesto was earning money for Santander. It added just over Pta9bn to the group's third-quarter net profits of Pta80bn although the overwhelming proportion of this was provided by Banesto's 25 per cent stake in Totta &amp; Acores the Portuguese bank.</p>

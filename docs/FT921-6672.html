			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Porsche defuses management crisis THE emergency meeting of the supervisory board of Porsche yesterday succumbed to an ultimatum from Mr Arno Bohn, the company's chief executive, and agreed 'unanimously' to extend his contract for another three years. The board's vote appears to defuse an immediate management crisis at the German sports car-maker. Mr Bohn had threatened to resign unless the board, some of whose members had previously offered his job to a senior BMW executive, gave him a vote of confidence this week. However, some industry observers last night expressed the belief that the apparent boardroom climb-down could not wholly repair the damage done to Mr Bohn's relationship with the board by a series of events over the past fortnight. The crisis was triggered by the offer of his job to Dr Wolfgang Reitzle, research and development director of executive BMW. the executive car-maker. It is understood this offer was made by Dr Ferdinand Porsche, chairman of the Porsche supervisory board. Subsequently, a regular meeting of the Porsche supervisory board last week failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to endorse the extension of Mr Bohn's existing contract after it runs out at the end of this year. Almost immediately afterwards, Dr Reitzle, who is seen as heir-apparent to BMW's 63-year-old management board chairman, Dr Eberhard von Kuenheim, said he had decided not to take up Porsche's offer. Mr Bohn described the board's actions as 'damaging' for the company and said he would 'not be available for reappointment' if the board did not give him unqualified backing'. The company last night offered a 'no comment' to question's about the long-term implications of the dispute for Porsche's management. The dispute has come at a bad time for Porsche, whose worldwide sales have fallen sharply. Some 4,000 workers are on short time, following a fall in 1991 sales to 26,200 - 4,000 fewer than in 1990 - and little more than half the 50,000 vehicles sold in Porsche's peak year of 1986.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York COTTON futures were sharply higher at midday on prospects of severe damage to the Texas crop caused by recent heavy rains. 'The earlier cotton planted in Rio Grande Valley and central Texas is standing in water, and in the Lubbock area, a vast amount of the acreage has been damaged by the cool, wet weather that visited the state again over the weekend,' an analyst said. 'At this time it appears the severe damage will amount to more than a million acres.' The rains are delaying the Texas WHEAT harvest, sparking concern over the crop's quality and helping to push prices higher in Chicago by midday. More rain is expected this week in the southern Plains. NICKEL rallied from earlier six-month lows on the LME in the afternoon but the market still closed down. The decline mostly reflected speculative selling, with sell stops hit below Dollars 7,200 a tonne for three month metal. Analysts see the market remaining under technical pressure, with Dollars 7,050 the key downside objective. The momentum of three month ALUMINIUM's move below Dollars 1,330 last week was continued, with sell stops triggered when prices breached Dollars 1,320. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / International Company News: Citicorp sees Dollars 800m gains on disposals CITICORP, the leading US bank, is hoping to record as much as Dollars 800m of pre-tax gains in the next few months from the disposal of assets, much of them equity holdings in Latin America.

Mr Reed, who yesterday spoke to investors in Boston and will hold similar meetings in California early next week, was asked by investors why Mr Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president, resigned abruptly earlier this week.

Morgan Stanley is expected to price the three-year convertible stock offer next Wednesday, at a yield of between 7 3/4 and 8 1/4 per cent. In his New York presentation, Mr Reed was asked for assurances that the bank would not again seek rapid growth once its capital had been bolstered and its profitability restored. Mr Reed, while telling investors that he wished to preserve the bank's global franchise, admitted: 'We can never be like we once were.'</p>

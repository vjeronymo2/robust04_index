			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Mansfield's misery fills a pint pot: Richard Donkin feels the body blow to a town where job prospects are already bleak MR KELVIN BREED, a 39-year-old face-worker at Clipstone Colliery, was leaning against the bar of the Dukeries Social Club, a pint of beer in one hand, when a friend broke the news that the pit was to close. His face betrayed no emotion. 'Where can I find a job? I was in the Army before going down the pit 20 years ago. What sort of work is there for someone who knows how to kill and work down a mine?' he said. Clipstone is one of four pits in the Mansfield area that are to be axed, with the loss of about 4,600 jobs. Staff at Mansfield's Civic Hall were preparing to change the notice board that gives the town's unemployment figures. Yesterday the total stood at just over 8,000. Within days the unemployment rate for the town will top 20 per cent. On some estates more than a third of householders will be out of work. Mansfield is famous for two things - beer and coal. In the past two weeks, Mansfield Bitter has become less the local brew and more a frame of mind in this community of 55,000 people. For those without jobs, prospects are bleak. Just outside Mansfield centre at Forest Town, a few coal heaps behind coils of barbed wire mark the remains of the old Mansfield colliery which closed about three years ago. But as the pits are consigned to history, Toray, the Japanese fabrics manufacturer, is shaping the future. Its factory will employ 400 workers when it comes fully on stream in the summer of 1994. About 70 vacancies have been filled to date from 3,000 inquiries. Many of those recruited for the first phase of operations next spring are former miners whose ability to work as a team has impressed the Japanese managers. The Pounds 50m Toray factory is the only significant inward investment in the area. 'The factory is very welcome but we would need 25 Torays next week,' said Mr Jim Hawkins, the leader of Mansfield District Council. 'That's the size of the problem.' The most worrying aspect of the closures is the lack of alternatives to mining and the knock-on effect for other businesses. The town grew up around mining at the turn of the century. Mansfield's coal had few impurities and made ideal steam coal, prized by the steel industry and the railways. But the local communities have seen more than 20,000 mining and related jobs disappear in the East Midlands coal field since 1985. The decline has been matched by the decline in textiles, Mansfield's other large employer base. Iron foundries have also suffered. Once there were six in the area. The foundry of James Maude and Co is the only survivor and workers have been on short time. The brewery has also had cuts. THE most severe effect of the closures outside British Coal is expected to be among the hundreds of related businesses that supply the industry. Mr Mel Brown, a former miner who runs a mine equipment refurbishing business employing seven people, said: 'We are almost 99 per cent dependent on the local pits. A lot of small businesses like ours will be directly affected. All we can do is hope we can see it through. Mr Ian Linney, chairman of Mansfield Newspapers, which publishes the weekly Mansfield Chad, estimated that the closures would lead to the loss of as many as 100,000 jobs in the region and cost more than Pounds 1bn to the government in lost taxes and extra unemployment benefit. 'I don't think there is a hope in hell of filling this gap for 15 years,' he said. 'As I see it the government has looked at only one side of the balance sheet. I just cannot see the economic sense of this. If these were inefficient pits unable to compete in the market I would probably agree with these measures, but these pits are producing a 27.5 per cent return on capital.' The bewilderment is reflected throughout the community. Mr Philip Asquith, Mansfield's Economic Development Officer, said: 'What this means is that we will undergo all this misery and suffering for more expensive electricity at the end of the day.' The council welcomed yesterday's announcement that Mansfield would be given assisted-area status for which it has lobbied hard. Mr Richard Goad, the chief executive, said: 'It is something we desperately needed but in the present climate we need a lot more and quickly.' There have been some success stories from previous redundancies. Mr Tom Wright used some of his redundancy and a bank loan to set up a sealant business with his nephew when he left the Clipstone pit a year ago. He is among a number of former miners who have been helped to start new businesses by Mansfield, Sutton and Kirkby Training and Enterprise Council. 'It's been hard going but we have full order books and I have no regrets. I could have sat at home and rotted away, but it wasn't for me.' For every success story, though, there are countless failures. Some former miners are resigned to a life on the dole. Mr Breed said he would look for work. 'But if I can't find it,' he said, 'the government will have to keep me. It put me here.'</p>

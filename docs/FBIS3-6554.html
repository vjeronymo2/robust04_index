			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] HANOI, March 17 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II is to  assign a controversial Vietnamese bishop to a job in the Vatican  instead of lining him up to take over as archbishop of Ho Chi  Minh City, a government official said here Thursday.    Bishop Nguyen Van Thuan, a nephew of former South Vietnamese  president Ngo Dinh Diem, is to be assigned to a Vatican post  instead of being appointed deputy to the ailing archbishop in  the southern city, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan said.    If confirmed by the Vatican, the agreement with Hanoi would  mark a backing down by the Roman Catholic Church over its  freedom to appoint senior church officials in Vietnam, by  granting the government here a veto over the selection of clergy.    During talks here last week between Vietnamese officials and  Monsignor Claudio Celli, the Vatican's deputy secretary of  state, the Holy See agreed to consult Hanoi over the selection  of clergy, a source of tension between the church and Vietnam  for some time.    The Vatican has so far refused to comment on statements by  the Vietnamese government, saying it was waiting for Celli's  return to Rome.    "As far as the case of Bishop Nguyen Van Thuan is concerned  we were informed that the Holy Father will assign Bishop Thuan  to a post in the Vatican and the Vietnamese side agreed to that  arrangement," Lan told a news briefing.    The spokeswoman said they had agreed "that the Holy See will  keep the government informed of all matters concerning the  Vietnamese Catholic Church and will not make any decision in  this connection unless the Vietnamese government gives its  approval."    Thuan was originally appointed deputy archbishop before the  communists took over the then Saigon in 1975. He was not allowed  to take up the post and has been in exile in Rome since 1992.    Vietnamese authorities have been trying to engineer the  appointment of Huynh Van Nghi, recently described by Vietnamese  Premier Vo Van Kiet as having "a positive attitude," as deputy  to Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, who is over 80 years old and in  poor health.    The Vatican had appointed Nghi as a "supervising bishop" in  Ho Chi Minh City but this was rejected by government authorities  here, who said it was part of a "plot" to sideline the bishop  and eventually appoint Thuan as archbishop.    The church's development here under French colonial rule and  the strong connections between Catholicism and the former South  Vietnamese regime have fueled government suspicions of  Catholics, who number around seven million people, or 10 percent  of the population.    Vatican officials have accused Vietnam of trying to turn  Asia's second largest Catholic community after the Philippines  into a state-sponsored church outside of the control of the  normal religious hierachy.    At a meeting in August with Vietnamese living in the United  States, the pope called on the congregation "not to forget your  brothers and sisters ... in the difficult situation of their  country."    Kiet told a Catholic newspaper earlier this month that as  the  issue was one of "national sovereignty," Vietnam had ruled out a  compromise on who had the right to control religious activities.    Tensions have eased in recent years with visits here by  Vatican envoys but the dispute over appointments has left  several top posts unfilled, including the head of the  archdiocese of Hanoi.</p>

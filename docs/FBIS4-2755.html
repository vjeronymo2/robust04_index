			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report on news conference with unidentified foreign </F> and domestic correspondents sponsored by the State Council  Information Office on 12 April; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] The State Council Information Office  today invited Liu Minxue, director of the State Administration  for Industry and Commerce [SAIC], and Bai Dahua, deputy director  and director of the State Patent Office, to answer reporters'  questions on the protection of the right to the exclusive use of  trademarks registered by foreign companies in China.    [Liu, seated and reading from a script] The current  situation  with regard to the protection of intellectual property rights in  China is an issue in which many people in the international  community are quite interested. We are holding this news  conference today to brief you on the protection of the right to  the exclusive use of trademarks registered by foreign companies  in China, which constitutes one aspect of the protection of  intellectual property rights. My colleagues and I are very happy  to exchange our views with you correspondents on this issue. We  hope that you will give full and extensive publicity  internationally to the progress China has made in protecting  intellectual property rights so that countries of the world will  have a better understanding of intellectual property rights  protection in China and dispel some people's misunderstandings.  This will be conducive to the development of China's economic  cooperation, trade, and friendly cooperative ties with foreign  countries.    The structure of China's intellectual property rights organs  is different from that of other countries. Trademarks, patents,  and copyrights are under the jurisdiction of, respectively, the  State Administration of Industry and Commerce, the State Patent  Office, and the State Copyright Administration. As the  competent law-enforcement administrative department of the state  in charge of trademarks, the State Administration of Industry  and Commerce has the dual responsibility of trademark  registration and administration. The SAIC protects, in  accordance with the law, the right to the exclusive use of  trademarks registered by domestic and foreign companies, and it  has made universally acknowledged progress. In particular, its  work in protecting the exclusive right to trademarks registered  by foreign companies in China has won praise from international  intellectual property rights protection quarters and from many  foreign enterprises.    As everybody knows, since China started implementing the  policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, it has  steadily amplified and improved laws concerning the protection  of registered trademarks with a view to bringing them, step by  step, into line with international practices. Today, we have by  and large caught up with the international level. The Chinese  Government has taken a firm position and has implemented  effective measures in protecting the exclusive right of  trademarks registered by foreign companies.    In regard to protecting the right to the exclusive use of  registered trademarks, the SAIC is unique in the world in that  it is in charge of both the registration and protection of  trademarks. This is an arrangement with distinctive Chinese  characteristics. In recent years, many enterprises have applied  for trademark registration in China. Seventy countries and  regions had registered 59,466 trademarks in China as of the end  of 1993; there have been sharp increases in the number of  trademark registration applications year after year. In  protecting foreign companies' right to the exclusive use of  their trademarks, administrative departments for industry and  commerce have devoted major efforts to investigations in the  past few years and have uncovered many cases involving trademark  violations.    On behalf of the SAIC, I would like to express our  appreciation to our friends in press circles at home and abroad  for their support of our work. It is our sincere wish to  increase exchanges with friends in press circles at home and  abroad. We hope that you will give wider coverage to the  protection of registered trademarks in China. We are happy to  assist you in your coverage.    [Announcer] Answering a question on what measures China has  taken in protecting the right to the exclusive use of  trademarks, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] I would like to answer this  question in three parts. First, the amended trademark law  increases the penalty for the infringement and counterfeiting of  trademarks. In terms of a pecuniary penalty, the amended  trademark law provides that a fine of not more than 50 percent  of the illegal volume of business or not more than five times  the illegal profit gained from the infringement can be imposed.  In addition to that, supplementary provisions on punishing  offenses concerning registered trademark violations adopted by  the National People's Congress have increased the jail terms for  offenses related to trademarks from three to seven years.    Second, in addition to the party whose rights have been  infringed upon, one can lodge a charge concerning the  infringement with administrative departments for industry and  commerce, and these departments can also directly investigate  trademark violations on the market. There are over 600,000  personnel in administrative departments for industry and  commerce across the country. We are entirely capable of doing a  better job in this regard in the marketplace.    Third, one of the distinctive characteristic of China's  trademark administration is the double-track system, which  places equal emphasis on administrative management and judicial  management. In other words, in addition to administrative  departments for industry and commerce which are empowered to  directly investigate and punish trademark counterfeiting and  other violations, China's judicial organs -- courts, that is --  can also accept trademark cases.    [Announcer] Speaking of the importance attached to the  implementation of the trademark law, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] As  I just said, we investigate and uncover a large number of  trademark violations every year, and we have so many personnel.  These facts demonstrate the following two points: One is that  China's legal system in regard to trademarks is being constantly  improved. The situation is improving in that we have more and  more rules to follow in dealing with all forms of trademark  infringement and unethical competition in the marketplace.  Because there are guidelines to follow on how to deal with  violations, we have been able to uncover and handle more cases.    The other thing is that we have placed greater emphasis on  this work. As you can see, the state takes the crackdown -- the  crackdown on the counterfeiting infringement in particular --  very seriously. We have also cracked down hard to protect the  interests of businesses and especially consumers.  Administrative departments for industry and commerce are  implementing work in this area on a priority basis. Besides, we  amended and improved the trademark law and formulated relevant  measures with an eye on bringing them into line with  international practices.    [Announcer] Answering a question on what China will do to  increase the people's awareness of trademarks, Liu Minxue said:    [Liu] We would like very much to raise the overall awareness  of trademarks among the people, especially among business  managers and traders. We have done a great deal of work in this  regard. For example, we launch at least a couple of large-scale  publicity campaigns on the trademark law each year. As for  enterprises, we run study classes and sponsor activities and  meetings on [word indistinct] and trademark policy so that  enterprises know how to use the trademark law to protect  themselves. The awareness of trademarks is improving.    [Announcer] Answering a question on whether China has  special  regulations on the protection of the right to the exclusive use  of trademarks registered by foreign companies, Liu Minxue said:    [Liu] China is a member of the Paris Convention for the  Protection of Industrial Property. We are firmly committed to  the obligations provided in the Paris convention. There is an  exception in procedure -- that is, when a foreigner or foreign  enterprise applies for trademark registration or lodges a charge  of infringement, it shall entrust it to a trademark agency  designated by the SAIC or the trademark bureau [organization as  heard] to act on its behalf in accordance with the provisions of  the Chinese trademark law.    [Announcer] Answering a question on how China will handle  the scramble for famous trademark registration, Bai Dahua said:    [Bai] We have a specific legal interpretation regarding the  scramble for famous trademark registration. According to  China's trademark law, whoever registers a trademark first owns  the trademark. However, there is one exception regarding  protection of famous trademarks. The second provision of the  sixth article of the Paris Convention, which is designed to  protect industrial property rights, stipulates that special  measures should be taken to protect famous trademarks. This  only applies to established, well-known trademarks. Only when  another person or enterprise tries to register these famous  trademarks can we call it a scramble for famous trademark  registration. Generally, if this happens we will take measures  to protect the famous trademarks in question according to the  Paris Convention if the trademark owners present proof of  registration issued by a competent administrative organ of the  country where the trademarks were originally registered. In  other words, we will deny the registration of trademarks  requested by others.    [Announcer] Answering a question about enterprises violating  the trademark law or infringing on others' trademark rights, Bai  Dahua responded:    [Bai] In China, infringement of others' trademark rights is  limited not just to Chinese enterprises infringing on other  Chinese enterprises' trademark rights; some foreign enterprises  have also infringed on Chinese enterprises' trademark rights.  Of course, some Chinese enterprises have infringed on foreign  enterprises' trademark rights. Liu explained this. According  to the principle of (?fair) treatment stipulated in the Paris  Convention, we handle such cases in a fair manner. Some  infringements of trademark rights in China are attributable to  foreign companies; there are many examples of this. Similarly,  some countries have violated their own trademark laws to  infringe upon the rights of Chinese trademarks registered in  their countries. For instance, some countries have gone so far  as to allow the use of the word China or Chinese as trademarks  even though the trademark laws of the great majority of  countries stipulate that the name, national flag, emblem, and  flags and emblems of the armed forces of that country must not  be used as trademarks.    [Announcer] Answering a question on how China handles  foreign-related trademark cases, Bai Dahua said:    [Bai] Regarding the first part of the question, since the  PRC Trademark Law was enforced, we have dealt with approximately  130,000 cases involving infringement of trademark rights and  counterfeit trademarks. Of these cases, about 3,000 involved  foreign companies. Regarding fines and compensation, they are  two separate categories. According to the law, if an enterprise  or individual has infringed on others' trademark rights, which  is a violation of the law, a court or industry and commerce  administration department is authorized to act on its own to  impose an administrative fine on the enterprise or individual.  But reasonable compensation can be given according to the law  only if the owners of the trademarks in question submit a  compensation demand. Legislation and enforcement of a country's  trademark laws develop step by step. In other words, legislation  of trademark laws will continue to be improved, and the degree  of enforcement of trademark laws will increase daily. Therefore,  if foreign enterprises or individuals voice dissatisfaction over  the way China protects exclusive trademark rights, that is  normal. This will help us improve our protection of exclusive  trademark rights. Of course, there have been cases involving  opposite situations; some enterprises have shown great  satisfaction over the way in which Chinese administrative organs  or judicial authorities protect their exclusive trademark  rights. For instance, the cases which include the silk banner  awards and photos provide in the booklets everyone of you has,  are examples that some enterprises have expressed satisfaction  over the way we protect exclusive trademark rights.

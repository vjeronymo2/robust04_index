According to an IRNA report, the Hezb-e Eslami spokesman  said: Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami considers this proposal as an  effort to create a rift between Afghanistan's Jihadi groups.    Furthermore, the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami-e [Islamic Unity  Party of Afghanistan] spokesman in Peshawar told IRNA: The  resolution of the Afghan problem can only be accomplished by  agreement among the four major parties in that country; that is  Hezb-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat, Jonbesh-e Shomal [the Northern  Movement] and Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society of  Afghanistan].</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Strike costs BR Pounds 200m in lost revenue The signal workers' strike has cost British Rail Pounds 200m in lost revenues and is leading to the loss of 'core business' which may never be regained, Mr John Nelson, managing director of BR's south-eastern train operations, said yesterday. The RMT transport union said last night the strike planned for tomorrow was still on after talks aimed at resolving the three-month dispute adjourned without result. The conciliation service Acas said both sides recognised that wage negotiations between the RMT and Railtrack would have to continue for several days. The two sides last met for talks in mid July. Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, had earlier called on the RMT as a gesture of goodwill to suspend its threat of strikes tomorrow and for next Thursday and Friday. Mr Nelson told a quarterly meeting of the Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee, a national passenger watchdog, that the loss of revenue in London and the south-east alone was Pounds 100m, which is nearly 10 per cent of the region's annual turnover. And in a separate presentation, Mr Horton told the committee that Railtrack, which owns and operates BR's track and stations, had lost Pounds 100m in access fees. Mr Nelson said: 'The impact of the strike is being felt right across the railway . . . even in the London area, which has been considered as a 'captive' market, we are beginning to see signs of erosion of our business. 'This is very damaging to the structure of the railway and our aspirations for the business,' Mr Nelson said. The punctuality and reliability of services was starting to deteriorate, which was a 'sickening' development given the effort the railways had made to improve their performance. The vulnerability of the railway to strike action could mean the government would in future be less willing to provide funds, he suggested. Mr Horton said that Railtrack would have to fund its strike losses by cutting investment this year.</p>

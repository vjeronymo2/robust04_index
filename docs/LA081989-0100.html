			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW MUCH IS A COMPANY'S PHONE BOOK WORTH? AT THE VERY LEAST, $30  </P> <P> The chairman and chief executive of F. W. Woolworth Co., Harold Sells, lives in  Murray Hill, N.J. Seven miles away, in Florham Park, Woolworth's president and  chief operating officer, Frederick Hennig, resides.  </P> <P> Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. partner Lloyd Blankfein has two homes, one in  Manhattan and the other in East Hampton, N.Y. Another Goldman partner, Fischer  Black, has homes in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Pittsfield, Mass. And David Beemer,  managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has a penthouse in  Guttenberg, N.J.  </P> <P> Those are but a few of America's least approachable corporate executives whose  home addresses and, in many cases, home telephone numbers, are for sale by  Steve Olsen.  </P> <P> Operating out of his cluttered two-room suite in Hotel Rutledge, a small  Manhattan residential hotel, Olsen, 25, is one of a small group of  entrepreneurs who buy, sell and swap corporate telephone directories.  </P> <P> He specializes in Fortune 500 companies and financial institutions. An  associate, Stanley Grubman, in Silver Spring, Md., also sells directories of  Fortune 500 companies, plus many Washington Beltway high-technology firms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Runs a Regular Ad  </P> <P> Olsen regularly runs a two-line ad in New York Press, a weekly, that says: "We  pay cash for internal phone directories of large companies." He pays $30 to $50  a book and sells photocopies for $50 to $100, he said. Those answering his ad,  he said, come from every level -- from the mail room to the executive suite.  </P> <P> Not all in-house directories include home numbers -- those that do command  higher prices -- and a sampling indicates that most of the home numbers in  company directories also are listed in local telephone books.  </P> <P> But the company directory still is valuable, because without it, someone  tracking an elusive executive would need to know which phone book to go to:  Greenwich, Conn., for example, for the home listing of Hugh Garnett, partner at  the accounting firm of Deloite, Haskins &amp; Sells; or Randolph, N.J., for a  listing for George Miles Jr., the executive vice president and chief operations  officer of WNET, Channel 13.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Companies  </P> <P> Olsen estimates that his more than 300 directories contain 4 million to 5  million names. Among the companies on his seven-page, single-spaced list of  phone lists are:  </P> <P> American Broadcasting, CBS, NBC, Aetna, Continental Insurance, Metropolitan  Life, New York Life, Prudential-Bache, Travelers Insurance, Merrill Lynch,  Oppenheimer Fund, Paine Webber, Smith Barney, Bank of America, Bankers Trust,  Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, Dillon Read, First Boston, Morgan Guaranty, Morgan  Stanley, Allied Corp, American Cyanamid, American Home Products, Bristol Myers,  Pfizer, Schering-Plough, Sterling Drug, Warner-Lambert, General Foods, General  Electric, General Motors, IBM, AT&amp;T, IT&amp;T, NYNEX and Sprint.  </P> <P> He also acquired one particularly hot property: the spring 1989 directory of  Time Inc. He sold it shortly before Time's takeover woes began but insists that  the buyer had nothing to do with that.  </P> <P> Among Olsen's most productive resources are the "alumni directories" kept by  many companies, especially management consulting and accounting firms, which  keep track of where their valued former managers have gone. Those books are  especially rich in home and summer-home telephone numbers, he said.  </P> <P> Most of Olsen's customers are executive recruiters stalking management and  technical personnel for finders' fees of up to a year's salary. "They want to  be able to talk to their candidate directly, either at home or on his direct  office line, without explaining to a secretary who they are and what they  want," Olsen said. He added that he often will offer to sell directories to  buyers at a lower price if they have some new directory to offer him in  exchange.  </P> <P> Grubman said 90% of his clientele are stockbrokers seeking new sales prospects.  "If someone is listed as management in a company phone book, they can probably  afford to buy stock," he said.  </P> <P> David Lord, managing editor of Executive Recruiter News, confirmed that  corporate recruiters are avid collectors of in-house phone books. It is general  practice, Lord said, for a headhunter, having lured an executive away from XYZ  Inc. for a better berth at ABC Co., to ask the recruit, as a favor, to drop off  a copy of his old XYZ phone book.  </P> <P> "We take a rather dim view of the practice," Lord said. "It is a violation of  the confidence of the firm. . . . Also, in a good executive search, original  research is the preferred method. And you do that by sourcing. You develop  names based on personal recommendations."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expressing Displeasure  </P> <P> Spokesmen for Woolworth's, IBM and General Motors also are annoyed at the  practice. Joseph Carroll, Woolworth's vice president for public affairs,  expressed displeasure that his company book was for sale. He said any employee  caught selling a company directory to someone like Olsen would be reprimanded.  </P> <P> A GM spokesman said his company's phone book bears a warning that outsiders are  not to see it, and the book is to be destroyed when a new one is issued.  </P> <P> Even a copyright, Olsen said, wouldn't protect the companies unless they sold  the books themselves. Only then, he said, could they claim that his photocopies  deprived them of profits.  </P> <P> "In the meantime," Olsen said, "I've got a pretty good thing going here. Some  day I'll get the money to have all of this cross-indexed and computerized: Can  you imagine what a data base I'll have? Direct lines to millions of the most  powerful people in the world."  </P></p>

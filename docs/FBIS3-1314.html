The one-day meeting will review the  conflicts in Angola, Somalia, Liberia and Burundi where renewed  fighting in Bujumbura, the capital has claimed many lives.    Cameroon, which is a member of the 11-nation OAU organ for  conflict resolution, is being represented at the meeting by its  foreign minister, Ferdinand Leopold Oyono, who reiterated his  government's position that the withdrawal of Nigerian troops  from the peninsula was a pre-requisite for negotiations. "It is  only through such a withdrawal that Cameroon could consider the  possibility of a summit" between the Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani  Abacha and President Paul Biya, Oyono told the organ. He  however stressed that Cameroon remained open to any concerted  initiatives likely to facilitate the search for a durable and  peaceful resolution to the conflict.    The Nigerian Government in a memorandum sent to the OAU  Secretariat, called on the organ to encourage ongoing bilateral  initiatives and implore both countries to agree on an early date  for the summit between the leaders of the two countries and  "seriously commit themselves to the resolution of the dispute  through the current peace initiatives". Nigeria referred to the  "intensive bilateral efforts" of President Eyadema of Togo and  Husni Mubarak of Egypt to resolve the dispute, saying "both  leaders have almost concluded arrangements for a summit of the  leaders of Cameroon and Nigeria at a neutral venue to be agreed  upon soon".</p>

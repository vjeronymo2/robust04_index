			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Arts: Goehr's 'Colossos or Panic' - Music in Boston Alexander Goehr is certainly not the only visitor to the Prado to have been struck by Goya's image of a gigantic male figure, naked and burly, striding through the air to the great consternation of travellers he seems not to be noticing. Nor is Goehr alone, surely, in wanting to release this painting from its frozen time and from its silence: to see, as it were, the film from which it is a still. But where most of us might think of massive chords for the walking giant and an uproar of shrieks and whinnies for the terrified people below and behind him, Goehr's response to the vision is a 'symphonic fragment' that preserves a glimmering gentleness throughout most of its 25 minutes. Commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the piece was given its first performance by them under Seiji Ozawa in Boston's Symphony Hall last week. Goehr's title, Colossos or Panic, perhaps provides a clue, in suggesting a viewpoint beyond the obvious. To react to the painting with hugeness and screams would be to align oneself with the scattering crowd, to share in the panic. Goehr, with characteristic care and calm in his voice, chides us for joining the sheep. No, we must remain alert and questioning. There will be moments of awesomeness, when the sky visitor seems real and a threat - moments like the sinister intrusion of Fafner-like music towards the end of the piece - but more generally the view will be from outside the frame, observing the scene and trying, through music and in music, to comprehend what it may mean. Unfreezing the image's time would be useless if it yielded only a Hollywood epic; better to listen to its implicit questions about mob behaviour, and to hear them voiced by a mob of another kind, one of orchestral musicians. If hysteria is thus the subject rather than the manner of the piece, it is altogether appropriate that the journey should be by way of earlier sites of musical delirium. Judiciously, because composers cannot pretend to be prophets any more, the music implies Skryabin in its flights of repetition. At one point there is a close encounter with Schoenberg's E major Chamber Symphony. And repeatedly the first of the two movements hovers towards a waltz rhythm that suggests the mania of Ravel's La Valse. Yet all the time we are being quiet. We are watching and waiting. The music seems to be drawn in strokes of light, playing over the instruments. The ideas are usually brief, often pregnant, and yet nearly always surprising - surprising by a change of colour, an unexpected interval, a luminescence of harmony. What is also surprising, even puzzling, is the form of the piece. Goehr tells us that his first idea was of a single movement that dissolves, but that he then added a shorter, more continuous extension, in a more settled tempo and in a different colour, marked especially by the entrance of the celesta in a recurrent motif of toy oscillations. The wondering and the wandering go on, until there is another dissolve. The enigma is redoubled, because the opportunity for a solution is taken and also courteously declined. Colossos or Panic is made with a typical generosity to musicians and to listeners: it plays well (the loose scoring provides splendid opportunities for musicianship, as many of the Boston players showed) and it sounds well. If, nevertheless, it is an elusive piece, that may be because of Goehr's wariness of the colossal, the imposing, as an ideal for himself or for his music.</p>

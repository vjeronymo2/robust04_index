			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR TO COMMUNISTS  </P> <P> Jules Feiffer's depiction of the aging communist of the '30s (Sept. 24)  couldn't be more unfair. Most people who joined the Communist Party ended their  membership when they were able to divine the villainy of Stalin. Some stayed  with the resolve to improve their party. I am aware of none who have concealed  from their consciences the many ugly realities of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> To those types of Depression-era communists, the right-headedness of Gorbachev  is certainly no embarrassment. Given their disillusionment, their dedication to  progress and the persecution they have suffered in this country, it should be  of surprise to no one that they may look upon his actions with a certain amount  of suspicion.  </P> <P> Then again, Jules Feiffer is a rather admirable fellow himself, not to mention  creative and intelligent. It's entirely possible that the grumpy old man in his  cartoon is not the run-of-the-mine American Red at all, but rather the breed  apart: that sanctimonious coward who will call himself by whatever name is  fashionable at the time.  </P> <P> RONALD WEBSTER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

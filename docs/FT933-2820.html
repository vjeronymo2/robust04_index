			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures drop STERLING interest rate futures fell sharply yesterday following a surprisingly large rise in the retail prices index in August, writes James Blitz. In the 12 months to August, the RPI increased by 1.7 per cent, from 1.4 per cent in the year to July. The year-on-year figure for last month was the highest since March, and raised speculation that UK base rates would not be cut so quickly. The revised expectations were most noticeable in the sterling interest rate futures market, which effectively dis-missed any possibility of rates being eased by the end of the year. The December contract fell 10 basis points to close at 94.19 and the March 1994 contract also dropped 10 basis points, finishing at 94.28. Both of these prices were compatible with rates remaining unchanged next year. In the cash market, three-month money firmed to end at 5 31/32 per cent from a previous 5 7/8 per cent. Conditions in the German cash market were considerably easier yesterday after the Bundesbank added substan-tially more liquidity in its weekly money market operations than dealers had expected. German call money has been at very high levels in recent days because commercial banks were unwilling to borrow funds in last week's money market operation, anticipating that a discount rate cut would bring cheaper money. Yesterday, the central bank surprised dealers by adding a great deal more liquidity than had been expected. A net DM24.4bn was injected, against expectations of, at best, DM20bn. The Bundesbank only needed to accept 55 per cent of the bids made by the banks, such was the enthusiasm for funds. Call money consequently fell sharply to close at around 6.75 per cent from a previous 7.25 per cent. The December Euromark contract was barely changed, declining 1 basis point to close at 93.92. French franc interest rates were a great deal more depressed, however, as dealers continued to take the view that France would only lower its official interest rates very slowly. The December Pibor contract dropped 7 basis points to finish at 93.38, in spite of a relatively robust performance by the French currency.</p>

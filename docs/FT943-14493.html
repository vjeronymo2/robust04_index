			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Arts: Warmed-up leftovers - Cinema MAVERICK (PG) Richard Donner THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES (PG) Penelope Spheeris MA SAISON PREFEREE (15) Andre Techine GYPSY (U) Emile Ardolino RENAISSANCE MAN (12)Penny Marshall One film with a special set of characteristics is an accident. Two with the same set is a coincidence. Three is a starting gun to the world's trend-spotting film critics. Pausing only to grasp their essay pens, they hurtle into action, hypotheses flailing. Maverick, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Flintstones - three movies based on old American TV series, opening this week and next in Britain] This must mean that western popular culture is undergoing an important new spasm. If only. But if the large screen is raiding the small, it is no more than a twitch on a now well-established graph line. Where were these 'Eureka]' critics while the skies were raining Batmans, Star Treks and Addams Families? In Hollywood, as we in the 1990s surely know, the sons and daughters of yesterday's couch potatoes are today's popcorn fodder. The new TV adaptations, like the earlier ones, each take a once popular series that rejoiced in skimpy production values and give them the big-dollar treatment. And each trusts that a freshly campy approach to material that was already tongue-in-cheek will be hailed as the New Sophistication. What we have in Maverick is two hours of the new smugness. The 1960s tele-series, starring James Garner as the poker-playing dandy with the wry, rictus grin and the six-gun concealed in his corset, was a noted insomnia cure in its own right: although today's critics are already canonising its halcyon charm. Maverick the movie kicks Mr Garner upstairs - into the role of senior gunfighter - while passing Mel Gibson the smirk, the suit and the stack of cards. Can our hero win the ultimate poker tournament to be held aboard the ultimate Mississippi steamboat? Can he get to the steamboat, past a narrative obstacle course containing Red Indians, enemy gamblers, sudden guest stars (James Coburn) and thieving saloon beauties (Jodie Foster)? Not to mention all those slapstick fight scenes, in which every bullet or blow of fist solicits an audience chortle. 'It's not unlike the Lethal Weapon movies,' Gibson has said in interviews: in case we thought that the film was based on exhaustive historical research. This Bret Maverick quips, smirks and double-takes; he turns on and off the sudden violence; and he is directed by Lethal's very own Richard Donner with Lethal buddy Danny Glover popping up in a two-second bandit cameo. Elsewhere we have a funny bit about politically correct Indians; a funny bit about a runaway stagecoach; and another funny bit about a sackful of rattlesnakes at a lynching. The problem with these funny bits is that for the most part, as directed by Donner and scripted by William (Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid) Goldman, they are not funny. The only thing that held my attention throughout was Miss Foster. Can Our Lady of the Silent Lambs, I wondered, stretch her range do a knockabout comical role? Not quite. But unlike the rest of the rheumatic reflex artists around her, she does try. The press show of The Beverly Hillbillies saw at least one early walk-out from a critic. But who am I to wag a finger? I kept falling asleep. I dreamed that a jalopyful of peasants with twanging accents journeyed to Beverly Hills, after striking oil in the Arkanas backwoods, and became enmeshed in a chaotic plot about evil businessmen (Dabney Coleman), shape-changing secretaries (Lily Tomlin) and sudden guest stars (Buddy Ebsen). Ah - that was the film? And there was I thinking I was still in Maverick; or that my dreams urgently needed a new scriptwriter. This film employed no less than four, none of whom seems to have been able to come up with an original comic moment. Jim Varney, Cloris Leachman and Diedrich Bader are among the Ozark-accented muggers. And the director is the once-promising Penelope (Suburbia, Dudes) Spheeris. Elsewhere in this non-improving week, you have a choice of female monuments. After watching Ma Saison Preferee and Gypsy on the same day - let us call it Black Monday - a terrible urge came upon me to swap the female leads. The French film's glacial, torpid study of a brother-sister relationship riven by love-hate - he (Daniel Auteuil) is a tormented, philandering brain surgeon, she (Catherine Deneuve) is a repressed public notary - would surely be livened up if we replaced Deneuve with Bette Midler? And Gypsy, a loud, stagy rehash of the Styne-Sondheim musical, might have a surreal charm if Hurricane Bette as Gypsy Rose Lee's all-singing, all-screaming stage momma were replaced by ice-cool Catherine. She would delicately urge her daughter to enter the lower depths of show business, invoking the cultural precedent of Toulouse-Lautrec or the fruitful existential anguish of Juliette Greco. Meanwhile Midler would be found somewhere in France, raising vocal hell: a banshee let loose in the banlieu. Instead the two stars stand around firming up the cliches of their respective vehicles. Andre Techine's listless chamber drama embodies everything bad about modern French cinema. Its tasteful lesson in family tension, full of pinched-nerve emotions and pseudo-profundities, resembles a TV daytime soap rewritten by Andre Malraux. And Deneuve is as elegantly dull as only she today can be. A once expressive actress - remember Polanski's Repulsion? - is now cast forever as the First Lady of French cinema. If Hollywood had a star as inanimate as this, they would consign her to stand-in work for the Columbia torch lady. What France, in turn, would do with La Midler we can only guess. Position her, perhaps, at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel as a warning to all French people going west: 'Apres ca, le deluge.' In Gypsy Midler bawls, screams, wheedles, cries, laughs and occasionally sings. The rest of the cast, including Cynthia Gibb's pretty Louise and Peter Riegert's perky Herbie, are wiped out. For Midler in this form is not so much an actress: more an exploding barrage balloon with teeth. By default the week's best film is Renaissance Man, which in a good week might be the worst. Danny DeVito, failed advertising man turned supply teacher, instructs six backward army cadets in the delights of Hamlet. They rebel; they hellraise; then finally - what else - they knuckle down and come to love the Bard. By final curtain they have all turned into G. Wilson Knights and are changing the face of Shakespeare interpretation. You have to love a film like this. It is foolish, sentimental, and as directed by Penny Marshall (Awakenings) earnestly inspirational. But at least it is not based on a TV series, does not star Mel Gibson and does not lean for support on a once-great diva past her prime.</p>

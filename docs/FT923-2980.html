			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Arts: Les Six, street music and Sinopoli - Lucerne Festival Despite the woolly choice of 'Europe' as its theme, Lucerne emerged from this year's festival with its reputation for resourceful programming intact. The Columbus anniversary was celebrated in two concerts - one pairing grandiose tributes to the explorer by the youthful Wagner and Honegger, the other devoted to Renaissance music and directed by Jordi Savall, who seems to be doing for early and classical Spanish music what Hogwood, Pinnock and others have done for Bach and Handel. The other subsidiary theme was Les Six, three of whom - Honegger, Milhaud and Tailleferre - were born 100 years ago. The festival laid on an admirable series of lunch concerts to explore the chamber music, but the centrepiece was a surrealist double bill in the city theatre - the Cocteau ballet Les maries de la tour Eiffel, to which five members of Les Six contributed, and Poulenc's opera-bouffe Les mamelles de Tiresias. The ballet describes the bizarre characters and events at a bourgeois wedding party on the Eiffel Tower. It may no longer shock audiences in the way Cocteau intended in 1921, and its structure and content are slight; but it adds up to a fast and mischievous entertainment, with an authentic Gallic levity deriving as much from Cocteau's spoken commentary as from the music. Auric wrote the explosive overture, Tailleferre a cheeky 'waltz of the telegrammes', Honegger a parody of a funeral march and Milhaud the raucous, pompous finale. There are ten short numbers in all, of which only Poulenc's charming 'Bathing-girl of Trouville' is ever heard independently. As Ronald Crichton points out in an illuminating essay on Milhaud in this month's Opera, Les Six were bound more by personal friendship than by similar musical tastes - and yet this work, premiered a year after they were christened as a group, shows a distinct compatibility of style. It should be less of a rarity. Thorsten Kreissig's choreography was fussy, but the conductor, Olaf Henzold, captured the wit and scintillating colour of the music. The double-bill with Les mamelles made sense on paper, but after the farcical goings-on of the ballet, the opera was an anti-climax. Something of greater contrast - perhaps La voix humaine - was needed, and the dialogue of Poulenc's domestic allegory, based on a play by Apollinaire, lost its spice in German translation. But the biggest handicap was the staging. Instead of trusting the natural comic irony of the piece, the producer Philipp Himmelmann loaded each scene with an extra layer of surrealist production baggage, reducing the work to the level of cheap pantomime. The cast, led by Eileen Hulse's spunky Therese, struggled nobly but unsuccessfully to achieve the necessary fluency. Only the poignant lyricism and sincerity of Poulenc's instrumental music emerged unscathed. Lucerne this summer broke with tradition by laying on some high-risk experimental events, including an official street music competition. The question posed by the new festival director Matthias Bamert was: does street music exist as an original art form? The answer - at the end of a noisy, hectic and controversial week of eliminating rounds at selected sites around the city - was 'yes, probably'. But some awkward lessons were learned in the process. The competition, which had the laudable aim of breaking barriers between tourists, townsfolk and the snobby aura of the festival, gelled with the formal events like oil and water, and should in future have a separate slot in Lucerne's summer calendar. Given the bohemian egalitarianism of street musicians and the variety of skills they present, it seemed invidious to single out one group or individual for a big cash prize - especially when the winner turned out to be the daughter of one of the judges. Small wonder this left a bad aftertaste. Lucerne's visiting orchestras offered plenty of high-brow glamour but varying degrees of satisfaction. Claudio Abbado's rapturous Daphnis et Chloe with the Berlin Philharmonic, which I heard on the radio, was billed as complete but in fact was subjected to all sorts of inexplicable cuts. The St Petersburg Philharmonic (with Yuri Temirkanov) followed their glorious Tchaikovsky Manfred Symphony with the Musorgsky/Ravel Pictures from an Exhibition, which exposed weaknesses in the orchestra's brass section and proved how un-Russian this piece really is. The Dresden Staatskapelle's golden-toned, echt-Straussian instrumental solos distinguished their performance of Ein Heldenleben, but their new chief conductor, Giuseppe Sinopoli, laid bare his lack of repertoire with a lumpy, shapeless Schumann Third Symphony. The old way of doing things was for a conductor to build his repertoire slowly and steadily, presenting his interpretations to an international public only when he had lived with the piece, and was properly inside it. Not so today: with Sinopoli and this great German orchestra, the recording contract came first, then the high-profile tours - and the mainstream repertoire is apparently digested somewhere along the way.</p>

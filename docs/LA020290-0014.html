			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR WIN FOR USC ON MINER SHOT;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: RAVELING'S TEAM BEATS UCLA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT  TRIES. BRUINS CAN'T GET OFF LAST-SECOND SHOT AND FALL FROM FIRST, 76-75.  </P> <P> A free throw by freshman Harold Miner with 30 seconds left Thursday night at  the Sports Arena gave USC a 76-75 upset victory over UCLA.  </P> <P> On a night when UCLA's Trevor Wilson fell hard to the floor in the first half,  bruising his back and spraining his right wrist, the Trojans took the lead for  good, strangely enough, after Wilson returned.  </P> <P> USC never trailed in the last 17 minutes as it won for only the second time in  10 Pacific 10 Conference games, knocking UCLA out of a share of the conference  lead. Miner scored 27 points.  </P> <P> UCLA failed to attempt a shot in the last 30 seconds.  </P> <P> After Miner made the second of two free throws, UCLA brought the ball up the  floor and was attempting to set up a potential go-ahead shot when Ronnie  Coleman intercepted a pass by the Bruins' Don MacLean.  </P> <P> "They ran a play we'd practiced against all week," USC Coach George Raveling  said. "They did not run a surprise play."  </P> <P> Coleman was fouled with 7.5 seconds left, but missed the front end of a  one-and-one, giving the Bruins another chance.  </P> <P> This time, Darrick Martin brought the ball up the floor before dishing off too  late to Wilson, who took the pass as the buzzer sounded.  </P> <P> "He didn't bring it up quickly enough," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said of his  sophomore point guard. "Credit that to youth and inexperience. That play didn't  beat us. Twenty-five other plays beat us."  </P> <P> The game was UCLA's worst of the season, Harrick said.  </P> <P> USC ended a four-game losing streak and improved to 7-10 overall in winning for  the first time against UCLA in eight games under Raveling.  </P> <P> UCLA, ranked 16th, fell to 14-4 overall and 8-2 in the Pac-10, a game behind  Oregon State, a 98-81 winner over California Thursday night.  </P> <P> Wilson and freshman Tracy Murray scored 19 points each for the Bruins, who got  12 points and a career-high 16 rebounds from MacLean.  </P> <P> Coleman scored 19 points and had nine rebounds for USC.  </P> <P> "I can't believe this," said MacLean, who made only five of 16 shots and missed  a pair of free throws with 1:40 remaining and UCLA trailing, 73-70. "I can't  believe we lost to these guys when it was so important."  </P> <P> UCLA made only four of 15 free throws in the second half. Wilson, his wrist  ailing, made two of eight.  </P> <P> Asked about his wrist, Wilson said tersely: "Painful."  </P> <P> USC's Calvin Banks, who had made only eight of 32 free throws this season, made  two with 1:38 left to give the Trojans a 75-70 lead.  </P> <P> "I looked over to Coach and he kind of smiled at me, and I smiled back," Banks  said. "That took a little bit of the pressure off."  </P> <P> Wilson then made a running jump shot with 1:10 left to cut the Bruins' deficit  to 75-72. After Banks lost the ball out of bounds, Gerald Madkins made a free  throw for UCLA with 45 seconds left to make it 75-73.  </P> <P> Madkins missed a second foul shot, but Wilson stole the rebound from Keith  Greeley and scored on a layup to tie the score with 38 seconds to go.  </P> <P> It was 75-75, but the Bruins never took another shot.  </P> <P> "A win like this will soothe a lot of wounds," Raveling said. "It's the perfect  balm for our disappointments."  </P> <P> USC was 3-9 under Raveling in games decided by two points or less.  </P> <P> UCLA led, 15-12, when Wilson took his painful tumble.  </P> <P> As USC's Chris Munk drove around Madkins on a fast break with 13:15 left in the  first half, Wilson rose to block Munk's layup attempt. He seemed to graze the  Trojan center and fell hard to the floor along the baseline, landing on his  right side and rolling his body over his right wrist.  </P> <P> Munk missed the shot, but Robert Pack scored on a follow.  </P> <P> "He has a big bruise on his back where he landed," UCLA's team physician,  Gerald Finerman, said of Wilson, who was scheduled to have precautionary X-rays  taken on his wrist later in the evening.  </P> <P> With Finerman and trainer Tony Spino attending to Wilson on the bench, the  Bruins then outscored USC, 13-6, to open a 28-18 lead.  </P> <P> Wilson eventually was taken to the locker room for treatment before returning  to the bench with five minutes left in the half.  </P> <P> In Wilson's absence, Murray scored 13 of his 15 first-half points, making four  of six shots as UCLA forged a 44-38 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Miner, limited to six-of-20 shooting and 15 points last month in the Trojans'  89-72 loss to the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion, scored 14 points in the first  half, making five of 10 shots.  </P> <P> Wilson, his wrist taped, returned for the second half.  </P> <P> Even with Wilson back on the floor, however, USC outscored the Bruins, 13-2, to  start the half. Pack scored the Trojans' first 10 points, making a pair of  three-point shots as USC pulled even at 46-46, then stripping MacLean and  scoring on a layup to give USC a 48-46 lead.  </P> <P> Miner then made a three-point shot to make it 51-46.  </P> <P> Trojan-Bruin Notes  </P> <P> In four games as the Bruins' starting center, Tracy Murray is averaging 18.2  points and 5.2 rebounds and has made 65% of his shots. "The addition of Murray  has made our team more fluid, a lot better offensively," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick  said. "He's made us a lot better club." And don't be too hasty in conceding  Pac-10 freshman of the year honors to USC's Harold Miner, Harrick said this  week, invoking the names of Murray and California's Brian Hendrick. Columnist  Joe Jares of the L. A. Daily News told Harrick at Harrick's weekly media  luncheon: "I'd probably give it to Murray because he sat in front of me at a  Westwood theater the other day and had the courtesy to move." Murray is 6-8,  with a flattop haircut that rises at least another inch above the top of his  head.  </P></p>

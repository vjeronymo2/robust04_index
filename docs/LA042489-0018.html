			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'TRAIL DAYS' WORK PARTY GIVES STATE PARK A SPRING CLEANING  </P> <P> Bob Hotel, a 55-year-old ex-track coach who on Saturday ran 24 miles to the top  of Mt. Wilson, spent several hours Sunday swinging a pickax, helping to cut a  new trail through Point Mugu State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> "I stretched out real good before I came here," the Manhattan Beach resident  said, with sweat rolling down his nose. "Besides, I'm not using my legs, just  my upper body."  </P> <P> Pam Maine, 29, an executive secretary and mountain bike enthusiast who wanted  to improve the image of bicyclists as well as the trails, also swung an ax  during the eighth annual "Trail Days" working party.  </P> <P> "Mountain bikers are supposedly folks who rip up trails," said Maine, a  Woodland Hills resident who is training to compete in national off-road bike  events. "We're doing our thing for the cause of mountain bikers, so the Sierra  Club won't look upon us so badly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bikers and Hikers  </P> <P> Nearly a dozen mountain bikers worked side-by-side with about 30 hikers this  weekend during the two-day spring cleanup event, sponsored by the Sierra Club,  the state Department of Parks and Recreation and the mountains' Trail Council.  </P> <P> Although bikers are restricted to fire roads and not allowed to use the park's  trails, several said they hope someday their efforts will pay off with greater  access.  </P> <P> "We're trying to work with other user groups to show we're not just a bunch of  young kamikazes," said biker Peter Heuman, 33, of Woodland Hills as he dug  rocks and roots out of a trail in Sycamore Canyon. "We're trying to give  something back to the mountains, as well as to use them."  </P> <P> Point Mugu, popular among bikers and horse riders as well as hikers, is an area  near the western edge of the Santa Monica Mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles  counties. It can be reached from Thousand Oaks to the north or from the Pacific  Coast Highway on the south.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Short Section  </P> <P> The weekend working party concentrated on a 1 1/2-mile section of the 55-mile  Backbone Trail that runs from the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu up to the spine  of the mountains and down to end at Will Rogers State Park. In the area where  most of the crew worked Sunday the air was pungent with sage. Sharp-spined  yucca guarded the hillsides and golden yarrow and elderberry provided splashes  of color.  </P> <P> Wayne Deese, a state park ranger, said the turnout for the weekend event was  smaller than expected. But, he said, "everybody that's been here really worked,  so we got almost as much done."  </P> <P> The Sierra Club's Ron Webster, who has been building trails in the Santa  Monicas for 17 years, said half a mile of trail was pioneered this weekend.  Other crews will return to smooth and widen it. Volunteers also helped remove  obsolete fencing and cut brush and branches encroaching on the trail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sore Muscles  </P> <P> The price of the hard work, however, will be paid in sore muscles and bandaged  blisters. Dennis Halliwell, 34, of Tujunga worked both days, camping Friday and  Saturday nights at Danielson Ranch to get an early start. On Sunday, he  complained of blisters on his hands, a sore back and tender thigh muscles.  </P> <P> "For the next couple of days, I'll feel it," said Halliwell, who said he lifts  nothing heavier than screwdrivers in his job installing commercial sound  systems. But the discomfort has not deterred him from returning for four years  running to work on the trails.  </P> <P> "We're just doing our part, since we use them," Halliwell said.  </P></p>

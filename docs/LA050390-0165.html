			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> A CUP OF JAVA;  </P> <P> COFFEE: IT GIVES PEOPLE AN EXCUSE TO GATHER, SIP AND REVEAL WHAT THEY'RE  THINKING  </P> <P> Coffee makes politicians wise (according to Alexander Pope), fills 400 million  cups in the United States daily (according to the World Book encyclopedia) and  was discovered more than 700 years ago by Ethiopian shepherds who noticed their  flocks nibbling green shrubs and staying up all night (according to a legend we  wonder about).  </P> <P> But the best thing about coffee may be that it gives people an excuse to  gather, to sip and to disclose what they're thinking. And you never know what  someone's thinking until you listen, especially in a place like Ventura County,  where the population swells daily with new surfers, Seabees, Angelenos,  agricultural workers, Oxnard youths and Simi Valley seniors.  </P> <P> And so, seeking the hidden truth about this place, Ventura County Life went out  for coffee -- a dozen cups of it, in sturdy mugs and fine china, by the ocean  and the avenue. Through eavesdropping and inquiry, we met a sleeping snake and  a crew-cut revolutionary, heard talk of camel-mounting and numerology. We  pondered an insect collection, and the subtle circumstances said to produce a  pink moment.  </P> <P> And we switched to decaf.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Live Lions and One Dead Deer  </P> <P> Cactus Patch Cafe  </P> <P> 197 E. High St., Moorpark  </P> <P> The Scene: Amiable and countrified. On the wall behind the counter, the stuffed  head of an eight-point buck. A rack of mugs belonging to George, Andy, Nina,  Howard and someone who loves his or her spaniel. Also, some Western art,  assorted firearms and hatchets, and a lariat dangling from the ceiling. On  first and third Thursdays, Lions gather here -- the dues-paying variety.  </P> <P> The Cup: White, of standard cafeteria stock, with a red leaf pattern running  around the top. Liquid cream in a stainless steel cup on the counter -- 65  cents.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Music involving a fiddle on the sound system. Soft clinking, as  a busboy strides down the aisle with seven coffee cups, empty, in one hand. And  lots of chat, it being 9 a.m. on a weekday.  </P> <P> The Truth: None of the regular customers really loves his or her spaniel that  much; somebody just left the mug behind one day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where Oil and Water Mix  </P> <P> The Cliff House Hotel  </P> <P> The Shoals Restaurant  </P> <P> 6602 W. Pacific Coast Highway,  </P> <P> Mussel Shoals  </P> <P> The Scene: A 43-year-old family-run hotel and restaurant with a lap pool, half  a dozen palm trees drooping over it, and a bizarre position near the Rincon  shore between two oil platform bridges.  </P> <P> The Cup: In the morning, free to hotel guests and stealthful interlopers -- but  forbidden to others, since the restaurant is closed then -- $1 with a dinner  (which begins at $11.95) or just dessert ($4.25) from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.  The cups are plastic foam by morning, with cream in plastic thimbles. By night,  china.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Waves crashing on rocks. Bird twitter. And Michele Porter,  co-proprietor, saying, "Most of our guests are yuppie types from L.A. looking  for peace and quiet. And finding it."  </P> <P> The Truth: The place looks downright dignified now, but through the early  1970s, Porter says, it was a bohemian apartment complex -- lots of surfers and  students from Santa Barbara's Brooks Institute of Photography, who for a while  had their own darkroom on the premises. Notable detail: This is the westernmost  cup of coffee in mainland Ventura County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coffee-Mate and a Snake  </P> <P> Little Manila Restaurant  </P> <P> 3630 Saviers Road, Oxnard  </P> <P> The Scene: In the corner of a strip mall, between Tino's Pizza and the D-Mar  Beauty &amp; Barber Shop. Inside, duct tape on the red carpet, a pool table in  the corner, and a reflecting ball above the central dance floor (this is Club  Manila on Friday and Saturday nights). Also, a couple of aquariums and one  terrarium (its scaled occupant was asleep), which may make Little Manila the  only restaurant in the county offering snakeside dining. What kind of snake is  it? "Ah, I don't know," says owner Sing Cunanan. "It's just here. . . " and he  finishes the sentence under his breath.  </P> <P> The Cup: Shiny cafeteria white, with a green pattern on its side. It comes on a  saucer, with a packet of powdered Coffee-Mate, for 50 cents. Prompt and  solicitous service.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: CNN on the big-screen television, the clinking of balls on the  pool table. Among the four or five patrons on a Monday afternoon, lots of  animated talk -- and all of it in Tagalog or other Philippine dialects.  </P> <P> The Truth: Unascertainable, until we learn Tagalog.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Numerologist's Tale  </P> <P> Le Petit Boulangerie  </P> <P> 968 S. Westlake Blvd., Westlake Village  </P> <P> The Scene: A popular morning stop in a leafy, tile-topped upscale mall. Lots of  red and white, and at 7:45 on a Friday morning, a steady procession of  prosperous coffee consumers.  </P> <P> The Cup: A high-powered plastic foam cupful -- 75 cents. Cream on the  self-service counter in plastic thimbles or an iced carafe.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Classical music, the hum of the revolving bakery display and a  wide-ranging conversation among the party of five at the next table. Retinal  scans, the relative merits of B. Dalton and Waldenbooks, the merchandise of  stores in the Akron chain -- none was overlooked. Nor were Shirley MacLaine,  crystals and the pursuit of numerology.  </P> <P> The Truth: Or at least it might be the truth. A man in jeans and a gray sweat  shirt sits revealing his first encounter with a numerologist. "She told me I  would meet a girl with black hair, a black dog, a black car, and who was born  Oct. 11," he says. Five months later, his story goes, he did.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weiners and Lost Love  </P> <P> Top Hat  </P> <P> 299 E. Main St., Ventura  </P> <P> The Scene: East Main and Palm, in a tiny corner building among the antique  stores and thrift shops of old Ventura. Two servers in Top Hat blouses power  their way through the lunchtime rush. As one reaches for the counter, a tattoo  peeks from her neckline. Customers stand, or sit at stools on the sidewalk.  "Your mother doesn't work here," says a sign in the kitchen. "Clean up your own  mess."  </P> <P> The Cup: Plastic foam, of course, but only 25 cents for a small one. Liquid  cream, from a dispenser they keep just inside the counter screen.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Traffic, vehicular and pedestrian, and the gurgle of grease in  the french fry fryers.  </P> <P> The Truth: An awkward one. "How's Louis?" says person No. 1. "I'm not with him  anymore," says person No. 2. "That was a long time ago, thank God."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Global Problems Solved Here  </P> <P> Mission Bell Cafe  </P> <P> 3241 Main St., Ventura  </P> <P> The Scene: Close quarters, but comfortable. Heavy traffic in regulars,  including Leighton Stuart, a beefy electrician who wears a crew cut and sits at  the counter second-guessing city, county, state and federal officials.  </P> <P> The Cup: A light brown mug, bearing signs of more than a few washings -- 75  cents. Cream along the counter in little thimbles.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Somebody on the sound system, not Sinatra, singing "My Way."  The busboy calling for Stuart's attention, saying "Let me show you one of your  relatives," and reaching for a newspaper photo of some successful bank robbers.  And Stuart cutting the busboy off. "Those ain't my relatives," he says, "or I'd  be down at the Pierpont Inn."  </P> <P> The Truth: "I'm a revolutionary," Stuart says, and he begins assembling a  manifesto out loud. Exxon got off easy for its oil spill, he says, and the City  Council is moving too fast and thinking too little about water-conservation  measures. And the drivers in Ventura just keep getting worse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Of Bugs and Camels  </P> <P> Pierpont Inn  </P> <P> 550 Sanjon Road, Ventura  </P> <P> The Scene: A darkish room with a view of a bright garden and, beyond it, the  freeway and the sea. Heavy wood paneling and, in the lobby, a collection of  butterflies, moths and beetles (including one 5 inches long), framed and  preserved under glass near the restaurant entrance. At 8:45 on a Wednesday  morning, just two occupied tables (business guests are more frequent on  Mondays).  </P> <P> The Cup: Beige, with a brown ring around the top and matching saucer -- $1,  recently raised from 75 cents. Cream in a cup at the table.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Talk from the foursome at the next table, which includes a  visiting couple from Chicago. Subjects include medical research and a  once-upon-a-time vacation in Morocco, when camels were ridden and there was  some trouble with the mounting. The man in this couple has a low, rumbling  voice, which carries.  </P> <P> The Truth: "A camel doesn't get up gently," says the voice. "It jerks." (About  the bugs. They were part of a collection gathered by co-owner Ted Gleichmann,  who died in 1976.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Sliding Coffee Scale  </P> <P> The Rock House  </P> <P> 396 Ventura Ave., Ventura  </P> <P> The Scene: Positively Ventura Avenue, with the Eclectic Fighting Arts Institute  just across the street. Inside, darkness, a dozen framed mirrors with  beer-label designs, and at 10 a.m. on a weekday, no customers. The place is  quiet and tidy, but the drum set of The Southbound Band, now appearing Friday  and Saturday nights, stands in the darkest corner hinting at noises to come.  </P> <P> The Cup: A plastic mug, with a plastic stirring straw and cream poured by  bartender David Roundsavill. Free to regulars.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Whoosh of passing cars. Jukebox idle.  </P> <P> The Truth: "In the mornings, we'll go through a lot of coffee on regular  customers. If it's too early to start drinking, we'll just keep the coffee  going," says Roundsavill, a 10 a.m. glass of beer near his elbow. "If a street  person comes in and wants coffee, I'll tell them 50 cents, and they'll just  walk on out."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Destiny and Joan Crawford  </P> <P> Stella's Gourmet Restaurant  </P> <P> 2385 Michael Drive, Newbury Park  </P> <P> The Scene: Affluent suburbia -- a shopping center with 31-flavor ice cream,  60-minute photo, 30-minute pizza, the whole upper-middle-class magilla.  Stella's stakes out its space with a handful of umbrellas, a smallish indoor  eating area and a biggish menu. It runs nine pages, with a table of contents,  credits for the copywriter and calligrapher, and this opening sentence:  "Perhaps it was destiny . . ."  </P> <P> The Cup: Thick, white china, with liquid cream in thimbles -- $1.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Soft rock, resonating from the gray-tile floor and the  wall-mirror panels. Late on a weekday morning, the murmur of a few quiet  customers.  </P> <P> The Truth: Never mind destiny. More likely it was celebrity, and that large  menu, that made Stella's what it is. Stella's dad emigrated from Greece in 1905  at age 14, and went on to open the 101 Ranch House in Oxnard, which, it says on  the menu, fed such celebrities as Joan Crawford, Richard Burton and Charles  Laughton. Now, having run her own place since 1981, Stella Scholle serves  sandwiches named after John Wayne and Shelley Winters to the people of Newbury  Park.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brickwork and Horse Talk  </P> <P> Appetite Alley  </P> <P> 322 1/2 Central Ave., Fillmore  </P> <P> The Scene: On the redeveloping main drag of tiny downtown Fillmore, where  ranchers and their new neighbors step carefully around the fancy sidewalk  brickwork. A regular morning group inhabits Appetite Alley.  </P> <P> The Cup: White, with the restaurant name in green lettering on the side. Price  advertised on the wall paneling near the front -- 40 cents. Cream from a  carton.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Real estate businessman John McKinnon asking former jockey  Shorty Belloumini what he feeds a young colt. Lots of ribbing among locals.  </P> <P> The Truth: While big-city ways invade the rest of the county, Belloumini and a  few of his neighbors cling to country ways. Belloumini sold a horse the other  day, says McKinnon, by handing over the reigns and telling the new owner to try  the animal out for a few weeks and, if all went well, to send along a check.  Belloumini, in his 80s, has lived in Fillmore for 46 years. McKinnon has been  there for eight, but says "you have to have someone buried here to call  yourself a native."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caution: Shells Underfoot  </P> <P> The Oak Pit  </P> <P> 830 Ventura Ave., Oak View  </P> <P> The Scene: A barbecue joint, with the scent from the grill rising. A pair of  12-point horns on the wall in the place of honor, and a bear's head staring out  from over the front door. Peanuts in baskets on the tables, a wagon-wheel  chandelier, and this small sign at the counter: "Stuff Occurs."  </P> <P> The Cup: Dark brown and white. Cream in a stainless cup -- 50 cents.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Crunching, loud and steady, as customers tromp on thousands of  peanut-shell fragments scattered underfoot. And the voice of manager Tricia  Clegg, whose parents own the place, explaining that one night three or four  years ago, "these people wanted to have a party here, and they wanted peanuts  and beer before they ate. And they had a peanut fight. We just never cleaned  them up. . . . It creates the right atmosphere."  </P> <P> The Truth: Actually, they pick non-peanut detritus out of the shells every  night, and they sweep out the shells every two or three weeks. But they keep  putting out peanuts, so the shells keep falling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Pink Moment, as Advertised  </P> <P> Bill Baker's Bakery  </P> <P> 457 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai  </P> <P> The Scene: A constellation of wooden tables, mostly empty, in the noon calm  after the usual weekday morning storm. One waitress at the counter, the other  in a seat for the moment, poring over a newspaper.  </P> <P> The Cup: Plastic foam again, at a cost of 45 cents for a small, with cream  waiting in a big pitcher on the counter.  </P> <P> The Soundtrack: Mysterious bakery noises emanating from the rear of the  building.  </P> <P> The Truth: The summer Ojai Festival is coming up, and one of the event's  promotional brochures is here, urging visitors to come see "the mysterious and  breath-taking pink moment (flooding the Ojai Valley at sunset)." Both bakery  waitresses deny knowledge of said moment. A woman at the spiritually inclined  knickknack store next door suggests that it has something to do with sunlight  and mineral dust. Somebody else says it's the depth of the valley and the angle  of the sun. We could probably find another source and puzzle this whole pink  thing out over a cup of coffee, but frankly, we're trying to cut down.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In providing information on linkages, proposers should keep in mind that Job Corps is an open-entry, open-exit, individualized, self-paced instructional program that operates on a year-round basis. This type of learning environment may have implications for the types of linkages being offered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing the linkage/contribution part of their proposals, eligible applicants should provide full information on each proposed linkage/contribution. Each item listed above should be addressed for each linkage/contribution, providing as much information as is needed to ensure that each proposed linkage receives a fair assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should include any other information the applicant believes pertinent to the proposed site for consideration by the Department. This information may include: letters of community support from elected officials, government agencies, community leaders and neighborhood associations; access to cultural/recreation activities in the community; and unique features in the surrounding area which would enhance the location of a Job Corps center at that site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, proposals should indicate whether or not the proposed site is located in either a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. The Department will verify any designation referenced in the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Job Corps legislation provides the Governor with the opportunity to veto the establishment of a center within a State. It is important that, before proposing the use of any particular location, appropriate clearances are obtained from local and State political leadership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to timeframes for choosing sites for the establishment of Job Corps centers, the site selection process normally take 8 months to complete. This allows sufficient time for eligible applicants to prepare and submit proposals and for the Department to conduct a preliminary site assessment of all proposed facilities, as well as a comprehensive site utilization study for those sites having high potential for the establishment of a Job Corps center, based on the preliminary assessment results. Governors of States in which high-potential sites are identified will be provided written notification by the Department, in accordance with section 435(c) of the Job Training Partnership Act, that these sites are in a final phase of consideration. Each Governor will be provided a 30-day time period to approve or reject further consideration of establishment of a Job Corps center at the identified site(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department hereby requests eligible proposers to submit proposals to be received no later than March 13, 1995, using the guidance provided above. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed in Washington, DC, this 9th day of November, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Doug Ross, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary of Labor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28281 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 12 KYODO -- Draft proposals for the  restructuring of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) urge the  facility to avoid wasting money by setting up a 30-nation body  to oversee the funding and carrying out of projects, government  sources said Saturday [12 March].    The draft notes that in some cases funds may have been  wasted  because the opinions of developing countries were not fully  taken into account when funds were distributed.    It says membership of the assessment body should reflect  opinion among all countries concerned, including developing ones.    Japan contributes funds to the GEF and the sources said the  government is likely to accept most of the provisions of the  draft.    The GEF began operations in 1990 to provide grants for  assisting developing countries to protect the global  environment, including combating global warming and pollution of  international waters, and for transferring environmentally  benign technology.    Responsibility for implementing the GEF is shared by the  United Nations Development Program, the UN Environment Program  and the World Bank.    But many developing countries have criticized GEF  operations,  prompting agreement at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro  that it be restructured.    Participating countries have also agreed that the facility's  current total funding of 800 million dollars be increased to 2  billion dollars.    The draft suggests that the voting system also take into  account developing countries' wishes with a dual vote system  consisting of a "one country-one vote" system combined with a  second-round vote, with votes weighted depending on the amount  of funds contributed.    The final draft will be debated at a March 14-16 meeting of  countries concerned in Geneva.</p>

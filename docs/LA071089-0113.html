			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LEMOND STILL OUT FRONT IN CYCLING RACE  </P> <P> Greg LeMond of the United States held his lead today after the first tough  mountain stage of the Tour de France cycling race, sticking with the other  leaders in a roller-coaster ride.  </P> <P> LeMond finished eighth for the day, almost two minutes behind Miguel Indurain  of Spain, who won the stage in 4 hours, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.  </P> <P> But he was right on the wheel of two-time winner Laurent Fignon of France, who  finished seventh in the same time as LeMond and remained in second place  overall, five seconds back.  </P> <P> Last year's winner, Pedro Delgado of Spain, finished third in today's 91-mile  course over four steep mountain climbs but picked up only 29 seconds on LeMond,  not nearly enough to catch him.  </P> <P> Several other serious contenders also ended today's stage in a tight group  around LeMond, including Sean Kelly of Ireland, Stephen Rooks of the  Netherlands and Charly Mottet of France, all within seconds of one another.  </P> <P> Andy Hampsten of the United States was 14th, 2:28 back of Indurain, and lost  half a minute to LeMond in the overall standings.  </P> <P> Another rugged mountain ride awaits the cyclists Tuesday, taking them 85 miles  from Cauterets to Luchon-Superbagneres.  </P></p>

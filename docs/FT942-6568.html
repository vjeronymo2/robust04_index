			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / 5,000 teachers may face redundancy Redundancy threatens 5,000 teachers in England and Wales at the end of this school term, according to data released to unions by local education authorities and schools. By law, schools have to give notice to staff and unions of the potential number of redundancies for the following academic year by the end of May. An analysis of these formal notices in 34 local authorities by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers shows that 1,732 teachers are under threat of redundancy. If this pattern is repeated across all 115 local education authorities, about 5,000 teachers are under threat. Not all schools which have made an official warning will necessarily cut jobs but the figures suggest that budgets are coming under strain. The association suggested that few areas were experiencing falling rolls. Instead, it believed that this year's pay increase for teachers of 2.9 per cent, which schools were required to meet from internal efficiency savings, had led head teachers to consider shedding staff. Added pressures on funding targeted at schools with high numbers of ethnic minorities and the growing number of temporary contracts offered to staff were also held to blame. Mr Peter Smith, association general secretary, claimed that teachers' jobs were being threated by inadequate government funding. More than 100 further education colleges will be hit by strikes next month, the Natfhe lecturers' union said at its annual conference in Southport, Merseyside, yesterday. The union is in dispute with the Colleges' Employers' Forum over new which were unveiled in May last year. It has abandoned national negotiations and is discussing contracts with individual colleges. Natfhe has announced an agree-ment with Manchester College of Art and Technology to introduce a new contract allowing a six-week holiday each summer and guaranteeing limits on teaching hours and the working week. Natfhe said it was confident that the contract would satisfy the criteria for flexibility laid down by the Further Education Funding Council for England, the quango which controls funding for the sector.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Hong Kong business cools on democracy plans SUPPORT among Hong Kong's business community for Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, is rapidly evaporating in the face of the concerted opposition from Beijing to his proposals for more democracy in Hong Kong. Many business people were alarmed by China's effective halt of the future development of the colony's container port by its threat last week not to honour the Hong Kong government's proposed plans for expansion of the port. This concern was heightened on Monday when Beijing said that all agreements entered into by the Hong Kong government would be invalid after 1997 if not agreed to by China. Business people took little comfort from China's assurance that it continued to welcome foreign investment in the colony. Business people believe that Mr Patten is acting precipitately in his attitude toward China and has embarked on a quest that has little or no chance of success. China, they claim, may compromise on economic issues when it is in its interests to do so, but not on matters of politics. Influential figures among the British business community in Hong Kong fear that Mr Patten has gone about dealing with China in a confrontational way which has succeeded only in hardening Beijing's resistance to his ideas for limited democracy in the colony. 'Confronting China head-on is not the way to deal with the Chinese,' said the head of one large diversified trading company. 'He has given them no room for manoeuvre.' Few business leaders, either British or Chinese, will speak publicly about their disquiet. In private, however, many are concerned about possible Chinese retaliation which could affect their business interests in Hong Kong and their prospects in China. According to the finance director of one local electronics company: 'I'm not sure that Mr Patten knows what he is doing. If you look at what has been happening in China it is helpful to business. Why change Hong Kong now? There is no need to.' Mr John Mulcahy, head of research at Peregrine, a local brokerage, said: 'I do not believe the position he has adopted is winnable. He has taken the risk and I think he has failed. 'There has not been a mood as divisive and anxious in Hong Kong as prevails today since the early 1980s. If that is what he has set out to achieve then he has achieved it.' This view is not, however, universally held. Nor is opposition to Mr Patten total among business people. Some leading members of the business community have welcomed his open style of leadership and the way in which he has brought the political problems facing Hong Kong to the public's attention. 'It is better for Hong Kong that the issue of democracy and the colony's relationship with China is settled once and for all,' said one taipan. Another top executive of a large Anglo-Chinese company said: 'We have to back the governor. Those who are criticising him now are the ones that have done well out of the colonial system and fear change.' Editorial comment, Page 20</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a correspondent's report, on 2 June  Surin Deputy Governor Phanat Sakuntanat signed an announcement  opening the border trading point at Chom Pass, Kap Choeng  District on 4 June. This trading point has been closed and  reopened several times due to fighting in nearby parts of  Cambodia.    Meanwhile, a source familiar with the Cambodian border in  Surin Province noted that kidnapping of Thai citizens for ransom  was mostly the result of business blackmail, not hunger. The  problem of Cambodian bandits robbing Thais existed long before  border points were opened for trading.</p>

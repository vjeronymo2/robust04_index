			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE ON MICK  </P> <P> Concerning the Sept. 24 Pop Eye column's mention of Mott the Hoople and  guitarist Mick Ronson and, later, the letter of correction from Michael  Beltramo: Ronson didn't play on any Mott the Hoople albums but he did in fact  join the group in time to play on and produce the last single, "Saturday Gigs."  He also played guitar on the last Mott tour. I hope this will put both Mott  informants in the right!  </P> <P> IAN HUNTER  </P> <P> New York  </P> <P>  Hunter was the founder and leader of Mott the Hoople, a rock band of the '70s.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Bosnian Foreign Minister  Irfan Ljubijankic has stated that the International Conference  Organization's liaison group at its meeting yesterday evening  endorsed a peace plan for Bosnia submitted by Malaysia. In a  statement made after his meeting with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  today, he said that this plan will be issued as a separate  resolution on Bosnia calling for an international peace  conference under UN auspices.    Ljubijankic expressed his hope that this resolution will  enjoy international support, particularly because it receives  major support from the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic  countries.    Discussing the statement released by the Yugoslav Foreign  Ministry regarding Egypt's refusal to invite Serbia and  Montenegro to attend the conference, Ljubijankic said that  Serbia is an aggressive country and it is only natural not to  invite it to attend this gathering. He noted that the refusal  to send an invitation was in line with the agreement reached  among the nonaligned countries in New York. He said that there  is an agreement among these countries not to invite Serbia. The  proof of this is that none of the conference committees raised  the issue, he said.    Ljubijankic said that he held amicable talks with Musa on  the  situation in Bosnia and the topics on the summit's agenda. He  pointed out that Musa affirmed Egypt's support for Bosnia,  noting that an agreement was reached to open an Egyptian Embassy  in Sarajevo. He expressed his satisfaction that his country was  invited to participate in the Nonaligned Movement Conference.  He said that Bosnia is the legal heir of the former Yugoslavia.</p>

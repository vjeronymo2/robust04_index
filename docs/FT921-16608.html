			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Regina's dead, long live Regina - The royal jelly seller's survival IF REGINA Health and Beauty Products, the one-time USM star which sells royal jelly, has any disgruntled shareholders, they were not to be found at the group's annual meeting. Regina's shares have fallen over the years from a high of 48.96p in August 1988, to 1.5p on Tuesday, and have been locked between 3p and a low of 1p throughout this year. However, the first AGM with the group's new directors in place and with just a handful of shareholders in attendance, passed all the resolutions - including one to shorten the company's name to Regina - without a murmur from the floor. Shareholders are presumably placing their faith in the new management team, led by Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, chairman and chief executive, who is supported by Mr Paul Geoghegan, director, and Mr Anthony Shakesby, finance director. Mrs Irene Stein, Regina's founder and former chairman who unexpectedly resigned two years ago - though still remaining one of its largest shareholders - was not present at Tuesday's meeting. The new team, in place since early last year, has, it seems, done much to bring the company back from its dire financial straits of a year ago. At its previous financial year-end on June 30 1990, Regina reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.7m, owed the banks Pounds 150,000 and a further Pounds 250,000 to Mrs Stein, and had negative net worth of Pounds 1.33m. Since Mr Malik-Noor took over in March this year, all the group's borrowings have been repaid with the exception of a small loan in Ireland. Mr Malik-Noor was even able to convince Mrs Stein to reduce her claims to Pounds 125,000, thereby saving the company a significant sum. Employee numbers have been cut further from 85 to 31 and administrative costs have fallen by almost a third to Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 3.41m). The group's net worth is now positive, at Pounds 509,000, and the pre-tax loss has been reduced to Pounds 505,000. All of this in a year that has seen the group's core business of selling royal jelly products slump in the face of the Gulf war and recession, with sales plunging to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 5.7m). The extent of the downturn is more pronounced than the figures indicate as this year covers 14 months after the change of year-end to August 31. Mr Malik-Noor is optimistic about the future, but shareholders in the group, which faces a prolonged recession in major world markets, will need to place considerable trust in the chairman himself. Regina's return to better health this time was only possible due to Mr Malik-Noor's generous Pounds 660,000 cash injection, via the exercising of options granted to him. He also arranged a placing with investors, including the Antonian Trust, to raise Pounds 180,000, bringing the total cash injection to Pounds 840,000 by the year-end. Since then Mr Malik-Noor has again arranged a further placing, raising another Pounds 125,000 with 'two friendly shareholders', an unnamed overseas investor and the Antonian Trust, the beneficiaries of which are unknown to Mr Malik-Noor. As a result, Regina's major shareholders are now Croxley Holdings, a discretionary trust established by Mr Malik-Noor and whose beneficiaries include members of his family, Mrs Irene Stein, Mr Malik-Noor himself and the mysterious Antonian Trust.</p>

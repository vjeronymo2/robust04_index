			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA pressured British Airways shed 7 to 364p following further skirmishing in the trans-Atlantic air fares war with the news that Northwest Airlines has put out a special five-month offer, cutting rates by up to 50 per cent. Northwest is the fourth largest US carrier and its aggressive price move sparked trading volume of 3.2m BA shares. Bus operator Go-Ahead was 10 higher at 143p on the back of a buy recommendation from Panmure Gordon following last week's strong interim results. News of yet more share buy- backs by the regional electricity companies failed to trigger any outperformance by the stocks involved. Seeboard slipped 3 to 417p in spite of saying it had bought in 750,000 shares at that price, while South Wales acquired 476,000 at prices between 795p and 803p. South West, steady at 749p, said it had bought in 250,000 shares at 752p. De La Rue, the banknote printing group, was among the FT-SE 100's best performers, racing up 21 to 927p after buy recommendations from UBS and SG Warburg Securities. Ahead of this morning's City meeting with analysts, Williams Holdings advanced 9 to 337p. Turnover in the shares was 4.4m, but the most active diversified industrial was Tomkins with 7.3m changing hands and the shares 3 firmer at 209p. The story among dealers was that a major securities house, possibly NatWest Securities, had finally cleared a big overhang of Tomkins stock. British Steel moved up 3 to 165 1/2 p on 8.7m shares dealt, with Goldman Sachs said to be especially active in the company's stock options, where the equivalent of 1.2m shares were traded yesterday. Some smaller engineering stocks had a bad day, Whessoe plummeting 21 to 96p. Transfer Technology tumbled 14 to 54p following weak half-year results and a cautious forecast about full-year earnings. Johnson Matthey fell 13 to 551p in spite of the generally bullish tone of its US presentation to analysts. Turnover in Anglo-US conglomerate Hanson rose to 9.9m and the shares gained 3 1/4 at 234p after NatWest Securities recommended the stock and upgraded profits expectations. Raising its current year forecast by Pounds 30m to 980m, NatWest held its estimate for the following year at Pounds 1.34bn. The securities house said recent weakness in the stock due to technical selling by US investors now provided a good buying opportunity for the shares. A poor interim results meeting with analysts left retailing group Sears 1 1/2 lighter at 106p. However, Hoare Govett continues to favour the stock and analysts at the broker said: 'We think Sears has managed the process from pure recovery to growth well. The mid-term earnings growth potential looks encouraging.' House Of Fraser, which reported interim figures for the first time, put on 4 at 211p. A strong recommendation from NatWest Securities boosted Body Shop, the shares advancing 9 to 218p. Advising investors to add to holdings, NatWest said: 'The restructured management and retail focus is unlocking the international growth potential.' A broker's recommendation helped the leading stocks in the food retailing sector shake off some of the recent gloom that has brought a slide in share prices as fears of an impending price war took hold. Credit Lyonnais Laing said the recent retreat in the top stocks in the sector had been overdone and current levels provided a good buying opportunity. Argyll Group hardened a penny to 266p and Tesco put on 2 at 230p. J. Sainsbury, down sharply in recent sessions, closed 3 ahead at 394p. Hazlewood relinquished 5 to 120p as Hoare Govett became the latest securities house to downgrade profits expectations. Hoare cut its forecast by Pounds 6m to Pounds 39m for the year to March 1995, citing 'the sharp increase in potato prices and other competitive pressures in the non-food division'.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / 17th-century king loses case against City King James I was yesterday defeated by the Corporation of London. At issue was the ownership of Smithfield Market, and the corporation's battle for the site was won after meticulous examination of medieval documents. In 1613, King James I disputed the corporation's claim to ownership of the market, which stands on what is now prime land for developers, adjoining St Bartholomew's Hospital in the City of London. The Court of Appeal judges had to review some ageing documents. The first royal charter granting Smithfield to the City was signed by Henry VI in 1444. It was regranted to the City by Henry VII in a charter of 1505. According to the corporation, the crown showed no ambitions on the site, which the City, had owned 'since time immemorial', until James I claimed ownership. This dispute led to a compromise under James's successor, Charles I. The precise meaning of that charter, granted in 1638, which was meant to clarify the position, has been at issue. According to the City: 'The crown's claim was that that charter established the crown's ownership and the corporation's right to certain uses of the land.' But the City claimed that the compromise upheld the corporation's ownership of the freehold. Yesterday's ruling against James I upheld a 1992 High Court judgment that the City owns the freehold, although it is restricted to using the land either for a meat market or for open space. The Crown Estates commissioners, which brought the case on behalf of the crown, were required to pay legal costs for the City, which are estimated at about Pounds 50,000. As a result the City retains its hold on the public gardens immediately to the south of the market, plus a segment of the market itself whose ownership was also under dispute. The crown did not apply for leave to appeal to the House of Lords yesterday, but the Crown Estates said this option had not been ruled out. Solicitors are reading the judgment 'in detail' and an announcement is likely on Monday. The City claimed there were insufficient grounds to appeal. Speculation over the future of the market has rekindled the dispute in the past few decades. Proposals to move it to a different site were mooted in the 1970s. More recently, some market traders have claimed they cannot pay the rents the City will charge to fund refurbishment to conform to European Union hygiene regulations. The City said: 'The majority of the land will continue as a public space, so in practical terms it makes no difference, but it's reassuring to have this dispute settled after 381 years.'</p>

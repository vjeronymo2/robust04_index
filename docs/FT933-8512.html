			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Books: All lyrical about dirty realism - Stephen Amidon on the work of American writers who capture the essence of their country / Fiction SOMEBODY IN BOOTS by Nelson Algren Flamingo Pounds 5.99, 287 pages ECLIPSE FEVER by Walter Abish Faber Pounds 14.99, 335 pages WOMAN HOLLERING CREEK by Sandra Cisneros Bloomsbury Pounds 7.99, 165 pages FIONA MOON by Melanie Rae Thon Viking Pounds 14.99, 315 pages NELSON Algren is the hard luck man of American literature. Not only do his novels deal with men and women down on their fortune, but Algren himself, who died in 1981, never really received the recognition he was due. While contemporaries like Steinbeck and Dos Passos went on to achieve immortality, Algren, every bit their peer, remains in the minor leagues, still awaiting that posthumous promotion to the pantheon. It is a sign of this hard luck that Algren's remarkable first novel, Somebody in Boots, only now receives its first UK printing, 60 years after it was written. The story details the life and hard times of Cass McKay, a teenager from a West Texas family so impoverished that Cass dreams of becoming a hobo. When his father commits murder he gets his opportunity, hitting the rails for a ride through Depression-era America that is anything but glorious. He is beaten in a New Orleans whorehouse and jailed in El Paso. He winds up a petty robber in Chicago, his future no less bleak than it was back home. Something in Boots is a masterful book that proves Algren to be a steely-eyed American novelist of the first order, a writer who seamlessly blends lyricism with a truly dirty realism. Compare it with the early work of, say, Steinbeck, and you see the injustice in Algren's relative anonymity. He was an honest artist who was able to raise righteous anger to the level of poetry. Walter Abish is another American novelist hovering on the brink of fame, having won the PEN/Faulkner Prize and many fans with his first novel, How German Is It? His latest, Eclipse Fever, concerns a Mexican literary critic, Alejandro, who becomes embroiled with a nefarious American corporation when its chairman, Preston Hollier, asks him to write an article praising the company's plan to build a tourist elevator in the Pyramid of the Sun. Alejandro, whose wife has just left him for a novelist (surely the most painful of fates for a critic), soon becomes enmeshed in Hollier's true agenda - to smuggle pre-Columbian artifacts. Meanwhile, the teenaged daughter of the writer cuckolding Alejandro travels to Mexico to view a big eclipse, only to become involved with the art thieves who are supplying Hollier. Eclipse Fever is a novel that is at once dense and deft, a book whose surface is as smooth as glass but whose depths at times appear imponderable. Abish is a writer of considerable grace and occasionally great acuity, able to multiply plot lines into seemingly geometric complexity. His take on contemporary Mexico and its love/hate relationship with its overbearing northern neighbour is equally perspicacious. That said, the reader should also be warned that Abish's sensibility is an oblique one. While his vision is often photographic, he does not seem particularly interested in arranging his snapshots into the sort of slide show you can sit back and enjoy. Readers who likes mysteries solved and enigmas explained will come away from the novel feeling shortchanged by a book that offers as many ellipses as eclipses. Mexico also figures strongly in the work of Sandra Cisneros. Her second book, Woman Hollering Creek, is a skilful and evocative series of short stories dealing with Mexican-American women trying to live Bel otro lada, or 'on the other side', the US. Whether she be a Chicano artist involved in a love affair with a labourer who poses for her pseudo-mythic paintings or an abused Texan wife trying to flee back to her ancestral Mexico, Cisneros's women all suffer the longings and dangers inherent in being trapped between cultures. Another writer who deftly captures what it is like to be a woman caught between worlds is Melanie Ray Thon. The eponymous heroine of her second novel, Fiona Moon, is a potato farmer's daughter born into a life of unrelenting harshness on the outskirts of White Falls, Idaho, where feelings remain unspoken, where men and women bring each other only misery. Iona is looked down upon by the other kids, most notably Jay, the town's golden child who is only interested in her in the back seat of a car. When her mother falls ill, Iona quits school and leaves town to try to make a better life. But she soon returns home, where she finds Jay, having suffered an accident, reassessing a life that had been beautifully charted for him. They discover that they are not so different after all and give each other the strength to start anew. Thon writes with clarity and warmth about coming of age in a life of limited possibilities, as well as about the stifling effect of rural poverty. Like Algren, she is able to tap that rich blend of American fiction that seeks salvation from deprivation in the lyrical.</p>

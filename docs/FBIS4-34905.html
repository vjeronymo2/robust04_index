			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The country will learn the Supreme Court  Constitutional Chamber's ruling on the unconstitutionality of  the agrarian law dictated by the Court of Constitutional  Guarantees in approximately three weeks. Constitutional Chamber  Magistrate Hugo Ordonez has asserted that they will expedite the  ruling but that this does not mean it will be decided with undue  haste.    [Begin Ordonez recording] I would not like to estimate the  exact duration of this proceeding because it cannot be  predetermined. We have to see if it takes the regular course.  However, I surmise--and I do so only to answer the question you  say currently concerns the country--that the matter could be  resolved in approximately three weeks. [end recording]    Ordonez stated that the verdict will not depend on the  magistrates' political leanings but instead on whether the law  adheres to the Constitution.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Obayashi in retreat from property in California OBAYASHI, the Japanese construction company, is to withdraw from the US west coast property market by liquidating three Los Angeles-based subsidiaries and writing-off losses of Y30bn (Dollars 278m) in the year to March. The Japanese contractor can apparently afford to bear the losses this year, as it has avoided the worst of a corruption scandal in which executives from five other leading construction companies have been arrested in recent weeks for the alleged bribery of provincial politicians. Japanese construction companies, hit by the fall in property prices and orders at home, have been reducing their exposure in the international market. The scandals in Tokyo have given them another reason to minimise investment risks. Companies implicated in the scandal, including Taisei and Hazama, have been temporarily suspended from bidding for some public works projects, creating opportunities for Obayashi and other contractors which have so far avoided the ignominy of arrests. The government suspensions for contractors implicated in the scandal are expected to influence private orders received by the companies. Taisei said yesterday that it had not lost private contracts, but private orders for the industry are down 30 per cent to 40 per cent because of the depressed property market. In spite of a record fall of 40.6 per cent in national and local government orders received by the largest 50 Japanese contractors in August, Obayashi said pre-tax profit for the year to March would be Y60bn, up from a previously forecast Y52bn. The write-offs arising from the Los Angeles liquidations will cut net profit to Y13bn from a projected Y23bn, the company said. Sales for the period are expected to be Y1,600bn, down slightly from the forecast Y1,640bn. Obayashi will remain active in Hawaii and Europe.</p>

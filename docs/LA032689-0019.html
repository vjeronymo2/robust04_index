			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALK LIKE A MAN  </P> <P> As a typical middle-aged male, I have been aware for years that Littwin and her  colleagues consider men like me offensive, and I have attempted to conduct my  efforts toward physical fitness furtively under the cover of darkness and baggy  sweat clothes. However, I had always thought that my lack of coordination,  excessive perspiration and general insensitivity were due to my own failings as  a human being. Little did I realize they were, as Littwin says, a matter of  hormones, specifically a lack of estrogen.  </P> <P> JAY M. PACKER  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

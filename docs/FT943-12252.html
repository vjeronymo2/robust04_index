			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Scantronic chief resigns as debt rises Scantronic Holdings, the security components manufacturer and distributor which last month delayed publication of its full-year results, yesterday said Mr Ray Dias, its finance director, was resigning and it would be unable to pay a final dividend. The company said Mr Dias had failed to alert the board to the twin impact of increased borrowing and difficult trading conditions. Net indebtedness rose from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 7.6m in the year to March 31, and stood at Pounds 11.2m by the end of last month. Borrowing increased following two acquisitions: Alarmexpress, the UK security equipment distributor, and Arius, the US distributor. The group said it expected to report pre-tax profits in the next two weeks of not less than Pounds 2.75m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 1.6m. The announcement was made after the market closed and the shares were unchanged at 48p.</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Kohl shaken by poll defeat: Economic collapse in east Germany dogs Christian Democrats MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, appeared increasingly beleaguered by the social and economic problems of the unified country last night as his Christian Democratic party was crushingingly defeated in an important state election. In yesterday's Land (state) election in the Rhineland Palatinate, Mr Kohl's home state, the Christian Democrats (CDU) lost control of the state parliament to the opposition Social Democrats. This is the first time the CDU has lost the state since the Second World War. The result will also cost the ruling Bonn coalition of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats its majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German legislature. The Bundesrat has veto powers over all legislation affecting the states, including tax law, and the loss of the coalition's majority would hamper the government considerably. Yesterday's election amounts to a severe rebuff for Mr Kohl, who made no fewer than 14 appearances in the state during the campaign. Coming only five months after his triumph in the first pan-German general elections, it underlines the extent to which the economic collapse of what used to be communist East Germany is dogging the CDU. In particular, voters appear to have been influenced by controversy over Mr Kohl's handling of an increase in taxes needed to pay for the costs of reconstruction in the east. The CDU in the Rhineland Palatinate firmly laid the blame for defeat at Bonn's door. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic candidate who seems all but certain to lead the Land's next government, called the result 'a clear defeat for Helmut Kohl'. Mr Volker Ruehe, CDU national secretary general, termed the outcome 'a bitter defeat'. Support for the CDU fell abruptly at Land level in February after the Bonn government - going back on repeated assurances last year that taxpayers would not be called upon to finance the rapidly mounting costs of unification - announced a hefty tax surcharge for a year from July. Last year the 'unity chancellor' reaped the political dividend of the historic unification of the two halves of Germany. However, Mr Kohl's position now looks increasingly difficult, as the true complexion of the eastern economic and social collapse comes to light. Mr Scharping's campaign had capitalised on the so-called 'tax lies' with the biting slogan on placards across the Land: 'One doesn't vote for people who lie like that.' The CDU's electoral fortunes appear to have been sliding for some time. Yesterday was the 13th occasion in 15 national and west German regional elections since January 1987 that the conservatives have slipped at the polls - the most recent exception being the December general election. The CDU, with just 38.7 per cent of the vote according to the provisional final count, kept 40 seats in the state parliament, a loss of eight; the Social Democrats, with 44.8 per cent, gained seven seats for a total of 47. The Free Democrats, previously in coalition with the CDU in the state, were left with an unchanged seven seats and 6.9 per cent of the vote. The Green party, experiencing something of a revival in its fortunes after its failure to attain the critical 5 per cent in the December federal elections, slipped comfortably into the Mainz parliament with 6.5 per cent of the vote. This leaves the SPD, mathematically, with a majority whether it seeks the Greens or the FDP as its partner. Samuel Brittan, Page 23</p>

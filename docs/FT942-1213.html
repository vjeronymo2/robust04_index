			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / California to vote on illegal immigrants Illegal immigrants in California will be denied public education, healthcare and other social programmes if the state passes an initiative which won enough signatures this week to be placed on the ballot in November. The vote could serve as a bellwether in other states, such as Florida and New York, which also have a large number of illegal aliens. California state officials confirmed that backers of the proposal - dubbed the 'Save Our State' initiative - collected the more than 600,000 signatures necessary to put the issue to a state-wide vote this autumn. The vote is shaping up to be a divisive political issue. Mr Pete Wilson, California's incumbent Republican governor, running for re-election but behind in the polls, endorsed the initiative last week. Mr Wilson's Democrat opponent, Ms Kathleen Brown, opposes the proposal, as do a number of prominent civil rights and Latino groups. These critics have labelled the initiative discriminatory and racist as it primarily targets Hispanic and Asian minorities. They have promised to challenge the proposal on constitutional grounds if it passes. Backers count among their ranks several current and former immigration officials, including Mr Alan Nelson, who ran the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service under the Reagan administration. Proponents say California's public education, housing, health and social programmes are already stretched as illegal aliens are entering the state at a rate of 2,000 a week. The initiative would ease pressure on California's budget. It would also require police, teachers and healthcare workers to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS LOOK INTO OFFERING BOND ISSUE IN U.S. MARKETS  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, warming up to Wall Street, is considering a bond offering in  American financial markets once longstanding debts to the U.S. government  incurred by pre-1917 czarist regimes are settled, bankers said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Something has been talked around," a top New York banker said in an interview.  "If the czarist bonds are settled, they'd be free and clear."  </P> <P> The Center for Security Policy, a conservative Washington think tank, said that  several big U.S. banks were recently invited to lead the underwriting of a  $250-million Soviet bond issue and that Citibank had accepted the offer.  </P> <P> Oleg Enoukov, senior manager at the New York office of the Soviet Bank for  Foreign Economic Affairs, denied that an offer had been made but said once the  pre-revolution claims are cleared, "in the future, it may make this (bond  issue) possible."  </P> <P> The Soviet bank office was established last summer to seek new business  opportunities, Enoukov said. "We're just exploring new possibilities of doing  business with American banks and financial institutions," he added.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Citibank denied that the bank had already accepted a Soviet  offer. "Any discussions at this point are at an extremely early stage," she  said.  </P> <P> Moscow's interest in borrowing in the United States coincides with a crisis in  the Soviet Union as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev struggles to institute  economic reforms, a subject likely to be on the agenda when he meets President  Bush aboard ships in the Mediterranean next month.  </P> <P> Before the Soviets can borrow here, they have to meet the terms of the 1934  Johnson Debt Default Act, which bars credit to countries in default to the U.S.  government.  </P> <P> "Their ability to float bonds in the United States would be dependent on their  getting off the Johnson Act," one State Department official said.  </P> <P> The United States lent some $192.6 million to Alexander Kerensky, who was prime  minister in a provisional government in 1917 before being overthrown by the  Bolshevik Revolution.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has since refused to honor the debt, but last year it began  settlement negotiations with Washington.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union gained re-entry to the London bond market after reaching a  similar settlement with Britain two years ago.  </P></p>

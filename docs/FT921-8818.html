			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Letter: Absence of nuclear levy focused attention on costs Sir, In your article 'Big power users fight electricity price rises' (February 4) you refer to 'the element in their bills that goes towards the annual subsidy for the UK's nuclear generation sector'. The fact is that what you are describing only applies in England and Wales. In Scotland, we do not receive the 'so-called' nuclear levy - an important distinction to make. In this company we are trying very hard to reduce our cost base and last year's published results will indicate that our operating costs were lower than those of fossil fuel generators, PowerGen and National Power. Currently, we are engaged in significant negotiations with the government and British Nuclear Fuels to reduce the cost of our fuel cycle services - as you reported ('Scottish Nuclear to cut fuel reprocessing needs', February 11) - all in an attempt to reduce the cost of electricity generated by nuclear power. It could even be said that the absence of the nuclear levy in this company has really focused our attention on the urgent need to reduce costs as soon as possible, and preferably before the 1994 review. James Hann, chairman, Scottish Nuclear, Minto Building, 6 Inverlair Avenue, Glasgow G44 4AD</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ATLANTIS COUNTDOWN PUT ON HOLD AS WINDS THREATEN LAUNCH  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration counted down toward a fifth  attempt to launch the space shuttle Atlantis early this morning, as clouds and  high, gusting winds threatened to delay the launch a fifth time.  </P> <P> "It will be nip and tuck," said Air Force Capt. Tom Strange, the shuttle  weather officer. "We have to hope for a letup, but at this point we don't see  it."  </P> <P> As the planned launch time of 12:55 a.m. EST approached, launch director Bob  Sieck called for an extended hold.  </P> <P> Winds over Kennedy Space Center reached 33 m.p.h. in the opening hour of the  planned launch period, which began at midnight Sunday and was to extend through  4 a.m. Unless the winds calmed as the launch period wore on, the shuttle could  be grounded for the fifth time. NASA rules do not permit a launch unless wind  conditions safely permit the shuttle to lift off its pad and to return and land  at the space center if such an emergency measure were to become necessary.  </P> <P> The fifth attempt to launch the craft came after an astronaut's cold, then foul  weather, and finally a last-minute computer failure delayed the launch of the  space shuttle four separate times.  </P> <P> Working throughout Sunday morning and afternoon, NASA engineers fixed the  "Cyber B," a back-up computer designed to ensure the safety of areas beneath  the flight path. Sunday morning's delay cost taxpayers $547,000 in labor and  material expenses at Kennedy Space Center alone, since the shuttle was forced  to jettison 500,000 gallons of fuel at the last minute.  </P> <P> The three earlier delays, which were called hours before countdowns were to  have begun, cost $247,000 in added services.  </P> <P> The flight of Atlantis, the 34th flight of a U.S. space shuttle and the sixth  shuttle flight entirely dedicated to a Defense Department mission, has a crew  of five military astronauts. John O. Creighton, a Navy captain, is commanding  the flight. Creighton's scratchy throat and congestion prompted NASA to call  off two earlier launch attempts. The other astronauts aboard Atlantis are Air  Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col.  David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre  J. Thuot.  </P> <P> While the Defense Department has shrouded Atlantis' payload in secrecy, experts  said that the shuttle is being used to carry a $500-million satellite called  the KH-12 into space. The "keyhole" satellite would be the sixth in a  constellation of U.S. craft designed to photograph and relay images of military  and other installations, according to John Pike, a space expert with the  Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.  </P></p>

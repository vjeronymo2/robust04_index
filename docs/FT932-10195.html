			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / US Money and Credit: Investors find the old rule holds true THE OLD financial markets rule, 'buy on the rumour, sell on the fact,' held true last week when the US Treasury finally announced its long-awaited decision on restructuring the government's debt mix. There had been plenty of buying on the rumours (which mostly predicted that the Treasury would decide that the best way to cut federal interest costs would be to issue fewer long bonds and more shorter-dated securities in future), and when the facts were released, there was an initial surge of selling. Prices, however, did not fall particularly far, as the selling was restricted by the fact that the rumours had proved well sourced, so there was no real element of surprise. The Treasury's plans consist of shortening the maturity on government debt by reducing the frequency of long bond auctions, eliminating the seven-year note and boosting issues of securities with a maturity of five years or less. In all, the market's reaction was rather muddled. Bond investors examined the Treasury's planned changes, and, unsure what to make of it, quickly diverted their attention to other matters, such as the April employment report. The Treasury's moves, however, deserve closer consideration than the market seems to have afforded them. Mr Joe Liro and Ms Mary Rooney, of Warburg Securities in New York, made an interesting point in their instant analysis on the subject. They pointed out that the Treasury's decision to place the emphasis of debt management on short-term financing gave the Federal Reserve an even greater role in determining the government's financing costs. 'Once the Federal Reserve embarks on a course of monetary restraint,' they wrote, 'short rates will come under pressure and Treasury financing costs will soar. If the Fed shows a reluctance to tighten when a policy of restraint is necessary, its anti-inflation credibility will be immediately called into question by the financial markets.' In other words, there will be more at stake than ever when the Fed decides to tighten or loosen monetary policy. Although the latest readings on the US economy suggest the strong pace of growth achieved at the tail end of 1992 is slackening, most economists expect the Fed's next likely move on interest rates to be up rather than down. They also expect the Fed to take precautionary measures designed to ensure inflationary pressures do not revive when business activity begins to hit its stride in late 1993 or 1994. The shortening of the maturity on government debt, however, means that in future the Fed will have to consider carefully what affect its tightening of policy will have on the government's interest costs. With a president occupying the White House who is extremely keen to reduce the drag on economic growth that the huge federal budget deficit represents, those considerations will weigh heavily on the Fed. Generally, the Treasury's decision on the debt mix did not go down especially well on Wall Street. The consensus was the government was playing a dangerous game, betting its debt management policy on long-term interest rate movements. At the core of the critics' complaints was the view that the shortening of maturities will make the federal debt more of a hostage to interest rate rises. Mr Geoffrey Dennis, of James Capel in New York, said that with more debt maturing at an earlier stage the Treasury's changes mean a more rapid refinancing of already-issued debt will be required. 'Should interest rates rise in the interim, this refinancing will become more expensive.' There was also an unhappiness with a politicisation of the debt management process. Analysts felt the government should be concentrating more of its energies on lowering the deficit, and less on lowering the interest costs of that deficit through, as Salomon Brothers called it, 'a superficial reshuffling of Treasury debt priorities'.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: Greasepaint - Theatre Frances de la Tour can so realise the nervous system beneath one character's external behaviour that she can turn the stage into a believable world; and that is why she is one of our finest actresses. But here, where she plays the one and only character of Hiashi Inoue's Greasepaint, the differences between nervous system, external behaviour, and surrounding stage world are so unclear that she is grounded. The production, directed by Koichi Kimura, is co-produced by the Lyric, Hammersmith, and Tokyo's Chijinkai theatre company. De la Tour has to hold us for 90 minutes with her account of the disintegrating psyche of a Japanese Kabuki actress-manager, haunted by the child she once gave away and the vicissitudes of performing. The kind of Kabuki she practices is on the skids. Gradually it becomes apparent that to hold her troupe, her art, and her life together is more than she can master. She addresses other characters -  whom we do not see. Part of the play's tension is the question, unspoken but gathering in force as you watch: are these other characters real or in her imagination? Much of the time she is applying or removing make-up, wig and costume, and she addresses the mirror as she talks. But there is no mirror. Her mirror talk is addressed straight out into the auditorium. Apart from the Kabuki trimmings, this kind of soliloquy has no great novelty. It's a Romantic mad scene, it's 'Ridi, Pagliaccio', and it's Petrushka in his cell. You can easily imagine how a hammier actress would devour such a role -  switching attention from one character to another with a sharp flick of the head, revelling in all the virtuosity of mirror antics with no mirror, changing vocal tone dramatically from mood to mood, and then suddenly amazing us with (oh irony]) the utter sincerity with which she 'becomes' the role she is rehearsing. De La Tour is too sincere an actress for all that, and shows no relish for such obvious theatrical effect. She plays this actress-manager without any charming japonaiserie but, instead, in a south London accent. She shows us that the Japan she inhabits is not some pretty Mikado land, but is thoroughly modern and urbanised. And this is a modern woman. Her mind returns to the son she gave away; she makes excuses for that; but she is 'reluctantly', miraculously reunited with him in a big theatrical recognition scene; she then loses him again; and finally she tries to turn everything back into theatre. It is de la Tour's modernity, and the play's ambiguity, that makes this Greasepaint interesting. She shows you the tawdriness of this character's life, and her need for escapism. She also shows you this character's weaknesses and self-contradictions. Her need for fantasy (and theatre) becomes both real and pathetic. But the dichotomy between play and actress is too large. For the performance de la Tour gives it, the play develops its character's psyche far too slowly. If it received a more narcissistic performance, it would 'work' better -  but it would also seem more trite. Lyric, Hammersmith, until March 6</p>

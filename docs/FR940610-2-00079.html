			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2618, subsection (a) of the Public Health Service Act, ``Special Projects of National Significance,'' permits the Secretary to allocate up to ten percent of the funds provided for Part B of Title XXVI to award grants directly to public and non-profit private entities to promote the statute's objectives. Approximately $9.7 million is available in FY 1994, to fund 25 HIV service delivery model demonstration projects estimating an average annual project budget of $350,000. The evaluation and dissemination center budget will be based on the availability of funds in relation to the objective review panel's recommendations. Approximately $600,000 is available in FY 1994 for this Center. The budget and project periods for approved and funded projects will begin October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project periods may be requested for up to five years. However, recommended support beyond the third year is subject to a determination by an objective review panel in conjunction with an assessment by the SPNS staff of the project's progress to date. All grants to support projects beyond the first budget year will be contingent upon the availability of funds, Congressional reauthorization of Ryan White CARE Act funding within the second project year, and satisfactory progress each year in meeting the project's objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All grantees funded to support HIV service delivery model demonstration projects under this Notice are encouraged to secure and show evidence of non-SPNS funding support equal to 20 percent of the approved project budget by the fourth project year, and equal to 40 percent of the approved project budget by the fifth year. Applicants are required to submit, in the initial application, budgets for each proposed project year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute, Section 2618 (a) (1), specifies that grants may be awarded to public and non-profit private entities to fund special programs for the care and treatment of people with HIV disease.

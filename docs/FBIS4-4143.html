			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Western Europe, the  United States and Russia need to map out and implement a "common  strategy" in resolving the Bosnian crisis, a former U.N.  commander in Bosnia said today.    The crisis is being prolonged because of a lack of unity in  the world community, Francis Briquemont, former commander of the  U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, said in the local media.    Earlier this month, NATO issued two ultimatums to the  Bosnian  serbs but did not imposed the same pressure on the other two  warring sides, Muslims and Croats, he explained.    General Briquemont, who retired from the post in January,  stressed that the "game of two against one" can only deepen the  crisis.    Differences on Bosnia among the big powers has led the  warring sides to have a "wrong vision" and to make "wrong  judgements", the general added.    Along with a common strategy, Briquemont indicated, the  world  community must make it clear to the warring parties that "the  use of arms will not resolve any problems, but will only hurt  each nationality".    Referring to NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions, the  general said that representatives of the United Nations should  not give in to "political pressure" by asking for such action.    The general further stated that air strikes against the  Bosnian Serbs will not resolve the crisis.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The location for the Long Beach public meeting was chosen because it was considered central to the affected area (i.e., the SCB). Those unable to attend the meeting were invited to submit written comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not possible for NMFS to have advance knowledge of all individuals interested in its activities, although it is noted that none of the individuals listed in one commenter's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 8, 1993, testimony contacted NMFS to obtain the documentation for review or submitted comments after being informed by the commenter of the proposed action. In addition, at least one of these individuals received a copy of the Navy application in June. The marine scientific community has had sufficient opportunity to become involved in this process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters believe that NMFS should have made more of an effort to locate alternative sites as required by NEPA. One commenter believed that NMFS must evaluate the proposed site in concert with other possible sites. One commenter asserts that NMFS has not considered previously used sites. Another commenter believed that the MMPA required NMFS to evaluate alternate sites to ensure the least practicable adverse impact upon affected species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the EA was to evaluate the impact of the proposed issuance of a small take authorization to the Navy to incidentally take marine mammals within the OSTR. Under that Federal action, NMFS identified two alternatives, in addition to the proposal. The alternatives to the proposal were to issue the LOA without mitigation requirements and to not issue a small take authorization, the no action alternative. Alternatives such as alternative sites or methods were identified as being beyond the scope of the proposed action. Because NMFS is not authorizing the detonation of explosives, only the proposed taking of marine mammals incidental to such detonations, NMFS is of the opinion that the site determination and method of operation is the responsibility of the Navy (provided NMFS is assured that there was not a practicable alternative to ship shock testing that would result in not taking marine mammals). As stated in the EA, if a Small Take LOA is not given to the Navy (no action alternative), because the take was either not small or would result in more than a negligible impact to the species, then the Navy could elect to relocate the test site or take some other action. Refer to the response under the ``Outer Sea Test Range'' below for additional discussion on this topic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter claims that NMFS has not considered (as an alternative in the EA) a reduction in the size of the proposed site. Another wanted the Navy to not conduct tests north of 33 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;27 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N. latitude within the OSTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Navy will be utilizing survey data collected in 1993 to limit the test site within the OSTR to an area with few or no marine mammals. Current aerial survey data will be used to ``reduce'' the test area to a site that will minimize potential impacts to marine mammals. Arbitrarily limiting the test area to a particular corner or area of the OSTR at this stage would be premature, and may not result in reduced impacts to marine mammals and other marine life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS should consider such alternatives such as a reduction in the number of detonations; the sizes of detonations; and, the period in which detonations are allowed. Additionally, NMFS must give due consideration to alternative forms of testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the Navy's application, the estimated number of large detonations is extremely conservative, and based on an extreme worst case scenario. To ensure conservatism, the Navy multiplied its worst case scenario by 5 (years) to determine the absolute maximum take during the 5-year term of the LOA. It is highly unlikely that the Navy will detonate 60 large charges during the 5-year period. However, there is justification, although remote, for requiring up to 12 detonations on an annual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four shots of gradually increasing severity maximizes safety, technical benefits, and economics. Small increases in severity between shots raises confidence in predicting the potential for unforeseen hazards from one shot to the next. Experience, careful planning, and examination of objectives and constraints resolved that 4 shots is the optimum procedure for conducting a shock trial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a ship the size of an AEGIS-class destroyer, a 10,000 lb. (4,536 kg) charge is necessary to produce a nearly planar shock wave. A plane wave generates nearly uniform loading on each shot, which is required when measuring responses from thousands of reaction points around the ship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time there is no scientific evidence to indicate that there is any one period of the year when marine mammals are not within the OSTR. Population assessment research in the SCB will be reviewed to determine if seasonal restrictions would result in lower incidental takes. If so, then NMFS would likely take actions necessary to ensure the greatest protection to these marine mammals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where feasible, the Navy conducts underwater explosives tests using computer modeling and land-based test facilities. Two contractor-operated quarries in Virginia are used for some of the test work. In addition, a test pond has been constructed at the Army Combat Systems Test Activity in Aberdeen, MD. These facilities are limited to testing small and medium size components on floating platforms. Ponds, like those at Aberdeen and in Virginia reduce the need for testing in the ocean. It is impossible, however, to eliminate the need for open-water testing for programs such as full-scale ship shock trials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

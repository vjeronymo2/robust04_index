As Prof. Alexander W. Koch explained, surface  structures, component movements, surface rough spots, and  vibrations, as well as coating thicknesses and optical constants  of thin surface films, for example, can be analyzed with these  sensors.    Especially the thin coating technique is playing an  increasingly more important role in environmental and medical  technology in particular. There is a large number of possible  coatings that endow the underlying materials with new  properties. Laser measurement techniques have also proven to be  very well suited to the examination of optically transparent  coatings. With them the laser light on the interface between the  surrounding medium and the coating is in part reflected and in  part refracted into the coating.    The light fractions interfere with one another, dependent on  the changes in the optical path. He further said that, since the  difference between the optical paths can only be vaired by a  change in coating thickness when the material properties are  constant, they have with this technique a sensitive in-situ  monitor for the thickness of the coating. The resolution  maximally amounts to somewhat more than 10 nanometers.    When two interferometers are combined in a dual-beam  experiment, their beam paths form different angles with the  surface of the coating. If the coating is thicker, there are  different periodicities of both monitor signals. Both  interferometers detect the difference between the optical paths  with high local resolution at the same point on the coating.    A comparison of both monitor signals also further provides,  in addition to the thickness of the coating, the refractive  index of the coating. Furthermore, Koch explained, computer  simulations of the signal sequences allow for conclusions as to  absorption coefficients and the homogeneity of the coating.</p>

Chief Simon Gumede was  minister of works and deputy secretary-general of the IFP.    He was also a member of the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly and  the IFP Central Committee as well as president of the Federated  Council of Indigenous Rulers of South Africa.    Chief Gumede's name appeared on a pamphlet listing 21  alleged  African National Congress activists within the kwaZulu  administration. Nongoma College Registrar Thabiso Ngubane, whose  name also appeared on the list, was shot dead at the weekend.    Announcing his departure, Chief Gumede said his decision had  not been influenced by the distribution of the pamphlet. He had  instead decided to serve his Gumede clan in the Ubombo area in  northern Zululand and would remain a member of the IFP.    KwaZulu Chief Minister and IFP President Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi said it was sheer coincidence that Chief Gumede's  resignation had come at the same time as the distribution of the  pamphlet. He said he had not suspected Chief Gumede of being  disloyal.    The ANC [African National Congress] has disassociated itself  from the pamphlet and has asked the Transitional Executive  Council to investigate the matter. Several people were attacked  and their houses gutted after a similar document was circulated  in Ulundi last year.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: Chicago takes the option into the third dimension THE Chicago Board Options Exchange last week took the financial world into a third dimension with its introduction of an index of implied volatility on its actively traded Standard and Poor's 100 stock index options. The dissemination of the index is likely to be followed within the year by its own volatility options. While there has been a plethora of new derivative instruments introduced in the past six months, the volatility index concept goes to the heart of options pricing and thus may have applications far beyond the equity index proposed in Chicago. The American Stock Exchange is considering a volatility index on its Major Markets Index, and the over-the-counter foreign exchange options market is said to be ripe for a similar product. However, while the concept is intriguing, traders say volatility options will be redundant, and industry marketing executives say the offering is too sophisticated for retail investors. The CBOE's volatility index may turn out to be an innovation without a market. Volatility is a measure of the speed of a market's movements. Since an option often becomes less valuable as it approaches its expiry date, a successful options trader must not only have a clear view of price direction, but also a feel for market velocity - how quickly the price of the underlying security will move towards his objective. That said, it must also be noted that volatility is no mystery, and can be mathematically derived as a sort of standard deviation of prices. Since Fischer Black and Myron Scholes introduced the first practical model for options pricing in 1973, volatility has been the one input to the formula that cannot be plucked from a newspaper. However, that is no problem for professional options traders, who program their computers with the Black/Scholes model or one of its offspring and calculate implied volatility. Many options shops tweak the pricing model to their own liking, and several generations of software vendors have lived and died by the speed at which they can spin the model through traders' machines. Options traders quote volatility as readily as premium prices, they chart volatility movement, and have devised a multitude of strategies for buying and selling volatility within standard options contracts. Their facility with options pricing and volatility hedging leaves them with little need for a volatility index option. Academics who study options pricing theory say that professional traders could use the products as a sort of re-insurance. Existing option strategies to hedge volatility require multiple transactions. A direct hedge, they say, has fewer transactions costs. They admit, however, that wide differences between bids and offers in thin markets can cost more than any trading fee, and spreads on a volatility option are apt to be wide. But a volatility index's appeal to the broader public may be limited. Mr Todd Petzel, research director at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, says the CME has considered volatility indices on its options contracts since 1986, but has not felt compelled to launch a product. Sophisticated investors do not need the product, he says, and less sophisticated ones do not follow volatility and use standard options to bet on price movements. American Stock Exchange executives also said volatility indices had lower priority than products with broader retail appeal. That is not to say that a volatility index would not offer some breathless trading opportunities, however. Volatility tends to rise ahead of an anticipated event as uncertainty increases, and fall quickly afterward. CME Eurodollar options saw implied volatility go from an August low of 15 per cent to an October peak of 49 per cent as traders anticipated a new Democratic president and his unknown economic policies. By last week, however, volatility had returned to 18 per cent, with savvy traders reaping rewards from the wild ride.</p>

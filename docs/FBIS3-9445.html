			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Berisha today received Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes. I am happy to receive you in Albania,  President Berisha told Willy Claes. I am sure that your visit  marks an important event in strengthening bilateral relations.  I would like to mention here the fruitful meetings I held in  Brussels with His Majesty King Albert I and Belgian Prime  Minister Dehaene, and the understanding I found in them  regarding the problems of bilateral relations and those of our  region.    President Berisha made a broad presentation of the  application and course of the reforms in the political,  institutional, and economic fields, as well as the latest  achievements in this direction. We are grateful to the European  Union [EU] and Belgium for the assistance they rendered to  Albania. However, Albania still needs assistance and increased  cooperation with Belgium and European Union. He asked Belgian  Foreign Minister Claes for the Belgian Kingdom to support the  processes of Albania's integration into the European Union.    Regarding the situation in the region, Berisha stressed once  again that, with its actions and attitudes, Albania is seriously  working to achieve stability in the region. He said, however,  that lifting or facilitating sanctions against Serbia not only  does not stop the war but moves it toward the south, where it  threatens to turn into a Balkan conflict. In this framework, it  comes out clearly that the problem of Kosova remains a regional  problem, the solution of which is a condition for regional peace  and stability. That is why this question must be placed on the  agenda. The European Union should consider the efforts of  Albanians for a democratic solution.    Regarding Kosova as a Serb problem means ignoring 2 million  Albanians and increasing the chances of conflict. We ask that  it is necessary to be understood that Greater Serbia is a factor  of war and instability in the region. I am of the opinion that  the situation in Kosova is continuously becoming worse. By  closing the last institutions of culture in conformity with the  memorandum of the Serbian Academy, Milosevic is escalating the  terror there.    Berisha continued by saying that, in the same way, Albania  is  interested in stability in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. However, there are others who  try to destabilize the situation in this Republic and find and  create destabilizing factors there where they do not exist. But  of course, it supports and defends the human and national rights  of the Albanians in this Republic because this is the only way  to achieve stability there.    Claes said that we feel it is our duty to help and support  you in the difficult road of reforms. We appraise your  achievements and guarantee you that Belgium will support  Albania's efforts to be integrated into the European Union, the  West European Union, and all European structures. He also  expressed complete understanding for the problems in the region  and assessed Albania's stance as a factor and stability. He  assured President Berisha that Belgium will give a concrete  contribution in the resolution of the question of Kosova.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Harbin city government decided to set a ceiling  price for the marketing of grain and oil for a period of time.  The ceiling prices will be effective today.    The specific standards for the ceiling prices are: The  ceiling price for every five gram of first-grade soybean oil is  3.7 yuan; that of first-grade rice, 0.84 yuan; and that of all  sorts of flour, 0.79 yuan.    Harbin city government has called all state-owned,  collective, and individual grain shops, and all enterprises  doing business at the country trade fairs to resolutely  implement the ceiling prices set for the aforementioned product  varieties, put price tags on the products, and sell these  products in line with the price tags. Those units that refuse to  implement the ceiling prices, abritrarily raise the prices, and  sell these products above the ceiling prices will be strictly  handled in case they are discoverd.</p>

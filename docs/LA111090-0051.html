			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW SCORES EARLY AND HANGS ON LATE  </P> <P> Ocean View High School scored on four of five first-half possessions, then held  off a late Huntington Beach drive for a 24-19 victory Friday in a Sunset League  game.  </P> <P> The Sea Hawks (5-3-1, 3-2-1 in league) were led by quarterback Randy Karliner,  who rushed for 46 yards.  </P> <P> Karliner scored on his team's first drive, with 5 minutes 11 seconds left in  the first quarter, and again less than three minutes later, three plays after  he intercepted a pass by Huntington Beach's Mike Chavira.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach scored five seconds into the second quarter on a 14-yard run  by Nick Peters, but Ocean View answered with a 35-yard field goal by Ron  Lightner and a five-yard touchdown run by Matt Barry.  </P> <P> The Oilers (5-5, 1-5) scored again with eight seconds to go in the half on  running back Adam Bowermaster's eight-yard run.  </P> <P> Ocean View held off a last-gasp Huntington Beach effort. With less than a  minute to go and the Oilers at the Sea Hawk seven, Chavira (15 for 31, 217  yards and three interceptions) handed off to Bowermaster and broke downfield.  Chavira caught Bowermaster's pass but came down outside the end zone. HEATHER  SMALLEY  </P></p>

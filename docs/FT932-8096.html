			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Danes are rewarded for Yes vote with tax cuts THE DANISH government yesterday brushed aside violent demonstrations sparked by Tuesday's referendum result endorsing Maastricht, and as a reward for the Yes vote announced a programme to stimulate economic growth and employment. Riots briefly flared up again last night, when police fired tear gas at about 200 stone-throwing protestors who had lit fires and smashed windows in central Copenhagen. Clashes on the previous night, described as the worst in Denmark's peacetime history, had left 11 demonstrators wounded by police gunfire and 26 policemen injured. The government blamed a small fringe group of militant squatters, known as the BZers. Many of them are anarchists and other far-left militants who see the plans for further EC integration as meaning tighter control of Europe by conservative political and business interests. Little damage was done to property, the main targets being the windows of several bank branches and a few cars. The government insisted the attacks did not represent the feelings of the vast majority of No voters. In parliament, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic prime minister, condemned Tuesday night's riots. The prime minister went on to announce that the government would slash marginal income tax rates to bring them closer into line with the rest of the EC. It would also bring forward state investment plans to push up growth in gross domestic product from under 1 per cent this year to almost 3.5 per cent in 1994. Mr Rasmussen said the signal from Danish voters was that Europe's political leaders must close the gap that had opened between them and their electorates over Maastricht. They could achieve this by adopting pragmatic policies that tackled problems such as unemployment, which had a direct impact on the everyday lives of Europeans. 'We have to be more engaged,' he said. Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate to 8.25 per cent from 9.25 per cent and commercial banks made similar cuts in lending and deposit rates, which had been held artificially high because of uncertainty over the Maastricht vote. The Copenhagen stock market, which had risen strongly in expectation of a Yes vote, put on a further 2.3 points to close at 303.89. Tax cuts aim to galvanise other EC member states to rally behind a beefed-up economic growth package ahead of next month's summit in Copenhagen.

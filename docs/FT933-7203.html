			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / International Company News: Commodity exchange link terms approved THE BOARD of governors of the Commodity Exchange, the New York precious metals futures exchange, has approved the terms of a proposed merger with the New York Mercantile Exchange. This sets the stage for voting by members on the Dollars 60m plan before the end of the year. Although the Comex board approval had been expected, it is viewed as a victory for Mr Daniel Rappaport, the Nymex chairman. Since assuming the chairmanship in January, Mr Rappaport has succeeded in smoothing historical animosities between the two exchange's trading populations, which have blocked previous merger plans. The Nymex has offered to pay Comex members Dollars 50m in cash. Of this, about Dollars 15m will come from the Comex's own treasury at the time the deal closes, while Dollars 20m will be deferred and distributed in equal payments of Dollars 5m, plus interest, in each of the next four years. Comex has about 775 members. In order to quell any opposition from the Nymex membership, the deal includes a Dollars 10m payout to members if the merger is accomplished. The merger would maintain the Nymex and Comex as separate divisions, and memberships to the divisions would continue to trade separately. Cost savings from the link-up are estimated at more than Dollars 6m a year.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / European foreign ministers determined to meet deadline European foreign ministers yesterday showed their determination to meet the deadline set for ratification of the Uruguay Round by agreeing to send paper work to the European parliament in time for consultation ahead of January 1 1995, writes Emma Tucker in Brussels. This will allow ratification to progress while the Europen Commission and member states await the opinion of the European Court of Justice on who has the authority to negotiate in contested trade areas. The court verdict is expected on November 15. By bringing forward the date to mid-November, the court has helped to defuse a row between member states and the Commission over the legal basis for ratification. The Commission asked the court for advice after member states argued that it did not have the authority to negotiate in areas such as services and intellectual property rights where no EU legislation yet exists.</p>

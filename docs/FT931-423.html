			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Courtaulds pensions surplus to be reduced COURTAULDS, the speciality materials company, said yesterday that it would remove Pounds 83m in surplus from its employee pension scheme, earning it an after-tax gain of Pounds 50m for the year to March 31. The move follows an actuarial valuation as of March 31 1992 showing that the pension fund surplus had increased to Pounds 189m and that assets were 124 per cent greater than the scheme's liabilities. Pension schemes are liable to tax on surpluses greater than 105 per cent of liabilities. The company will also use Pounds 47m of the surplus to improve benefits to members. The remainder of the surplus will stay in the scheme and fund a continuation of Courtaulds' contributions holiday for the next year. Mr Michael Pragnell, finance director, said the company had taken the unusual step of extracting the surplus in cash, rather than dissipating it through contributions holidays, because the surplus was so large relative to liabilities. UK companies have largely avoided removing their surpluses in cash because they attract a 40 per cent tax charge. The effect of the repayment will help Courtaulds reduce its year-end debt to capital employed by some 4 per cent at the end of its current year. The interest accrued on the surplus in the 1993-94 year as a result of the repayment will be cut by Pounds 7.5m from the Pounds 18.2m earned in the current year. The reduced interest will lower the 1993-94 operating profit credit by Pounds 2m.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Issues of sex and power - Zara Steiner on the pros and cons of this feminist biography of Eleanor Roosevelt ELEANOR ROOSEVELT: VOLUME ONE 1884-1933 by Blanche Wiesen Cook Bloomsbury Pounds 25, 587 pages THIS biography of Eleanor Roosevelt would not have appeared 20 years ago. This is not just a question of new documentary sources or even the current preoccupation with the childhood traumas and sexual activities of our political leaders, male or female. The new feminist biographers, and Blanche Cook is one, insist that the issues of sex and power are as central to the study of women's public roles as men's and that women's passions can provide the key to their influence and importance. Rather than the dutiful wife of an American president sublimating her interests and passions, ER, as she is called throughout this account, is portrayed as an assertive and independent woman who created her own feminist agenda. Cook's biography is all the more provocative because in her own memoirs ER deliberately obscured the historical record, minimising her political ambitions and revealing almost nothing about her intimate private life. Her closest friends remained silent and, for the most part, concealed or destroyed the letters that would have opened Pandora's Box. In this first volume of two, Professor Cook dwells on ER's complex inheritance, the alcoholic but adored father and the beautiful if shallow mother who died when Eleanor was eight. Eleanor's first moment of self discovery occurred at Allenswood School in London's Wimbledon, where the Strachey girls and other daughters of the enlightened, wealthy Anglo-American elite received a disciplined but liberating education. In this heady emotional and intellectual atmosphere the orphaned ER flowered, gaining the inner self-confidence and broader range of sympathies so important to her later development. The debutante, secret fiancee and then wife of Franklyn Roosevelt returned to New York to live the conventional life of her sex and class, distinguished only by a difficult relationship with her domineering mother-in-law, in whose house she and Franklyn lived, and by the sense of entrapment and depression that came to engulf the young mother of six. It was Franklyn's turn to politics and, above all, the shock of discovering his love affairs that opened ER's inner gates. Franklyn's flirtations and his almost exclusively masculine political life encouraged Eleanor to become active in the 'new women's' political groups of the 1920s. Here she made her first feminist friends, including the political activists, Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman, a lesbian couple who later lived in a cottage on the Roosevelt estate and with whom ER enjoyed an intimate personal and professional relationship for over 15 years. As her husband climbed the political ladder, ER embarked on her own career in politics, journalism for women's magazines, and part-time teaching at a girls school bought and run by Eleanor and her friends. Cook is particularly acute on the kind of bondage created by financial dependence, whether between mother and son or husband and wife, and its effects on the Roosevelt marriage and ER's quest for independence. She catches the tensions created by Eleanor's double life during the early stages of her husband's struggles with polio and the growing gap between ER's mother-wife and politician-teacher roles. The personal compromises and the totally unliberated treatment of her own daughter suggest how incomplete was ER's emergence from the conventions of the times, despite her strong female friendships and an independent power position in an anti-feminist Democratic Party. There is more in this volume about ER's emotional involvements than about her political activities though Professor Cook sees them as equal parts of the same story. These include not only Eleanor's close friendship with Nancy Cook and others but also her relationship with Earl Miller, the handsome, young bodyguard who became her companion, defender and champion. The volume ends with the Roosevelts' move into the White House and the start of what is described here as Eleanor's lesbian affair with Lorena Hicks, the Associated Press's senior woman reporter. With so much of the evidence missing and final conclusions always a question of judgment, Cook follows up every lead and includes every detail. If only she had used a more delicate brush when filling in the political background and selected a wider range of colours when dealing with her male politicians, we might have been spared some of the all too numerous illustrations of FDR's shallow and opportunistic political convictions: Professor Cook's claim that men enter politics for personal fulfilment while women try to get things done is, even in terms of ER's odyssey, open to question. A good feminist biography does not need to fight the war of the sexes. Commercial reasons apart, the decision to conclude the volume in 1933 raises questions about the feminist approach to historical biography. In the not-so-distant past, when little was known about the intimacies discussed here, it was ER's outspoken political views and public causes that made her an exceptional presidential wife and the focus of interest and intense debate. Is it a hopelessly outdated suggestion to say that the sexual life of any statesman or stateswoman is only of historical interest because of what they did or accomplished? If this first volume, written from a feminist perspective, brilliantly casts its subject in a radically different light, the next must locate her in a broader context involving issues that go far beyond those of power and pleasure. It still remains to be seen where ER should stand in the pantheon of feminist heroines. The focus on who she was and how she lived makes sense only because of Eleanor's subsequent political and humanitarian contributions. If Cook finds the right balance between ER's private and public worlds, she will not just have created a stir at a time when Hillary Clinton comes to Washington but will have significantly advanced the cause of feminist biography. As someone who regularly read Eleanor Roosevelt's syndicated My Day column, I found this a fascinating and revealing, if disturbing, book. I wait to read the next volume.</p>

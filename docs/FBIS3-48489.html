			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and  North Korea will hold a series of working-level contacts during  this week in a bid to discuss a final-stage compromise to narrow  the two sides' opinion difference over the inspection method and  scope. Under a policy to complete the issue of resuming the  inspections of North Korea's facilities as soon as possible, The  IAEA is accelerating a final-stage compromise to remove  stumbling blocks through a series of working-level contacts with  North Korea or through the delivery of documents.    The IAEA did not hold a working-level contact with North  Korea yesterday, 25 January. Instead it arranged the IAEA's  position on the problems revealed at the 24 January  working-level contact as an official document and delivered it  to the North Korean side.    IAEA Spokesman David Kyd revealed that since the IAEA urged  the North Korean side to accept full-scope inspections of the  seven nuclear facilities on 19 January, opinion difference  between the two sides has been somewhat narrowed, thus a little  progress has been made. He stressed that he expects that if a  series of contacts is held in the future, the stumbling block  factor will be completely removed.    Spokesman Kyd's remarks are analyzed as while reaffirming  the  IAEA's position on full-scope inspections of the two key nuclear  facilities, the IAEA is assuming a flexible attitude toward the  working-level negotiations over the inspection method and scope.    In the meantime, diplomatic sources in Vienna pointed out  that even though inspections can be conducted early if a final  compromise succeeds, considering the recent North Korean Foreign  Ministry statement, it is early yet to have an optimistic  thought.</p>

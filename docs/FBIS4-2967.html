			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A former Executive  Councillor and the former treasury secretary of Hong Kong had  their telephones bugged for a long time because they had close  relationship with China.    This was revealed by Alex Tsui, a sacked investigator of the  Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) during the  second day of the inquiry into his sacking yesterday.    Tsui claimed he was ordered by his boss, Jim Buckle, to  investigate Yeung Kai-yin, the former transport secretary and  secretary for treasury, because Yeung was found to have a close  relationship with the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch.    "Jim Buckle immediately wrote a report and shortly after  that  Yeung left the government," Tsui said.    Tsui also disclosed that former executive and legislative  councillor "Rita Fan's (phones) had been bugged for a long  period" in 1993.    In addition, he alleged that buckle was preparing a  political  target list for use by the British Government after 1997.    "He (Buckle) told me that we had to prepare a list of names,  a list of targets. The targets will first be those who are  involved in corruption,. "And later the list should include  political targets," he said.    The list would collect all dirty things related to the  targets. And these documents would shipped to Britain after  1997, he added.    "Indeed, the ICAC has done the work of the special branch,  that's true," Tsui said.    He deemed that a key reason for his dismissal was the  conflict with Buckle over the change in the role of the ICAC to  include political vetting.    However, ICAC official Jim Buckle issued a statement shortly  after the hearing, saying what Tsui said is totally ungrounded.    Responding to the news coming to light yesterday, Fan, now a  member of the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory  Committee for the Future Government of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative region, said, "I would be very concerned if what  Mr. Tsui said was true."    She warned that such an "intrusion into her privacy" could  shatter the long-time image of the ICAC being an independent  body committed to combating corruption.    Yeung, who resigned last September after 30 year's service  in  the government, reacted with shock, saying his close links with  XINHUA officials were a result of his work.    But he asked, "since the signing the of joint declaration in  1984, can you tell me who in the civil service has not had a  close relationship with the Chinese side?"</p>

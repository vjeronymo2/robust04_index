			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLACKS OF ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Sean Saunders is a black teen-ager growing up in Orange County. His dad is a  dermatologist, his bedroom is festooned with posters of the heavy metal rock  group Iron Maiden and he owns both a Toyota truck and a $3,000 motorbike that  he often races in Palm Springs.  </P> <P> A standout football player at Foothill High School, where he is only one of 12  black students, Saunders, 17, dates and befriends only whites.  </P> <P> "I've lived here since I was 6 years old so I am not accustomed to much else,"  he said. "I don't feel weird when I am around whites because I feel truly  accepted by them -- at parties or wherever. It's around other blacks that I  don't feel like I belong. I don't speak the language."  </P> <P> A few miles away, in a tiny apartment within earshot of the Costa Mesa Freeway,  Ali Shephard, 18, listens to the music of the controversial rap group Public  Enemy and talks about Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela and social issues concerning  blacks.  </P> <P> Shephard, whose father died four years ago, works nearly 40 hours a week as a  stock boy at the nearby Drug Emporium to help his mother pay the bills and to  save for college. He prefers to date black women and surrounds himself with a  close-knit circle of black friends.  </P> <P> "Orange County is OK and all," Shephard said. "There are certainly a lot worse  places to be, but I do miss being around more of my people. It's like two  different worlds out here -- theirs and ours -- and they make sure you don't  forget it."  </P> <P> Saunders and Shephard are the two extremes of what is a complicated and often  painful struggle within Orange County's small, scattered black community -- the  desire to assimilate into what some consider a less-than-friendly white society  while maintaining a sense of African-American identity.  </P> <P> While other minorities are flocking to Orange County in search of economic  opportunity, the number of blacks remains stagnant. Out of 2.3 million  residents, blacks have made up less than 2% of the county's population for  decades. And observers say it is unlikely those numbers will increase in the  near future.  </P> <P> "Orange County has never been a place viewed as very hospitable to black folk,"  said Thomas Parham, director of career planning and placement at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> "Historically, if you looked at the way things were out here, you'll see the  John Birch Society and the ultra-conservative John Waynes were the dominant  forces," he said, "which makes it somewhat difficult for blacks to feel that  this a place with its arms extended, welcoming them in."  </P> <P> The reasons for the scarcity of blacks here are complicated and intertwined.  </P> <P> Historically, the major migration of blacks from other parts of the country to  Southern California had already ended by the time Orange County developed into  a flourishing commercial center.  </P> <P> Blacks began their slow but steady migration to the West Coast shortly after  World War I. More than 1 million blacks left the south and moved north to  Chicago and New York, and west to Los Angeles and Oakland for the better jobs  that had been created by the wartime activity.  </P> <P> The largest migration was between 1965 and 1970, when nearly 100,000 blacks  moved to Los Angeles. After that, the migration slowed considerably.  </P> <P> "Orange County didn't get major industries until the mid to late '60s," said  William Gayk, county analyst. "Many people move out to Orange County because of  their jobs, and since there probably weren't many jobs at the time when blacks  were moving, they didn't have a reason to move to Orange County."  </P> <P> And now, the high cost of housing in Orange County -- where houses routinely  sell for $200,000 and more -- is far beyond the reach of many black families,  whose average household income nationally is half that of whites.  </P> <P> According to the latest national figures by the U.S. Census Bureau, the average  black family's income is only 57% of that for whites, while the unemployment  for blacks is double that for whites.  </P> <P> "I'd have to say it's economics more than anything else," said a black Orange  County real estate agent, who declined to be named. "I've been selling homes  for 10 years now, and I can say that I've only sold homes to 10 black families  during that period. One a year. We as a people just don't have the financial  base for this type of affluent lifestyle."  </P> <P> But many mobile, affluent blacks who could afford to move here say the county  simply has a reputation that keeps them away.  </P> <P> Take Luther Hill, a vice president of a Los Angeles bank who lives in the  exclusive black community of Baldwin Hills in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I could afford to live in Orange County if I wanted to, as I feel many other  blacks living in L.A. and other parts of Southern California could," Hill said.  </P> <P> "My friends and I have even discussed it. The area doesn't appeal to me for  various reasons, including the way I know many blacks have been treated there.  Why would I want to subject myself to that with all the other things I must  deal with on a day-to-day basis?"  </P> <P> To most outsiders, Orange County has always been viewed as staunchly  conservative, uniformly white and uncompromisingly rigid in its political  attitudes.  </P> <P> In the 1920s, for example, four-fifths of the Anaheim City Council, most of the  city's police force and the publisher of the city's largest newspaper were open  about their membership in the Ku Klux Klan.  </P> <P> But many blacks say it was an incident two years ago that fueled fears of  racism. On Sept. 4, 1988, Sundaga Bryant, a black man strolling on a Balboa  shore late at night with a portable radio, was shot in his arms and torso by  Newport police, who mistook the radio for a gun.  </P> <P> "That is the kind of anxiety you feel in place like this, particularly as a  black man," Parham said. "And worse in a situation like this is that the  officer was not punished, and no one from the white community spoke out and  said, 'Hey, this is wrong.' They see a black with something in his hand and, of  course, it's a gun."  </P> <P> Bryant's lawsuit against the city of Newport Beach seeking more than $1 million  in damages is still pending.  </P> <P> Though the incident was an extreme example, many blacks cite a more subtle  racism they face daily.  </P> <P> Out of the more than 15 black men interviewed for this article, 14 said they  had been stopped by local police more than once for no apparent reason and were  questioned about everything from their car registration to their whereabouts  during a local crime.  </P> <P> "There have been times when I was just walking around my block in Tustin, and  the police would just stop me and ask if I had anything to do with some robbery  that had just been committed," said 21-year-old Bruce Gilbert.  </P> <P> "As a black man in America, I am accustomed to the fact that I am viewed as the  most probable possible criminal," he said. "But it's sad to say that here the  attitude is 10 times more intense."  </P> <P> Robert Cox, an offensive tackle for the Los Angeles Rams who lives in Anaheim,  noted that on more than one occasion he has been stopped by police to check the  registration of his black Bonneville.  </P> <P> "I am from Northern California, so all of this is really new to me," Cox said.  " I mean the whole attitude that is here in Orange County is totally different  from any other place I've lived. When I go into places, I get funny looks and  you know automatically what they're thinking: 'What's he doing here, he doesn't  belong.' "  </P> <P> Though Orange County area police deny any concentrated effort to detain blacks  without reason, Milton Grimes, a Santa Ana defense attorney who is black,  acknowledges that it's a common occurrence for black men to be detained by  police in mostly white suburban areas.  </P> <P> "It's an unfortunate reality, but true," Grimes said. "Black men are targeted  day after day for this type of what I call harassment. I tell young black men  all the time -- 'if it happens, file a complaint. Let them know you won't stand  for it.' "  </P> <P> But despite these problems, more than 25,000 blacks have decided to call Orange  County home.  </P> <P> "I've been here most of my life, so I really like and enjoy what Orange County  has to offer," said Vicki Jones, a sales clerk at South Coast Plaza who lives  in Irvine. "My family is removed from that inner-city crime, the gangs and all  the other bad elements that you find in L.A."  </P> <P> Socially, the black community in Orange County exists primarily where it always  has since the days of slavery -- in the Baptist church.  </P> <P> "The church has always been the mainstay of the black community," said the Rev.  John McReynolds, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Santa Ana, which has one of  the largest congregations in the county. "Everything from the music we all  listen to, to the dancing we all do and love has its roots in the black church.  It's vital to the community."  </P> <P> In addition to the 27 black churches in Orange County, various black social  clubs, such as the LINKS and Delta Sigma Theta, hold monthly meetings and black  history events that also bring together the otherwise virtually invisible  community.  </P> <P> "When blacks want to see other blacks in Orange County, there are various  outlets, including social events," said McReynolds. "It does take effort though  because 25,000 people may sound like a large number, but when in comparison to  more than 2 million people, it's a faint drop in the bucket."  </P> <P> But while black adults in Orange County have a variety of ways to socialize,  experts say black children can have a tough adjustment.  </P> <P> "Growing up in Orange County can have a very negative effect on black children,  particularly since they are so isolated from the traditional black community  and role models," said Dr. Phyl Robinson, an Anaheim-based psychologist.  </P> <P> "These children have an incredibly hard time defining who they are amidst blond  hair and blue eyes. Self-esteem and a sense of worth for blacks is more easily  found in a more ethnically diverse community."  </P> <P> For Sean Saunders, it has meant immersing his identity within the white  mainstream, from the music he likes to the clothes he wears. He says most of  his fellow black students at Foothill High are accepted because they excel in  some area, particularly sports.  </P> <P> "We (blacks) are all good at something, so that always helps," said Saunders,  who is co-captain of the football team.  </P> <P> But for Ali Shephard, playing "hoop ball" with the "brothers" is where he finds  the most comfort.  </P> <P> Despite his busy work schedule, Shephard manages to keep a B-plus average in  school and plans to attend Grambling College, a predominantly black school in  the South, after he graduates from Tustin High School.  </P> <P> It was at Tustin High where white and black students exchanged potent racial  slurs after a talent show last March, and Ali was there.  </P> <P> "To me, that lets me know that's the way they feel 24 hours a day and seven  days of the week," Ali said. "You don't call someone a 'nigger' out of the  clear-blue sky. It has to be something they've wanted to say all along."  </P> <P> To combat some of the anger, negative feelings and questions young blacks may  have about themselves and their community, various local black social groups  hold regular programs aimed at educating the black child on his culture and  boosting self-esteem.  </P> <P> "It may be difficult, but there are ways of instilling in a child love for  himself and his people in a community such as this," said Parham, who regularly  speaks to groups of young people about African heritage.  </P> <P> "I think some parents realize what isolation from their culture can do to a  child and are making that extra effort to expose them to cultural events  pertaining to black history."  </P> <P> But Parham also notes that while many middle-class Orange County blacks are  introducing their children to black history, others are deciding against it for  fear of alienating their children from the white majority.  </P> <P> "Feeling good about yourself," he pointed out, "does not mean feeling bad about  others."  </P></p>

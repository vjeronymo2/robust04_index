			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Top borough praises support of parents MR BILL DICKINSON, director of education for Kingston upon Thames, one of the top boroughs, believed its excellent results were based on the full range of good local schools, and not just those that selected their pupils. 'Our schools, as well as being ably led by their head teachers and management, are also strongly supported by parents and governors,' he said. 'This leads to generally well motivated pupils.' According to the results, 46.3 per cent of Kingston pupils achieved A-C grades in five or more GCSE levels, compared with a national average of 38.1 per cent. Two schools, Tiffin Girls' and the Tiffin School (for boys), achieved pass rates of 96 per cent and 92 per cent respectively for these top grades. Mr Dickinson also thought strong primary schools and the relatively small size of the borough, which allowed closer contact with schools, were factors that led to good results. Ms Sandra Buchanan, headmistress of Tiffin Girls', said it was not surprising that selective schools such as hers were at the top of the table. 'Kingston is a fairly prosperous borough so it should have good results,' she explained. 'There would be something wrong if we didn't' Southwark, the inner London borough at the bottom of the league table, was clearly taken aback by its position. It is introducing an action plan to improve future GCSE results. The borough, which includes former dockland areas, had an average of 15.1 per cent of pupils achieving top GCSE A-C grades, and 56.9 per cent entering at least one A/AS level examination compared with the national average of 86.1 per cent. Local secondary schools are being set new attainment targets, governing bodies are to undertake a comprehensive review of the results and inspectors are to visit each school to discuss its performance and assess how improvements can be made. Mr John McTernan, chairman of the education committee, said that although local results were better than last year, with more pupils entering and passing GCSEs, there remained 'unacceptable differences in attainment' between schools and departments. He said the education department and schools had had to contend with a great deal of change since Southwark assumed responsibility for education in 1990 (following the abolition of the Inner London Education Authority). 'A lot of difficulties, particularly around teacher staffing, have been resolved and I would expect to see a steady and significant improvement in exam results over the coming years.'</p>

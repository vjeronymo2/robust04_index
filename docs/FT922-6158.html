			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / EC weakens environment plans ahead of Earth Summit in Rio THE European Community's position at next week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro looks set to fall well short of what environment commissioner Carlo Ripa di Meana has proposed, and his own attendance at the summit was last night in doubt. Environment ministers of the 12 yesterday agreed to sign the Climate Change convention due to be agreed in Rio. But they did not agree to endorse politically the European Commission's plan to tax energy as a means of curbing carbon dioxide emissions, even though no EC state opposed the proposal. Nor were they able to agree on a timetable for nearly doubling development aid to a minimum of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to help developing countries adopt more environmentally sound development strategies. Taken together, this is a limp posture when set against what Mr Ripa de Meana had defined as the minimum 'dowry' the Community should take to Rio. The Commission's plan is to stabilise CO emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, through an energy tax equivalent to Dollars 10 a barrel of oil equivalent. Mr Ripa di Meana says the EC can only deliver half that target without a tax. The plan won strong support yesterday from Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy. The first four attacked the Commission for making introduction of the tax conditional on the US and Japan adopting similar measures. Spain, Portugal and Greece insisted that conditionality was vital to protect EC industry. France and the UK reserved their position behind procedure, since the Commission overshot its deadline in producing the detailed draft directive, which it will look at today. 'The UK position remains that when we see it, we will study it in detail,' Mr Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, said of the tax plan.</p>

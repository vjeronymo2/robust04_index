			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / EC plans big public works programme: Commission initiative aims to halt Europe's slide into slump THE European Commission wants closer monetary co-operation and a multi-billion-pound public works programme to break Europe's deflationary cycle. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is pushing the plan in order to revive confidence and avoid Europe's economic slowdown turning into a slump. The Commission's plan is backed by France. In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, called for a growth initiative to be adopted at next month's EC summit in Edinburgh. Mr Sapin, who starts two days of talks in London today, will outline his ideas when he sees Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, tomorrow. An EC-led stimulus package requiring pledges of new funds is likely to meet resistance from Germany, which is saddled with huge budget deficits because of the cost of unification. Bonn is expected to voice scepticism that a centralised Brussels-led infrastructure programme could conflict with the EC's idea of enhancing subsidiarity. Bonn officials suspect that the proposals could represent an effort to persuade countries such as Spain that the EC's difficulties will not hold up infrastructure programmes. Hopes of winning special conditions for Denmark to allow it to approve the Maastricht treaty are threatened with a Spanish veto unless generous 'cohesion' funds for poorer countries are also approved. The UK, currently the EC president, also has reservations about the Delors plan, which was informally discussed before the special EC summit in Birmingham last month. A spokesman for Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that 'no new work was going on' at intergovernmental level on a growth initiative. He said the EC should concentrate its efforts on securing a Gatt deal. In Brussels, EC officials said the public investment programme could involve new European Investment Bank loans of around Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.06bn), backed by government guarantees and aimed at stimulating further private investment. Another idea is to create an institution called the European Investment Fund to boost spending on roads, rail and communications. All EC governments would be asked to shift priorities from current to capital spending. A senior EC official said the public works programme was only 'one element' of a wider strategy aimed at persuading member states and the US to promote world growth. For Mr Delors, the growth initiative is partly aimed as a springboard to a political comeback after recent setbacks. Mr Delors also wants the Community to show it can respond collectively to economic crisis, and not let member states such as the UK pursue solo plans for growth.</p>

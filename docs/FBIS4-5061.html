			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 5 KYODO -- Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa assured Americans on Tuesday [5 April] that  economic reform he is pushing in Japan will heal the ailing  Japanese economy and turn it once again into a "powerful engine"  for global growth.    Hosokawa, writing in the editorial page of the newspaper USA  TODAY, said the fresh market-opening measures unveiled by Japan  last week were one result of his reform efforts, and he urged  Americans to take advantage of new business opportunities in  Japan. "I hope that foreign firms will, with enthusiasm, take  advantage of the opportunities provided by the measures, thereby  leading to an increase in imports to Japan from the United  States and elsewhere," Hosokawa said.    A Japanese Embassy spokesman said Hosokawa contributed the  article in response to a request from the newspaper to present  the Japanese case on growing trade disputes between the two  countries.    The Japanese premier, who was swept to office last August as  a champion of change, began his article by promising the  American public that he is determined to press on with political  and economic reforms in Japan. "Economic reform is particularly  important in order to pull Japan out of the current recession  and once again make it a powerful engine for the world economy,"  Hosokawa said.    Hosokawa gave an outline of the market-opening measures his  government adopted last Tuesday, arguing that tapping the  Japanese market would help create jobs in the U.S.    He said, "Japan is America's largest export market after  Canada, and Japanese investment is greatly contributing to the  creation of American jobs and to the enhancement of production  in the U.S. industry."</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: TransAtlantic rises to Pounds 67m aided by insurer TransAtlantic Holdings, the property and life assurance group controlled by Mr Donald Gordon, the South African financier, yesterday reported a 19 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 56.5m to Pounds 67m. The results were ahead of market expectations, primarily due to 50 per cent-owned associate Sun Life, which 'showed exceptionally strong growth', according to Mr Gordon, TransAtlantic's chairman. Earnings rose by 59 per cent to 13.24p (8.35p), reflecting mainly a fall in tax to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 19.2m) thanks to scrip dividends which saved ACT. A final dividend of 6p is announced, representing an unchanged full-year pay-out of 12p. Sun Life's contribution increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 42.7m. UAP, France's largest insurer, owns the other 50 per cent of the life insurer. New annual regular premiums increased by 25 per cent to Pounds 106.7m and single premiums increased by 60 per cent to Pounds 2.24bn. Sun Life reported pre-tax profit of Pounds 59.3m, up from Pounds 51.3m. TransAtlantic's property interests, incorporating the Capital &amp; Counties, contributed increased operating profit before administrative expenses of Pounds 75.1m (Pounds 71.4m). TransAtlantic is finalising the flotation of its shopping centre interests into a separately listed company, Capital Shopping Centres, which should have an initial market capitalisation of about Pounds 600m. The remaining property portfolio is also valued at Pounds 600m, and Mr Gordon said the company planned to increase its non-retail property activities. TransAtlantic yesterday finalised a Pounds 250m convertible bond issue, which will fund the recent Pounds 162m purchase of Sun Alliance's share of the Harlequin shopping centre in Watford, and reduce its floating rate debt to Pounds 58m. Mr Gordon said the company was interested in establishing a new leg to its business by investing in a life assurance company in North America. There were numerous opportunities. 'If you come out with a cheque for Dollars 1bn, you can do a lot of things in the US,' he said. TransAtlantic also owns 3 per cent of Sun Alliance. TransAtlantic's net asset value per share rose by 6 per cent to 298p in 1993, but the company said that the current book valuation of Sun Life 'materially understates TransAtlantic's net asset value.' COMMENT TransAtlantic's results provide some justification for the recent strong performance of the share price, demonstrating the strength of new business growth at Sun Life, amid a competitive market. Profits should reach Pounds 75m in 1994, putting TransAtlantic shares on a p/e of 30. This is aggressive, despite the long-term nature of its shopping centre investments. Fair market values for property and insurance would push the net asset value closer to the share price; but unless Donald Gordon pulls a choice acquisition out of the hat, the shares look fairly valued.</p>

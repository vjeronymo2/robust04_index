			<p>BFN     [Text] Recently, authorities of Yanji Municipal Public  Security in China reportedly sent an official letter to  Haninhoe, a group of some 300 South Korean companies in the  Yanbian region, requesting that they not protect or help North  Korean fugitives.    The reason for the PRC's relay of such a letter to South  Korean companies may have been spurred by North Korea perhaps  lodging a strong protest to the Chinese Government following  rumors that South Korean companies are helping North Korean  fugitives.    A South Korean Government official said on 8 May: "We have  been informed by companies in Yanbian that the PRC sent a letter  to Haninhoe requesting that they neither protect nor help North  Korean fugitives, but concentrate on business."</p>

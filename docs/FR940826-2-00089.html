These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent at any time prior to final entry. The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over these actions, and any party may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for their modification, interpretation or enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> VI <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives To The Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation to seek an injunction to prevent the proposed merger between AT&amp;T and McCaw. The United States rejected that alternative because the relief in the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the possible occurrence of conduct the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition in the relevant geographic markets for cellular service, wireless infrastructure equipment and interexchange service to cellular customers. The equal access provisions imposed by the proposed Final Judgment will open McCaw's cellular systems to competition among interexchange carriers. Because the United States believes that the proposed Final Judgment adequately protects against possible anticompetitive effects that might flow from the proposed merger, seeking to enjoin the merger could only serve to prevent the achievement of economic efficiencies and other potential procompetitive effects that might result from the merger of AT&amp;T and McCaw. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> VII <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Standard For Review Under The Tunney Act For Proposed Final Judgment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> may  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> consider_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

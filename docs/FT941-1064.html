			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: The Pru goes it alone - Debbie Harrison looks at a giant The Prudential, the largest life assurance company in Britain and the biggest provider of personal pensions, this week opted for splendid isolation; it declined to join the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator protecting private investors. The Pru has Pounds 73.5bn in assets under management. It has sold 870,000 personal pensions since 1988; this represents about one-sixth of the entire market. The company's representatives used to collect premiums in cash from the homes of policy-holders. But the 'Man from the Pru' has become more sophisticated and no contributions are collected in cash now, although the direct sales force of 9,000 still visits clients' homes to do business. More than 97 per cent of the Pru's personal pension clients invest in the company's unitised with-profits contract, sold through the direct sales force. This product offers good value for risk-averse clients who pay low contributions. The with-profits fund invests in UK and international equities, fixed-interest securities, and property. The value of units held increases by the addition of annual bonuses, plus a final bonus when the contract ends. The performance of the unitised with-profits personal pension is particularly good on single-premium contracts where the fund is in the top quartile (top 25 per cent) over five and 15 years. On the regular premium with-profits contract, the fund is either just above or just below average for all terms. The charges on the unitised with-profits contract include a 5 per cent bid/offer spread (initial charge) on all contributions and a policy fee of Pounds 3 a month on regular premium contracts, or Pounds 20 on each single premium contribution. To recoup sales and marketing costs and to pay commission, the company imposes an extra annual charge of 5 per cent of the value of the units bought during the first year. This is levied for up to 25 years. Steve Bee, the pensions manager, says: 'This is designed as a long-term savings product, but it is flexible if people's circumstances change.' If, for example, a client changes jobs and joins a company pension scheme, he is no longer allowed legally to pay contributions to the personal pension. Nevertheless, there would be an early termination penalty under most regular premium plans. Several providers waive the penalty if the client contributes instead to free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs), which are used to top up the company scheme. The Pru offers this option but also allows the client to take a break of up to five years - longer, in some cases - before FSAVC premiums have to start. Even without this flexibility, the Pru's direct sales with-profits contract charges are low compared with the industry average. The reduction in yield figures, which show the equivalent annual percentage charge over the term of the contract, are among the best available, particularly over 20 and 25 years. The unit-linked personal pension plan, which is sold through independent advisers, is not so attractive. Charges are higher and performance has been poor over all terms and contracts, apart from the five-year regular premium plan. Bee says: 'Taking a long-term view, the investment performance of our unit-linked pension funds has not been as good as we would have liked. However, over the past five years, there has been a marked improvement.' The Pru has been quick to distance itself from the recent survey on personal pensions by accountant KPMG Peat Marwick which suggested that nine out of 10 sales of personal pensions used to transfer benefits out of an occupational scheme did not comply with regulatory requirements. The Pru's transfer business represents about 9 per cent of total personal pension sales, and the company's transfer assessment system checks the adequacy of the transfer value against the level of benefits being given up in a company scheme. If this is reasonable, the system produces a like-for-like illustration which can be used to compare directly the personal pension benefits with the company scheme benefits being surrendered. Bee adds: 'We always advise against opting out of employers' schemes and we do not recommend transfers to customers . . . However, we will accept transfers if customers wish to make them and have no intention of withdrawing from the market.'</p>

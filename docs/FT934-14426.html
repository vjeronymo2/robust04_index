			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Eurotunnel needs another Pounds 1bn  -At a glance Eurotunnel confirmed this week that it would need to raise at least another Pounds 1bn from banks and shareholders by mid-May 1994. At least half the additional funds will come from a rights issue. The company has reduced its initial revenue estimates because of start-up delays and price competition from the ferry companies. On current estimates, it will not be until 1998 that the company breaks even on a cash basis.</p>

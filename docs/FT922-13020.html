			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / BT presses Oftel for faster rise in line rental charges TELEPHONE BILLS for heavy business and residential customers could rise more slowly if BT persuades Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, to allow faster increases in its charges for renting lines. The company's proposals - in a submission to Oftel, which is reviewing BT's prices - would mean that customers who use the telephone infrequently would see their bills increase by more than the rate of inflation. This could affect around 7m customers. The submission was made last month but not published until yesterday, because BT did not wish the matter to be drawn into the general election campaign. Mr Malcolm Argent, BT's company secretary, repeated the company's frequently used argument that line rental charges were artificially low and call charges artificially high. The company estimates that the size of the subsidy from calls to rental charges is Pounds 1.8bn a year. Currently, BT is allowed to increase rental and connection charges by 2 percentage points above the rate of inflation each year. The company wants the constraint on rental charges to be replaced by a stipulation that the size of the average residential customer's bill should not go up by more than inflation. Mr Argent said this would mean that people paying less than the average  - Pounds 43.57 a quarter - would see their bills increasing faster than inflation, but that those paying more would find their bills going up at a slower rate. He said such a 'rebalancing' of charges would allow BT to compete fairly against rivals such as Mercury Communications which are not under similar regulatory constraints. It would also be good for the economy, he argued, because lower call charges would encourage people to use the phone more. Mr Argent refused to spell out how sharply BT wanted to increase prices, saying he did not wish to be 'hoist on his own petard'. He said BT's poorest customers would be protected by a scheme allowing them to pay lower rental charges if they made very limited use of the phone. BT is also arguing for a relaxation of its overall price cap, which requires that the cost of a basket of services should be set at the retail price index minus 6.25 percentage points. It believes a figure of 4.5 percentage points should be the 'starting point for discussions' with Oftel. BT has held several meetings with Oftel which the regulator describes as 'preliminary skirmishes'. Both sides would like to reach an agreement by the time Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, moves to the Office of Fair Trading in mid-June.</p>

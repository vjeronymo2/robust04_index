The rate of decline was the greatest since the ministry  started the annual surveys in 1961.    Ministry officials attributed the plunge chiefly to a 24.1  percent fall in construction orders from the private sector to  12.11 trillion yen -- the third straight yearly drop.    Orders from the manufacturing industries, centered on the  automotive and food businesses, posted a 37.1 percent decrease,  and those from the nonmanufacturing industries a 21.3 percent  fall.    Orders from the public sector totaled 6.38 trillion yen,  down  7.1 percent for the first fall in eight years.    Authorities placed more orders with medium-sized and small  construction companies and fewer orders with major firms  following the uncovering last year of a series of bribery  scandals involving general contractors and local government  chiefs.</p>

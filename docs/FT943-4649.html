			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / BMW takes on more staff BMW is to take on 700 full-time production workers in the German car industry's most significant hiring move in three years. The company, which yesterday also announced extra Saturday shifts for the rest of the year, said strong orders for new models and rising demand across the rest of its range demanded additional production capacity. Although most of the new permanent jobs are to go to employees on short-term contracts, the move appeared to mark an end of the steady erosion of the workforce which started in 1992. However, it is unlikely to be matched elsewhere in the German automotive industry, where reduction of payroll costs remains a priority. Yesterday, Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen's chairman, stepped up his lobbying efforts for government subsidies to bolster car sales.</p>

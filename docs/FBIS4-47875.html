			<p>BFN     [Text] Nelspruit, May 5, SAPA -- When Mathews Phosa fled to  Mozambique in April 1985, he left behind an unusual range of  professional and business activities.    As a high profile lawyer, political campaigner, member of an  underground ANC cell and working for MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe --  Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing], MK counter-intelligence  had informed him that the South African security forces were  plotting to kill him.    Now Nakedi Mathews Phosa is to be sworn in as premier of the  Eastern Transvaal region following the massive ANC victory in  this region during the general elections.    He is currently the chairperson of the ANC in the Eastern  Transvaal.    Mathews Phosa was born in Mbombela township at Nelspruit on  September 1, 1952. His early years were spent on the farm in  Potgietersrus with his grandfather. When he lost his land  during the land removals young Phosa went to live with his  parents in Nelspruit where his father was a teacher.    His mother, who was politically active, had a strong  influence on his life telling him about Nelson Mandela in prison  on Robben Island among other things.    He attended boarding school in Acornhoek.    Having matriculated with a distinction in agricultural  science, Phosa studied law at the University of the North.  Steve Biko and Themba Sono were the heroes of his generation.    At university Phosa started publishing poetry in English and  Afrikaans.    He graduated, completed his articles and started a legal  firm  of which he is still the senior partner.    Besides serving as national organiser of the Black Lawyers'  Association, Phosa was on the board of directors of a business  and of a welfare organisation he had founded.    When the then apartheid government wanted to incorporate  KaNgwane into Swaziland, he was prominent in the campaigns  against the move. He also led the rent boycotts in the Eastern  Transvaal. During this time - in the early 1980's he joined MK  and the ANC underground.    During his stay in Mozambique he became part of a machinery  directing political and military activity in the Eastern  Transvaal. In 1990 he was among the first cadres sent home to  begin negotiations with the government.    As a lawyer he is currently involved in defending members of  the movement and organising the ANC Legal Department.    He is a member of the National Negotiations Commission and  serves on the police board in terms of the Peace Accord.    He is married to social worker Yvonne Nkwenkwezi and has  three children.    The Eastern Transvaal region incorporates KaNgwane and  KwaNdebele. It is a rich coal mining and industrial area, where  sheep and fruit farming as well as forestry are among the main  income generators. The Eastern Transvaal is also a well-known  South African tourism destination.</p>

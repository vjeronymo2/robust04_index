			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Jobless total falls for second month running - At a Glance Unemployment fell for the second month running in March, raising hopes that the recession is over. The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 26,000 to 2.94m. The Treasury said it was dangerous to read too much into any one month's figures and said it was still too early to say whether unemployment had peaked. The March drop in the seasonally adjusted total of people out of work followed a 25,500 drop in February and compared with City expectations of a 30,000 increase last month. The unadjusted jobless figure fell by 46,000 to 2.99m in March, below the politically important 3m mark.</p>

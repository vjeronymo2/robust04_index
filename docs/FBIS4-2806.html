			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.N. Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali said here today that he supports in  principle Germany's request for a permanent seat in a reformed  UN Security Council.    He made the statement at a press conference at the end of  his  two-day visit, his third to Germany.    Under the UN Charter, the decision on expanding the 15-seat  council has to be taken by the UN General Assembly and he is not  responsible for the issue, said Butrus-Ghali.    But the UN chief promised to appoint a German as an under-  secretary-general.    He said he welcomes any role Germany can play in the UN.    The Security Council has five permanent members and some  countries, including Germany and Japan, have tried to obtain  permanent seats in the body.</p>

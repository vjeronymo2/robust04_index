			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / European Government Bonds: Year of Maastricht and recession THE TWO words which have determined the performance of the government bond markets this year are 'Maastricht' and 'recession'. When Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty on June 2, European government bond markets were thrown into confusion over the prospects for European economic and monetary union. Investors moved out of the higher-yielding bond markets, such as Italy and Spain, and into the safe haven of the D-Mark bloc, forcing up prices on German, Dutch and Belgian government bonds. Hopes of lower interest rates - or actual cuts in interest rates - helped to propel several of the government bond markets, particularly those in Europe which were suffering from severe recession, as well as the Japanese government bond market. The chart shows the performance of the main government bonds markets over the last year, and illustrates the impact of uncertainty over European economic and monetary union as well as the effect of falling interest rates in certain markets. The UK government bond market was the top performer among the world's 14 largest government bond markets in local currency terms, according to data compiled by J. P. Morgan. Gilts showed a return of 18 per cent in local currency terms, helped by falling UK interest rates during the year. The UK base rate peaked at 15 per cent in 1989-1990. It has been cut steadily since October 1990 as inflation has gradually fallen and the government has recognised the need to try to stimulate the UK economy. While sterling was a member of the European exchange rate mechanism, the room for manoeuvre on the interest rate front was severely restricted, due to the Bundesbank's determination to keep German interest rates high in order to conquer inflation. At the start of 1992, the base rate stood at 10.5 per cent, falling to 10 per cent in May. However, as the Danes voted against the Maastricht Treaty, the weaker member-currencies of the EMS - including sterling - came under pressure. After briefly increasing the base rate to defend the pound's exchange rate against the D-Mark, the government decided to pull sterling out of the ERM in September. Since then, the government has enjoyed greater freedom to cut rates, and the base rate has been slashed from 10 per cent on September 18 to 7 per cent on November 13. Clearly, the gilt market has benefited from the steady cuts in interest rates over the year - and by expectations of much lower interest rates during much of the autumn and winter. Some economists predicted that the base rate would fall as low as 5 per cent by early 1993 as the government attempted to kick-start the UK economy. The other top-performing government bond markets in local currency terms this year were those in the D-Mark bloc, reflecting the rush by investors to the more stable ERM currencies at a time of turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, and expectations of lower interest rates in Germany. Following the reunification of Germany, the Bundesbank has been forced to tighten monetary policy in order to try to curb inflation. German interest rates have gradually risen, but in September the Bundesbank allowed a small easing - with the discount rate cut from 8.75 to 8.25 per cent and the Lombard rate from 9.75 to 9.50 per cent. Most economists believe German interest rates have now peaked and should gradually fall as inflation and money supply figures improve. Investors saw a 15.71 per cent return in the Dutch government bond market (in local currency terms), followed by 13.87 per cent from Belgium, and 13.01 per cent from Germany. Buyers had flocked to the high-yielding bond markets such as Spain and Italy in 1991 and early 1992 as they looked for so-called 'convergence plays' - hoping to gain from falling inflation and cuts in interest rates in these markets. However, after the Danish vote, investors rushed to sell high-yielding bonds and bought bunds, as well as Dutch and Belgian bonds. Returns from the traditional high-yielding European markets lagged those of the D-Mark bloc. The Spanish government bond market showed a return of 6.89 per cent in local currency terms, while Italy rose by 9.68 per cent. For sterling-based investors, the top-performing government bond market was Japan, which showed a 36.26 per cent return. The Japanese government bond market showed a 10.83 per cent rise in local currency terms as the Bank of Japan has eased interest rates. A year ago the Bank of Japan cut the official discount rate from 5 per cent to 4.5 per cent, and the central bank eased further during 1992, allowing the discount rate to fall to 3.25 per cent. Hopes of further easing sustained the Japanese government bond market throughout much of the year, especially as the stock market plummeted and the economy remained weak. For sterling-based investors, the returns from the D-Mark bloc markets were also boosted by sterling's 15 per cent depreciation against these currencies, with the Dutch bond market showing a 34.71 per cent rise in sterling terms, followed by Belgium (32.63 per cent), and Germany (31.34 per cent). The US Treasury bond market gained 30.39 per cent in sterling terms, although it only showed a 7.21 per cent return in dollar terms. 'The US Treasury bond market performed badly during the first four months of the year as investors started anticipating a pick-up in the economy,' according to J. P Morgan. However, as the US economy remained weak, the US Treasury bond market rallied until the autumn.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: WILL GARBO EX-PAL SAM GREEN PLEASE STAND UP?  </P> <P> THIS COLUMN has been trying to find Garbo's former pal Sam Green. They were  very close until the actress discovered that Sam had been taping their  conversations. Sam, if you read this, give a call.  </P> <P> R. G. Friedman of Brooklyn asks: "How did Garbo manage to live comfortably  without doing any kind of work, no movies in nearly 50 years?" Good question.  Well, Garbo was notoriously close with a dollar. There are no notable acts of  charity or generosity in her life. She herself lived rather simply. She often  visited and traveled as "the world's guest," notably aboard the yacht of her  friend, the Baroness Cecile de Rothschild. (She is now very ill in Paris.)  </P> <P> A typical Garbo incident occurred in Greece when the star was visiting a member  of the Calliga shipping family. After a long stay, she left behind a rueful  maid who had attended her. The maid liked to show off the old straw hat with  its holes and frayed edges, saying, "Garbo gave me this; it was her tip!"  </P> <P> Garbo invested early in the 1930s in valuable Los Angeles real estate, which  has only gone up and up ever since. She has likely left a sizable fortune.  </P> <P> THE MANNER in which ABC's "PrimeTime" offered up its background to the Marla  Maples interview -- why, my, my -- out there in TV-land, I'm sure the public  got the idea that the New York Post was the newspaper that scooped and covered  the big story of the Ivana-Donald Trump split. Diane Sawyer's producers didn't  even bother to show you the New York Daily News front page that busted this one  wide open.  </P> <P> WASHINGTON has always been such a "company town" its business is "government"  and "gossip." So public figures in D.C. always concentrate a lot on image.  </P> <P> But the TV age has now arrived with such a vengeance that every congressman,  senator and Cabinet member knows enough to want a good makeup before going on  the air. Some now arrive at studios with makeup charts, outlining their  best/worst features, numbers and brand names of foundation bases, etc. One of  the most dedicated is West Virginia's Sen. Jay Rockefeller.  </P> <P> ANYBODY AROUND here care that Eddie Murphy's enormous exclusive contract with  Paramount has ended? Every studio has, of course, offered him a blank check to  relocate. But Eddie says he needs to take some time off. He is spending it in a  very Bill Cosby-ish way, with his new baby daughter at his house in New Jersey.  </P> <P> NOW THAT David Geffen has bought the nine-acre Jack Warner estate in Beverly  Hills for a record $47.5 million, let's note he also bought a screenplay by  Shane "Lethal Weapon" Black for a record $1.75 million. "The Last Boy Scout"  was a sizzling property, the center of an auction frenzy by the majors.  </P> <P> Geffen, with his $500-million profits from the sale of his record company to  MCA safely tucked away, is also ready to bring the Broadway musical  "Dreamgirls" to the screen.  </P> <P> There is continuing speculation that Spike Lee will direct.  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: FT-A Bank Index above All-Share UK BANK shares yesterday ended a 16-year run of underperforming the equity markets, a turning point that underscored their recovery in investors' opinion. The FT-Actuaries Bank Index rose 1.5 per cent yesterday to close at 1,406.97 compared with the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index's which ended at 1,393.64. Thus, the ratio of the bank index to the All-Share, known as the sector relative, was greater than 100 per cent for the first time since 1977. The bank index - based on shares of the large high street clearing banks and others including Standard Chartered and Abbey National - stayed below the All-Share in the 1980s because of losses on loans to less developed countries and high interest rates. Some analysts have predicted that the sector would continue to outperform this year as expectations of bank profitability rise. Investor confidence in bank shares has grown strongly over the past 18 months as banks are perceived to have improved their management, and to have set in train profit recoveries extending to 1995 or 1996. The sector relative figure has risen from around 70 per cent at the end of 1991 to 101 per cent yesterday. It was boosted last July by the addition of HSBC Holdings to the sector following its acquisition of Midland Bank. Mr Nick Collier, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the banks' sector relative figure would have stood at about 88 per cent yesterday without the addition of HSBC Holdings. This left scope for further outperformance by banks this year. Mr Collier said he believed banks would be inherently more profitable in a low interest and low inflation economy where the risks accompanying loans were cut. Banks are still suffering from losses on loans made in the late 1980s. Mr Robert Law, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said bank shares had underperformed during the 1980s because of loan problems, and the dilution of capital through high inflation, which had required a series of rights issues. He said current share prices largely discounted recoveries in earnings up to 1995 or 1996, and the outperformance of bank shares could be fragile if assumptions that future loans would be less risky than past ones proved wrong. The last time that the FT-A All Share was at the same level as the banks' index was January 17, 1977. Bank shares reached their lowest relative level in April 1989, when they fell to 66 per cent of the FT-A All Share.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Major prepared to send Bosnia reinforcements: PM backs soldiers who shot dead Croat gunmen THE PRIME MINISTER, Mr John Major, yesterday strongly backed British soldiers who fired on Croat gunmen in central Bosnia, saying he was prepared to send reinforcements if necessary. He was speaking a few hours after British United Nations peacekeeping troops shot dead two Croatian soldiers who attacked a Moslem convoy near Vitez, the British base in central Bosnia. He underlined the government's commitment not to take 'any unacceptable risks with the lives of our troops in Bosnia', telling a Conservative party conference in Wales that there was 'increasing evidence of widespread deterioration on the ground'. The prime minister's office emphasised that Mr Major and other senior ministers were keeping a close watch on the situation and said there were contingency arrangements to protect the lives of the 2,400 British troops deployed to assist in providing humanitarian aid in Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, indicated that the incident would not lead to an early withdrawal of the British contingent of UN forces from Bosnia. 'So long as the government believes that our troops can do a good job in saving lives without undue risk, they will go on doing so,' he said. In Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warned that intense fighting and roadblocks have virtually halted all humanitarian aid convoys in central Bosnia. 'We have basically reached a worst-case scenario with things degenerating,' Mr Ron Redmond, UNHCR spokesman, said. In Belgrade, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, mediators for the EC and the UN, announced that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia had agreed to travel to Geneva for peace talks, probably next Wednesday. The Bosnian Croat leader, Mate Boban, reversing a previous statement, said he too would go to Geneva. Lord Owen said: 'We have to look increasingly at the issue of Bosnia and Croatia and Serbia and that is why I think it is appropriate we have the three presidents talking to each other.' Mr Major is under pressure from opposition MPs who have urged the withdrawal of British soldiers. MPs of all parties expressed dismay at the fast-deteriorating situation in Bosnia. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the situation could not be controlled. The Bosnian Serb army said it would hand back weapons to up to 900 Croats who surrendered to them so they can go back to fighting Moslems in central Bosnia. The Croats had been held in a prison camp after being taken from a flood of refugees who fled clashes with Moslems around Travnik during the weekend.

Taking part in it are more than 600 representatives  of the regional organizations of political parties and  movements, entrepreneurial and industrial structures,  foundations and public organizations from Odessa, Poltava, Sumy,  Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Zhytomir, Nikolayev, Kiev, and other  cities of Ukraine. One of the co-chairmen of the bloc,  Volodymyr Hrynyov, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman of  the "Nova Ukrayina" [New Ukraine] association, emphasized that  the goal of the future strong parliamentary coalition, which the  bloc expects to reach at the March election to the Supreme  Council, should be order and the market in Ukraine. He believes  that ways toward this lie in privatization, improvement of the  financial system, establishment of equal economic relations with  Russia, changes within the authority institutions, and the  priorities of the private sector. The conference is planned to  approve an appeal of the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc to the citizens of  Ukraine on the election eve and a "Declaration on the goals and  principles of the activity of the Interregional bloc of  reforms." The four fundamental provisions of the  "Declaration..." envision the following: priority of human  rights and freedoms, creation of a civilized market society in  Ukraine on the principles of private ownership of land and the  means of production, refusal from any attempts to build a state  with national and ethnic priorities, refusal of the policy of  confrontation with Russia and other CIS countries. Also, the  conference delegates will take part in the work of the "Kharkov  Business Assembly."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The inter-Tajik talks to stabilize the situation in  Tajikistan are continuing in Moscow. This was told to a  correspondent of the Khovar news agency by Rahim Hasanov, a  spokesman of the Tajik Embassy in Russia, yesterday. On the  second and third days of the talks, the sides continued the  discussion of the agenda with the mediation of Ramiro  Piriz-Ballon, the UN secretary general's special envoy. The  issues related to achievement of a cease-fire and stopping the  acts of provocation on the Tajik-Afghan border were entered on  the agenda by proposals of the Tajik Government delegation.    Shukurjon Zuhurov, the head of the Tajik Government  delegation, proposed that a joint declaration to put an end to  hostilities, especially on the Tajik-Afghan border, be adopted  in the course of talks as a top priority task. Issues related to  repatriation of refugees, disarming illegal bands, and involving  all citizens of Tajikistan -- in particular those citizens  living outside the territories of the Republic -- in discussion  of a draft of a new constitution, are among the issues raised by  the sides.    The sides are going to thoroughly study each point of the  agenda. Today, the sides are going to consult with experts. The  representatives of the United Nations, the Foreign Ministries of  Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, and the  representatives of the Embassies of Iran, Afghanistan, and  Pakistan are attending the talks as observers.</p>

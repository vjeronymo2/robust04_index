			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Commerzbank in Tokyo gets bill for extra taxes Japanese tax authorities have sent the Tokyo branch of Commerzbank, Germany's third biggest commercial bank, an additional tax bill of Y40m (Pounds 2.58m). The National Tax Agency claims the bank failed to report income of Y100m in 1991 and 1992. The bank is the first financial institution to be involved in the tax agency's crackdown on Japanese affiliates and branches of foreign companies, which have been allegedly trying to avoid paying local taxes by transferring profits from Japan. In July, the tax agency stepped up efforts to tackle the problem. Last month, the Japanese subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri was ordered to pay Y1.1bn in additional taxes. Ciba-Geigy, Roche, Hoechst and Coca-Cola, the US beverage company, are also among companies sent penalty tax bills. Commerzbank said a misunderstanding arose over when it should have booked costs for its computer investment. A company official said about 60 per cent of the Y100m in under-reported income derived from computer costs; the rest was from financial trading, including derivatives. Japanese tax authorities have started targeting profits made on derivatives trading, an area where foreign banks and brokers have expertise, and the main source of income at foreign institutions.</p>

After hearing a brief report by the government-funded Taipei  Agricultural Products Company, which assured Lien that supplies  of all products are sufficient, Lien expressed his satisfaction  over the bounty and wished a happy New Year to all market  workers.    In addition to raising questions about product prices and  market administration, Lien told Taipei City Mayor Huang  Ta-chou, who accompanied Lien during the inspection tour, that  the city government should continue its efforts to promote  automation of and direct sales from production sites to offer  better service to consumers.    The supply of vegetables, fruit, fish and meat has increased  by as much as 60 percent with the coming of the holidays, and  the supply of flowers and potted plants -- used for holiday  ornamentation -- has increased by 20 percent.    Calyx canthus, gladioli, chrysanthemums, lilies and  anthuriums are especially popular this time of year, and their  prices are an average of 10 percent higher than they were for  last year's lunar new year.    This is the first time that Lien has toured the two  wholesale  markets since he assumed the premiership a year ago. The  markets will close on Feb. 10, New Year's Day, and reopen on  Feb. 15.    Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry under  the Taiwan provincial government also instructed all county and  city authorities to increase supplies of all kinds of  necessities to satisfy the growing holiday demand.</p>

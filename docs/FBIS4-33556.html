			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release by the Jonassaint government responding to </F> the threat of military intervention in Haiti.]    [Text] 1. The provisional Government of the Republic has  noted with stupefaction the AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE dispatch dated  3 June in which a Haitian citizen has just demanded a military  intervention by a foreign power against his country.    2. The provisional Government of the Republic is amazed that  the United Nations charges this government with state  delinquency by unanimously legalizing this cowardly attack by  the planet's superpower against the small, independent,  sovereign Republic of Haiti, still a statuary member of this  organization.    3. In view of this unanimity of international policy in  favor  of organized genocide on behalf of anarchy and fanaticism,  regardless of logic, in defiance of international law,  regardless even of reason, the Government of the Republic  believes that it must protest, and as a matter of fact, does  protest against the military option considered and being closely  executed by the Navy despite the sane opinion of polite society,  carrying on regardless of the resolutions of Congress.    4. The provisional Government reiterates to all the great  and  small powers of the world its deepest feeling of friendship and  good faith in cooperating with the international community for  the defense of peace and the promotion of the development of  nations.    5. The provisional Government stresses to all, however, that  any attack will trigger an automatic reaction of defense, even  suicide.    6. Therefore, the order has been passed to the Haitian Armed  Forces to remember under these circumstances the strategic  traditions of the country by taking all proper measures to  organize civil defense for the benefit of the national  population.    7. The homeland remains above all sacrifice!</p>

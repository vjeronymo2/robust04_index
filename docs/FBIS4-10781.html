			<p>BFN     [Text] DPRK President Kim Il-song has stressed that the  DPRK has neither the intent nor the capacity to produce nuclear  arms. That would make no sense, he said, adding that the United  States is mistaken in thinking that pressure and intimidation  can bring the DPRK to its knees.    This statement was made by Kim Il-song in the course of an  exclusive PRENSA LATINA interview at the Presidential Palace.  During the two-hour interview, Kim Il-song addressed the current  tense situation being experienced by the DPRK, relations with  the PRC and other countries, foreign investment, and the outlook  for reunification of the Korean peninsula.    Kim Il-song also praised the DPRK's ties with Cuba and  President Fidel Castro. In a measured and firm voice, Kim  Il-song stressed that his government is committed to turning the  Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone.</p>

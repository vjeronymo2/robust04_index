			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Putting trust in pensions - Debbie Harrison finds a small but well-formed alternative to life companies in providing an income after retirement DOES THE average employee have a real choice when it comes to a personal pension provider? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Despite most financial institutions being able to offer these plans, the fact is that life offices have maintained a virtual monopoly on this lucrative market. Personal pensions were introduced in July 1988 to allow employees to opt out individually from the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), and to provide a tax-efficient investment vehicle for their retirement savings. Of the 5m plans sold to date, an estimated 97 per cent are life office products. So, what happened to the other institutions? Most of the banks and building societies, deterred by the cost of setting up systems to offer pensions, rushed with almost indecent haste into the welcoming arms of the life offices and signed exclusive sales agreements in return for handsome commissions. One of the few sectors to challenge the life office monopoly - the unit trust groups - saw its meagre presence reduced further when Fidelity withdrew from the market earlier this month. Fidelity's action leaves only three main unit trust providers: Rothschild Asset Management (RAM), Gartmore and Murray Johnstone. Despite this, unit trust pension plans are worth considering by both individuals and employers interested in setting up a simple, cost-effective group arrangement that offers flexibility of contributions without penalty. Murray Johnstone's product is a group money-purchase scheme under which the unit trust group handles the investment but the administration is looked after by a third party. RAM and Gartmore continue to provide individual plans and undertake both investment and administration. Both companies are keen to develop in the group market. Assuming you are satisfied with the performance, one of the main attractions of unit trust personal pensions is the charging structure. These products offer a simple, clear fee system with two elements: the initial charge (or bid/offer spread) and the annual management charge. RAM's charges are 5 per cent initial and 1 per cent annual while Gartmore's are 6 per cent initial and 0.5-1.5 per cent annual, depending on the fund. Murray Johnstone cut its fees last year and now imposes an initial charge of up to 1 per cent and an annual management levy of 1.5 per cent. Bear in mind, however, that RAM and Gartmore allow in their initial charge for a commission payment to the adviser, part of which could be rebated or re-invested. Murray Johnstone usually sells through fee-based advisers. By comparison, life office charges are notoriously complex and it is impossible for the layman to find out what he is actually paying. In addition to the bid/offer spread and annual management fee, there are policy and administration fees. Many unit-linked insurance plans also allocate the early contributions to 'initial' or 'capital' units which carry a higher annual charge than standard units. Furthermore, regular premium plans tend to pay a hefty up-front commission to the adviser, often accounting for most of the initial two years' contributions. This is usually paid from the capital unit charges. Unit trust groups can pay only a single premium commission of 4-5 per cent, which is incorporated in the bid/offer spread. While it can be shown that there is little difference in total commission cost between the regular and single premium method over a 25-year investment period, few plans last this long in practice and many are terminated within the first few years. Robert Ivey, financial services manager at actuarial consultant R. Watson and Sons, says: 'Many people with personal pensions will face the situation where they have to stop making regular contributions, perhaps because they have moved to a company which has a good pension scheme, been made redundant, or simply can no longer afford to contribute. 'In these circumstances, it is important that they receive the full value of their contributions. Contracts arranged as a series of single premiums are likely to provide considerably better value for money in this event. This is the standard basis used by unit trust providers.' Despite this advantage, several problems have beset the unit trust groups. Personal pensions are a heavy administrative burden on providers and, while life offices are geared up to cope with this, unit trust groups have had to start from scratch. Moreover, unit trust groups are not able to offer important features like life cover and waiver of premium insurance. In most cases, this has to be bought separately, although Gartmore has set up an arrangement with Swiss Life to provide these benefits. Explaining Fidelity's reasons for abandoning its personal pension plan, Mary Blair, executive director of product development, said: 'We see ourselves primarily as an investment house, and we found dealing with the complex pensions legislation and administration very onerous.' Fidelity has transferred its clients to Professional Life, which will handle the pensions administration while maintaining an investment link with Fidelity's funds. Other well-known groups did not even attempt to provide a unit trust personal pension. Save &amp; Prosper and M &amp; G decided to launch unit-linked products through their life operations while Mercury Fund Managers (the investment arm of merchant bank SG Warburg) set up Mercury Life in July 1989 specifically to launch a unit-linked product. Midland Bank switched to a unit-linked product despite the apparent initial success of its unit trust plan. Last year Invesco linked up with Provident Life to provide unit trust investment but, again, via a life office unit-linked plan. In all of these cases, the higher charging structure and higher commissions paid on unit-linked personal pensions made them favourites over the more cost-effective but less lucrative unit trust version. Employees and employers interested in unit trust personal pensions, whether on a group or individual basis, should bear in mind the long-term nature of this type of investment and seek advice to select the fund suited best to their own risk profile. The unit trust groups do offer deposit and gilt funds, for example, and recommend a switch to these safe havens five years before retirement to protect gains in the event of a stock market crash.</p>

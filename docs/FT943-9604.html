			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Japanese investors fall under curse of pyramids Japanese investors, in common with their counterparts in Moscow and the UK, are finding that innovative local companies have yet to perfect the profitable pyramid scheme. Government figures yesterday suggested that police found 331,000 investors stuck in pyramid schemes in the first seven months this year, more than double the 163,500 affected for the whole of last year. Multi-tiered marketing, as proponents prefer to describe such schemes, is not illegal in Japan. The ministry of international trade and industry releases occasional warnings to take care in dealings with certain companies, and urges mainstream employers to warn their workforces. The pyramid companies are called nezumiko ('mice networks') because of their constant need to breed. Unlike MMM, the subject of Muscovite riots, Japanese pyramid companies often have a product of sorts to sell. But they rely on the same principle: paying anything near their projected dividends requires continuing recruitment of participants who will be progressively less advantaged as the pecking order grows. The losses have been mounting quickly this year. Stakeholders' losses reached Y76.2bn (Dollars 770m) in the first seven months, up from Y29.5bn in 1993 and just Y7.1bn the year before, when barely 30,000 people were caught out. In the latest known case, Sun Flower, a Tokyo company selling water and air purifiers, fax machines and health foods, recruited some 280,000 agents by telling them they would earn as much as Y1m a month. The agents were expected to buy products themselves, and police say that few made any money except the 20 executives subsequently arrested. In February, police accused directors of an Osaka waterbed maker of illegally persuading people to part with at least Y230,000 for one of its products, plus Y10,000 apiece to join a scheme where they would earn commission not only from those they recruited but from all those beneath them in the chain. Agents of such companies canvass acquaintances or sell door-to-door in their spare time. Most are young white-collar workers, often newly relocated to big cities and inspired by the expectation of getting rich quickly at a time when regular employers are cutting bonuses. The pyramid companies sometimes offer credit terms to get recruits started, but Ms Keiko Furukawa of the Tokyo metropolitan government consumers' centre says there are other seductions. One company making jacuzzi attachments held regular barbecues for members.</p>

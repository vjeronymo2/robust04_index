			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt A steep rise in yields on German bunds over the course of last week reflected poor conditions in the US markets - yields on German government securities rose from 5.63 to 5.71 per cent over the course of the week. The trend is likely to be reversed only if the Bundesbank policy-making council chooses this Thursday to deliver a long-awaited cut in short-term interest rates. The fundamentals support such a move - inflation is dropping and money supply growth in January is likely to be back to manageable levels after the embarrassingly high 8.1 per cent increase in the seasonally adjusted figure for December. January data may be released this week. Timing considerations alone suggest that this Thursday may be a good moment to cut - it is unlikely that the Bundesbank will want to ease two weeks later (when its changes to minimum reserve requirements take effect). But the central bank is unlikely to want to ease monetary policy further before an acceptable wage deal is reached in the engineering sector. Talks between employers and the IG Metall union broke up on Friday night without an agreement. A cut on Thursday would send the wrong signal. The markets will thus pay close attention this week to developments on the pay round.</p>

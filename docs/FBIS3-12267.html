			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faruq Qaddumi, identified by his </F> nom de guerre Abu-al-Lutf, chief of the PLO Political  Department, "conducted a short while ago" by unidentified  reporter; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Faruq Qaddumi: Have you taken any  steps that could be announced, or at least what is the current  tendency? Would the talks be suspended? And would they be  resumed if your conditions are met or if new bases are laid  down? Will the PLO be satisfied with moving the talks to  Washington, as President Clinton called for?    [Qaddumi] Moving the talks is not sufficient. The  invitation, which is addressed to the PLO, seems to forget what  took place yesterday. The crime perpetrated by Israeli hands --  through the army's collaboration -- cannot be forgiven.  Decisive steps must be taken by the international community to  stop such acts in the future.    They say that Israel is protecting its security. In fact, we  are the ones who need security. Israel is the hotbed of  tension; it is the one which is creating such problems and  practicing terrorism in the region. Israel is a Nazi state,  which is perpetrating massacres. This is a Palestinian  holocaust. They say that they were treated unjustly in history,  however, they are inflicting their injustice on others.    The United States comes to cover up this crime with its call  for negotiations. This is not the issue. There should be  international guarantees to protect our people inside the  occupied territory. Defenseless people are facing this Israeli  military warmarchine supplied to Israel by the United States.    [Reporter] We can understand from what you are saying that  the Palestinian leadership is now discussing whether or not the  talks will continue. It seems from what you said about Israel  that it is difficult to resume the talks.    [Qaddumi] The continuation of the talks is difficult now. We  accepted the call for peace, but Israel is practicing the  opposite. It is practicing terrorism. How can a man hold talks  under these circumstances. We recalled all our delegations here  to Tunis. First, the Security Council must issue a resolution  condemning Israel and take the necessary steps in this regard.  The United States should take measures to protect our people  through the Security Council and international forces. Steps  also must be taken to dismantle these settlements. The United  States is saying that these settlements are obstacle to peace.  This crime proves that these settlements are obstacle to peace.  Therefore, these settlements must be removed. Otherwise, what  is the benefit of these talks?    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, does this mean that the resumption  of  talks now depends on the removal of the settlements?    [Qaddumi] This should be the case. We are holding talks with  the United States and the Security Council. These settlements  must be dismantled and the occupation should end. This is the  cause of tension in the region.    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf: We must be clear in the wake of the  terrible massacre which took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque. Does  this mean that you are suspending the talks with Israel, or will  you discuss the issue of settlements and settlers during the  coming talks?    [Qaddumi] First, the Security Council should issue a  resolution. Then, the second step comes; namely, the removal of  these settlements. If no measures are taken these negotiations  will be meaningless.    [Reporter] Israel announced that it will take firm measures  against settlers?    [Qaddumi] Let us see what are these measures which will  really provide security and peace for our people.    [Reporter] Shim'on Peres announced that the negotiations  should be rescued? How can this be done?    [Qaddumi] He himself should take measures, not the  Palestinian people.    [Reporter] But he speaks about rescuing the negotiations as  they are in a dilemma?    [Qaddumi] They are the ones whose positions have brought  about this dilemma, from the Cairo agreement until today. Every  day, they go back on what they wrote in this agreement and  postpone withdrawal. All this means Israel does not want peace  in the region. It wants to be rewarded for its occupation of  Palestinian and Arab territories.    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, this means all the basics on which  the negotiations between you and Israel were initiated could be  subject to review.    [Qaddumi] The negotiations cannot continue in this manner.  The cosponsors of the conference, particularly the United  States, should act as a sponsor that is not biased toward  Israel. The weapons it gave to Israel are enough. It suffices  that the United States says it wants to safeguard Israel's  security. The Palestinian Arab people and the Arab people are  the ones threatened by Israel because the latter is the hotbed  of tension, and a factor of instability. No more lying to the  world.    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, the PLO calls for the sending of  international forces to protect Palestinians in the occupied  territories. A short while ago, Peres said he completely  opposes this idea.    [Qaddumi] This means Israel does not want peace. The  international community must decide, as it does in other  international problems, to safeguard peace if today's world  wants to establish stability and security in all the world's  regions, including the Middle East.    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, we know the atmosphere is tense  after  yesterday's massacre. How can one control the situation,  security-wise, in the occupied territories?    [Qaddumi] This can take place by adopting speedy measures.  First, the UN Security Council must not only condemn this crime  but should take practical measures. The United States has to  play a basic role in these measures. Israel, too, must respond  to the international community's will by removing these  settlements so that these terrorist acts do not recur.    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, you are asking the international  community, or the UN Security Council, to adopt practical  measures. Give us an idea about these practical measures? What  are you asking for?    [Qaddumi] First, international forces. Second, the removal  of the settlements. Third, to expeditiously carry out  withdrawal. Fourth, the United States must shoulder its  responsibilities as a sponsor of the conference to have the  peace process proceed on the road to eliminating the Israeli  occupation.    [Reporter] These are the practical measures. However,  during the meetings you are currently holding in Tunis, can you  tell us about the atmosphere that prevails?    [Qaddumi] The atmosphere is very tense because this crime  has  exceeded all crimes. This is Palestine's holocaust, commited by  the Israelis against the Palestinian people.    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, do you have any new information  about  the way yesterday's massacre was committed?    [Qaddumi] The way in which the crime was committed is that  while the worshipers were performing Friday prayers more than  one settler came in. There were three groups. The settler was  among them. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to have  these great losses, more than 65 marytrs and 250 wounded. There  were three groups. The permanent presence of the Israeli Army  there helped these groups carry out their crime because they  entered from three doors. But, this doctor of U.S. origin is  the one who stepped ahead of the others and as a result of this  was hit and killed.    [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, does this mean that the PLO directly  accuses the Israeli Government and the Israeli Army and holds  them responsible?    [Qaddumi] The Israeli Government is directly responsible for  this crime.    [Reporter] Thank you, Mr. Faruq Qaddumi.</p>

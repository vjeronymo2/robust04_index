This amendment is prompted by reports of incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design service goal. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. This amendment relates to the recommendations of the Airworthiness Assurance Task Force assigned to review Model 707/720 series airplanes, which indicate that, to assure long term continued operational safety, various structural inspections should be accomplished. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective June 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 20, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Phil Forde, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2771; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 707/720 series airplanes was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53678). That action proposed to require inspections of certain structural components on older airplanes for cracks, corrosion, and other discrepancies, and repair or correction of discrepancies, if necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule. One commenter requests that the structural inspections and modifications referenced in section A.3 and section A.4 of appendix A of Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;54996, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification and Inspection Program_Model 707/720,'' Revision D, dated January 23, 1992, be combined and addressed as a single AD action, rather than in two separate actions, as proposed by the FAA in this notice. This commenter points out that the FAA previously issued AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;08, Amendment 39&hyph;8856 (59 FR 13446, March 22, 1994), which requires the accomplishment of a certain structural modification of the wing front spar lower chord in accordance with section A.3 of appendix A of the Boeing Document. This commenter contends that by issuing a single AD to cover both sections of the Boeing Document, the FAA will contribute to reducing the cost and complexity of publishing and tracking multiple AD's, while maintaining the same level of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with this commenter's request, specifically because of the nature of the requirements of the rules. The requirements contained in AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;08 address a single structural modification applicable to Model 707 series airplanes listed in Appendix A.3 of the Boeing Document. The compliance time for accomplishing that modification is based on either the number of flight cycles on the airplane or a specific calendar time. The requirements of this AD, however, address structural inspections for both Model 707 and Model 720 series airplanes listed in section 4 and appendix A.4 of the Boeing Document. The compliance times for implementation of these various inspections vary, as do the repetitive inspection intervals. The FAA considers that combining the requirements for these dissimilar actions into one complex AD would create unnecessary confusion for affected operators. Therefore, the FAA finds it appropriate to issue one AD addressing the modification and another AD addressing ``inspections only.'' This method of issuance will ease tracking of and facilitate compliance with the requirements of these two separate AD's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of the proposal, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision E of Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;54996, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification and Inspection Program_Model 707/720,'' dated March 8, 1994. The inspections described in this revision are identical to those described in Revision D, which was referenced in the proposal as the appropriate source of service information. The only change effected by Revision E is that it excludes the inspections of the upper skin on the wing center section described in Boeing Service Bulletin 2590. The actions specified in Boeing Service Bulletin 2590 currently are the subject of AD 68&hyph;18&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;2056. In light of this, the final rule has been revised to reference Revision E of the Boeing Document as the appropriate source of service information in order to eliminate these redundant inspection requirements. The applicability of the final rule has also been revised to reference those airplanes listed in Revision E of the Boeing Document in order to exclude those airplanes that are subject to the requirements of Boeing Service Bulletin 2590. Additionally, the economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect the deletion of these inspections from the required number of work hours for accomplishment of the actions required by this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon further review of the inspection actions required by this AD, the FAA has revised the final rule to extend the proposed 15-month compliance time to 18 months (for airplanes that have surpassed the specified compliance threshold in terms of accumulated flight cycles or time-in-service). The FAA has determined that increasing the compliance time by an additional three months will not adversely affect safety, and will allow the inspections to be performed during regularly scheduled maintenance at a main base where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available if necessary. Moreover, this is the compliance time currently recommended by the manufacturer in the latest revision to the Boeing Document, which is referenced in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 416 Model 707/720 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 82 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 691 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,116,410, or $38,005 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

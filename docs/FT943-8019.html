			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Murray lifts stake in Andrews Sykes to 42% Mr Jacques Murray, who made a 50p per share buy-out bid for Andrews Sykes earlier this week, yesterday acquired a further 590,264 shares in the specialist industrial services group. The purchase, at 50p each, lifts his holding to a little less than 6m shares, or 42.01 per cent. Mr Murray was forced to launch a full bid under the City takeover code on Wednesday after European Fire Protection Holding, the private Netherlands-based company which he owns, lifted its stake from 29.67 per cent to 37.87 per cent by acquiring 1.17m shares at 50p. European Fire also acquired 760,000 convertible preference shares, representing 8.26 per cent of the capital. It is understood that Mr Murray, who became chairman of Sykes last month, was invited to buy the shares by two institutional investors. European Fire is offering 50p cash for the outstanding ordinary shares and 12p each for the preference shares. The bid values Sykes at about Pounds 8.2m. The group's ordinary shares closed 6p up at 53p yesterday, while the preference shares, were 9p lower at 38p.</p>

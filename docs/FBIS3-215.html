Braid] </F>   [Text] Cape Town March 2 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on  Wednesday [2 March] advised Freedom Alliance parties to register  for the election to ensure their voice was heard and so that  they could participate in negotiations. "My advice is for them  to register and participate. They will not be giving anything  away but will ensure their voice being heard; that they will be  represented; and will fully become part of the continuing  negotiation process," he said at Tuynhuys after meeting  Portuguese Foreign Minister Dr Jose Barroso.    "Participation does not prevent anyone from continuing with  negotiations." He said that after his talks on Tuesday evening  with Freedom Alliance leader Gen Constand Viljoen, the ball was  now in the Alliance's court.    "We would like some specific proposals and then negotiations  can continue. These can be concluded before the elections for  implementation after the elections. I believe such an agreement  would be better for all concerned.    "Reneging after the election will be visible for everyone to  see, will leave more than a bad tase and would have  international focus." A signed agreement could contribute to  defusing tensions.    Mr de Klerk would not comment on his discussions with Gen  Viljoen except to say he had the impression there was a move for  the election date to be shifted. He had stressed the process had  reached the stage when it had to continue on its course.    He did not foresee Parliament being recalled again soon  because "the strength of the amended constitution which we  passed for federalism is such that there is no reason for them  (the Alliance) not to participate."</p>

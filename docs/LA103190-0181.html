			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ACTRESS PONDERING ROLE OF MOTHERHOOD  </P> <P> Ordinarily, you don't meet young women who look like Belinda Bauer and who are  not actresses.  </P> <P> The reason is beauty, a singularly marketable commodity for the screen.  </P> <P> An Australian-born brunette, Bauer's gifts were evident to filmgoers in her  small role in "Flashdance" several years ago and her co-starring role in this  year's "Robocop II."  </P> <P> She has completed a starring role in "Servants of Twilight," a thriller.  </P> <P> So far, true stardom has eluded Bauer.  </P> <P> In an industry where beauty may be only skin deep, it also is suspect.  </P> <P> Still, unlike some women similarly endowed, Bauer is not impressed with her  appearance. She is striving to develop acting skills, wise enough to know  beauty fades; talent endures.  </P> <P> During an interview, she was preoccupied with discussing her role as a single  mother whose life is jeopardized in "Servants of Twilight," the film version of  Dean R. Koontz's novel.  </P> <P> Many of Bauer's scenes are with 8-year-old Jarrett Lennon Kaufman, who plays a  6-year-old.  </P> <P> "Working with a child opened up a whole new world to me," Belinda said. "I'd  never played a mother.  </P> <P> "There were days when I told myself I would never have a child. But I did tap  into a maternal experience I didn't know I had.  </P> <P> "I got in touch with my desire to nurture and protect a little creature, a  little person. It would be an incredible thing to feel that love.  </P> <P> "Jarrett and I became friends. His mother was at the studio every day, and I  found myself feeling a bit competitive for his affection and attention.  </P> <P> "I had very different ideas on how I would raise the child if he were mine. I  didn't agree with his mother's choices. I was quite opinionated and told her I  would do things differently.  </P> <P> "She told me, quite rightly, that she was Jarrett's mother and that my comments  were unappreciated. I learned a lesson, and we got along all right. I would  have been less strict with him than his mother.  </P> <P> "No offspring of mine would ever be a child actor. That's tricky because  children do appear in movies, and someone has to play them. But I think it's  hard on a kid.  </P> <P> "Jarrett is a good actor and an intelligent kid. He didn't run wild too much  and when he got tired he could be stubborn. It takes a little more time to work  with a child, but he was very professional.  </P> <P> "My experience makes me think it would be fascinating to have a son and a  daughter, for totally different reasons. I would understand a little girl, and  with a boy I would perhaps learn more about the male of the species.  </P> <P> "At the moment I haven't a thought about who the father might be."  </P></p>

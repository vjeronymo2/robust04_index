			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Canadian power group ahead 5.1% Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's biggest electric power utilities, posted net profit of CDollars 761m (USDollars 567.9m) for 1993, up 5.1 per cent from 1992. Favourable natural conditions, tighter cost control and lower interest rates helped the advance. The utility derives nearly all its power from hydro-generating sites. Total electricity sales were up 5.2 per cent, mainly due to higher industrial demand and higher exports to the US while sales revenue rose 3.5 per cent to CDollars 7bn. Operating expenses, fuel, depreciation, amortisation and taxes were CDollars 3.76bn, up 3.6 per cent, but operating expenses alone advanced 1.7 per cent. Taxes plus debt guarantee fees totalled CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 594m in 1992. Total investment was CDollars 4bn, slightly lower than 1992. Most of the money went to the new generating capacity in the James Bay area. No dividend will be paid.</p>

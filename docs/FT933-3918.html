			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: BTR suffers Turnover in international conglomerate BTR soared to a hefty 23m, its highest daily total since 1989, as dealers moved to sell the shares after a cautious statement accompanied the group's results. The shares fell 17 1/2 to 381 1/2 p, brushing aside a 10 per cent rise in first-half profits to Pounds 602m, in line with market expectations, after the company said the outlook 'remains uncertain' for the second half. Analysts also suggested that there was some unease in the market about the enhanced scrip dividend alternative and the free warrant issue, both announced yesterday. New London Stock Exchange rules likely to exclude Rothmans International and half of SmithKline Beecham from the FT-SE Actuaries Indices hit the price of the respective shares. The changes, devised to plug an advanced corporation tax anomaly, would imply that investment funds may not automatically buy SmithKline Units or Rothmans as part of their need to get a full Footsie weighting. Analysts said that from being 25 per cent underweight in SmithKline because of extensive US holdings in the stock, UK fund managers might in future be 50 per cent overweight. One disgruntled analyst complained that the rule changes were 'hardly conducive to an orderly market'. SmithKline Beecham Units fell 15 to 374p on heavy turnover of 11m and Rothmans lost 21 to 675p. A surprise afternoon downgrade for Courtaulds, the chemicals group, left the shares 16 cheaper at 519p. SG Warburg cut its current year forecast from Pounds 210m to Pounds 180m as analyst Mr Paul Mylchreest argued that short-term prospects were worrying, particularly in the heavy chemicals arm of the business. Stores issues had a good session, buoyed by optimism over rate cuts and continuing reports about consumer-led recovery. Boots rose 5 to 498p, Dixons 7 to 231p after an upbeat agm and Marks and Spencer 5 1/2 to 389 1/2 p. Dull results and the resignation of the finance director left Booker 9 down at 432p. Northern Foods edged forward 1 1/2 to 281p. Strauss Turnbull was recommending the stock. The day's highest volume was in Babcock International, 29m shares being recorded after the company issued a profits warning. Babcock said it expected a first-half loss and would not pay an interim dividend due to higher than anticipated costs on its Pounds 400m contract to supply equipment to the Drax power station. The shares dropped 8 1/2 to 31 1/2 p, just above the year's low. T&amp;N shed 4 1/2 to 205p following a cautious results statement along with what some in the market called 'unease' about the scrip alternative it announced at the same time as the results. Lloyds Bank rose 10 to 555p, with turnover hitting 5.7m shares, on talk of a buy note from broker Kleinwort Benson and on technical considerations. Kleinwort's banking team declined to comment. RTZ strengthened 7 to 725p after announcing a 15 per cent profits increase.</p>

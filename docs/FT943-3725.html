			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / ITC to rule on late data service bid The Independent Television Commission will decide on Thursday if it should grant a data broadcasting licence to a News International company in spite of the application arriving nine minutes after deadline. Mr Justin Cadbury, chief executive of Simple Active, a company controlled by the Guardian Media Group, said last night he would consider seeking a judicial review if the ITC accepts the bid from Skytext. Mr Cadbury said he was present at ITC just before the noon deadline after delivering what he thought was the only bid for an additional commercial service. The licence is for use of spare lines on the ITV picture - but the service is for only the professional transfer of data and not open for a general audience. Mr Cadbury said that at 17 seconds to the noon deadline Mr Anthony Hewitt, ITC deputy secretary, began a countdown. Fifteen seconds later a message was passed to Mr Hewitt saying another bid was on the way. Mr Cadbury said: 'As we left, we saw a motorcyclist arrive. He signed the visitors' book at 12.09.' Simple Active bid Pounds 78,000 a year for the data licence. Skytext bid Pounds 355,000. In normal circumstances the licence goes to the highest bidder.</p>

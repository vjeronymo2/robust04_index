			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> AT&amp;T said it plans to cut long-distance rates on 1.6% April 1 to offset a  30-cent increase in local phone bills starting the same day. The changes will  mark the last step in a cost shift ordered by the Federal Communications  Commission that reduces prices that long-distance carriers pay local phone  companies for completing calls while adding a monthly "subscriber line charge"  to local bills. That charge will increase to $3.50 in April. The FCC must still  approve AT&amp;T's proposed plan for passing on its cost savings. AT&amp;T said  rates for interstate calls traveling less than 292 miles would increase 4.7%  under its plan "to bring prices more in line with costs."  </P></p>

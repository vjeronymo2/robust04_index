			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Canadian Bonds: Prices overcome election uncertainty HOLDERS of Canadian bonds have shown remarkable equanimity ahead of today's general election. Despite the prospect of a change in government and an unusually fractious parliament, bond prices have regained almost all the ground they lost at the start of the election campaign in September. The spread between 10-year US and Canadian government bonds has narrowed from 1.72 percentage points to 1.38 points. The benchmark Canada issue was yielding 6.71 per cent at the end of last week. Short-term interest rates have fallen even faster. The Bank of Canada has intervened in foreign exchange markets, not to support a sliding currency, but to brake its climb. The Canadian dollar has soared by almost two US cents in the past week, closing last Friday at about 76.65 cents. The recent rally in financial markets mirrors rising confidence that the Liberal Party, presently in opposition, will emerge from today's poll as the majority government. Foreign investors' first choice would have been a third term in office for the Progressive Conservatives. However, the Tories have had a disastrous campaign. They may end up behind not only the Liberals, but also the two fledgling regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the right-of-centre Reform Party. The prospect of a Liberal majority has dissipated fears of an unstable, hung parliament in which the separatist BQ and Reform would call the shots. Furthermore, the Liberals are perceived as more sympathetic to business than they were during their last spell in office in the 1970s and early 1980s. While Liberals still argue among themselves on the pros and cons of government internvetion, some of the key economic portfolios in a new Liberal government are likely to go to two MPs, Mr Paul Martin and Mr Roy MacLaren, who each have substantial experience in, and sympathy for, the private sector. Their room for manoeuvre will be limited by the huge build-up in federal and provincial government debt over the past decade, much of it held outside the country. Canadian politicians of all stripes have become more sensitive in the past year or two to the views of foreign bond holders and credit rating agencies. The odds have narrowed in recent weeks that a Liberal government will offer Mr John Crow, the Bank of Canada's inflation-fighting governor, a second seven-year term. Although the Liberal leader, Mr Jean Chretien, has said that he will seek to renegotiate the North American free trade agreement, there is a widespread perception that a face-saving formula will be found to implement it. Money managers tick off several reasons why the bond-market rally is likely to continue for at least another month or two after the election. Canada's economy is still in the doldrums and the annual inflation rate remains below 2 per cent. Despite the recent narrowing of US-Canada spreads, inflation-adjusted interest rates in Canada are high. 'Canada is attractive at spreads anywhere above 100 basis points, and very attractive above 150,' says Mr Will Sutherland, vice-president for fixed income at Altamira Management, a Toronto-based mutual fund group. Like many other bond-market players, Mr Sutherland says the attraction of Canadian bonds is not so much a high yield as the prospect of a further advance in the Canadian dollar. 'The opportunity for currency appreciation is better now than it was a year ago,' he says. Such optimism is harder to find however, among foreign exchange traders. Mr John Nicholson, vice-president at Bank of Nova Scotia, says the dollar's strength 'will probably continue over the near-term if there's a (Liberal) majority. But over the long term, there are a lot of problems.' These range from weak commodity prices to uncertainty about next year's provincial elections in Quebec, which will be more important than today's poll in determining whether Canada remains in one piece. Towering federal and provincial budget deficits, which could lead to the downgrading of some provinces' credit ratings, continue to cast a shadow over currency and bond markets. There is also the risk, of course, that the opinion polls may be wide of the mark. One Canadian securities dealer in London says, with some understatement, that 'the market could have a bit of a hiccup this week if the Liberals are short of a majority'.</p>

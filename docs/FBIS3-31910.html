			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Caracas, 30 Jan (AFP) -- Admiral Radames Munoz,  outgoing defense minister, today modified the position he voiced  yesterday when he said he respected but did not agree with the  decision to remove him from office. Today, Radames Munoz wished  success to the new administration of President-elect Rafael  Caldera.    Munoz, who on Saturday was informed by Caldera that the  entire high Military Command would be removed, said he was  "humiliated" and announced he would resign before the  inauguration of the new president on 2 February and that he  would request his retirement from the Armed Forces.  Nevertheless, this Sunday, as he left the last meeting of the  council of ministers of interim President Ramon J. Velasquez,  Munoz said "the new government must be given an opportunity to  succeed. It must be helped because the success of the new  government means success for the country, and the failure of the  new government means the people's failure."    Vice Adm. Munoz also praised the members of the new high  Military Command that Caldera will appoint and denied that a  crisis might break out in the government or the Armed Forces.  These remarks contrast with those he made yesterday, when he  said, "I am crying inside because I do not know what will happen  with a precarious government that was elected by 16 percent of  potential voters and that begins by striking out at an  institution that is at the service of the fatherland and not  political or economic interests."    Munoz will be replaced as defense minister by General Manuel  Montero Revette, current Army inspector general.</p>

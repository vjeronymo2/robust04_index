			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The Armed Forces and  police were put on alert Tuesday [31 May] as President Kim  Yong-sam leaves the country Wednesday on a week-long state visit  to Russia.    During the alert, major Armed Forces commanders will stay  within reach of military communication networks 24 hours a day  and the Army, Navy and Air Force will intensify surveillance of  North Korea's military movements.    The status of combat readiness adopted temporarily by the  Armed Forces last November has been extended indefinitely in  view of the tension caused by the North Korean nuclear standoff.    The police will also intensify their emergency preparedness  during President Kim's absence from the country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Although significant steps towards peace and  democratic elections in September were taken in Liberia this  week, serious snags remain, especially in a demobilization of  fighters of the three parties to the Cotonou agreement, which  has been sluggish. Initially, only fighters of the AFL [Armed  Forces of Liberia] began to hand in weapons. Yesterday NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] fighters began disarming.  But ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]  has faced problems. It has been racked by internal splits, and  over the weekend there were reports that rival ULIMO factions  had been fighting. Well, the UN special representative to  Liberia, Trevor Gordon-Somers, has been traveling around the  different parts of Liberia. On the line to Monrovia, Josephine  Hazely asked him what news he had of inter-ULIMO fighting.    [Begin recording] [Gordon-Somers] In fact, as far as I know  there was none yesterday and the day before. There was fighting  in ULIMO going back a week ago in Tubmanburg, but since  Tubmanburg calmed down I have had no evidence or no information  that there has been fighting anywhere else among ULIMO.    [Hazely] In that right, because we are getting reports that  there has been fighting in the Todi center itself?    [Gordon-Somers] Well, I visited the Bong Mines, the Todi  Mission, Kakata, I think on Thursday [10 March] and we talked  with the fighters, we saw them massed in their center, and what  they told us was that they were waiting for clear instructions  from their high command. Now, Mr. Alhaji Koromah, in fact, sent  written instructions, as I understand it, to the field commander  and then sent in one of his commanders out to him, and as has  been reported to me they started disarming this morning and I  think that it is a good sign that they have started their  disarmament today.    [Hazely] So, as far as you can gather, the faction fighting  within ULIMO is more or less (?finished now).    [Gordon-Somers] I would like to believe that but, I mean,  one must not oversimplify these matters. Notwithstanding the  reconciliation efforts, it doesn't necessarily heal in one day.  But I believe that it is a very positive sign and I think that  the best indication that there is calm in ULIMO headquarters and  in the various ULIMO barracks is that they have started  disarming. At least it means that fighters themselves have a  sense of confidence that they are not going to be attacked by  one faction or the other.    [Hazely] As has been reported, ULIMO commander Roosevelt  Johnson has not acknowledged Alhaji Koromah as the leader of  ULIMO.    [Gordon-Somers] That is correct.    [Hazely] Okay, let's talk about Charles Taylor's NPFL now.  You, I understand, went to watch some of them disarm yesterday.  What did you see?    [Gordon-Somers] That has taken place in NPFL territory.  This is between Konola and Sir George Philip Mission or  something of the sort. Well we... [pauses] there were some...  [pauses] I -- the figures may vary but -- I suspect it was about  400 NPFL fighters who were assembled with their weapons and we  processed them through yesterday evening between three o'clock  and I think they must have finished at about six or seven  because I left before they were completed.    [Hazely] What sort of weapons did they hand in?    [Gordon-Somers] They were handing in weapons like some types  of machine guns or AK's or what was it, and there were some  mortars.    [Hazely] What was the mood of the fighters from what you  could judge? Were they happy to hand in their weapons or did  they do this grudgingly?    [Gordon-Somers] No, they were extremely happy. They were  singing songs and dancing around, and their commanders who were  with them were cheering them on and dancing with them. It was a  very happy occasion, and some of them to whom we spoke indicated  their readiness, their willingness, they want to go back to  school, they want to go and do something else. It was a very  happy occasion. [end recording]    [London BBC World Service in English at 0600 GMT on 14 March  adds that "Fighters of one of Liberia's largest armed factions  have begun to surrender their arms to the African peacekeeping  force. They were ordered to do so yesterday by the National  Patriotic Front leader, Charles Taylor, despite a political  dispute over the composition of a new transitional government  and continued factional fighting clashes. Fighting has  continued among members of the ULIMO faction around the town of  Todi, which has been designated a disarmament site."]</p>

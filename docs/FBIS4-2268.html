It was Qing Ming festival yesterday [5 April]. The primary  school in Huzhen town, Jinyun County organized over 140 students  from grade four and five to go on a spring outing. Three  classes went on a water tour on a reservoir in Yanmen Township,  five km from the town. Over 80 students came to the assembly  place. At around 1030, the students embarked at the designated  place. Ten minutes later the first boat capsized, and, after  four or five minutes, the second boat also capsized and sank.    Teachers on the scene and some other people who rushed to  the  scene on hearing the news threw themselves into rescuing the  students from the water. The large rescue operation ended in  the early hours of today. It was finally confirmed that 44  students, all of whom were around age 10, had drowned.    Both of the sunken boats were concrete boats [the hulls are  constructed from concrete formed around a steel frame]. The  preliminary police investigation suggests that the accident was  caused by serious overloading.    After the accident, Xu Zhichun, the vice governor of  Zhejiang  Province, together with persons in charge of the administrative  office in Lishui Prefecture, rushed to the scene to supervise  the rescue operation and the handling of the aftermath. The  provincial government education committee issued a notice to all  primary and middle schools in the province advising them to draw  a lesson from this accident and to take substantial measures to  ensure the safety of spring outings. The cause of the accident  is under further investigation and the repercussions are being  dealt with.</p>

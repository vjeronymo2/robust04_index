			<p>Threatens   To Destroy North's `Vital Interests'   <F P=102> EA0306164094 Aden Democratic Republic of Yemen Radio Network  in Arabic 1410 GMT 3 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> EA0306164094 </F> <F P=104>  Aden Democratic Republic of Yemen Radio Network  in Arabic 1410 GMT 3 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=105> Arabic </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the "Presidential Council of the </F> Democratic Republic of Yemen" in Aden on 3 June]    [Text] There have been repeated statements from 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih's regime, some from its Council of Ministers and  some from its foreign minister, that they are committed to the  UN Security Council's resolution. Not satisfied with lying to  our people, they are using the same approach with the regional  and international organizations. Their forces continue to wage  their barbaric and immoral aggression in all the battle zones  which shows that people like this neither respect themselves nor  the world. Their word cannot be trusted.    We once again ask the international community, with its  different bodies and organizations, as well as the fraternal and  friendly countries, to work with us to compel that regime to  adhere to legitimacy and the basis of reality, or else to admit  that it has no control. Consequently, they should leave the  governing of the north to those who can establish self-respect  and respect for the international community.    We shall courageously resist this aggression supported by  all  the sons of our people. We expect a decisive stand from the  international community to put an end to the arrogance, vanity,  and aggression directed against us from more than one state.  Iraq's involvement has been confirmed, as well as others in  this aggression, in a desperate attempt to occupy our territory  and destroy our people's vital interests and violate what we  hold sacred.    We call on the international community to witness that any  continuation of this aggression against our people and our  territory and our vital interests will compel us to destroy the  vital interests in the north even though we have been careful to  avoid that, because such interests are owned by the people of  Yemen jointly with friends, and we are concerned to protect  their interests and maintain our good relations with them. But  the Sanaa regime is exploiting this concern of ours and every  day attacks our vital interests with its missiles and aircraft.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Sandoz/Gerber A strong currency, cheap money and virtually non-existent gearing have made foreign acquisitions irresistible to the Swiss. Sandoz's Dollars 3.7bn agreed purchase of US baby food manufacturer Gerber is only the latest example. This month has also seen fellow pharmaceuticals group Roche bid Dollars 5.3bn for Syntex as well as foreign moves by Nestle and Holderbank. Though Gerber may not look expensive when viewed through Swiss lenses, the acquisition seems thin on industrial logic. Sandoz's own nutrition business mainly sells to health-conscious adults through specialist health food stores, while Gerber sells baby food through supermarkets. So there seems little scope for pumping Gerber products down Sandoz distribution channels or vice versa. It may be possible to add value by capitalising on Gerber's strong brand name. Sandoz products may gain wider acceptance in the US if rebranded with the Gerber logo. But all this will not be easy. Given that, the purchase price of almost 30 times 1993-94 earnings is hardly cheap.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Baku Azerbaycan Radio Televiziyasi  Television Network in Azeri at 1640 GMT carries a 60-minute  "extensive report" by correspondent Gulsefa Ahmedova on the 9  March "expanded consultative meeting," attended by deputies and  government and regional officials, held at the Supreme Soviet  and chaired by Speaker Rasul Guliyev. The report includes  recorded excerpts of the meeting.    Ahmedova begins her report by saying that the meeting  discussed the military and political situation in the republic,  problems connected with the creation of the Army, and measures  to end the war.    In a recorded excerpt, Guliyev says: "Azerbaijan has been  holding talks at the international level and directly with the  Armenians for the peaceful resolution of the military conflict  with Armenia. Although there are certain achievements in this  regard, they have not yet been implemented. As you know, a  protocol was signed on 18 February 1994 between the Armenia and  Azerbaijani defense ministers with the participation of the  Russian Federation. According to this document, the fighting was  to end by 1 March; Armenia's Armed Forces were to withdraw from  Nagorno-Karabakh within three days; and, in accordance with our  own variant, they were to free the occupied Azerbaijani lands  within 14 days. Recently, we received international  representatives from the Minsk Group under Eliasson. First, the  republic's president met them and then I held talks with them  for a few hours. They said that Azerbaijan's position is  correct and hoped the Armenians would accept it. They first met  us in Baku, then left for Khankendi [Stepanakert] in  Nagorno-Karabakh and Yerevan. We were apprehensive that after  their visits to Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia they might have  changed their views. However, I want to inform you that despite  their visits there they have not changed their views and are  supporting our own variant and position.    "As always, the Armenians exploited our aspiration for peace  and resumed their attacks [words indistinct] mostly in the south  in Fizulinskiy Rayon. Bloody battles have continued there the  last few days. The Azerbaijani Army is dealing the necessary  reply to the Armenian aggressors. Armenians have suffered  considerable losses and are unable to achieve anything.    "At around 1900 yesterday, the Chairman of the Armenian  Parliament Babken Ararktsyan phoned me and told me that he  wishes to meet me to resolve this conflict. I replied that we  have always favored the peaceful resolution of the problem and I  am ready for talks anywhere, be it in Moscow, Yerevan, Idzhevan,  or in any foreign country. We decided that we should meet on  the border of Kazakhskiy and Idzhevanskiy Rayons on 12 March to  search for ways to peacefully resolve this war.    "The Azerbaijani Republic and its people must deeply  understand one thing: The future and destiny of Azerbaijan  rests solely in the hands of the Azerbaijani people and  citizens. No one, be they close neighbors or friendly countries  elsewhere, will solve the Azerbaijani people's problems. For  this reason, we must have a strong army and internal unity, must  mobilize our economic potential, and deal decisive and  courageous blows to the enemy. Such blows will bring peace  closer. The opposing side will bow and opt for peace only when  faced with force. There is no other alternative."    Guliyev also says that the Azerbaijani side rejected the  disengagement plan because it would place people behind the  lines and under threat.    He then goes on to strongly criticize the TURAN news agency  for publishing reports that freedoms in Azerbaijan are being  suppressed.    Resuming her report, Ahmedova says that the speakers  complained that the troops are not receiving their wages on time  and spoke on measures to establish discipline in the Army and  prevent desertions.    In a recorded excerpt, Prosecutor-General Ali Omerov says  the  Defense Ministry is responsible for the increase in desertions.  He accuses the military commissars for criminal behavior in  this regard. He also accuses the TURAN news agency for its  distorted reports on the seizure of arms from the People's Front  headquarters. He said TURAN should publish reports on "objective  reality," or face legal measures.    In another recorded excerpt, the military prosecutor says  that the main reason for desertions is that "the combat  readiness is not up to the desired level." He says in some  cases the commanders are telling the soldiers to flee so that  they too could flee from the front. Therefore, he says, first  of all the training of the military cadres should be improved.    Guliyev interjects and says: "Every one of you have sinned  before the Azerbaijani state and people. You must all realize  this. And the actions of some of you are criminal in nature.  You should know this. You should not think that we are not  following your actions. We fully know everything you are  involved in. You have come here to discuss what concrete  measures to take. If the talk is about desertions, you must  openly state, for example, that the deserters should be in a  certain location within two days. Therefore, you should talk  about concrete military measures you want to implement to  speedily extract the Azerbaijan Republic from its present  situation. If you want, you can also express your political  views."    Guliyev goes on to say that there cannot be internal  divisions when it concerns Azerbaijan's territorial integrity.  He again indirectly criticizes TURAN's reports as acts of  "enmity" against Azerbaijan. He says everybody in the hall are  to be blamed for desertions. He ascribes the desertions to the  fact that young people have not been imbued enough with feelings  of patriotism. He also criticizes those present for their lack  of ideas on economic reforms. He says economic reforms,  primarily in agriculture, should be launched courageously in  each rayon.    He supports the proposal that the Defense Ministry should  report to parliament within three or four days that it has  resolved the problem of desertions.    He indirectly criticizes certain people for trying to  exploit  the war for their own interests. He calls on the  prosecutor-general and military tribunal to publicize  information in papers and on the television on this so "people  could see and recognize its enemies."</p>

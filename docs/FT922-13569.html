			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Leading Article: A deepening German crisis THE TEST of an economic or political system is whether it can respond quickly and effectively to rapidly changing circumstances; it is a test that Germany is currently failing. For Germany's neighbours, the consequences of this failure are economically trying; for the EC they may prove increasingly disruptive. But it is the social cohesion of the new Germany that will suffer the most. Germany's politicians, employers and trade unions have so far proved unable to meet the challenges thrown up by the unification of west and east Germany in 1990. It would be premature to write the obituary of the German social market economy. But the economic disaster in the eastern Lander, the growing threat of a recession in the west and the rise of the German right in the recent regional elections are all testament to the great economic and political strains that have been caused by this failure. The economic collapse that has occurred in east Germany since monetary unification in July 1990 lies at the heart of Germany's current problems. The disintegration of east European trade is partly to blame. But the underlying cause was the imposition by the west German establishment of the regulations, non-wage costs and wages of one of the most productive economies in the world upon east Germany's backward one. Wage levels Few companies would agree to move to east Germany and pay unit labour costs comparable to those in west Germany, and higher than in Portugal or Spain. But that has been the effect of union efforts to push east German wages towards west German levels, with the blessing of western employers and politicians. In the absence of new investment and indigenous production, the east German economy will continue to be propped up by large transfers from west Germany. As important a cause of Germany's current predicament has been the politicians' unwillingness to persuade the west German electorate that they would have to pay for unification: through higher taxes and lower real wages. Instead, the general government deficit has been allowed to rise to DM180bn this year, 6 1/2 per cent of gross national product and twice as high as the deficit ceiling that Germany insisted be included in the Maastricht treaty; while west German unions have been demanding real wage rises to recover the loss in incomes caused by temporary tax increases. Slow growth The longer the government prevaricates, the more difficult it then becomes for it to act. Persistently high borrowing, rapid monetary growth and the threat of a public sector strike are likely to persuade the Bundesbank to keep interest rates high throughout 1992. But slow growth or even a recession this year is precisely what is not required to bring public borrowing under control. Nor does it make sense, politically or economically, to raise taxes now the economy is slowing. Mr Kohl has already gone back on one misconceived no-tax pledge. There is still time. The government needs a fiscal plan, consisting of tax increases and spending cuts, that will bring the budget back towards balance over the next five years; the public sector unions should drop their strike threat; and wage convergence must be halted, preferably by a temporary wage subsidy. Yet none of this seems likely to emerge from Germany's paralysed political system. West German real wages will fall: but only after an all-German recession has pushed west German unemployment towards 10 per cent and east German non-employment nearer 50 per cent. Wage convergence will slow: but only after more businesses have collapsed and many more east Germans have moved west. Meanwhile the fiscal deficit will grow larger. For the European economy this second scenario may be good for growth. The negative effect of high German interest rates has outweighed the stimulative effects of German expansion over the past two years. Lower interest rates, following a German recession, might fuel European growth. But slow growth, rising unemployment and further mass migration would sorely test the unity of the new Germany. Last week's election may prove a foretaste of things to come.</p>

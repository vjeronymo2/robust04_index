			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Zamyatin: "Visit of U.S. Secretary of </F> Commerce: Ministers Do Not Come to Russia Now Without  Businessmen"]    [Text] It is not known which there is more  of--politicians or businessmen--in the delegation of U.S.  Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown (he is cochairman of the  Russian-American Committee for Business Cooperation) that began  its visit to Moscow yesterday. The managers of 28 very big U.S.  companies arrived together with him.    On the list of Brown's audiences were several ministries  (the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Ministry of Fuel and  Energy, Ministry of Economics, and Ministry of Finance), Yuriy  Petrov, the head of the Russian Investment Company, and the  prime minister himself, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Along with the  general situation in Russia, specific questions were also  discussed--the participation of American firms in projects to  develop the Sakhalin shelf, investments in Russia, and access  for its commodities to U.S. markets. The secretary of commerce  used the occasion to express concern over the increase in import  tariffs in Russia. He reported that he does not share the  opinion that is current here, particularly in the Ministry of  Economics, that protectionism will attract investments (the  argument of the Ministry of Economics is that in order to  overcome the barrier to imports, foreigners will create  production in Russia).    Brown's mission, obviously, is to dot the "i's" with respect  to other problems--the fate of the most expensive IBM project in  Russia (at a cost of $130 million), which is being financed by  the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] ($40  million), and the U.S. Export-Import Bank ($90 million). There  is the question of replacing the long obsolete Sirena-2 computer  system used in the sale of air tickets. Not long ago a  competitor appeared for the IBM project: The Department of Air  Transport of Russia has proposed phased modernization of  Sirena-2 for a total of $40 million. However, this plan, other  than its relative cheapness, is also different in that it is  based on a sharp reduction in the volume of air traffic and  threatens to turn into "patching up holes" (if it has a  temporary character). Brown will try to convince Moscow that the  popular idea of "supporting domestic producers" is not always  justified from the standpoint of long-range interests.    The secretary of commerce regards discussion of various  forms  of assistance to the development of small and medium-sized  business in Russia as one of the leading themes of his  negotiations in Moscow. As Ron Brown likes to say, the strength  and power of the United States have always increased precisely  owing to the "increase and expansion of small and medium-sized  firms." Obviously, it is exactly in this connection that he  planned a visit not only to the Russian capital: Questions of  increasing the effectiveness of American assistance programs to  the private sector will be a subject of discussion in St.  Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. In addition, in the opinion of the  secretary expressed in an interview just before departing for  Moscow, the aid given should be oriented on intensifying the  export potential of the private sector. But, in the opinion of  the U.S. secretary of commerce, it is also called on to be the  main object for American export to Russia. Washington is  pursuing quite reasonable economic interests: An increase in the  volume of exports of $1 billion will lead to an increase in the  number of jobs in the United States by 20,000.    Moreover, the American administration does not conceal the  fact that it is still early to view trade and business with  Russia separately from politics. For, as he figuratively  expressed it at yesterday's negotiations, "stability and  predictability are the sisters of investment."</p>

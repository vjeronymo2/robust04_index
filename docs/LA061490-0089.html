			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COVER STORY;  </P> <P> A NEW AGE GLOSSARY  </P> <P> There is no Webster's for the New Age, so there are different meanings for  these words, depending on whom you ask. This glossary reflects some of the New  Age offerings available locally.  </P> <P> Aromatherapy: The use of various mixtures of oils in a massage to heal and  balance energy.  </P> <P> Aura: That electric field around all living things. It's got to be healthy for  your emotions to be healthy.  </P> <P> Channeling: The act of transmitting conversation from a spirit who is always  smarter than you are. Some channels channel only one spirit, others channel  lots.  </P> <P> Consciousness: A thing to be raised. Those with raised consciousnesses believe  in the New Age.  </P> <P> Crystals: Minerals that can do all sorts of good things. Usually energy flows  into the base and out the point. Some New Agers think crystals are actually  left over from Atlantis, where they were imprinted with codes containing  knowledge, sort of a cosmic CD.  </P> <P> Dolphin awareness: An attempt to learn about the universe from the dolphins,  believed to be privy to many kinds of wisdom.  </P> <P> Eckankar: The road for soul travelers. You may be helped along the road by  ancient guides, who usually seem to be Chinese. Wah Z is especially good at  guiding.  </P> <P> Ecstasy breathing: Some would call this hyperventilation. The idea is to  achieve a new spiritual plane through a variety of breathing techniques.  </P> <P> Free radicals: A scientific term denoting an atom that has an unpaired  electron. In New Age thinking, these must be driven from the body.  </P> <P> Iridology: The science of "reading" the irises of the eye to diagnose all sorts  of maladies and emotional states.  </P> <P> New Age: This moment in cosmic history. This phrase means a little something  different to everyone and can denote a range of activities. Some have argued  the New Age began, or ended, with the Harmonic Convergence, a rare alignment of  stellar bodies.  </P> <P> Ness: A useful suffix. You can invent your own New Age words by adding "ness"  at the end of nouns, as in "doorness."  </P> <P> Numerology: Tells about you according to various numbers in your life, such as  your birth date. Numerologists can also tell, for example, which house numbers  will be unlucky for you.  </P> <P> Psychic: A person with several possible powers -- such as mind reading, fortune  telling or seeing auras.  </P> <P> Pyramid: A shape believed to focus huge amounts of cosmic energy. Some people  have taken to crystals instead, because they are so much easier to carry  around.  </P> <P> Rebirthing: Usually a breathing technique designed to put you in another state  of being so you can remember your own birth or a birth from one of your past  lives.  </P> <P> Reflexology: The art of manipulating the foot to relieve stress.  </P> <P> Reichain: A type of therapy using massage and touch.  </P> <P> Reiki: Another type of therapy using massage and touch.  </P> <P> Rolfing: A type of massage that is especially vigorous and is designed to  pummel your troubles away.  </P> <P> Shamaness: A woman who has studied spiritual arts, usually under the direction  of native Americans.  </P> <P> Sufi dancing: Sufi was a Muslim mystical Shiite movement in the 11th Century  that tried to unite man's soul with God's. Today it's a dance that tries to do  something similar.  </P></p>

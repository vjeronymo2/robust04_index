			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Laurentian Bank rises 20% LAURENTIAN Bank, the fast-growing unit in the Laurentian financial services group, reported first-quarter net profit of CDollars 9.7m (USDollars 8.1m), or 53 cents a share, up 20 per cent from a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Return on equity was 12.1 per cent, up from 11.6 per cent, and total assets at January 31 were CDollars 8.2bn, up 36 per cent due mainly to two acquisitions. But expenses and non-performing loans were higher due to the recession. The bank has nearly doubled its branches to 213 over the past year.</p>

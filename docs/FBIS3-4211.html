			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Based on the common  understanding reached this February between the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and Taiwan's Straits  Exchange Foundation [SEF] in the "Joint Press Release of Tang  Shubei and Jiao Renhe," the two organizations will began holding  their fourth working level talks today on issues that include  the fishery dispute between the two sides of the Strait.  However, due to moves by Taiwan prior to its delegates'  departure for Beijing to "veto part of the Tang-Jiao common  understanding," there is no optimism for reaching an agreement  during the current talks.    At the conclusion of the Tang-Jiao talks this February,  Taiwan described the "Joint Press Release" as a having developed  a "great degree of common understanding" between the two sides.  Huang Kunhui, chairman of the "Mainland Affairs Council [MAC],"  and others gave it a "high degree of affirmation." However,  according to Taiwan press reports, part of the common  understanding reached during the Tang-Jiao talks was vetoed in  mid-March during a meeting convened by MAC, and attended by such  as the "National Security Bureau [NSB]" and "Ministry of Justice  [MOJ]," to discuss strategies to be adopted at the forthcoming  fourth round of talks between the two organizations. This  caused "great shock" among the SEF delegates to the talks.  Complying with a top SEF official's request, "MAC" called a  special meeting again on 19 March. However, departments such as  "NSB" and "MOJ" again made firm demands for rights, including  jurisdiction over judicial matters," thus "overturning the  important common understanding over the three issues formed  during the Tang-Jiao talks." They also claimed they wanted to  "maintain the bottom line of the two organizations' Taibei  [Taipei] talks on the premise of giving consideration to the  dignity of the rights of jurisdiction over legal matters."    Commenting on this, the Taiwan press noted that by  overturning the common understanding reached in the Tang-Jiao  talks, Taiwan will cast variables in reaching an agreement  during the two organizations' fourth round of talks and will  create pre-talks tension.</p>

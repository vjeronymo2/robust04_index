			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["B.A.P."-signed interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the </F> Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not given: "Eternal  Second?"]    [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] cannot  initiate coalition steps, and no signal has yet arrived from the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told  us when we asked him about his party's election results and  coalition possibilities.    [PESTI HIRLAP] The SZDSZ finished in second place in both  free elections so far. In the last issue of MAGYAR NARANCS  [HUNGARIAN ORANGE], socialist political scientist Mihaly Bihari  drew the conclusion that no liberal party can win in Hungary.  Is there any truth in this?    [Peto] I could refute this if the SZDSZ won the elections,  but I think this was not the first mistake of Mihaly Bihari. It  is not fortunate to come up with such an eternal judgment that a  party always finishes second, because it generally does not  happen so.    [PESTI HIRLAP] Some people assume that the SZDSZ is  hesitating to form a coalition because this way an  MSZP-Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] government alliance could  emerge and these two parties will soon lose value and then the  SZDSZ will remain the only marketable political force.    [Peto] I have not yet heard about this assumption. On such  a basis, one could also consider the possibility of an MSZP-  Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] coalition.    [PESTI HIRLAP] on the eve of the elections, [trade union  chief] Sandor Nagy said that his party thinks in terms of a  coalition anyway. If the SZDSZ is not willing to form such a  coalition, they will form an alliance with another party.    [Peto] Apart from the SZDSZ and the MSZP, there are still  four other parliamentary parties. They can also think of the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP], and the FKGP. I do not want to deal with  every possibility separately.    [PESTI HIRLAP] In view of the election results, the first  half of the runners ends with the MDF. The other three parties  are lagging far behind the front runners.    [Peto] The MSZP does not need to form an alliance with a big  party; they can form a coalition with any small party if any of  these parties is willing.    [PESTI HIRLAP] The head of the MSZP list already declared  that they are thinking in terms of a coalition anyway. However,  there is not yet a relevant answer from the head of the SZDSZ  list.    [Peto] I said to this that if a party does not have a  parliamentary majority, we consider it to be necessary; if it  has a parliamentary majority, we consider it to be possible. I  have nothing to say in addition to this. There is not yet any  coalition offer whatsoever at the moment; only the intention for  a coalition has been declared so far. No one called upon us  with a coalition offer. We cannot initiate anything with our  17-18 percent.    [PESTI HIRLAP] Peter Hack said in one of the dailies that he  would not take the SZDSZ into a coalition in this political  situation.    [Peto] He was correct in declaring this.    [PESTI HIRLAP] Does that mean that Ivan Peto also thinks so?    [Peto] As the SZDSZ chairman, I think that I should not  treat the public with my own private opinions. Of course, I  have my own private opinion, but the party should form its  opinion. I said that in the case of an absolute majority, the  chances of a coalition are much smaller -- at least on our part  -- than in case there were not such an absolute majority.    [PESTI HIRLAP] However, you did not exclude the possibility  of a government coalition with the MSZP.    [Peto] Nor did Peter Hack. He said that, on his part, he  would not support such a proposal.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> R. S. V. P. / ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Under The Stars  </P> <P> The Grove Shakespeare Festival hosted a party and poetry reading at the  Festival's Garden Grove amphitheater on Monday, raising an estimated $20,000  through ticket sales and donations, according to managing director Barbara  Hammerman. About 185 people paid $125 each for cocktails and a gourmet dinner  served in a courtyard across from the theater, then moved across the park at  dusk to hear selections from the Bard's rhymes and rages. An additional 220  guests bought $50 tickets for the performance, dubbed "A Midsummer Night's Eve  at the Grove."  </P> <P> The Star  </P> <P> Among the six actors who mingled with guests at dinner and then shared the  starlit stage was local-girl-done-good Kelly McGillis, a Juilliard-trained  actress as well as an above-the-title movie star. McGillis stuck by her  husband, Fred Tillman, and Thomas F. Bradac, Grove's producing artistic  director, for most of the party -- at least until she was called up to a podium  to address the clearly smitten guests. She kept it brief. "I believe in the  classics, and I believe in language," she said, praising the theater for giving  "young people a chance to be exposed to Shakespeare." She called Bradac, who  was her drama teacher at Newport Harbor High school, "the reason I became an  actress -- much to my parents' dismay." And she said she hoped she'd be able to  do a play at the Grove (that worked like an applause sign on her rapt  audience). After a minute or two with all eyes on her, McGillis smiled and said  she had to go get ready for the show. "I don't have much to do," she added,  laughing, "but stop shaking." The other performers -- all of whom have acted in  Grove productions -- were uniform in their praise of McGillis. "She's just been  a real pleasure to work with," said actress Kamella Tate, who dined with her  parents, Tom and Donna Tate, and date Paul Yeuell. "This isn't some movie  person saying, 'Hey, I think I'll try this,"' said actor Daniel Bryan Cartmell.  "She's a real Shakespearean actress. She knows what she's doing up there." Also  taking part in the reading were John Frederick Jones, Gregory Itzin and Carl  Reggiardo.  </P> <P> Who Was There  </P> <P> While musicians played period pieces and Elizabethan-garbed merrymakers  strolled the courtyard, guests lined up for buffet helpings of prime rib,  shrimp scampi, pasta with pesto, marinara and clam sauces, Ceasar salad, fresh  fruit and desserts. Among those alfresco-ing were proud papa Don McGillis, Leo  and Virginia Zlaket, Donna Connelly, Kathryn and Paul McKee, Jean and Phil  Darling, Jeanne Delp and Jeanette Justice, president of the theater's board of  trustees. The party was chaired by David Krebs, whose committee included Greg  Devereaux, Patricia Negrino, Jane Oglesby, Joan Peters, Alicia Dorman, Joe  Bernhardt, Tom Moon, Carol Hoffman and Billur Wallerich.  </P> <P> In a brief, thickly accented speech from the podium, French artist Jean Pol d.  Franqueuil recounted how, when he decided to make a painting to donate to the  party, he didn't know anything about Shakespeare "except what you learn in  school." But he wanted to take part, so he went to the library and spend hours  poring over texts and illustrations. "Now," Franqueuil said, "old William and I  -- we are good buddies." PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

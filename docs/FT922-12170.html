			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / UK Company News: Property; health amid the walking wounded - Investors may find a pocket of growth in this spiralling sector PENNY shares are one of the property industry's few growth sectors. As the property market spirals further downwards, the share prices of over half the quoted sector have been dragged down to under 50p. The companies in this predicament are a motley crew. Some former high flyers, such as Rosehaugh at 7p or Speyhawk at 5p only exist courtesy of their bankers. A larger group has no scope to do anything other than concentrate on survival. But a few have healthy balance sheets and the flexibility to outperform the big companies as the market recovers. This sub-group of small property companies may prove a genuine growth sector. The handful of robust companies among the ranks of walking wounded attracts relatively little attention. Stockbrokers tend to focus their attention on the six largest companies on the market, which account for two-thirds of the quoted sector's value. Moreover, it is hard to drum up enthusiasm for any property company in the wake of a stream of bad news about the sector, most notably the restructuring talks of Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest property developer. For all that, some companies deserve further scrutiny - even though their share prices may not rise until sentiment improves concerning commercial property. A few have managed to increase their profits and net assets, despite operating in tough markets. Last year, eight property companies, mainly those with low gearing, outperformed the stockmarket with share price increases of over 15 per cent. Investors interested in small property companies should look for three characteristics. First, skilled management, which has been able to read the market correctly. Kleinwort Benson Securities, the City broker, cites Burford Holdings as an example. It sold property at the peak of the property cycle to eradicate its borrowings. It has since bought a clutch of properties outside London at distressed prices. But the few companies which timed their disposals correctly are in select company. 'It is extremely difficult to find smaller companies which did not think it necessary to expand very aggressively during the boom,' says Mr Martin Barber, chairman of Capital &amp; Regional Properties, which sold half its UK property in 1998. Managements with deal-making flair or fee-earning potential also have something extra to offer. For instance, English &amp; Overseas Property, the former property arm of Pentos, is able to cover its management costs with fees earned by helping banks unscramble their property problems. Second, a well-spread portfolio. Many of the best-placed companies are those with portfolios outside Central London, which has been particularly badly hit by the property recession. One example, which also benefits from sound finances, is Town Centre Securities, which has a bias towards retail property in the north of England. 'It has not put a foot wrong,' says one analyst. The inclusion of London property does not always deter investors. Derwent Valley Holdings is credited for good work in sweating its assets, despite the concentration of its portfolio in the difficult west end market. Third, sound finance. The best-placed companies are perhaps those with no borrowings, such as the conservatively-managed Frogmore Estates. But some gearing will help companies make the most of a turn in the market. And even companies with significant borrowings may have room for manoeuvre because net rents virtually cover its interest costs. Capital &amp; Regional Properties, for instance, has gearing of 73 per cent. But it has been able to double its UK portfolio at a cost of Pounds 20m, with buildings that yield enough to cover the interest costs. The importance of strong finances can hardly be overstated at a time when many companies have difficulty in raising new money. Those with weak balance sheets are unable to borrow for expansion. And as they usually have low share prices, well under their net asset value, any attempt to raise money by issuing shares would severely dilute the net asset value. For many of these companies the rental income does not cover the interest and administration costs, which are often inflated by exaggerated salaries. 'It is only a matter of time before institutional investors start to ask questions of directors', say property brokers at Kleinwort Benson Securities. The logical answer to excessive administration charges is the consolidation of the sector. Mergers would also increase the share capital to a size where it would be far more marketable, with lower spreads between bid and offer price. Another point in favour of deal-makers is that capital gains tax liabilities have shrunk to nothing in many cases. So far, corporate activity has been limited to Southend Property's failed attempt to buy Frogmore Estates; TR Property Investment Trusts' successful Pounds 17m bid for New England Properties and Hemingway's reversal into Marylebone Estate Company. Although Hemingway is still loss-making, analysts think the management team could be one to watch. The reason there has been little corporate activity so far is partly that asset values have not stopped falling and potential bidders are worried about 'black holes' in their accounts. It is also difficult to persuade managements to agree to a merger which could leave them out of a job. 'It is difficult to put two entrepreneurs together, unless one is willing to walk away,' says an analyst. Unless and until there is some corporate activity amongst the smaller companies in the sector, the prospects for most small quoted property companies are decidedly unexciting. Scores of washed-up companies could remain stranded until they expire, merge or are swept up by the tide of the next property boom.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: When a gain can be a loss For CGT, I understand that indexing the cost of shares is no longer permissible if they are sold at a loss but is still available when a sale results in a gain. Say I buy shares for Pounds 1,000 and sell them for Pounds 1,400. Since there is a gain, I am allowed to index the base cost. But what happens if the indexation takes the base cost from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,600. A money gain of Pounds 400 has become an indexed loss of Pounds 200? Since indexation is not permitted to increase a loss, what should I do? Do I declare a gain of Pounds 400, a loss of Pounds 200, or nil gain? The answer is neither a chargeable gain nor an allowable loss. If shares which cost Pounds 1,000 are sold in a month for which the indexation factor is 60 per cent, it makes no difference if the net proceeds are Pounds 1,600 or Pounds 1,000: the result for CGT purposes is zero.

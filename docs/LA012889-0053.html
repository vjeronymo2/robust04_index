			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HALL AND DOUBLE STANDARDS  </P> <P> After commenting on TV talk show host Arsenio Hall's use of racial dialect,  Times critic Howard Rosenberg asks: "Isn't it a double standard to criticize as  racist such dialect when a script writer employs it as black dialogue when at  the same time someone like Hall is using it on national television?" ("Bedtime  for Talk? Nothing Special on Sajak, Hall Shows," Jan. 16.)  </P> <P> Hall and some other comedians don't seem to realize black racism is no better  than white racism; plus they send bad signals to kids who desperately need role  models (such as the praiseworthy Bill Cosby) who speak well.  </P> <P> A.

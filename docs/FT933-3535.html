			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Finance ministers in Emu pledge EC FINANCE ministers yesterday vowed to press on with the Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union, and called on the European Commission to make its forthcoming White Paper on competitiveness and employment in the Community a real instrument for job-creation. In a televised debate on Community economic and monetary policy, ministers easily agreed that the jobs crisis was now top of the EC agenda, but showed little uniformity in identifying solutions. Mr Phillipe Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium which holds the EC presidency, underlined the general agreement that EC credibility hinged on starting stage two of Emu on time next January, and on offering realistic solutions to unemployment. All participants in the lacklustre debate backed his call for tighter macroeconomic and monetary co-ordination, and for no let-up in attempts to control budget deficits and inflation. As Mr Bertie Ahern, Ireland's finance minister, put it, 'the foundations for Emu are the same as those for growth: sound and convergent economies operating a completed internal market.' Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economic affairs commissioner, warned that currency instability would wreck Europe's single market and bottle up cross-border investment. Most ministers agreed job creation would need more flexible labour markets, a re-examination of taxes and social security charges on employment and wage moderation. But practical interpretation of this varied sharply. Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, for instance, stressed the need to shift taxes on employment on to resources, calling for the EC to press ahead with its stalled energy tax plan. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, called for the removal of 'all unnecessary and damaging controls on business activity', in line with the UK's submission to the White Paper debate calling for the dismantling of much actual and planned EC social legislation, and fuller labour market deregulation. Mr Jean Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's finance (and employment) minister, said 'frenetic deregulation' was not the way to boost EC credibility, and that 'we can not take on the Asian model'. Several member states from Denmark to Portugal emphasised the need to preserve Europe's 'model' of social provision. UK officials nevertheless sense the debate is moving their way, and Mr Clarke said afterwards that 'what would be a complete waste of time would be for the Commission to emerge with something as if the member-states' contributions (to the White Paper debate) had never been made.'</p>

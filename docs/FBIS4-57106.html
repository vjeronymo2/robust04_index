			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] This afternoon at Havana's Granma Memorial, a  ceremony was held to render homage to internationalist soldiers  who lost their lives in Africa and whose deeds contributed to  the South African people's victory in the recent elections.    The ceremony was presided over by Army General Raul Castro,  second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and minister of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who moments before the ceremony  made exclusive comments for this newscast:    [Begin Castro recording] This is the most important event of  the century, and Mandela -- I was thinking the other day -- is  the greatest leader of the century. I even dare say the greatest  leader Africa has had in its long history.    As you know, ceremonies such as this are being held in over  150 mausoleums nationwide as a salute to the death of apartheid;  the birth of the new South Africa; and to remember our comrades  whose blood and effort, as leaders of the ANC including Mandela  have pointed out, were instrumental in reaching 10 May, a day  such as today. This is a highly moving day for us, a day of deep  remembrance and immense gratitude toward all our dead comrades.  Once again, this shows that in a third country -- first Angola,  then Namibia, and now South Africa -- the effort and the  bloodshed were not in vain. They conducted the most glorious  internationalist missions. I say glorious because they were  probably the most selfless acts in the history of mankind, of a  people toward their African brothers, a significant limb of our  national identity.

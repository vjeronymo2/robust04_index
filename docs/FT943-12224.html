			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sprint joins Iusacell in venture Sprint, the US telephone group, is joining up with Grupo Iusacell, a leading Mexican cellular telecommunications company, to provide a long-distance service in Mexico from January 1997. Iusacell will own at least 51 per cent of the new company, and Sprint at least 33 per cent. Bell Atlantic, the US Baby Bell, last year agreed to take a 42 per cent in Iusacell for Dollars 1.04bn, and will indirectly own a stake in the new venture. The Iusacell-Sprint joint venture will first apply for regulatory approval to provide long-distance services. The Mexican government has agreed to open up the long-distance telephone market to competition from 1997, but has not yet issued licences, nor established the requirements potential carriers will have to meet. However, Iusacell and Sprint expect to be given approval soon. Last month the ministry of communications and transport agreed in principle not to limit the number of long-distance carriers as part of the first step in opening up the telecommunications sector. Sprint's venture in Mexico follows a similar move by MCI, the second largest US long-distance carrier, which earlier this year formed a Dollars 1bn alliance with Grupo Financiero Banamex to provide long-distance services from 1997. MCI will invest about Dollars 450m in the new company, taking a 45 per cent stake in it. Sprint and MCI will be competing against Telefonos de Mexico, the current monopoly provider, in which Southwestern Bell has a minority stake. Telmex earned about Dollars 4bn from long-distance revenues last year, Dollars 2.5bn from domestic long-distance and Dollars 1.5bn from international. Mr John Cahill, vice-president of Sprint, said Mexico's long-distance market could be worth Dollars 20bn by the end of the decade. Sprint said the new Mexican company will advance its strategy of creating 'a seamless North American network to handle the anticipated demand stemming from the North American Free Trade Agreement'. Sprint already offers long-distance services in Canada, in partnership with Call-Net, Canada's largest alternative communications carrier. Iusacell, which sold 9 per cent of its capital for Dollars 250m in an initial public offering last month, is the non-Telmex cellular company in central Mexico, with more than 150,000 subscribers. The company is planning to offer a wireless local telephone service in Mexico next year.</p>

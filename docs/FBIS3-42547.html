			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sharon Kenon, JerusalemInform, under the rubric </F> "Astronomy": "The Ultraviolet Universe: Space Telescope Studies  New Stars"]    [Text] A new space-based ultraviolet telescope designed and  built in Israel will make it possible to penetrate the mysteries  of the universe. That telescope -- the result of the joint  efforts of Tel-Aviv University, the Israeli Space Agency, and  the firm ELOP -- will be the "all-seeing eye" of a spacecraft  that will be launched in 1995. Israel has received permission to  participate in an international project involving the first  science mission for the study of celestial objects in the  ultraviolet range of the spectrum.    "We have all the necessary basic infrastructure for space  technologies," said Ethan Reys (Eytan Reys), the head of the  space developments division of the firm ELOP.    The TAUVEX telescope (TAUVEX stands for Tel-Aviv University  UV Explorer) was developed to fill the considerable gap in our  knowledge of the universe. Astronomers have successfully  observed stars in a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum,  to include the visible, radio, x-ray, and infrared ranges of the  spectrum. The ultraviolet range, however, remains accessible in  only individual fragments.    "It is impossible to perform sufficiently precise  observations in the UV spectrum from the ground, because of the  severe scattering of UV radiation in the atmosphere," said Reys.  "The only way to get images of distant or weak stars is to take  the science instrumentation into space."    TAUVEX will be pointed at "white dwarfs" (new stars that  emit  high-energy UV radiation), binaries (binary stars), galaxies,  and quasars (extremely bright objects at the edge of the  universe). "We expect the search for quasars to be more  productive than any other search every undertaken," said Dr. N.  Brosh, an astronomer at the Weiss [Vays] Observatory of Tel-Aviv  University. That observatory is the most active observatory in  the Eastern Mediterranean. "We expect to catalog more than  10,000 new quasars, which will be identified from their UV  spectra. At present, only about 4,000 quasars are known from  ground-based observations."    The information that will be obtained in the course of the  mission will help scientists to have a better understanding of  the physical nature of high-energy sources such as neutron stars  and black holes. Using the broad-range UV telescope, scientists  will have a unique opportunity to get to the heart of the  process associated with the formation of stars and to ascertain  their makeup, velocity, size, age, emittance, and position. All  that information not only expands our knowledge of the current  state of stars, their origin, and history, but will also help to  predict their future.    The images will be obtained with three telescopes: two of  them designed for scientific research, and the third serving as  a position and velocity sensor for the spacecraft itself. Those  data are very important in that producing images requires  lengthy exposures. "The data of the third telescope will make it  possible to reconstruct images that are blurry because of the  long exposure while the spacecraft is moving. The information on  direction and velocity makes it possible to produce images as if  from an immobile platform," said Reys.    The spacecraft will be launched into an elliptical orbit  with  a maximum distance from Earth of 200,000 km and a revolution  period of three days. Low-orbit satellites usually complete a  revolution in an hour and a half. The satellite will function in  orbit for three years.    One other unique feature of the TAUVEX system is that it  provides a field of view that is 500 times greater than the  field of view of the wide-angle camera of the Hubble Space  Telescope.    The satellite is to be launched from the CIS. The data will  be received at sites in Russia, but will be made accessible to  all scientists participating in the project.</p>

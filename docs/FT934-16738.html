			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / People: Vernon takes on Blanchardstown Green Property, the Dublin-based property investment company quoted on both the London and Dublin stock exchanges, has a new managing director, Stephen Vernon. He takes over from John Corcoran, who founded the company 28 years ago and who retired in August. Vernon, 43, is a chartered surveyor and was group managing partner of St Quintin in London before taking up his new post. He has been a non-executive director of Green Property since 1989. Vernon faces a number of pressing tasks at Green, the most immediate probably being to ensure the successful re-start of the group's planned Blanchardstown shopping centre project, suspended amid controversy in June 1991. Blanchardstown, a new town being created to cope with Dublin's rapidly expanding population, has experienced delays in its development as politicians and lobbyists have clashed over the rezoning of land - altering its designated purpose - for either residential or industrial purposes. 'The political hold-up has in large measure been cleared up, though resolution of the zoning issue is not yet complete,' says Vernon. Green Property will, he says, forge ahead with its plans forBlanchardstown but it needs to finalise details on its financing and also on its 'anchor' tenants; negotiations are proceeding on both fronts and Vernon says he hopes the financing will be with a suitable partner. He emphasises that pushing ahead the 57-acre site, with its planned 1m square feet of shopping, leisure and community facilities, is in any case only one of several priorities. He wants the company to grow; it is 'still very small, with a market capitalisation of a shade under Pounds 20m, whereas I think it should be closer to Pounds 100m'. He plans on keeping its portfolio solidly in the offices/shops/industrial property sector. As for his current commuting life  -3 days in Dublin, 2 days in London each working week - it has its compensations, including visits to Dublin's Abbey Theatre.</p>

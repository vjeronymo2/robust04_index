			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> $275-MILLION INITIATIVE;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA ROAD TAX OKD FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to place a tax  initiative on the November ballot that could raise up to $275 million for roads  in the Santa Clarita Valley over the next 25 years.  </P> <P> Just three weeks ago, proponents of the measure said it would never reach the  Nov. 7 ballot because Santa Clarita and Los Angeles County officials were still  drafting the complex documents needed to create the agency that would  administer the funds. Proponents predicted that a special election would have  to be held in December.  </P> <P> But to their surprise, planners and attorneys hammered out details of the  proposal in time, said Lou Garasi, head of a citizens transportation committee  spearheading the effort.  </P> <P> The tax, which must be approved by two-thirds of the voters, would add from $75  to $200 to annual property tax bills. The tax would be levied on most property  within the William S. Hart Union High School District, but would not include  the rural town of Val Verde and small portions of the city of Los Angeles  located within the Hart district. Senior citizens would be exempt.  </P> <P> Technically, the supervisors voted to create a joint-powers agency with Santa  Clarita to oversee the funds. While the agency's board must now hold a public  hearing to set the boundaries of the tax district, that step is viewed as a  formality, Garasi said.  </P> <P> The supervisors appointed Dave Vannatta, planning deputy to Supervisor Mike  Antonovich, and county Planning Director Jim Hartl to the agency's board. Santa  Clarita Mayor Jan Heidt and Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon will represent  the city. The four will select a Santa Clarita Valley resident as the fifth  member.  </P> <P> Proponents of the measure conceded that persuading voters to tax themselves  will not be easy. "The sale of this is going to be tough," said J. J. O'Brien,  a member of the citizens committee.  </P> <P> But O'Brien and others said Santa Clarita's crushing traffic problems could  persuade voters to support the tax.  </P></p>

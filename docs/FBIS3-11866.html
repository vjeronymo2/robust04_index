			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] In its Press Bulletin No. 33, the Secretariat of  National Defense [SDN] has denied the assertions made in a  communique datelined 24 March which the rebel group leadership  in Chiapas State has been circulating. The communique states  government airplanes released strange gases and bombed areas  near the Comitan-Altamirano highway, causing serious fires, at  dawn on 19 March 1994. The SDN hereby informs the public of the  following:    1. The Secretariat of Defense flatly denies airplanes have  bombed the area of conflict, because Army and Air Force troops  have not fired a single shot since 12 January, when the  president of the Republic ordered a unilateral cease-fire.    2. The SDN hereby confirms the pledge made in Press  Bulletin No. 32 issued on 23 March to the effect troop movement  in the area of conflict has been strictly administrative.    3. The SDN once again offers assurances it will not  execute actions that may hinder the government's resolve to find  a peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>

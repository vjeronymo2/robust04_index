			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Mediterranean Eurocorps under discussion France, Italy and Spain are discussing the creation of a southern 'Eurocorps' to maintain security in the Mediterranean region, a senior military officer said, David Buchan writes from Paris. The plan follows their recent 'Ardente' troop exercise in Italy, and is designed to complement the increasing number of joint manoeuvres by the three countries' navies and air forces. The scheme has been forwarded to the Western European Union, defence wing of the new European Union, as a formal initiative by Italy. 'The idea is to try to find a formula to bring together rapid deployment units of the three countries,' the officer said. It was unlikely to be a copy of the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps, which is to have some 40,000 French, German and Belgian troops at its disposal by 1995, but 'perhaps a common command structure'. France, Italy and Spain are already working, through the WEU, to institutionalise their naval co-operation in the Mediterranean in the form of 'pre-planning' for emergencies. Behind the scheme is the realisation, particularly on the part of France, that the Strasbourg-based Eurocorps will be ill-suited for rapid mobile operations outside Europe. First, it is composed largely of heavy units designed for battle on the central European front, and second, there are still political, if not constitutional, constraints on German forces' range of action. Spain is considering joining the Eurocorps, and once that decision is taken, the Strasbourg-based force will be of a satisfactory size and membership, the officer said. There is no expectation in Paris that Britain or the Netherlands might join the Strasbourg unit. 'One day there might be a Eurocorps 2, a Eurocorps 3, particularly if the US continues to pull its troops out of Europe,' said the officer.</p>

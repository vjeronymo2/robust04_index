			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL REPORT ORDERED ON GOLF COURSE PLAN  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission has ordered completion of a  final environmental impact report on a controversial project to transform a  340-acre Malibu canyon into a private 18-hole golf course and country club.  </P> <P> The $35-million project, if approved, would allow grading of more than 5  million cubic yards of earth and the construction of 60 homes, a  52,000-square-foot clubhouse, six tennis courts, two restaurants, a swimming  pool and underground parking. It would be located on land recently sold by  comedian Bob Hope to the Sun Pacific Co., a development group.  </P> <P> The Malibu Country Club project is widely opposed by environmental consultants  and homeowners' groups who want to preserve the rugged canyon area.  </P> <P> Local conservationists contend that the project would threaten sensitive  watersheds, destroy wildlife and vegetation and lead to increased traffic  congestion.  </P></p>

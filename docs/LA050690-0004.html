			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EL MOSCO  </P> <P> It is about time for responsible journals to illustrate the fact that illegal  aliens are just that: They are in this country illegally. The national  consensus, as represented by current law, is that we, as a nation, do not want  all of the world's poor people to move to the United States.  </P> <P> It is indeed unfortunate that the world today is populated mainly by people  living in poverty; it is equally unfortunate that the United States cannot  eliminate world poverty by absorbing all of the world's poor into its  population. Immigrant "rights" groups would serve future generations better by  devoting their energies to advocating birth control in Third World countries  rather than advocating absorbing excess population into this country.  </P> <P> BRUCE DUNCAN ROSS, Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: English &amp; Overseas back in the black English &amp; Overseas Properties yesterday announced a return to profitability with pre-tax profits of Pounds 312,000 for 1993. The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 707,000, struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 982,000. Mr Jim Clark, chairman, said the company hoped to be able to aggressively expand its existing investment and development portfolio during the current year. EOP plans to move away from the consultancy work which saw it through the recession and into property investments, where it can add value through intensive management. Turnover rose to Pounds 5.98m (Pounds 986,000), primarily due to contributions from acquisitions and recently-completed development properties. Fully diluted earnings per share were 1.11p, against losses of 2.86p, and the company returned to the dividend list with a final of of 0.5p. During the year, the company gained court approval to transfer Pounds 1.5m from capital reserves to distributable reserves.</p>

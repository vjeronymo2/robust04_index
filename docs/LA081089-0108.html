			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPANSION OF LANDFILL IN AZUSA ENDORSED  </P> <P> Reversing its earlier recommendation, the staff of the state Water Resources  Control Board has endorsed an expansion of an Azusa landfill.  </P> <P> The expansion is opposed by San Gabriel Valley water officials.  </P> <P> In a 22-page report released Tuesday, the staff concluded that a new  ground-water protection system proposed for the landfill "will ensure adequate  separation between the waste and underlying ground water."  </P> <P> Robert Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water  District, said the recommendation is a major setback for water officials who  have fought against continued operation of the dump.  </P> <P> Berlien said that water officials will attend the state water board meeting in  Sacramento on Aug. 17 to oppose the plan for the Azusa Land Reclamation Co.  landfill but that the recommendation will be difficult to overcome. "It sure  changes the odds a lot," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposition Maintained  </P> <P> Representatives of Azusa Land Reclamation sought unsuccessfully last week to  persuade local water officials that their new plan -- which calls for adding a  second plastic liner and liquid collection system under the trash disposal area  -- would prevent seepage into underlying ground water.  </P> <P> After hearing the company's presentation, the San Gabriel Valley Watermaster  board, which manages the area's ground water, voted to maintain its opposition.  Board members argued that the dump site, which is in a gravel pit, contains  soil so porous that the danger to ground water cannot be overcome by plastic  liners and other protective measures.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board in November of last year  approved a plan to shift trash disposal to a new area of the dump, extending  the dump's life by up to 20 years. The San Gabriel Valley Watermaster appealed  the decision to the state water board.  </P> <P> The state board staff recommended in April that the regional decision be  overturned, agreeing with the watermaster that the proposed safeguards would  not protect ground water. However, the Azusa Land Reclamation Co. upgraded the  plan, leading the staff this week to reverse its position.  </P></p>

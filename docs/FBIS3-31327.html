			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  chairman of the Srpska republic assembly, today told TANJUG's  correspondent that the Serb side is "very disappointed" with the  work of the UN expert commission investigating the massacre at  Sarajevo's Markale marketplace, and that it will demand "an  additional investigation and explanation."    "We have not yet received the commission's report, but we  have been informed that it concludes it is impossible to  determine whether the shell was fired from the Muslim or the  Serbian side, and therefore impossible to establish  responsibility for the massacre," Krajisnik said.    "We are very dissatisfied with such a report because the  commission did not carry out a detailed investigation and make  an in-depth analysis", Krajisnik explained, recalling that the  Serbian side's demand that it not only establish whether the  shell was fired and by which side, but also that a forensic  study of the victims' bodies be carried out.    "This would have told us something about the nature of the  injuries and answered whether a mortar shell could have killed  so many people," Krajisnik said.    "Our demand has not been not met. This is strange and we are  all the more disenchanted with the fact that the truth has not  been not established, because we know the massacre was committed  by the Serbian side," the Srpska republic assembly chairman  underscored.    Commenting on the commission's explanation that some time  has  passed since the massacre, Krajisnik said: "I believe it is now  a problem to gather all the evidence and ascertain the nature of  the crime." "However, we cannot accept such practice,"  Krajisnik added, recalling that, immediately following the  massacre, the Serbian side demanded that a mixed commission and  then an international commission of experts be formed, but that  there was too much procrastination.    "Many indications exist that the device which exploded had  been planted, and doubts remain," Krajisnik stressed.    According to Krajisnik, a larger number of various  international experts should have been included in the  investigation, because this case, as he said, has grave  consequences for one side -- the Serbian side -- and could have  far-reaching repercussions on the entire peace process and peace  in the region.    Recalling that the massacre has been a reason for NATO to  issue an ultimatum, Krajisnik stressed that the report in its  present form cannot be a reason for the rigorous threat against  the Serbian people.    "We fear that at this moment, a few days before the  expiration of the ultimatum, politics have had a significant  influence on the results of the investigation," Krajisnik said.    Asked whether Serbian experts were included in the work of  the international investigative commission, Krajisnik replied  that a Serbian representative was not a full member of the  commission, and was unable to vote, or in any way influence  results of the investigation. He, as an additional member, had  an insight into the work of the commission, could offer  explanations, and inform them about the findings of the Serbian  side regarding the massacre at Sarajevo's marketplace, Krajisnik  explained.</p>

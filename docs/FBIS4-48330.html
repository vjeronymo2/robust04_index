			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 14 SAPA -- Twelve people were  killed -- execution style -- by unknown gunmen firing AK47  rifles in Thokoza on the East Rand on Friday night, police said.  The motive for the attack, which occurred at 7.30PM, was  unknown.    Police Spokesman Capt Janine Smith said on Saturday the  victims, with ages ranging between 13 and 25, were inside a  house in Unit F in Thokoza when the gunmen stormed it and fired  on them. Ten bodies were found inside the house and two others  outside on the premises. All the bodies had bullet wounds.    Capt Smith said it appeared the youths had been staying in  the house for about a month and that the previous owners vacated  it some time ago. It was not known at this stage if the victims  were affiliated to any political grouping. Spent AK47  cartridges were found on the scene.    No further details were given and police were investigating.</p>

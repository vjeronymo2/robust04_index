			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> The Doll Hut, 107 S. Adams Ave. (at Manchester Avenue), Anaheim.  </P> <P> Open Monday through Saturday, 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 533-1286. Top 40 is  strictly prohibited; it's too loud and cramped to ever be a pickup joint; and  its grunge-over-glitz motif is the anti-thesis of all those peach-stucco and  neon yuppie hangouts. It's also the best place in O.C. to hear avant-rock,  drink Guinness and shoot pool. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

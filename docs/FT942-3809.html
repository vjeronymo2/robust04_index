			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Notices could assist French Eurotunnel share investigation The routine issuing of Section 212 notices by Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, following its Pounds 858.3m rights issue, could provide important information for the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market regulator which is investigating French claims that Eurotunnel shares were manipulated ahead of the rights issue. After big share offerings or rights issues, it is standard procedure for companies in the UK to send out these notices which oblige investors to provide details of their shareholdings. A by-product of these notices is that the company can also find out who has bought or sold its shares. Last month, Mr Christian Cambier, head of a French association for Eurotunnel shareholders, wrote to the COB calling for an inquiry into the movement of shares in Eurotunnel ahead of the announcement of its rights issue. 'It seems that massive selling may have deliberately weighed on the share price since the beginning of May and that curiously shares in Eurotunnel may have been lent between institutions during the same period,' he said in the letter. Although selling 'short' is legal in the UK and regularly occurs ahead of a rights issue, the exercise could benefit large institutions at the expense of small shareholders. Eurotunnel said it would co-operate fully with the COB.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pharmacia to set up S Africa unit Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical manufacturer, yesterday became the first Swedish company to establish a direct presence in South Africa since Stockholm lifted sanctions at the beginning of this month. The company, one of the world's top 20 drug makers, said it was setting up both a wholly-owned subsidiary and a 50-50 joint venture operation with Adcock-Ingram in which Pharmacia would invest SKr120m (Dollars 14m). Pharmacia has long sold its products in South Africa through Adcock-Ingram and conducted clinical trials in the country, but it was prevented from having a direct presence because of sanctions which previously barred direct investment in South Africa by Swedish companies. A spokesman for the Swedish Industry Federation said other Swedish companies which did not have established links with South Africa were likely to be more cautious because of uncertainty about the political and economic situation during the transition to majority rule. Pharmacia, with annual turnover of around Dollars 3bn, was recently spun off from Procordia, a drugs and food group jointly controlled by the Swedish government and Volvo. The government is set to privatise its holding in Pharmacia next year, leaving Volvo as the largest shareholder.</p>

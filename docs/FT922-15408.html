			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: A 1980s flagship set for a change of tack - Bristol, where the electorate mirrors the nation as a whole BRISTOL, capital of south-west England, holds a peculiar fascination for psephologists. With roughly the same socio-economic breakdown as that of Britain as a whole, it represents the nation in microcosm. The slave trade, tobacco, aerospace and defence in turn brought prosperity. The late 1980s brought an influx of service-sector businesses lured from London by an attractive environment, low costs and easy access along the M4. For a while, Bristol looked as though it had become an honorary member of the south-east. By 1983 the Conservatives had four of the city's five seats, and in 1987 they defied the national trend by increasing their share of the vote. Today, Bristol could be ripe for a Labour comeback. Indeed, if Labour is to stand any chance of triumphing in the election it must do well here. Bristol prospered in the 1980s. Its defence industry, led by companies such as Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace, were resilient to the last recession. When it ended, the service sector fed the city's growth. Now the city is suffering. A shake-out in financial services has coincided with defence cuts. BAe and Rolls-Royce alone have shed 2,000 jobs, and unemployment has shot up from 5.9 per cent to 9.3 per cent over the last year. Labour's chances of electoral recovery rest on the fact that it can look to a sizable bedrock of support. Bristol retains a sizable manufacturing base, a large working class and a Labour city council. But Labour has a fight on its hands. It is not helped by vestiges of the wrangle for power between the party's own left and right. The Kinnockites won the upper hand in the local party, but businessmen still speak with frustration of the council's alleged anti-business stance, and Labour's one MP in the city, Dawn Primarolo, is a leftwinger. Ms Primarolo has not endeared herself to the moderate vote by refusing to pay her poll tax until served with a liability order. But her Bristol South seat is a solid working-class constituency, and the fact that she clung to it amid Labour's poor local performance in 1987 suggests she can only do better this time. Winning Tory seats is another matter. One that will not go Labour's way is William Waldegrave's Bristol West. Although it includes St Paul's, scene of the notorious 1981 riots, it is dominated by the elegant terraces of Clifton and the leafy suburbs of Henleaze and Stoke Bishop, and has never voted anything but Tory. Labour has two easier targets. Bristol East, a mixed bag but broadly working class, was captured from Tony Benn by Jonathan Sayeed in 1983 and swung further to the Tories in 1987 when Labour fielded left-winger Ron Thomas. This time Jean Corston, a model of Kinnockite orthodoxy, needs only a 4.1 per cent swing to take it back. An even smaller swing - 3.8 per cent  - is needed to retrieve Kingswood. This constituency on Bristol's eastern fringe includes just the sort of owner-occupying skilled workers that Labour needs to win over. The catch is that the sitting Conservative, Robert Hayward, is a strong constituency man who commands a personal vote. The biggest challenge is Bristol North-West. A classic marginal, it has been won six out of seven times in the past 25 years by the party that has won the election. Socioeconomically mixed, it takes in the Rolls-Royce and BAe plants at Filton, and skilled workers make up a significant proportion of its electorate. These might just turn the vote against Michael Stern, the somewhat colourless Conservative incumbent. Many upwardly mobile families moved out of inner-city terraced houses into the vast Bradley Stoke estate on the constituency's northern periphery. Heavily mortgaged, they have seen the value of their property slump. Some have lost their jobs as well. Robert Fisher, 29, should have been an archetypal Conservative voter. A fire-protection engineer, he says he is working class, but ambitious. He moved from Bristol to Canada in 1988 to get a better job and two years later moved back to a new home in Bradley Stoke for the same reason. Last year he was poached by a company offering him a career path into management. The move backfired. Within months he was made redundant. Once in demand, he has been unable to find a job in his field within 100 miles. He and his family - his Canadian wife Christine and nine-month-old daughter Sarah - receive barely enough in income support to pay the mortgage. It is not for want of trying for other jobs. 'I applied to be a shelf-stacker at Asda,' he says. 'There were 35 vacancies, but 1,600 to 2,000 people applied. I didn't get the job: they said I was over-qualified.' Labour needs a swing of 6 per cent to win Bristol North-West. Robert Fisher says he is going to vote Labour: if there are enough like him Neil Kinnock could be the next prime minister.</p>

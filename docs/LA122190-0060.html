			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED IN RAMPAGE AT BASE WANTED TO KILL BUSH  </P> <P> A man who went on a shooting rampage at a military base here said Thursday he  wanted to kill President Bush and send planes to Saudi Arabia because he  disagreed with Bush's actions against Iraq, authorities said.  </P> <P> Robert Craig Anderson, 41, arrested Wednesday night after a high-speed chase  outside Moffett Naval Air Station, told FBI agent John Zent about his plans  during an interview at Stanford Medical Center, the agency said Thursday.  </P> <P> The man from Mountain View, who is being held for psychiatric evaluation,  waived his right to an attorney, the FBI said. In an affidavit, Zent said  Anderson told him he planned to take over the base "and dispatch planes to  Saudi Arabia as he disagreed with President Bush's present actions concerning  Iraq."  </P> <P> Anderson also told Zent "his intention (was) to kill President Bush," but the  complaint did not specify why.  </P> <P> Anderson crashed his vehicle through the base front gate Wednesday night,  speeding past sentries and firing as many as 16 rifle shots, including some at  military police, the FBI said. No one was hurt. He faces seven charges,  including assault with intent to commit murder, kidnaping and threatening the  President.  </P></p>

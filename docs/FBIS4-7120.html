			<p>BFN     [Text] WELLINGTON, April 21 (AFP) -- Foreign minister Don  McKinnon said Thursday he was reluctant to send New Zealand  troops to join the United Nations in Bosnia because on the two  previous occasions New Zealand forces had gone to war in Europe  this century they had taken "enormous losses".    On Wednesday, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said the government  would be prepared to send troops, but there would be no hasty  decisions and any contribution to UN forces would be "very  modest".    Three New Zealand soldiers are currently with UN forces in  Bosnia.    He told reporters the UN had [word indistinct] for about  10,000 troops from its member nations and so far 3,500 had been  committed.    "They will be coming back for the remainder of the 10,000.  New Zealand has of course been included in that general call for  troops."    But in Japan, McKinnon told Radio New Zealand he did not  support sending New Zealand troops to fight in a civil war in  Bosnia, but saw a future role for them as peacekeepers.    "I said more than a year ago when this question was raised  that I would be very reluctant to recommend to my cabinet  colleagues that New Zealand commit itself to another land war in  Europe," he said. "We've been there twice in this century, we've  taken enormous losses in that time. "    McKinnon said he was more concerned about New Zealand  playing  its role as current president of the UN Security Council to  establish a settlement.    "Ultimately that may mean a request for peacekeeping troops;  that's quite a different exercise," he said. "But (at the  moment) we are in between. We haven't got peace; we've still got  a civil war there."    McKinnon said he believed New Zealanders did not really want  to see New Zealand troops there fighting a war.    New Zealand suffered heavy casualites during both world wars  this century.</p>

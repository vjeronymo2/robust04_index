This idea took  shape during the party's first congress which ended its work in  Moscow on Sunday. The congress drew party representatives from  Russia's 64 regions.    "We understand conservatism as something resting upon  spirituality, morals, family", Shakhray told a news conference  after the congress. He said "the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord aims to restore upset ties with the tsarist Russia  without totally repudiating the Soviet times". He told  reporters the party did not yet have any programme, it "is  expected to be adopted at the party's second congress this  coming autumn". Participants in the first congress took a  decision to publish a party newspaper.    Among his potential allies, Shakhray listed the Yabloko  (Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin) Bloc, entrepreneurs' movement, as  well as organizations of social democratic orientation, while  the party's main opponents are Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic  Party and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. The  party leader did not rule out the possibility of tactical  coordination of activities with the Russia's Choice bloc.  However, he stressed that "we cannot regard them as our allies".</p>

A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Kiev, Yevgeny Tyurin,  told Interfax-Ukraine Thursday [17 March] that Smolyakov had  drawn the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's attention to the  "anti-Russian" lecture given by the Ukrainian ambassador to  Canada, Viktor Batyuk, at the University of Ottawa. According  to Russian sources, Batyuk described Russia's foreign policy as  "undeclared cold war against Ukraine aimed at destabilizing its  internal political situation" and that of Ukraine towards Russia  as "anti-imperial."    The Russian diplomat said "such statements and other  unfriendly actions" of this kind do not contribute to the  development of Russo-Ukrainian relations in the context of  agreements reached by the two countries' presidents and do not  strengthen their good-neighborly relations in accordance with  the foreign policy guidelines passed by the Ukrainian Supreme  Soviet.</p>

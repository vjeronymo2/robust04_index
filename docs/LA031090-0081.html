			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE CAT IN MAINE IS MAINLY IN THE DRAIN  </P> <P> Tootsie the cat is back home after spending five weeks in a storm drain.  </P> <P> "The poor little thing looked awful when we got her out.  </P> <P> She was just skin and bones," said Nicole Lonsdale, who helped find the cat for  her neighbors, Peter and Teri Tyson.  </P> <P> Tootsie disappeared on Jan. 26, after apparently entering an open storm drain  that was later sealed off by a snow plow clearing roads in this southern Maine  city.  </P> <P> The Tysons and neighbors searched the area but gave up hope of finding the  6-year-old cat.  </P> <P> Then, late last week, Tyson was chatting with Lonsdale in her driveway when he  heard a faint meow from the nearby drain. He pried the lid off and climbed  inside, calling Tootsie's name. The cat poked its head out of a pipe and  scampered to Tyson.  </P></p>

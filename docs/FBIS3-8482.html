As for the Greek demands of changes in the Macedonian [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Constitution and  its flag, he stressed he "had never given nor can now give  promises" for possible changes by Macedonia, but these issues  can be discussed in an effort to seek compromises. But, he  said, no negotiating is possible in conditions of embargoes and  preconditions.    In reference to the "Greek-Serbian" axis, Papoulias' visit  to  Belgrade, and the embargo that followed afterward, President  Gligorov said he considers mutual relations between the Balkan  countries to be their internal affairs. It is only important to  accept Macedonia as an independent and sovereign state, whose  existence is a condition for peace and stability in the Balkans.    President Gligorov does not believe that additional troops  in  Macedonia, whether Russian or from any other country, are  necessary. He said present UN peace-keeping forces are  sufficient.    Asked on the latest radicalization of the Serbian party in  Macedonia, Gligorov stated he does not expect any border  incidents (although they are not completely excluded as long as  the war is on), because Serbs in Macedonia are given all  possible rights. "I would be happy to see such rights for the  Macedonians in Serbia," he added. Gligorov said the PDP [Party  for Democratic Prosperity] split is a "normal process in a  democratic state." The worst possible solution would be forming  ghettos of any nationality. It is another issue what forces and  what party option will come out as a winner.    Asked on Bulgarians in Macedonia, Gligorov said they have  been given the opportunity to self-declare themselves in  previous consensus.    The East-West corridor is a "priority matter" for the  Macedonian president. Mr. Gligorov said he is personal friend  with the Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and said Mr. Zhelev  is a man of wide democratic views close to his own.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign </F> trade and economic cooperation, by Zhang Shaozhou (1728 1421  3166) and Liu Luyan (0491 7627 3601); date and place not given:  "Vast Vistas, Bright Prospects--Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation, Extensively Talks About the  Development of Foreign-Funded Enterprises"]    [Text] Editor's note: Foreign-funded enterprises in  China, which were tender seedlings in the 1980's and which have  attracted extensive domestic and foreign attention, are now  standing before the world with a brand new outlook. Their  industrial output value now accounts for over one-tenth of the  country's total, and their imports and exports account for  one-third. Foreign investment absorbed by these enterprises  accounts for nine-tenths of the country's use of foreign  capital. Large and efficient enterprises with a high technology  content and with the ability to earn more foreign exchange have  emerged one after another. The vigorous development of  foreign-funded enterprises has played an increasingly important  role in China's economic construction, demonstrating the  outstanding achievements of reform and opening up. After  leaving Beijing on 28 April, the team charged with covering  "China's noted foreign-funded enterprises" went to all  localities and wrote a number of articles reflecting the growth,  successful experience, and outstanding contributions of the  foreign-funded enterprises. Commencing today, we will publish  these articles one after another to provide our readers with a  window to understand contemporary China's reform, opening up,  and modernization program. [end editor's note]    Since reform and opening up, China has achieved marked  successes in the use of foreign capital. Foreign-funded  enterprises have become an important force in China's national  economic development, and a number of noted, efficient, and  properly managed ones have particularly attracted attention at  home and abroad. As China's reform and opening up has entered a  new stage of development, foreign-funded enterprises, which are  marked symbols of opening up, have also greeted a new high tide.  Under such a momentum, how should we maintain the sustained,  rapid, and healthy growth of the foreign-funded enterprises? We  held an interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and  economic cooperation and asked her to express her views.    "I am optimistic about the development of foreign-funded  enterprises." Minister Wu Yi gave a spirited account of the  status quo of foreign-funded enterprises:    "Vigorously making effective use of foreign capital  constitutes an important element of China's open policy and  economic work. Absorbing direct foreign investment is one of the  main forms of making use of foreign capital. By March this  year, the country approved a total of 186,000 foreign-invested  projects, with agreed-upon capital of $241.5 and an actual  investment of $67.2 billion. Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  tour of southern China in early 1992, the enthusiasm of foreign  businessmen for investing in China ran high, and both the number  of projects and the amount of capital doubled. In 1993, the  country approved 83,000 foreign-funded projects, involving  contracted capital of $111.4 billion and an actual use of $27.5  billion, an increase of 71.1 percent, 91.72 percent, and 149.95  percent respectively over 1992, or equivalent to the total sum  of the 14 years since reform and opening up. According to  figures provided by a foreign authoritative accounting office,  the United States, China, and Britain have become the major  countries for international commercial investment in 1993.  China's position, which was sixth in 1992, rose to second in  1993, second only to the United States. The foreign capital  absorbed by China in 1993 accounted for one-tenth of the world's  overseas capital of $152 billion. In the first three months of  this year, China again approved 12,000 foreign-invested  projects, with an agreed upon investment of $19.6 billion, or a  real foreign investment of $5.4 billion."    The reporter asked, "What are the new characteristics of  direct foreign investment absorbed by China over the past two  years or so?"    "Over the past two years, the number of countries and  regions  investing in China has been continuously increasing, rising from  a little more than 80 in 1991 to 133 by the end of 1993. The  ten largest investors include: Hong Kong and Macao, Taiwan, the  United States, Japan, Singapore, Britain, Thailand, Canada,  Germany, and Australia.    "The scope of investment has been expanded. The average  amount of contracted foreign capital in each project was $1.33  million in 1993, an increase of 12.9 percent over the $1.178  million in 1992. The average figure in Guangdong, Fujian,  Shanghai, and Beijing approached or exceeded $2 million. By the  end of 1993, the number of projects involving an investment of  over $10 million approved by China totaled more than 1,800.    "Apart from the expansion in the areas and field of  investment, the means of investment also diversified. Although  foreign investment in China primarily focuses on the coastal  areas, the interior is also speeding up its pace of attracting  foreign investment. In 1993, approximately 80 percent of the  foreign-funded projects and the amount was focused on the  coastal areas; however, the proportion of foreign-funded  projects and capital attracted by the interior rose from 7 to 8  percent in 1992 to 20 percent in 1993. Foreign businessmen made  marked progress in their investment in the three major  industries. The fields of banking, insurance, real estate,  retail sales, consultation, accountant office, and information  services were also opened gradually to foreign investors. New  headway was made in the means of foreign investment. The  establishment of more than 30 Sino-foreign shareholding  enterprises was approved, and more than 20 special renminbi  shares (B shares) were listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock  exchanges. In recent years, we also selectively approved a  number of investment companies."    "Moreover, a number of transnational companies have been  active in their investment in China, which further optimized the  investment setup. By the end of 1993, more than 80  transnational industrial corporations from Europe, the United  States, Japan, and the developed countries and regions in the  Asia- Pacific region made investments in China. Some of the  transnational corporations and big companies with solid  financial foundations also ran a number of transportation,  energy, infrastructure, raw material, and other large projects  which were badly needed for national economic development. The  large scale and amount involved in these high-level projects  further rationalized and optimized the investment setup."    "Could you tell us the status and role of foreign investors  in China's economic development?"    "With the expansion in the scope and field of investment  made  by foreign businessmen, foreign investment is playing an  increasingly important role in China's economic development."    "Foreign investment has accelerated the pace of China's  economic development and has increased employment opportunities  and state revenue. The proportion of China's annual actual use  of foreign investment to total investment in fixed assets, which  was 2.5 percent in the 1980's, 8 percent in 1992, and 13 percent  in 1993, constituted one of the essential sources of capital for  China's economic construction. Foreign-funded enterprises which  have gone into operation total over 80,000, of which the output  value of industrial enterprises accounted for 7.5 percent of the  country's total in 1992, 11 percent in 1993, and higher in  Guangdong and Fujian. Taxes collected from foreign-funded  enterprises increased for successive years, jumping from 10.7  billion yuan in 1992 to 20.6 billion yuan in 1993, nearly  doubling the figure. The number of people employed by  foreign-funded enterprises which have gone into operation total  approximately 10 million.    "Foreign investment promoted China's industrial progress.  The available foreign capital is primarily used in importing  advanced technology and equipment, which filled the gaps in some  domestic technology, upgraded large number of products, narrowed  the gap between China and advanced international levels, and  brought about an upgrading of similar domestic products.  Meanwhile, the transfer of parts and technology of many trades  further boosted the growth of the relevant domestic industries  and improved the production and technological level."    "Foreign-funded enterprises have become a vital force in  China's foreign trade. The volume of imports and exports of  foreign-funded enterprises in 1993 totaled $67.1 billion,  accounting for 34.4 percent of the volume of the country's  imports and exports, of which their exports amounted to $25.2  billion, accounting for 27.5 percent of the country's total.  China's foreign trade grew comprehensively in the first quarter  of this year, with the volume of imports and exports reaching  $39.5 billion, of which the volume of imports and exports of  foreign-funded enterprises amounted to $14.66 billion,  accounting for 37.1 percent of the country's total as compared  with the 30 percent rise of the previous year. The development  of foreign-funded enterprises improved the structure of China's  export commodities and enormously boosted China's foreign trade."    "The means of organizations and operation of foreign-funded  enterprises, their market mechanisms, and the scientific  enterprise management system have offered a demonstration and  reference to state enterprises to change their operational  mechanism and establish a modern enterprise system."    After a pause, Minister Wu said: "Facts have proven that the  development of foreign-funded enterprises is healthy on the  whole, and their achievements are remarkable. This should be  fully affirmed and appraised. But there are also problems. We  should follow international standards to promote and ensure the  healthy growth of foreign-funded enterprises. Viewed from the  foreign-funded enterprises which have gone into operation, most  of them have obtained better or considerable economic results  and have attained their due interests in investing in China."    Minister Wu said enthusiastically: "Through 15 years of  development, a large number of well-known foreign-funded  enterprises have emerged. They have filled the gaps in domestic  technology, scientific operational mechanism, enterprise  management, social and economic efficiency, product quality and  grade, capital and technology content, and foreign exchange  earning through exports. All foreign-funded enterprises and  domestic enterprises should learn from their experiences.  Therefore, I am in favor of the long series on `Noted  Foreign-Funded Enterprises in China' that is jointly being  written by RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION and CHINA FOREIGN  CAPITAL."    "What will be the main guide for foreign capital in the  years  ahead?"    "We will continue to follow the state's industrial policies;  will vigorously guide foreign capital toward infrastructure and  basic industries, toward the technical transformation of  enterprises, and toward capital and technology intensive  industries; and will gradually lift the restrictions on the  service trades. We encourage foreign businessmen to invest in  the following fields: Comprehensive agricultural development  projects -- the energy, transportation, and essential raw  materials industries that China badly needs; advanced  technological projects; and projects that earn more foreign  exchange through exports."    "In short, China has a variety of industries and offers an  extensive scope for investment and great potential for  development, which provides foreign investors with favorable  conditions. We will unswervingly implement the open policy,  further strengthen international and regional economic and  technological cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit,  and make contributions to economic prosperity and development."</p>

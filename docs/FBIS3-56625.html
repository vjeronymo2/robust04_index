As many as 132 people were killed during those January days  and more than 700 were wounded.    The president voiced his remark during the report of  Azerbaijan's attorney general Ali Omarov. Omarov, in  particular, pointed out that the purpose for forces being  introduced into Baku at that time was primarily to rescue the  leadership of Azerbaijan's communist party.    As the attorney general believes, Azerbaijan's former  leaders  Abdurakhman Vezirov, Ayaz Mutalibov, Viktor Polyanichko, Elmira  Gafarova, and former leader of the republic's KGB Vagif Gusaynov  should be made answerable for the January 1990 events along with  the former Soviet leadership at that time and its power  ministers (Gorbachev, Yazov, Kryuchkov, Bakatin, Primakov).    Omarov reported that he had ordered the National Security  Ministry to institute proceedings against Vagif Gusaynov due to  the January 20, 1990, events in Baku.    Observers do not rule out that criminal charges against  Vezirov and Mutalibov can be brought as well.    The discussion is being continued.</p>

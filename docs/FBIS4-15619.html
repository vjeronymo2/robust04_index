			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Brykin] </F>   [Text] Simferopol April 9 TASS -- "The results of our trip,  together with other materials, will be submitted on April 21 in  The Hague to Van der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for national  minorities. They will become a basis for drafting a programme  of work with the Crimea and specific directions of the  consultative, economic and humanitarian assistance," Emil Payn,  member of the Presidential Council of Russia, told ITAR-TASS  today. He is now on a working visit in the Crimea as a member  of the CSCE expert group.    Speaking about Russia's policy with regard to the Crimea,  Payn said that a new conceptual framework, under which the  Russian-speaking population in the former USSR republics should  be given assistance, is set forth in President Yeltsin's address  to the Federal Assembly. "The Crimea is a source of concern for  Russia as a potential conflict area. Russia is also concerned  over the fact that Russians and representatives of the nations,  historically linked with Russia, are living there. The problem  of the Black Sea Fleet, which is important both for Russia and  the Crimea, will also be tackled," Payn said.</p>

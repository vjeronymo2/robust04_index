			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Bundesbank takes a bet on its credibility - Capital &amp; Credit Last Wednesday's generous cuts in the German discount and Lombard short-term interest rates came after a long period in which rates had been allowed to fall only in a sequence of teasingly small steps. 'Prima]' ('Great]') was how Mr Norbert Walter of the Deutsche Bank greeted last week's cuts, which took the discount rate to 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate to 6 per cent. Mr Martin Hufner of the Bayerische Vereinsbank said the German central bank was taking full advantage of an ideal combination of circumstances. The move was readily comprehensible against a favourable background of falling inflation (inflation is set to drop below 3 per cent early in the second half of the year) and a weak dollar. Many economists saw the move as a natural extension of the Bundesbank's intervention to support the US currency in the previous week. For once, then, a cut was supported by both international and domestic policy considerations - a pleasant change, economists observed, from the state of affairs over recent years, when domestic policy considerations have run contrary to the wishes of other countries. The interest rate cuts, which many expect to be the last before the Bundesbank policy-making council's summer break in 10 weeks, were not without elements of surprise and controversy. The timing was unexpected - the consensus had been that the central bank would not move until its meeting in two weeks, when it would have had more data on inflation and money supply to support further easing. More importantly, the reasoning behind the move was unusual, not to say revolutionary for the Bundesbank. The central bank said it was justified in the light of the improving outlook for inflation in Germany - so far, so conventional - but also that it would help dissolve the 'monetary blockage' which led to the explosion in money supply growth in the early months of this year. The statement that a reduction in interest rates will contribute to a reduction in money supply growth stands the Bundesbank's standard argumentation on its head: it has previously maintained that interest rates have to be kept high to prevent growth in M3, the broad measure of money supply on which the Bundesbank relies as a leading indicator for the development of future inflation. The Bundesbank justifies this volte-face in reasoning by saying that under current circumstances a substantial reduction in interest rates will encourage investors to shift money out of short-term deposits into longer-term investment vehicles, such as bunds, which fall outside the definition of money. The central bank believes this will reverse the flows of money which have led the explosion of M3 growth - M3 was up by a seasonally adjusted, annualised 15.4 per cent in March compared with the 4 to 6 per cent target range for 1994 - and cause the formation of capital instead. This claim is highly controversial and many economists believe the central bank is taking big risks. 'The Bundesbank is taking a major gamble on its credibility,' said Mr Adolf Rosenstock of the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt. 'A big bet on M3 slowdown', is how Mr Kermit Schoenholtz at Salomon Brothers International in London put it. The risk is that M3 does not behave as the Bundesbank wants it to. 'Then in a few months time, the Bundesbank will face an awful dilemma,' observed Mr Joachim Fels at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. 'It will realise the policy has failed and it will either have to abandon M3 altogether, or it will have to start raising rates to bring money supply back under control.' The danger that investors will continue to park their liquid assets at the short end of the yield curve is real. Bund yields, up more than a full percentage point from a low of 5.58 per cent in early January this year, failed to respond substantially last week. 'The current yield of 6.6 per cent is not sufficient to compensate investors for the risk of holding long-term assets,' said Mr Fels. 'Given the volatility in the bund market over recent months, the Bundesbank can't expect to shock investors out of short deposits - the uncertainty factor is too high.' The pessimism is underscored by a shift in market expectations about interest rates. Futures markets now expect short-term rates to bottom out in September, rather than at the end of the year, and at a higher level than had been expected only months ago. This reflects worries about the chances of a recovery in the German economy, stimulated by a crop of recent data suggesting that the economy will avoid a 'double-dip' recession. The more buoyant the economy, the more likely it is that the Bundesbank will start raising interest rates again. Ironically, the lower rates introduced last week will stimulate the economy and make the Bundesbank's task trickier later in the year.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS REASSURE CONSUMERS ABOUT MERCURY IN PAINTS  </P> <P> Paint companies scrambled to alleviate consumer fears Friday over reports that  mercury in interior latex paint can be harmful. Several of the companies said  they have not used mercury for years.  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency barred manufacturers from adding mercury to  paint after Aug. 20. Paint made before then may still be sold, however.  </P> <P> But the furor followed reports this week of a study that found relatively high  levels of mercury in people whose homes were painted inside with latex paint  containing mercury.  </P> <P> The study, conducted in 1989, was published in Thursday's issue of the New  England Journal of Medicine. Concern about mercury in paint arose last year  after a 4-year-old Michigan boy suffered mercury poisoning when his home was  painted. He suffered severe rashes, itching, sweating and a personality change.  </P> <P> The EPA's 24-hour hot line for paint information -- the National Pesticide  Telecommunications Network at 1-800-858-7378 -- reported a record 900 calls on  the issue on Thursday.  </P> <P> A trade group for 550 manufacturers, including some of the nation's largest,  noted that paint used in the study and to which the boy was exposed contained  nearly three times as much mercury as the EPA recommended at the time. The  paint was made by the Mercury Paint Co. of Detroit, Mich.  </P> <P> "It was almost certainly at the high end," said Marilyn Ludwig, spokeswoman for  the National Paint &amp; Coatings Assn. in Washington.  </P> <P> "Vague directives" led the EPA to declare Mercury Paint's mercury levels to be  an "unenforceable action," agency spokesman Al Heier said.  </P> <P> A telephone call Friday to Charles Soberman, president and owner of Mercury  Paint, was not returned.  </P> <P> Most uses of mercury were banned in the mid-1970s, except in paint.  Manufacturers had convinced the EPA that they didn't have a good alternative to  mercury, Heier said. The element is used to preserve the paint in the can and  prevent mildew after application.  </P> <P> The EPA estimates that, before the recent ban, up to 30% of interior latex  paint contained mercury. But the industry association believes just 10% to 15%  contained the element, Ludwig said.  </P> <P> Consumers who own paint bought before the ban should call the manufacturer to  determine if it contains mercury, she said.  </P></p>

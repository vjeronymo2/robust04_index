			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Read this, you need to know it - Tips on how to ensure your press release does not end up in the wastepaper bin Is this article important? That is the first question editors and writers ask when they pick up a press release and start reading. And the conclusion they reach will determine whether they read on or toss the release aside. The writer has one paragraph  -perhaps 20 seconds - to seize the reader's attention or lose it. Important means this: the article is based on a development that the publication's readers will find interesting because it matters to them and is new. So when submitting a press release, ask yourself how your new product, improved service or reduced price, for example, could be important from the publication's point of view and then write your press release to emphasise that importance. As a golden rule before sitting down to compose a press release, make sure you have something worthwhile to say. Of equal importance is to tackle the main point immediately - in the first paragraph. And make it with absolute clarity. Editors and writers will judge your article in a matter of seconds and what they are looking for are facts. Many press releases are not used because the central idea is flimsy and unimportant. It puffs up an organisation but has no benefit for the reader. To cover up this critical flaw, the writer often commits another mistake - he or she resorts to fancy writing. Editors and writers have no time to untangle any tricky phrasing. They spot it at a glance, run out of patience and your press release goes in the wastepaper basket. It does not take long for you to acquire a reputation as an inexperienced amateur, to be safely ignored by editors and writers. A point just touched on is worth a bit of emphasis: once you have decided what is important, get to the point fast. Say it in the first paragraph. Let's say you have 100 words to convince the reader. So make your point quickly, with every word meaningful and clear. Here are 13 rules to guide you: Make sure your subject is important to the readers of the publication to which you will send your release. Present the essential facts immediately, in the first paragraph. Search for a simple, straightforward style, so your information will be easy to follow and understand. Clarity is an absolute must. Fancy, pretentious writing can only obscure your message. Try to personalise your press release by quoting an authority in your organisation. This breathes life into the article. But make sure the quoted person says something important to help move the story along and, incidentally, to make him or her look authoritative. If this person cannot say anything interesting or pertinent, do not use him or her. If your press release mentions a new rate sheet, brochure, or book, be sure to enclose a copy. Keep companies, columnists, business editors and writers on separate mailing lists. Each has a different point of view and different needs, so tailor your stories to fit each group. If your press release refers to an important coming event, which editors and writers might cover, send it far enough in advance so that they can make plans. Freelances need time to query editors, and editors appreciate time to make arrangements. A last-minute press release, on the other hand, may pose so many problems that editors and writers may decide it is not convenient to attend. Timing is often the difference between success and failure. Keep mailing lists up-to-date and weed out duplicates. Nobody likes to receive a press release addressed to a predecessor. And a mistake of that kind marks you as careless and unprofessional. A sample sheet showing photos available, with a request form, helps the editor and writer choose exactly what they want. This saves you the considerable expense of sending big collections of mass-produced photos, 90 per cent of which would never be used. Do not label your press releases as 'special', 'personal', or 'exclusive' unless they really are. Writers or editors who have been led to believe that they have received an exclusive story can only be angry when they discover that your promise is not true. And using these words recklessly brands you as an unsophisticated performer whose work should be regarded sceptically. It is obvious, but needs emphasising, that every release should have a specific release date - such as August 10, 1993. It is not good practice to use 'immediate release' because this allows one editor to use it ahead of another, and sometimes that can be embarrassing. Always include the name of your organisation's contact person, plus telephone and fax numbers. At the end of your press release, add this: 'If I can be of further help, please call.' It is often true that editors and writers need additional facts or wish to explore a different angle, and they appreciate your willingness to help. Next time you write a press release, check it against these rules. Then, to be on the safe side, check it once more against the golden rule above. If you pass that test, you are well on the way to getting your release read and used.</p>

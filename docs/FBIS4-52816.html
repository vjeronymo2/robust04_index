			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Pak Chong-mun: "Government's Belated </F> Attention to Japan's Moves for Nuclear Armament"]    [Text] With the operation of fast-breeder reactors,  completion of the largest nuclear reprocessing plant in the  world, and introduction of plutonium from overseas, Japan, our  neighbor, has aroused heated public debate in the West. Our  government, which kept silent despite such heated public debate,  has begun to direct its attention to Japan's nuclear policy.    What touched off our government's interest was the  unexpected  discovery of 70 kilograms of plutonium in the nuclear  reprocessing plant operated by Japan Energy and Nuclear Fuel  Development Corporation. The entire world has suspected North  Korea of having extracted and concealed kilogram-levels of  plutonium prior to inspection by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] in May 1992. We may point out that contrary to  such global suspicion on North Korea, the recent incident in  Japan has been treated in an exceedingly light manner. In fact,  nine nuclear bombs the size of the bomb (12.5 kiloton) dropped  in Hiroshima in 1945 can be manufactured with this amount of  plutonium. This should not be overlooked.    Needless to say, direct comparison of plutonium possessed by  Japan with that of North Korea is unreasonable. While pushing  ahead with nuclear energy development by putting forward the  slogan, "democracy, openness, and independence," Japan has  allowed the highest-degree of inspections by IAEA. Contrary to  this, North Korea has been trying its utmost to evade IAEA  inspections as much as possible.    The IAEA is using most of its budget to watch Japanese and  German nuclear facilities, by permanently posting seven  inspectors in Japan's nuclear reprocessing facilities. Thus,  the discovery of such a large amount of plutonium which the IAEA  failed to uncover is certainly an issue.    We may point out, first of all, that there are many  unforeseen blind spots [sagak chidae] in the IAEA's inspection  system. An even more serious problem is that even if Japan,  which is classified as a "semi-nuclear state," were to convert  nuclear material on its own after getting rid of IAEA  surveillance, no other nation would be able to take steps until  its conversion was exposed to the public.    It is not easy for one to use nuclear material for purposes  other than the generation of atomic energy, even if this  material is produced outside surveillance network, because  thorough surveys are conducted at each important step in the  enrichment, reprocessing, and stockpiling of nuclear fuel.  Nonetheless, Japanese nuclear technology, has reached a top  level in the world, and includes laser enrichment technology  that can be put into operation secretly. This being the case,  experts point out that Japan can convert nuclear material  whenever it should so desire.    At the same time, the Japanese openly declared plan to  stockpile plutonium in order to operate high-breeder reactors  and converters, has even more serious implications. Experts in  the West believe that Japan will stockpile 71.6 tons of  plutonium by 2004, and will be able to store 14.9 tons of  plutonium from 1993 to 2004 in an unused state after using the  amount necessary for use in atomic energy power stations. One  can produces 1,500 to 2,000 small-size nuclear bombs with this  amount of plutonium. Thus, the world is directing attention to  the issue of Japanese plutonium.    Our government showed no objection to the Japanese  denuclearization policy until last year, because it believed  that the Japanese nuclear facilities were under strict  international surveillance and that the United States would not  remain indifferent to the Japanese moves for nuclear armament.  Our government also put into consideration the fact that  hurting the Japanese people's feelings would not help resolve  either the North Korean nuclear problem or problems pertaining  to past relations between the ROK and Japan in a satisfactory  manner. However, the government has now changed its attitude  with the discovery of plutonium as an occasion, to cautiously  raise a voice toward the Japanese nuclear issue. It appears  that the government's decision is based on its judgment that  this issue should no longer be overlooked. Meanwhile, by taking  issue with the possibility of Japanese nuclear armament, North  Korea is continually attempting to deflect away attention from  the declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  and our government has also had to consider this. Moreover,  recent trends indicate that a possibile slackening in the  U.S.-Japan security alliance relations, which has been key to  blocking Japan's nuclear armament. This being the case, we  should make appropriate preparations for such a situation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hasin al-Bunyan: "Gulf Reservations About U.S. </F> Draft for Multilaterals"]    [Text] Riyadh -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher will meet tomorrow with the foreign ministers of the  Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states at the GCC General  Secretariat.    Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Gulf  ministers will discuss with Christopher the proposed draft for a  "declaration of principles" of states participating in the  multilateral negotiations, which lays the foundations for the  shape of political and economic cooperation between the states  of the region.    The United States submitted this draft to the GCC states  during the meeting of the multilateral negotiations steering  committee, which convened in Ottawa, Canada, in February. Under  secretaries of the GCC foreign ministries met in Riyadh at the  beginning of the week to discuss this draft. They reached a  joint formula in this connection. The ministers will discuss  this formula with Christopher when they meet with him tomorrow.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that some GCC states have  reservations about some clauses in the proposed U.S. draft,  especially those related to the pledge to establish democracy  and party pluralism and encourage individual and collective  freedoms.    In addition to GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan  al-Qasimi, the meeting will be attended by the foreign ministers  of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and  the Sultanate of Oman. It will not be attended by Shaykh Sabah  al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, who is on a tour of the Maghreb states. Kuwait will  be represented at the meeting by 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dakhil,  minister of state for cabinet affairs, planning minister, and  acting foreign minister.    The "declaration of principles" proposed for the  multilaterals in the Middle East region stipulates laying down  basic principles to govern relations among regional parties in  the region, establishing full relations, and reinforcing  regional cooperation and economic development with Israel's  participation under the plan to achieve reconciliation; a just,  secure, comprehensive, and lasting peace; and mutual trust among  all parties in the Middle East region.    Muscat recently hosted the meetings of the water committee  arising from these negotiations. Qatar is scheduled to host the  arms control committee meetings next Monday. Bahrain too has  offered to host the environment committee meetings next fall.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cominco deficit widens to CDollars 95m in final period COMINCO, the Canadian metals and fertiliser group, suffered a heavy fourth-quarter loss as a result of soft metal prices and the decision to write off a third of the cost of its troubled lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia. The loss, including the CDollars 50m (USDollars 39.2m) smelter write-down, was CDollars 95.2m, or CDollars 1.21 a share, against a CDollars 16.3m loss, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 364.6m from CDollars 344m. The loss for the year narrowed to CDollars 30.2m from CDollars 41.3m, thanks largely to a gain earlier in the year from the sale of a 46 per cent interest in Aberfoyle, the Australian mining group. Cominco's mining and metals business swung to a fourth-quarter operating loss of CDollars 40.5m from a CDollars 5.5m profit a year earlier, due largely to an after-tax charge of CDollars 30m to reflect the impact of lower metal prices on zinc and ferro-nickel inventories. Canadian Pacific Forest Products, the newsprint producer, suffered a net loss of CDollars 59.5m or CDollars 1.13 a share in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of CDollars 96m or CDollars 2.19 a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The company, controlled by Canadian Pacific, had sales of CDollars 467m, against CDollars 481m. The fall was mainly due to a mill shutdown and asset sales. For all 1992 the loss was CDollars 248m or CDollars 4.82 a share, against a deficit of CDollars 571m or CDollars 13 in 1991.</p>

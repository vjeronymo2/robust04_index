At the opening session, Dr. Eduardo Cruz Gonzalez, dean of  Cienfuegos University, said the objective of these meetings, the  second of which is being held here in coordination with the  Center for Research of World Economy, is to study how  universities, in the midst of the difficulties daily affecting  the world, can contribute to maintaining the concept of support  to the integrationist process in America.    Several working groups are analyzing such topics as Latin  American integration in history; the Latin American university  in today's world; research on housing; and science, technology,  and sustainable development. Two important seminars will close  the international scientific research meeting on integration  tomorrow.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Inishtech Inishtech, the packaging and labels group, reported profits of IPounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.85m) before tax for the six months to June 30, against IPounds 3.6m. The 8 per cent increase was achieved on turnover ahead 18 per cent to IPounds 31.8m (IPounds 27m), including a contribution of IPounds 1.99m from acquisitions - six over the past 12 months which currently achieve combined annual sales of some IPounds 7m. Mr Thomas Toner, chairman, said that the group's UK-based companies performed satisfactorily but warned that a disappointing showing from Label Art, the Dublin-based self-adhesive label offshoot, would 'have a restricting effect' on the trading outcome in the second half. Sales at Label Art declined 13 per cent on a year-on-year basis, following the loss of a contract with its largest customer. The interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 2.75p, payable from earnings of 16.8p (15.9p) per share. Some 70 per cent of the issued capital is held by James Crean, the Irish industrial holding company.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Close shave for sterling STERLING fell within  1/2 pfennig of its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, but the Bank of England narrowly avoided the need to support the currency through intervention, writes James Blitz. After a comparatively quiet morning in European trading, the pound and the Italian lira fell sharply against the D-Mark after an opinion poll indicated that 51 per cent of the French population would vote against the Maastricht treaty in next month's referendum. The prospect of European monetary union collapsing has become a strong incentive for investing in D-Marks as a safe haven. Sterling dived to an offered rate of DM2.7820, compared to its floor of DM2.7780. The Italian lira was offered at L764.5 per D-Mark, compared with its floor of L765. Both falls threatened interest rate rises. In London the government continued to insist that it would do 'whatever was necessary' to protect the pound's parity within the ERM. The two currencies rebounded from their lows after another French opinion poll came out showing 51 per cent in favour of Maastricht. However, Mr Mark Brett, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said it was pointless to buy sterling on the back of the second poll. 'If only 51 per cent vote in favour of Maastricht in France, the treaty will be politically dead anyway,' he added. The Bank of England may have been saved from having to intervene because the French opinion polls were released at 3pm. ERM rules only operate between 8am and 4pm in London time, so the Bank no longer needed to intervene after an hour. Sterling closed in London 1 1/4 pfennigs down at DM2.7875. Today, the Bundesbank carries out its weekly intervention in the market. If it withdraws funds from circulation to keep in line with its monetary growth targets, it will push up call money rates. This will scare sterling holders into thinking there will be another Lombard rate rise. The D-Mark also gained substantially against the French franc, ending at FFr3.413 from a previous FFr3.405. A measure of the German currency's strength over Europe is that it has moved up two places in the EMS grid. It is now third from the top of the grid, narrowly behind the Belgian and Spanish currencies. The dollar had a quiet morning in Europe but was rocked by poorer than expected August consumer confidence figures. The conference board index was expected to rise to 63 per cent from July's 61.2 per cent but dropped to 58 per cent, its lowest since March. The US currency quickly fell from DM1.4010 to a low of DM1.3940, but clambered back to end in London at DM1.4000, down 35 basis points. In New York it closed at DM1.4022.</p>

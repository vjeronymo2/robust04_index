			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: La finta giardiniera - Opera Mozart's teenage operas, given a strong cast and producer, can easily hold modern audiences. Mitridate has enjoyed recent success at Covent Garden and Il re pastore drew enthusiasm at Opera North, but it is hard to imagine more alive and persuasive early Mozart than Tim Albery's staging of La finta giardiniera, which opened at Cardiff's New Theatre on Monday, Welsh National Opera having taken over Opera North's original 1989 production. But then Finta, written shortly before Mozart's 19th birthday, is perhaps the most interesting of the composer's early operas. In its blend of comic and serious styles it foreshadows Cos fan tutte and, especially, Le nozze di Figaro, and the extraordinary music accompanying Sandrina's nightmarish visions at the end of Act 2 anticipates not only Mozart's later style but that of his musical successors. Finta deserves respect, and gets it from Albery. Albery convinces one of its dramatic viability, which in fact is not consistently strong. He is helped by Tom Cairns's bold designs - bright green for the garden setting with contrasting reds and blues, a heap of soil with plastic flowers for Sandrina's garden - which play up to the opera's absurdities. It is fascinating to see a producer who in opera has been drawn mainly to dark dramas played out by a 'people' - his Peter Grimes, for instance, currently in revival at English National Opera - direct a cast of just seven with such a strong sense of comedy. He draws intense performances from each singer. In her WNO debut, Joan Rodgers as Sandrina - the disguised gardener of the title, really a Countess  -gives a heart-melting performance. Her creamy soprano plumbs depths of emotion, she sings with poise befitting the nobility Sandrina conceals. Janice Watson is a commanding, brightly sung Arminda, Sandrina's arrogant and sometimes hysterical rival, and plays the role for all it is worth. The American Paul Groves portrays Count Belfiore with wit and reveals a firm, lyric tenor - a notable UK debut. Another American, the soprano Cyndia Sieden, makes her WNO debut as a truculent Serpetta. Ryland Davies celebrates the 30th anniversary of his first WNO appearance as a properly comic Mayor, and sings with a fine sense of musical style. The mezzo Ann Taylor-Morley, a rapidly emerging talent, is fresh and impetuous in the trouser role of Ramiro, and the baritone Neal Davies an appealing Nardo. Finta is a long opera, but it flies past in this stylish performance and because words - Amanda Holden's lively translation is used - are projected with such clarity. Ivor Bolton's inflexible conducting is less than ideal, but does little to detract from a production that should not be missed. Further performances in Cardiff on June 15 and 18, before the production tours to Swansea (June 23), Birmingham (June 30), Southampton (July 7) and Bristol (July 14).</p>

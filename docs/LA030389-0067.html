			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TOWER  </P> <P> Wouldn't it be neat if Tower was appointed secretary of defense and on the same  day Ollie North was acquitted of all charges? And the two events were  celebrated on a national scale as a reaffirmation of the fact justice still  reigns in the U.S.? That would surely be evidence of the "kinder, gentler  society" President Bush has promised us. Only a terrible cynic could fail to  recognize that truth, honesty, decency and sobriety still prevail when we  select leaders to admire.  </P> <P> BEN IRWIN  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

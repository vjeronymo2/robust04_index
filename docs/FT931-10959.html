			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Tory rebels state their pit demands TORY OPPONENTS of the government's pit closures programme have signalled that they may be ready to accept a new strategy for the industry which would rescue fewer pits than the number implied in last week's report from the Commons trade and industry committee. An FT survey of the Tory backbenchers most likely to rebel if too few pits are saved indicated that a plan to rescue between 12 and 14 threatened coal mines may be enough to stave off defeat in the Commons on the issue. But the potential rebels hold a wide range of views, and some hardliners insist that up to 20 of the 31 pits must be rescued. Nevertheless, an assurance that private operators would be able to take over the running of any pits British Coal decided to close would help appease rebels. The government could be defeated if as few as 11 of its backbenchers voted against it in the Commons debate on the energy white paper to be published later this month. Among the most difficult to satisfy is Mrs Ann Winterton, MP for Congleton, who spoke of sparing a number 'in the high teens.' Mr Stephen Day, MP for Cheadle, described the trade and industry committee report as 'the bottom line'. Others have a lower threshold. Mr David Nicholson, the MP for Taunton, who said he had attended meetings of the 30-strong coal group of Tory MPs, said he would vote against the government 'only if the government appeared suicidal.' He added: 'Anything below 10 and we come into abstention or voting against.' Mr Spencer Batiste, MP for Elmet and another coal group member, said he was 'looking for a minimum of 10 to 15 pits in the context of British Coal' with remaining pits offered for sale. He was likely to support the government unless it proposed an additional market significantly below 10m tonnes per year, he indicated. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the MP for Batley and Spen who has been among the most prominent Tory coal campaigners, said she would be unlikely to back proposals to save between 10 and 12 pits. 'I think we could get an additional 30m tonnes per year with a subsidy of just short of Pounds 300m over five years.' Sir Richard Body, MP for Holland with Boston and 'theoretically' a coal group member, said he had abstained when MPs debated the pit closure programme last October because it was 'disgraceful' that any group of employees should be treated 'in this way without consultation'. Many of these concerns had been addressed, he indicated. The soundings suggest that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may win a majority for a package which rescues fewer pits than the committee implied. He may be reluctant to pitch such controversial proposals so close to the minimum that MPs regard as acceptable, however. Mr Winston Churchill, one of the leaders of the coal group, has warned that Mr Heseltine 'cannot afford to lead the government to defeat on this issue'. Calculations of the number needed to defeat the government are complicated by the presence of the 13 Ulster unionists. Last year the abstention of eight Unionists helped to ensure that a Labour amendment was defeated in spite of a rebellion by six Tories. If all 13 unionist MPs abstained when the white paper is debated, the number of Tory rebels needed to defeat the government would rise to 18.  --------------------------------------------- How deep will the government go?  --------------------------------------------- Rebel Tory MPs indicate that saving 12 to 14 pits may secure a government majority  --------------------------------------------- PITS UNDER THREAT  --------------------------------------------- Case 1* Working practices unchanged, new technology is introduced, and job cuts accelerated  --------------------------------------------- 1  Maltby 2  Hatfield 3  Prince of Wales 4  Frickley 5  Point of Ayr 6  Bentley 7  Rossington 8  Wearmouth 9  Calverton 10 Kiveton Park 11 Bilsthorpe 12 Silverdale 13 Shirebrook 14 Markham 15 Bolsover 16 Clipstone 17 Rufford 18 Shariston 19 Bevercotes 20 Westoe 21 Easington  --------------------------------------------- Case 2* Working practices improved creating more flexible shifts, and mining regulations changed to allow job cuts  --------------------------------------------- 1  Maltby 2  Hatfield 3  Prince of Wales 4  Frickley 5  Rossington 6  Point of Ayr 7  Wearmouth 8  Silverdale 9  Bentley 10 Shirebrook 11 Bilsthorpe 12 Calverton 13 Clipstone 14 Kiveton Park 15 Rufford 16 Markham 17 Bevercotes 18 Shariston 19 Bolsover 20 Westoe 21 Easington  --------------------------------------------- * The Boyd Report ranked the 21 collieries under Case 1 and Case 2 but pointed out that the rankings did not provide the sole bases to judge economic viability  ---------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 3 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The question of signing  an agreement between Russia and the European Union [EU] on  partnership and cooperation was a focal point at a meeting  between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Greek Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias in Moscow today.    At the start of the meeting the Russian president expressed  amazement that "Russia occupies half of Europe and is still not  in Europe." The Greek minister stressed that Greece, which is  the current chairman in the EU's leading bodies, is among those  countries which actively support the idea of close ties between  Russia and the EU.    Karolos Papoulias invited Boris Yeltsin to the Greek island  of Kerkira [Corfu] 24-25 June for a meeting between the leaders  of the EU countries to conclude an agreement between Russia and  the EU. He gave an assurance that everything is ready for the  signing of this important document.</p>

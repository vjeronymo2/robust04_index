			<p>SUMMARY                                  Pyongyang has made a point of reminding Washington that linking  the resumption of bilateral high-level talks to the exchange of  special envoys by North and South Korea could jeopardize ongoing  international nuclear inspections.  The North continues to signal  its reluctance to engage the South in any substantive dialogue  beyond the bare minimum required for the convening of the DPRK-  U.S. talks.                            END SUMMARY      To draw attention to Pyongyang's stance, Vice Foreign Minister  Kang Sok-chu, head of the North Korean delegation to last  summer's high-level talks with the United States, took the  unusual step of issuing his own "press statement"(SEE NOTE) on 4  March.  Kang's statement claimed that there were no preconditions  stipulated in the 25 February DPRK-U.S. agreement for resumption  of bilateral talks.  The statement, carried in full by KCNA and  Pyongyang radio the same day, also complained that Washington is  using the exchange of envoys and IAEA inspections as  preconditions for suspension of Team Spirit and the convening of  high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, set for 21 March in Geneva.      (NOTE: A press statement is typically issued in the name of a  Foreign Ministry spokesman.  This is only the second time Kang  has been observed to issue a press statement of his own.  Kang  issued a press statement last November calling for a "package  solution" to resolve the deadlocked nuclear issue (Trends of 17  November 1993, pages 15-17)--a step that eventually led to the 25  February agreement.)      Focusing on the special envoys issue, Kang claimed in his 4 March  statement that the 25 February agreement only mentioned  resumption of working-level contacts to discuss the topic and not  realization of the exchanges.  His statement also implied that  any U.S. insistence that the envoy exchange precede resumption of  high-level talks could jeopardize IAEA inspections.  Reiterating  Pyongyang's depiction of Seoul as irrelevant to discussions of  the nuclear issue, Kang contended that the South has neither  "political wherewithal" nor "authority" to discuss the nuclear  issue.  Implying that the North will agree to exchange envoys on  non-nuclear issues only, Kang claimed that "only when" the South  stops the "unjustifiable act" of trying to push its way into the  discussion of the nuclear issue and makes a "clear switch" toward  seeking national unification can the exchange of special envoys  take place.  Kang said that "reintroducing unjustifiable  preconditions"--conditions that he claimed the United States had  tried but failed to include in the 25 February agreement--can  been seen only as "an element capable of destroying the full  implementation" of the agreement.      In a 7 March followup commentary, the party paper Nodong Sinmun  similarly cautioned Washington against creating "artificial  difficulties" by setting preconditions.  The commentary urged a  "strict observance" of unspecified "principles" set forth in last  June's DPRK-U.S. joint statement (KCNA, 7 March).      Inter-Korean Dialogue     In line with Pyongyang's posture, North  Korean media have characterized the "fourth" inter-Korean  working-level meeting on the exchange of presidential envoys,  held on 3 March, as having made no progress.  The North Korean  chief delegate introduced two new demands (Pyongyang TV, 3 March)  in addition to the previously raised issues of 1) stopping all  "nuclear exercises" and 2) renouncing the "international  cooperative system" (Pyongyang TV, 25 October 1993)--that is,  seeking cooperation with the United States and Japan to apply  pressure on Pyongyang on the nuclear issue, with attendant  references to UN-imposed sanctions.  The two new conditions are  that Seoul:      + Call off its effort to bring in Patriot missiles.      + Withdraw "remarks" that it will not "shake hands" with the  North, an oblique reference to the remarks South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam made last June.      Also suggesting that the North Korean leadership is not quite  ready to engage the South in serious discussions, Pyongyang media  have continued their harsh personal attacks on ROK President Kim.  The latest attack came in a 4 March KCNA dispatch criticizing the  remarks made by Kim to Seoul radio, which, according to KCNA,  showed that Kim is a "heinous traitor" and a "dyed-in-the-wool  flunkeyist."  The only sign so far that Pyongyang does not want  to totally foreclose the avenue of dialogue for now is the fact  that the North Korean chief delegate at the 3 March meeting  refrained from directly naming President Kim in his remarks at  the talks, as reported by North Korean media.      Background     The idea of exchanging presidential special envoys  was first advanced by the North last May to deal with "all  issues" related to national unification, most likely as a fall  back position on the eve of the first round DPRK-U.S. nuclear  talks, then slated for 2 June.  Subsequently, after much  wrangling, three preliminary meetings were held to discuss  procedural matters and agenda.  However, on the eve of a fourth  working-level contact, scheduled for 4 November, the North called  off the meeting to protest remarks by the South Korean defense  minister, who, Pyongyang claimed, had hinted at the possibility  of a preemptive strike against North Korean nuclear facilities  (Yonhap, 3 November 1993).  Moreover, even while reluctantly  agreeing to the latest round of inter-Korean contacts, Pyongyang  has still maintained that the nuclear issue must be resolved  bilaterally between the DPRK and the United States.      Implications     Although couched in tough language, Kang's  warning against "preconditions" did not rule out the possibility  that envoys may be exchanged before 21 March.  In fact,  Pyongyang's stance may be designed to test Washington's resolve  to stand behind Seoul as the latter navigates the waters of  inter-Korean dialogue.  Therefore, while Pyongyang's hardened  stance at the North-South talks may represent posturing for  bargaining, its continued personal attacks on ROK President Kim  suggests that the North is still reluctant to reach any agreement  of substance with the South at present and is proceeding with  inter-Korean talks solely to meet requirements for the resumption  of high-level DPRK-U.S. talks.

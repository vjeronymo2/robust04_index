On  29 March, Foreign Minister Han stopped over at Narita Airport on  the way from Beijing to the United States, and during the brief  stop, he met with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN correspondent at an  airport hotel. He said that "we would like to place our hope on  China's persuasive power with North Korea." Referring to his  U.S. visit, he said that he intends to meet U.S. Government  leaders to discuss the two nations' future stands toward North  Korea. He added, in particular, that the U.S.- ROK  consultations will focus on the possibility of UN Security  Council resolutions against North Korea in line with the results  of the Japanese-ROK and Chinese-ROK summit talks.    As for China's desirable role in the nuclear issue involving  North Korea, Foreign Minister Han stated: "Just like Japan,  China has an important role in this issue. We would like to  place our hopes on China's persuasive power with North Korea,  while we still do not know how effective this actually will be."    Foreign Minister Han had been visiting China as the deputy  leader of the ROK delegation led by President Kim Yong-sam, and  he is heading for the United States straightaway. After his  U.S. visit, he is scheduled to again visit Japan on 3 April and  to meet with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and other Japanese  leaders.</p>

This AD also provides an optional terminating action for the AFM revision. This amendment is prompted by reports of engine power rollback (loss of engine power) that occurred in environmental conditions involving freezing precipitation. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of multiple engine power during flight in freezing precipitation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective June 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 15, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Inc., P.O.

That action proposed to require revising the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit flight in certain freezing precipitation conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule, but suggests that the action should have been issued to require immediate compliance to reduce the traveling public's exposure to the potential risk of loss of multiple engine power during flight in freezing precipitation and possible unplanned landings. The commenter also requests that, since the AD was issued as a proposal, the time required for publication of the final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be kept to a minimum so as not to induce an additional administrative delay that would only delay compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's suggestion that the final rule be issued to require immediate compliance. At the time of issuance of the proposal, the FAA could not justify that an immediate safety of flight problem existed, especially in light of the fact that the single operator of the entire U.S. fleet of Model ATP airplanes already had added an operating restriction similar to that required by this AD to its FAA-approved operation specifications and had agreed to operate in accordance with that restriction until further corrective action could be identified and incorporated. Moreover, the operating limitation was proposed by the FAA since, at that time, the airplane manufacturer, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, and the FAA were uncertain as to the cause of the engine power rollback problem described in the preamble to the proposal. However, considerable information was available at that time to indicate that the problem was due to ice ingestion into the engines during certain meteorological conditions. That data, however, had not yet been confirmed through testing conducted by the manufacturer and the CAA. Consequently, the FAA determined that a requirement to prohibit flight in certain freezing precipitation conditions would provide an acceptable level of safety until terminating action could be identified and developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing this AD action, the FAA considered all of these items, and determined that, since the continued operational safety of the U.S. fleet could be assured during the interim, it was not impracticable to provide notice and the opportunity for public comment on the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters, the CAA and Jetstream, request that the proposed rule be revised to require establishing a life limit on the engine igniter plugs, installing a bypass duct outlet eductor, and incorporating other changes to the airplane flight manual (AFM), in lieu of the proposed AFM revision. The commenters contend that, if such interim measures are taken, an acceptable level of safety would be assured pending longer term corrective action. The commenters explain that service information has been issued that describes procedures for those actions, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;80&hyph;06, Revision 1, dated October 22, 1993, which describes procedures for placing a life limit on the engine igniter plugs and replacing those parts at staggered periods in order to improve ignition reliability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

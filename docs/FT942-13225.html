			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help EIS advance 7% to Pounds 16.2m EIS Group, the specialist engineer, yesterday said it had defied the worst recession since the second world war to report a 7 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits. The group, comprising 66 subsidiaries making products including filters, pumps and aircraft components, overcame shrinking markets with profits of Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 15.1m). The improvement was underpinned by five acquisitions during the year and full contributions from Fluidrive Engineering and Sime Industrie, the makers of fluid couplings and industrial disc brakes, purchased for Pounds 4.7m in 1992. Turnover rose 26 per cent to Pounds 253.2m (Pounds 201.6m) including Pounds 8.89m (Pounds 13.3m) from acquisitions. The profit rise was despite a sharp fall in interest receivable to Pounds 451,000 (Pounds 1.2m). Earnings per share declined from 26.8p to 24.9p following a tax charge of Pounds 5.75m (Pounds 5m). However, Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said the prospects of newly acquired subsidiaries justified proposing an increased final dividend of 9p, making a 12.3p (12p) total. Of the three divisions, fluid seals and power transmission couplings benefited most from acquisitions with operating profits increasing from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 8.2m. 'At least half the profits increase was due to contributions from new businesses,' Mr Haslehurst said. Funded by last year's Pounds 24.4m rights issue, acquisitions were dominated by the Pounds 11.2m purchase of Plenty Group, which is expected to boost the process equipment division which had profits of Pounds 2.93m (Pounds 2.06m). On prospects, Mr Haslehurst said that while considering further acquisitions EIS also wanted to concentrate on turning round its aircraft and precision engineering division, where profits fell from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 3.95m. 'It's been hit by defence cuts and the downturn in civil aviation. We're not promising any good news from that division for two years.' His caution prompted an 8p fall in the share price to 426p. COMMENT Having raised more than Pounds 42m from rights issues in the past three years, the catchphrase of the EIS board is 'proceed with caution'. Its prudence has paid off with carefully selected acquisitions which are expected to generate sales of Pounds 50m this year. These new subsidiaries should help push this year's profits ahead to Pounds 18.5m despite the prospect of flat performances from some existing businesses. With a prospective multiple of 15.5 and the possibility of further acquisitions, the shares are an attractive long-term prospect.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA currently has no packaging or labeling requirements specifically for iron-containing drug products. As prescription drug products, these iron-containing products must comply with the labeling requirements of section 503(b)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(2)) and 21 CFR part 201, as well as other applicable provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

Under this authority, CPSC has promulgated regulations establishing special packaging <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  standards for several household substances, including noninjectable animal and human iron-containing drugs (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12)) and dietary supplements (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(13)) containing a total amount of iron in a single package <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  equivalent to 250 mg or more per container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Special packaging  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> means packaging that is designed or constructed to be significantly difficult for children under five years of age to open or obtain a toxic or harmful amount of the substance contained therein within a reasonable time and not difficult for normal adults to use properly, but does not mean packaging which all such children cannot open or obtain a toxic or harmful amount within a reasonable time.'' 16 CFR 1700.1(b)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Package  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> means the immediate container or wrapping in which any household substance is contained for consumption, use or storage by individuals in or about the household and, for purposes of section 4(a)(2) of the act, also means any outer container or wrapping used in the retail display of any such substance to consumers&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' 16 CFR 1700.1(b)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For nonprescription covered products, the PPPA permits one type of package for each product to be sold without special packaging if all other package types of the product comply with the requirements. However, exempt packages must bear a conspicuous label stating: ``This package for households without young children.'' CPSC may, by regulation, prescribe a substitute statement to the same effect for packaging too small to accommodate this statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of prescription drugs, the PPPA allows for an exemption to such packaging requirements only when directed in the prescription or when requested by the purchaser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

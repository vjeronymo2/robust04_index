			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuba must remain firm and victorious because it is a  symbol for the peoples of the world, particularly Africa, said  Marcelino dos Santos, president of the People's Assembly of  Mozambique, on 27 June. Dos Santos spoke in a ceremony at the  Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization  [AALAPSO] building to mark the 19th anniversary of Mozambique's  independence. A special first-day stamp cancellation took place  during the ceremony to mark this significant occasion. Ricardo  Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP], was in attendance. Marcelino dos Santos spoke  about the future of Mozambique as well as its role in a  convulsive Africa.    [Begin Dos Santos recording in Portuguese] We can expect a  bright future because, first of all, the war that destroyed our  country is in the past; secondly, the great cancers of the  region -- apartheid in South Africa and the regime of President  Banda in Malawi -- have been eliminated. In other words, the  Mozambican people now have all the conditions to reconstruct the  economic development projects that we had already established  between 1975 and 1980 in health and education.

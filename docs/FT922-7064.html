			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Commanding officer of British forces in N Ireland visits troops Commanding presence: Lieutenant General Sir John Wilsey, commanding officer of British forces in Northern Ireland, visited troops outside Coalisland, County Tyrone, yesterday after soldiers and youths clashed on Sunday. He refused to comment on demands by the Dublin government for the withdrawal of the Parachute Regiment from the province. The call by Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign affairs minister, followed several days of unrest in the town, culminating in the confrontation on Sunday when three civilians were shot. Paratroopers were kept off the town's streets yesterday after protests over the soldiers' behaviour. Lt Gen Wilsey spoke to troops outside the town as metal detectors were used to find a machinegun stolen during the unrest.</p>

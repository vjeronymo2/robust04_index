			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Observer: Counterfeit Jean-Claude Lefranc is at it again. Having held his tongue since last year's ERM crisis, the anonymous critic - describing himself as a collective of bureaucrats and bankers - has returned to the pages of the French daily, Le Monde, firing a broadside at government economic policy. This time, Lefranc takes umbrage at the centre-right administration's allegedly sanguine view of public sector finances. His chief target - Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister - is accused of various sins including disguising the true condition of the nation's books and glossing over the escalating debt burden. Who is Lefranc? All printable suggestions to the usual address.</p>

The state taxation committee of the Republic of  Uzbekistan should take additional measures to step up the  monitoring of compliance with tax and customs legislation.    To this end, incidents of tax evasion, duties, and other  compulsory payments on a large and especially large scale; the  illegal export of goods and material resources from the  Republic; and other contraventions that harm the economic  interests of the state, must be comprehensively probed. Criminal  prosecutions must be brought in accordance with legislation,  investigations carried out and material relevant to  investigations passed to the law enforcement bodies.    2. The Procurator's Office, the National Security Service  and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of  Uzbekistan must organize the immediate and efficient  investigation of crimes concerning compliance with tax and  customs legislation, ensuring that crimes are inevitably  punished.    3. The judicial bodies of the Republic should be instructed  to ensure effective and priority examination of the  aforementioned category of criminal cases in the courts, giving  wide publicity via the media to sentences passed and decisions  returned.    4. The procuracy of the Republic of Uzbekistan should be  instructed to exercise effective scrutiny of the investigation  of material passed to the law enforcement bodies by the tax and  customs bodies and to bring in strict monitoring of the  progress, thoroughness, quality and time-scale of the  investigation of criminal cases arising from this material,  ensuring the compulsory involvement of procurators in the  hearing of these cases in the courts.    5. The procurator general, the chairman of the Supreme  Court, the minister of justice and the chairman of the state  taxation committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan must call the  heads of tax and customs bodies, as well as town and rayon  procurators and judges, to strict account, in accordance with  legislation, for red tape, an easygoing attitude or lack of  principle, as well as for breaches of the deadlines set for  cases to be heard.    The heads of the above bodies should report on the progress  of implementation of this decree and supply the government with  the necessary information once a quarter.    [Signed] I. Karimov, president of the Republic of  Uzbekistan.    [Dated] Tashkent, 18 March 1994</p>

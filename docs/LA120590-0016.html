			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AROUND THE NFL;  </P> <P> GAME WATCHED BY RECORD 41 MILLION  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers' 7-3 victory over the New York Giants was the  most-watched game in the 21 years of ABC-TV's Monday Night Football, the  network said Tuesday.  </P> <P> While its A.C. Nielsen rating was well off the record, the game was watched by  an estimated 41 million.  </P> <P> The game drew a national rating of 27.0 and a share of 42. The record was set  Dec. 2, 1985, by a Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game rated at 29.6 with a 46  share. That game, however, was watched by an estimated 39 million.  </P> <P> The 49ers' Ronnie Lott, who made two crunching hits on Giant tight end Mark  Bavaro Monday night, suffered sprained knees and possible ligament damage in  the fourth quarter. Coach George Seifert said Lott was "very suspect" for San  Francisco's game Sunday against Cincinnati.  </P> <P> "I haven't personally ruled out (playing) because I finished the game," Lott  said. "But that was mainly on adrenaline. We'll see. We'll take it day by day."  </P> <P> Gov. Rose Mofford and Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona will lead a delegation  that is to meet Friday with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to discuss the 1993  Super Bowl. Tagliabue has said he will urge NFL owners to move the Super Bowl  to another state because Arizona rejected a paid state holiday to honor Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> The Washington Redskins waived punter Ralf Mojsiejenko, a one-time Pro Bowl  player, and replaced him with former Kansas City Chief Kelly Goodburn.  </P></p>

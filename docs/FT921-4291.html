			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Greggs dips to Pounds 6m on higher turnover Recession continued to have an adverse effect on the bakery sector and this resulted in a dip in pre-tax profits at Greggs, the manufacturer and retailer of bread, confectionery and savoury products, in the 12 months to December 28. Taxable profits emerged at Pounds 6.07m (Pounds 7.02m) and were struck on turnover almost 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 95.5m (Pounds 87m). Mr Mike Darrington, group managing director, ascribed the profits fall to 'recession, increased competition, a significant escalation in rents and the progressive impact of the new food hygiene regulations'. However, Greggs opened 37 new shops and closed 10, leaving the total at 474. Earnings were down at 36.8p (41.2p) but 'in view of the group's strong cash position and dividend cover', the final pay-out is lifted to 9.375p (9p) for a total of 14.125p (13.5p).</p>

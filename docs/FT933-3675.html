			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Polish Elections: Rearguard fight over Polish sell-offs - A lool at attempts to discredit policy ahead of next week's elections PRIVATISATION is a controversial issue in the Polish election campaign and Mr Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's privatisation minister, knows he is fighting a rearguard action in the run-up to voting on September 19. Opinion polls show his pro-privatisation Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) party, which played a key role in several post-communist governments, could fail to win the 5 per cent of votes needed to enter parliament. Mr Lewandowski, a 42-year-old economist, is under attack from left wing and populist rivals anxious to discredit the KLD's privatisation record. On the campaign trail in Poznan province in western Poland he described himself as the most controversial minister in the government. 'I feel like a bomb disposal specialist,' he said, aware that almost every decision he takes could blow up in his face. 'It would be safest to do nothing,' he said at meetings last week, 'but then many of the companies which only exist because they were privatised would have disappeared long ago'. The attacks, which Mr Lewandowski labelled as 'a pack of lies of Himalayan proportions,' relate to his ministry's efforts to privatise more than a quarter of the nearly 8,500 state sector enterprises and the sale to foreign and domestic investors of 76 former state-owned companies. Formal privatisation remains bogged down by bureaucratic and political obstacles, but the explosive growth of new private companies means that more than half the Polish workforce in employment now has jobs in the private sector. Mr Lewandowski's main aim after the election is to press ahead with a mass privatisation scheme (MPP) involving the sale of shares, at a nominal charge, in more than 400 state-sector companies, to be managed by western-style investment funds with western managers. Critics of the MPP have found ammunition in reports prepared by the Supreme Chamber of Control (NIK), an official audit body which has faulted the procedures followed in the privatisation of more than 60 plants. Mr Lewandowski pointed out that the NIK was set up to assess a completely different economic system. 'Most of the criticism dates back to 1991 when we at the ministry were learning to privatise and NIK was learning how to conduct inquiries in new conditions.' But the pressure from NIK is one of the reasons why privatisation is so slow. 'I look at each deal as it would be viewed by a NIK controller,' he told employees and management during an electoral meeting at Pozmeat, a Poznan state-owned meat works which has been trying to join the private sector since 1989. Everyone at the plant wants the minister to move ahead as quickly as possible in order to face the challenge from long-established private-sector meat processors in the area. The hitch is that the former owners of one of the production units have laid a claim for compensation and some equity has to be set aside in case the claim is justified. Shares at a discount are also due by law to be sold to farmers who supply meat to the works, although the bulk of Pozmeat's suppliers were state farms now in their death throes. 'The farmers won't buy the shares but we have to make provision for them,' Mr Lewandowski patiently explained last week in the century-old plant's assembly hall. Poznan prides itself on its traditions of order, hard work and reliability, and Mr Lewandowski is hoping these will favour his cause. In 1991 the KLD won a mere 7 per cent of the national vote, but 12 per cent in Poznan. 'I'm standing here because I do a difficult job which needs to be understood and people here have a better feel for economics than elsewhere,' he told a sparsely attended election meeting at Szamotuly, north west of Poznan. Mr Lewandowski is taking no chances with a potentially explosive decision over the future of a local company, the Goplana confectionery plant. Goplana, with 10 per cent of the domestic market, has been working for more than two years towards a merger with E D and F Man, the sugar and cocoa brokers, and Elite Industries, an Israeli chocolate and food processor. Man, which says it will invest Dollars 37.5m (Pounds 24.3m) in the plant has been challenged by Nestle, which has offered to pay the Treasury Dollars 40m for control of the company and invest a further Dollars 30m. 'This is a conflict between the head and the heart,' Mr Lewandowski said, adding he would visit the plant before deciding what to do, but 'not just yet'. Whatever he decides, however, he knows he will be criticised. 'If I go with Man I will be attacked for failing to secure budget revenues. If we sell to Nestle there will be hell to pay locally,' he mused. The atmosphere is calmer at Metalplast, a metal panels producer established in the 1970s to build the new factories put up under the western-financed investment boom. Over the past four years Metalplast has started to provide commercial rather than industrial buildings. It ended last year with a 36bn zlotys (Pounds 1.2m) net profit and has voted to enter the MPP. But even here, where unemployment is low, the doubts linger. 'We went into the programme because the employees are keen to get the 15 per cent of the equity that entry will give them, and we need a modernisation loan,' said Mr Marek Szczesny, managing director. 'But we worry that the foreign fund managers will start reorganising just when we have got everything going properly.'</p>

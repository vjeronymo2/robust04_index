			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Asda under pressure SUPERMARKET group Asda retreated in busy trading as the market continued to worry about current trading. The shares finished 6 lower at 115p after 8.5m had changed hands. The decline was triggered by a weekend press report which identified Asda as the food retailer most likely to suffer as competition in retailing intensified. Talk that a broker had changed its investment advice to a hold from a buy added to the pressure. Suggestions that Goldman Sachs, which has been positive towards Asda in the past, had changed its stance was denied. Mr Philip Dorgan of Goldman said that with higher profits likely next year Asda was cheap at current levels. BET disposal The stability of BET shares in a generally weak equity market reflected relief that the business services group's high level of debt had been further reduced by the sale for Pounds 212m of Biffa, its waste disposal business. The price disappointed some optimists who had been hoping for nearer Pounds 250m, and BET shares slipped before rallying to close little changed on balance at 178p. The deal enables purchaser Severn Trent Water to achieve a key objective in the specialist waste area. It also puts a question mark over Severn's near 30 per cent stake in Caird Group, another waste company. Severn withdrew a 100p cash per share offer last year and is free to bid again in October. Chief executive Mr Roderick Paul said yesterday the board was 'reviewing the options'. Severn Trent fell to 272p but recovered on good buying to 277p for a net loss of only 3. Analyst Mr Andrew Stone of Hoare Govett said the short-term reaction was always likely to be down. 'But in the long term the acquisition buys market share and gets Severn into an area where there is good potential for development.' He advised clients to buy Severn stock. SmithKline Beecham proved one of only three firm spots in the FT-SE 100 index. The shares, after recent weakness, ended up a penny at 790p awaiting today's annual meeting. Rothmans International also bucked the trend, rising 2 to 875p on reports that it was considering buying the outstanding equity of subsidiary Dunhill Holdings. Reuters slipped 13 to 802p after bearish analysis from Nomura Research. The latter maintained its sell stance on Reuters and shaved its profits estimates for this year and next. Analyst Mr Martin Mabbutt said the stock would be helped by a strengthening dollar but it still had not bottomed out. BOC receded 13 to 545p on nervousness ahead of its half-year results due on Thursday. Allied-Lyons and Grand Metropolitan lost ground as buyers held off ahead of trading reports scheduled for this week. Allied slipped 11 to 550p and GrandMet lost 20 to 800p. Oil shares failed to escape the general decline in spite of their generally perceived strong defensive qualities. Specialists said there had been no fundamental reasons to dump stock in the sector but pointed out that crude oil prices had once more dipped below the Dollars 20 a barrel mark. Shell ran back 12 to 511p but volume was a thin 1.8m ahead of Thursday's first-quarter figures, expected to reveal net income of around Pounds 600m, compared with Pounds 816m in the same period last year. Ultramar, a penny harder at 314p, provided one of only three positive performances in the FT-SE 100 stocks as the market braced itself for tomorrow's first-quarter numbers. Worries remain that the oil group may post a loss of up to Pounds 10m for the period, but general consensus is for the company to manage a modest overall profit. The threat of further litigation leading to even heavier losses on its disastrous oil rig conversion contract upset Davy Corporation shares, which dipped 8 to 120p. Smith New Court advice to 'top-slice' holdings, meaning take profits, before the annual results on May 22 brought Courtaulds back 8 to 390p. More negative assessments from broking houses unsettled Trafalgar House and the stock lost 4 more to 253p. Hoare Govett maintains that 'back in November, the huge 15 per cent yield and plausible recovery hopes added to an attractive story, but with the shares since rising by over 75 per cent as performance has weakened, Trafalgar is now well ahead of events.' BT (formerly British Telecom) held up resolutely against a sharply weakening market, closing only 3 off at 370p after County NatWest upgraded its profits forecast and reiterated its buy recommendation. Mr Patrick Wellington at County raised his profits and dividend estimates on the back of anticipated lower tax charges. Mr Wellington said BT offers 'very strong earnings and dividend growth, excellent medium-term potential through cost reduction, fading political and regulatory risk, and a strong technical position' ahead of the sale of the government's remaining stock. Hoare Govett took a much more cautious view of the stock, however, recommending that clients move to 'underweight' in the shares. Butler Cox jumped 99 to 230p after the agreed Pounds 14.3m bid from US group Computer Sciences. A number of bank shares were unsettled by stories concerning Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group. Standard Chartered bore the brunt of the selling pressure prompted by the Brent Walker story, closing another 9 off at 370p; turnover was a low 238,000. TSB was also affected and dipped 2 1/2 to 149p but Lloyds performed well, holding at 350p. The heaviest turnover in the sector was in NatWest, which eased 5 to 324p on 1.9m. Cadbury-Schweppes declined 8 to 366p as speculation about a bond or equity issue continued to depress the shares. Dealings resumed yesterday in Sutcliffe Speakman, the activated carbon company, which was rescued from the brink of receivership by a complex refinancing plan involving the issue of 150m 10p shares. Sutcliffe shares touched 12p before making steady upward progress to close at the day's highest of 16 1/2 p, compared with last October's suspension price of 45p. Profit-taking pulled Scottish Television back 20 to 697p. The company is believed to be the only independent broadcaster able to make an uncontested bid for its franchise when the bidding opens tomorrow. It has outperformed the sector recently. TVS Entertainment held firm in spite of poor results, losing only a penny to 64p. Mr Terry Connor of Smith New Court said the stead-iness showed that 'the market has chosen to concentrate on the franchises rather than results'. WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, dropped 14 to 190p after broker James Capel cut its profits forecast for the company by Pounds 13m to 50m. Brent Walker, the leisure group, slipped sharply to close 16 down at 40p following reports that it was expected to announce a Pounds 1bn write-down of assets. The shares were also depressed by the announcement that 'although the group produced profits at the operating level, it sustained a substantial loss for the year . . . and its balance sheet at 31 December 1990 will show a major reduction in shareholders' funds'. A significant shift in the balance of forecasts of corporate profits by City analysts during April should not be over-emphasised, warns Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Analysts have tended to underestimate the depth of the UK recession and more downgrades may come in the summer. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (74).

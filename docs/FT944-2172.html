			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Advertising flag-bearer made all seem possible: Maurice Saatchi seen as industry mould-breaker Last night may have ended in humiliating defeat but there are many in the advertising business who fervently believe Maurice Saatchi must still rate as one of the industry's all-time greats. With his brother Charles he built what was in its heyday the number one advertising agency in the world. It is still probably the only advertising 'brand' that the average person - in the UK at least - could readily name. One leading member of the advertising establishment sums it up: 'Maurice has had an enormous influence as a flag-bearer for advertising. The chutzpah of the brothers made it seem that anything was possible and it could all be done from the UK. They were an enormous force for good. It's a pity it all went wrong.' Born 48 years ago to Iraqi Jewish parents, Maurice can be a reserved - even remote - and bookish figure. His chief strengths are considered to be his intellect - he is said to have taken with great ease his first-class degree from the London School of Economics - and his charm, when he wishes to exercise it, with clients. While neither of the brothers likes the limelight, Maurice has been the one to act as front man, leaving Charles to play the reclusive, volatile, creative genius. According to a former close associate, Maurice 'had clients eating out of his hand - he really did the job with companies like Procter &amp; Gamble'. But others complain that he deliberately kept himself distant from staff and all but the most important clients. One said: 'I wouldn't say he is an enigma, he isn't interesting enough for that. He's very grey - a bit of a Mr Major. Charlie is much more flamboyant.' It was Charles who was first into the business and had already established a reputation as a creative ad-man when his brother Maurice joined him from publishing to form Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in 1970. It was Charles' advert for the Health Education Council, depicting a pregnant man and the slogan Would you be more careful if it was you that got pregnant that first brought them to wider public attention. But it was Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's relationship with Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative party and, in particular, the Labour isn't working poster campaign, that turned Saatchi into a household name in the UK. Through the 1970s and 1980s the name spread across the globe as acquisitions spiralled, taking in public relations, market research and management consultancy businesses. The frenzy reached its peak with Saatchi's unconsummated approaches to Midland Bank in 1987. Maurice may have been the frontman, but close associates say it was Charles who was the one with the drive to take on the world. One said: 'The engine room was Charles, not Maurice. Charles was always the guy who pushed and pushed. Maurice responded to that but was always more laid back. Maurice was the public face but Charles was the one who had unfettered ambition.' It was the near collapse of the company, after heavy borrowings and the onset of recession, which led to a financial restructuring in 1991 and the beginning of the end for Maurice, who had by then ceded the chief executive role. Some fellow advertising professionals feel he should have called it quits at this point. 'Like a lot of merchant adventurers, he's been nowhere near as effective since his wings have been clipped,' said one. 'It could be argued that he probably should have bought his agency back and started again, or let other people get on with it and pursued his merchant adventuring elsewhere.' Maurice's main role in recent years has been to open doors for new business and keep clients - in particular Mars and British Airways - happy. But even in this function he has had his critics. According to one former associate: 'He schmoozed at the very highest level but made a point of not meeting your regular marketing director types who were desperate to say they had met the brothers.' The head of a rival group - who is highly critical of events last year when there appeared to be a campaign to oust chief executive Charlie Scott - nevertheless agrees that Maurice has earned his place in advertising history. He said: 'Maurice raised advertising in the public consciousness in a way that nobody has ever done before. He had a sense of vision and courage that few in our business have had. Agencies throughout the world used to sit around waiting to be swallowed by Americans. What Maurice did was to change those rules, probably for ever.'</p>

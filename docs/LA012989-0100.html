			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR RESPONDS TO DRUG STORY  </P> <P> It is the genuine concern of the Bell City Council to improve our city and  attack crime in our streets. Your recent article, "Drug Users Frustrate,  Frighten Merchants in Small Bell Center" (Times, Jan. 22), calls attention to a  specific problem -- drug-dealing in our city. The merchants interviewed held  our Police Department up as insensitive and powerless against this menace.  Indirectly, this is also an indictment against our city, which I take exception  to.  </P> <P> Crime is everyone's problem. The very merchants who complain about drug pushers  are the ones who can testify against this activity, yet they refuse to get  involved. Our city has a merchant watch program; not one of the complaining  merchants is a member.  </P> <P> It is true that the Bell City Council and our Police Department have received  complaints regarding this drug . . . criminal activity. We have authorized  undercover operations. We further asked for a higher profile of patrol in that  area. We have had small successes which we hope to build on. It is not true  that no action is being taken!  </P> <P> It is the Bell City Council's commitment to take any and all legal action to  diffuse and eventually eradicate the drug and gang problems that have  infiltrated our city. This can include further police action, preventive drug  education programs such as DARE, and going after the absentee landlords who  ignore our building and health codes, which lowers the living standards in our  city. A slum, Bell will never be!  </P> <P> Finally, it will never be our policy to instruct our Police Department to break  the law in order to enforce the law, as has been suggested by some residents.  This obviously creates limitations which creates frustration, but if concerned  citizens would act as the eyes and ears in helping our Police Department, our  successes would be multiplied.  </P> <P> It is my hope that these merchants will join our commercial watch program to be  full partners in eradicating these problems from our city.  </P> <P> GEORGE MIRABAL  </P> <P> Mayor of Bell  </P> <P> The Southeast / Long Beach sections of The Times welcome all viewpoints from  readers about local issues.

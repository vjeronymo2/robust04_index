			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Fed rate cut: the rationale and the risks - Michael Prowse discusses the pressures behind the move IN a perverse way, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, must have been relieved that the June employment figures released yesterday were so awful. He was under intense pressure to cut rates for two reasons: to give the lacklustre economic recovery a bit of pep ahead of November's election and thus improve President George Bush's chances of re-election, and to let treasury secretary Nicholas Brady take to next week's economic summit in Munich clear evidence of a US commitment to global economic growth. In the event, the employment numbers were bad enough to give plausibility to the Fed's claim that it eased policy in response to poor domestic economic conditions. Financial markets had expected a rise in non-farm employment of about 80,000 and no change in the unemployment rate, but employment plunged by 117,000 and the unemployment rate jumped to 7.8 per cent, its highest since 1984. The details of the report were almost uniformly gloomy. The fall in jobs partly reversed three months of modest gains and would have looked worse but for a rise in public sector employment; non-farm private jobs fell by 142,000. Manufacturing and construction employment fell 58,000 and 32,000 respectively. Wholesale trade fell by 16,000. Much of the retail sector was also weak. Services as a whole were flat. The report also followed a series of gloomy statistics pointing to flagging growth after a surprisingly robust expansion at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent in the first quarter. Signs of weakness included: Consumer confidence stalling in June after modestly rising in recent months, the level of confidence remaining far below what is normal in a vigorous recovery; The Purchasing Managers' Index falling last month to 52.8 per cent, remaining above 50 per cent and indicating that manufacturing is not yet contracting but nowhere near the level expected after a year of faltering recovery; Sales of existing homes, following weakness in housing starts, falling more than 5 per cent in May to register their fourth consecutive monthly decline; and New orders for manufactured durable goods falling 2.1 per cent in May, following declines of 1.8 per cent in April and 2.1 per cent in March. Growth in the first quarter was buoyed by a strong rise in consumer spending just after Christmas. After a lag, this prompted higher industrial production and a small rise in employment. However, the stimulus from consumers was temporary and the risk is that the economy has now entered another mini-downturn. The Fed is easing to prevent such a downturn from gathering momentum. It cited the 'uneven progress of the recovery' and also drew attention to 'sustained weakness in credit and money growth' and 'continued movement toward price stability'. The seven Fed governors voted unanimously for the half-point discount rate cut to 3.0 per cent. This was the first cut since December and the seventh since the recession began in July 1990. The discount rate is now at its lowest level since the summer of 1963. The Fed then signalled a half-point cut to 3.25 per cent in the overnight federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend to one another. Commercial banks responded quickly, cutting their prime lending rates from 6.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent. The prime rate influences the cost of a range of consumer and business loans. The Fed's move will be seen by some as a decisive reaction to renewed signs of economic fragility. It is well aware that, had it cut rates more quickly last year, it might have prevented a weakening of the economy in the fourth quarter, when growth drooped to a disappointing 0.4 per cent at an annual rate. Policymakers outside the US, however, may wonder if the Fed has acted rashly. After all, the economy has been advancing for four quarters, albeit slowly. Few if any forecasters expect output to fall. In a sluggish upturn, the economic statistics are likely to be choppy: too much should not be read into a single month's disappointing figures. And while inflationary pressures are abating, the maturity structure of US interest rates hardly suggests financial markets are confident that inflation is licked. Even after the surge in bond prices yesterday that followed the Fed's announcement, the yield on 30-year bonds was still 7.6 per cent, more than four percentage points higher than short-term rates. The long-run impact of the Fed's rate cut will depend greatly on the response in bond markets. If the Fed is correctly responding to genuine weakness, long rates should fall further, with beneficial effects on sectors such as housing and consumer durables. But there is a risk that the Fed has made the classic central banking error of easing policy when the economy is already capable of recovering under its own steam. If this proves the case, much of the blame will lie at the White House's door.</p>

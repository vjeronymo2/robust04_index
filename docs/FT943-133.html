			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sherwood cuts losses to Pounds 88,000 Sherwood Computer Services made a loss of Pounds 88,000 in the first half of the year after redundancy costs of Pounds 412,000 and a contribution of Pounds 300,000 from an investment which has now been disposed of. The results were in line with the board's and market expectations. The share price was down 4p at 101p. The company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 541,000 for the same period in 1993 but was Pounds 2m in the red at the year-end. It has restructured significantly over the past year, concentrating on software and services for the London insurance market, life assurance and pensions and investment services. With the sale of Consort Data, it has withdrawn from the investment management software market. Turnover was Pounds 11.9m compared with Pounds 11.8m in the first half last year. Net debt has been reduced to Pounds 1.9m compared with Pounds 3.4m at December 31. Fully diluted earnings per share came in at 1.5p compared with 3.4p. The dividend is passed (1.75p). Mr David O'Brien, chairman, said results from the life and pensions venture Sherwood International had been disappointing as many companies had yet to decide on their future systems. City Deal Services, however, offering an execution only stockbroking service, had 40,000 customers and was proving successful. He said the restructuring was complete and the directors were confident of further recovery, adding that Sherwood would be dependent on increased sales towards the end of the year to meet its targets.</p>

Lieutenant Colonel Nukri Gogitidze has been  appointed head of the Department for Coordinating Law  Enforcement Bodies.    [Chachua]Excuse my asking you a not very tactful  question: Won't your service become yet one more bureaucratic  link in the state structure?    [Gogitidze] The nature of the question is clear: There is  hunger, destruction, and poverty in the country and here we have  one more service, one more parasite. Incidentally, this is not  an entirely new structure. Those tasks that are today being  entrusted to this service were previously fulfilled by different  departments and groups; these have now been concentrated into  one.    [Chachua]Crime in the republic and the capital have  reached a peak. Can one hope that the activities of your  department will enable the fast rising "curve" to take a  downswing?    [Gogitidze] We are called upon to coordinate the work of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], the Ministry of Security  [MB], and the Procurator's Office in the business of the  struggle against crime and to restore law and order in the  republic. I should point out that the leaders of these power  structures, as they are now referred to, are professionals who  are devoted to their job and they are sure to achieve success.  The first serious steps aimed at strengthening law and order  have already been taken. However, much work lies ahead. The  wave of violence perpetrated by criminal bands could lead to the  "Lebanonization" and "Somalization" of the situation in Georgia  and to the establishment on its territory of the rule of the  criminal world and the most dreadful tyranny and "bandocracy."    [Chachua]A boring question comes to mind here: Do you  think that order can be established in Georgia only with the  help of Russia?    [Gogitidze] I am opposed to someone else establishing order  in our country. This is our mess and we have to clean it up  ourselves. We have to strengthen the combat structures of the  MVD and the MB and I am certain that, with the support of the  public, they will cope by themselves.    However, I believe that we will not be able to resolve  questions of military organizational development, the protection  of our borders, and so forth without Russia's help. Moreover,  Russia, as the successor to the former Soviet Union and as a  neighboring power, which, during the last few centuries, has  played and continues to play an important role in the life of  Georgian society and the Georgian state, is morally obliged to  become the guarantor of the stabilization of the situation in  Georgia.    It will be very difficult to resolve the problems that have  accumulated without recognizing and understanding the role of  the Georgian state in the Caucasus and surrounding regions.  Georgia is the key to the Caucasus and whoever wishes to  acquire economic and political dominance in this region should  recognize the value of the role played by Georgia and draw the  appropriate conclusions. After all, it is not by chance that  the residence of the tsar's governor- general was in Tiflis and  that Tbilisi was the administrative center of the Transcaucasus.    In connection with Georgia joining the CIS, mutual relations  with our northern neighbor are undergoing changes. The presence  of Russian military contingents -- air force and naval bases and  air defense units -- on the territory of Georgia is essential  for Russia.    [Chachua]Do you think that we should agree to the  temporary deployment of a limited contingent of Russian troops  on the territory of Georgia?    [Gogitidze] Yes, but under the following conditions. The  Russian side should render assistance in the organizational  development of the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces. It is  essential to restore or create an air defense system that will  be used in the joint interests of both states. A start should  be made on forming the republic's naval forces with the help of  units and subunits of the Black Sea Fleet. The Republic of  Georgia Air Force should start to be trained on the Russian  Federation Air Force base. Specialists in all branches of the  Armed Forces should be trained in military educational  institutions in Russia and other CIS countries. The structure  and stationing location of Russian troop units should be changed  and also the name itself of this contingent; they should be  given the appropriate status and all this should be legalized by  treaties and so forth.    Decisive and severe measures should be taken in the sphere  of  guaranteeing national security, protecting borders, the struggle  against crime, and ensuring law and order. It would be possible  to accelerate the implementation of these measures with Russia's  help.    In order to implement these measures, it is necessary to  resolve a number of painful problems in the political sphere,  something which is difficult without the active interference of  Russia. However, close economic cooperation should not mean the  violation of the sovereign rights of an independent state.    If Russia wishes to have an equal and reliable ally in the  Caucasus region for a long time, with whose help it will be able  to exert an influence upon processes taking place in the Near  and Middle East, that is to say, if, as a world power, it does  not wish to renounce its responsibility for the fate of the  world, it should render assistance to Georgia in the  aforementioned spheres.</p>

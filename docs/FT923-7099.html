			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Cuba 'will sign' N-treaty CUBA said yesterday it was ready to sign a Latin American treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons in the region, if other countries there did the same, Reuter reports from Havana. Mr Pedro Nunez Mosquera, director of multilateral affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, told the news agency Prensa Latina: 'We are ready to sign for the sake of Latin American unity.' He said Cuba had remained outside the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty as it did not want to renounce the right to possess arms needed for its defence. This position was justified because of a policy of hostility by the US against the island and the continuing presence of a US military base in eastern Cuba at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

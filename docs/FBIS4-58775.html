			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--The Arab League Council's  emergency session at the permanent delegate-level, called by  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa to find a quick solution to the  military crisis in Yemen, opened at the Arab League General  Secretariat today.    As Yemen is the current chairman of the Arab League, Yemeni  Charge d'Affaires Ahmad Shahir Sayf opened the meeting by  thanking Egypt for calling this meeting to stop the bloodshed in  Yemen, halt the military operations, and invite the concerned  parties to sit at the negotiating table instead of arguing with  guns.    The Yemeni official said he finds it very difficult to  continue chairing this meeting as a Yemeni citizen whose heart  is bleeding because of the developments in Yemen. He announced  that he had relinquished the chairmanship to another country.    After the Yemeni delegate's speech, Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid announced Ambassador Nayif  Sa'ud al-Qadi, Jordan's permanent delegate to the Arab League,  would chair the emergency meeting, being next alphabetically.    Opening the session, Ambassador Nayif al-Qadi said: I would  like to express deep sorrow and pain at the situation in a  country we love. He expressed his regret that the Yemeni  leaders had abandoned dialogue and reason and resorted to guns.    He added: We do not take what is happening in fraternal  Yemen lightly, because the developments will not be confined to  Yemen and its people. Their repercussions will affect us all.  No Arab country will be removed from what has happened and the  bleeding wound will expand if we do not hasten to bind it.    Al-Qadi noted that Jordan was among the first parties to  seek  to mediate to help resolve the Yemeni crisis. He said, with  help from the Omani brothers, his country managed to broker the  Pledge and Accord Document which was signed in the Jordanian  capital by Yemeni leaders in the presence of several Arab  leaders. The Yemenis wanted this document as a means out of the  crisis.    He added that mediation did not cease after the signing of  this agreement, and noted the efforts of Egypt, the United Arab  Emirates, and the Arab League, which all sought to provide  controls to prevent military friction and avert what we had  expected and feared.    He called on the Arab League Council to work in its  emergency  session to adopt a practical and objective stand that would help  stop the bloody fighting in Yemen and preserve the fraternal  Yemeni people's interests.    Concluding his speech, the Jordanian delegate thanked Egypt  for calling this emergency meeting out of concern for the Yemeni  people's interests.    After his speech, the Arab League Council held a closed  session to discuss an Egyptian proposal to send Arab forces to  maintain peace in Yemen and to carry out measures guaranteeing  an end to the fighting.</p>

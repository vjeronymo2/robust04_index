			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL REPORT: SPRING INTO FALL;  </P> <P> ECOWEAR;  </P> <P> EARTH ANGELS IN ENGLAND  </P> <P> For 25 top London designers, fashion awareness is increasingly about much more  than where to hang a season's hemline.  </P> <P> Coordinated by Arabella Pollen and designer/retailer Joseph Ettedgui, the group  is organizing a celebrity fashion show May 24 at London's Natural History  Museum to support the Friends of the Earth Rainforest campaign.  </P> <P> "Actually, the Friends of the Earth Rainforest group approached us," said  Pollen, "and it's taken off from there. Certainly, I was aware of the problems  before I became involved in this protest but I have to say I was ignorant. I've  learned a lot, and through my own heightened awareness I've made other people  think."  </P> <P> The group she and Ettedgui have organized includes Joe Casley Hayford, Jasper  Conran, Bruce Oldfield, Betty Jackson, Anthony Price, Artwork, Caroline  Charles, David Fielden, Edina Ronay, John Galliano, John Richmond, Katharine  Hamnett, Marion Foale, Monica Chong, Paul Smith, Richard James, Victor  Edelstein, Vivienne Westwood and Workers for Freedom.  </P> <P> Each will present selections from their fall/winter collections in an informal  show around the stuffed dinosaur in the museum's great hall. Everyone has  offered to design an outfit with a rain-forest theme, which will be auctioned  at some point to raise even more money for the cause.  </P> <P> Ettedgui and Pollen, who are trying to persuade top international models to fly  in for the show, have come up with a back-to-back limited edition commemorative  T-shirt, with all the profits going to Friends of the Earth.  </P> <P> Even before becoming officially involved in the Friends of the Earth movement,  several British designers were making their ecological sentiments known. Betty  Jackson used intarsia knit maps on the backs of long knit coats -- her tribute  to the Brazilian rain forest -- and hat designer Stephen Jones designed Mylar  caps printed with satellite weather "one world" maps.  </P> <P> Last season, Joe Casley Hayford embroidered his clothes with autumn leaves. And  then there's militant Katharine Hamnett. Since 1985 she has used slogan  T-shirts to express her views on everything from acid rain to pollution to the  killing of whales. At a fashion reception hosted by Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher at 10 Downing Street several seasons ago, Hamnett showed up wearing a  T-shirt which read: "58 Percent Don't Want the Pershing," her comment on  Thatcher's decision to allow American missiles on British soil.  </P> <P> On June 14, she will be in New York to attend a conference at the United  Nations to discuss these and other fashion/environmental issues.  </P></p>

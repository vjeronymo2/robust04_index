			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet finalises summit agenda MR JOHN MAJOR began finalising details of the agenda for next month's European Community summit in Edinburgh with cabinet colleagues yesterday before touring EC countries to win allies next week. The prime minister, who chaired a meeting of virtually the entire cabinet, is expected to begin consulting with other European leaders on Monday over an ambitious agenda that Downing Street said would be dominated by the UK's priorities for the EC. But it is likely to provoke fresh rows among the community's members. Dispute is expected over the future financing of the EC. Mr Major believes he can win backing from Germany and France for his opposition to proposals for increases put forward by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president. The task of finding a package of changes to the Maastricht treaty to satisfy Danes will also dominate the Edinburgh summit. Britain, meanwhile, wants a clearer definition of subsidiarity - the principle of decisions being taken at the lowest appropriate level. Downing Street expressed confidence that headway would be made at Edinburgh but appeared keen not to raise expectations. Officials indicated that Britain does not want discussion at Edinburgh of how economic policies could be co-ordinated to boost growth. They said that the best way to help job creation would be a deal on in negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Others items on the agenda will include the enlargement of the EC and the completion of the European single market. The Netherlands has been pencilled in as Mr Major's first destination. He is expected to visit all other EC countries over the next few weeks. Although Mr Major realises he faces an uphill task in reaching deals at Edinburgh, officials at Downing Street stressed that such a tour was usually organised by the country holding the EC presidency.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark weathers high street slump with rise to Pounds 31.5m C&amp;J CLARK, the largest shoe manufacturer in the UK and one of the country's six largest private companies, weathered the high street retailing slump to post a rise in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds 31.52m compared with a previous Pounds 30.32m. The higher profits, which came on an increase in turnover to Pounds 605.79m(Pounds 599.93m), was attributed by the company to a retail-led marketing strategy it has recently adopted. Profits from the core footwear manufacturing and retailing businesses, including Clarks Shoes, K Shoes and Ravel, improved by over 50 per cent. The company had previously tended to separate manufacturing and retail activities. However, three years ago it started to let retailing considerations take the lead, which resulted in more interesting shoes in the shops and prices that were more in line with what customers were willing to pay, it said. Replacing the former shop names of new shops with the Clark's namehad improved business significantly and the group's new shops in the UK were strong contributors to profits. The group was less fortunate in its US operations, where the strong dollar made it difficult to export there. Exports comprise 10 to 15 per cent of overall sales. It also has quite a substantial amount of dollar-denominated capital tied up in the US business which becomes negative when converted into sterling, it said. Property profits also made alower contribution of Pounds 8m last year compared with Pounds 13m in 1989. The buy-in of its shares cost the group Pounds 40m last year, which pushed up borrowings 'but not to an uncomfortable extent,' the group said. Earnings per share were maintained at 23.8p.</p>

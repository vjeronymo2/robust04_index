			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Generale des Eaux Not long ago Generale des Eaux seemed to cast its substantial shadow across the UK water industry. A number of smaller water-only companies still fall within its empire. But fears of a French invasion proved unfounded. As its planned Ffr3bn-4bn rights issue shows, Generale has its hands full elsewhere. Proceeds will cover perhaps three years capital investment in SFR, which holds one of two digital cellular phone licences in France. Construction and property interests have been mauled by recession at a time of rising capital spending, so gearing will be well over 100 per cent even after the capital increase. Generale will have little incentive to look again at the UK's privatised water companies after takeover restrictions are lifted at the end of next year. The attraction to any potential bidder will depend on price limits set by the regulator for the second half of the decade. Even on the most optimistic assumptions, though, water bills will not rise fast enough to cover investment. That could be an effective poison pill against a predator facing substantial calls on capital elsewhere. Nor does Generale need a UK water acquisition for earnings growth. Its investment in telecoms should start to pay off in the middle of the decade and lower French interest rates will cut the cost of servicing its debt mountain. Its existing French and international water interests look capable of delivering decent profits growth, without the bother of UK-style regulation.</p>

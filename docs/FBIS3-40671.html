			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Prem Kumar: "The Dunkel Dangers"] </F>   [Text] Some areas of the Dunkel text which represent the  kernel of the just-concluded Uruguay Round come into conflict  with India's Constitution, especially the Directive Principles.  Thus, the domain of domestic policy is being subjected to  international scrutiny because of which conflicts may arise  between our socio-economic and political objectives and  international commitments. A conflict may also arise in exercise  of jurisdiction by our judicial bodies and panels and  authorities being set up under the Dunkel text where domestic  policy issues are involved.    The provisions of the Dunkel text regarding subsidies are an  important area of possible conflict. While developing countries  with per capita income of less than $1,000 are not required to  phase out export subsidies, there is no relaxation in their  favour as regards nullification or serious prejudice. In any  event, in considering the legal aspect, we should consider also  the situation when the threshold income has been reached.    Now, while both in the case of manufactures and agricultural  products subsidies for disadvantaged regions are allowed, they  have to be given to all enterprises located there. No exemption  is allowed for assistance given to a section of the people.  Article 46 of the Indian Constitution enjoins upon the State the  duty of promoting the economic interests of the weaker sections  of the people, particularly of scheduled castes and scheduled  tribes. In our programmes of economic assistance, there is a  special dispensation in favour of backward classes, scheduled  castes and tribes with respect to interest rates, margins, grant  elements, etc. We also know that in certain industries mostly  persons of these categories participate. In fact, some castes  are known by their profession or industry affiliation such as  julaha (weaver). It will be possible for another  country to argue that goods exported by such industries  (handlooms, carpets) or from such enterprises (National Textile  Corporation) carry more than 5 per cent subsidy, causing  `serious prejudice' to its interests and are actionable. Thus,  there could be a conflict between the objectives of Article 46  and these provisions of the Dunkel text.    In the same vein, supply of agricultural inputs such as  fertiliser, at subsidised prices to farmers other than poorer  ones defined in income terms, will attract the provisions of the  Dunkel text regarding commitment for reduction of domestic  support.    While regional development programmes are permissible under  the text, insistence upon inclusion of criteria mentioned in  Section 1, Article 8(b)(iii) would exclude some of the regions,  possibly North-East, which are covered by special programmes  such as freight subsidy. Similarly, our public distribution  system and distribution of essential goods at subsidised prices  is partly designed to reduce inequalities in income and various  facilities (c.f. Article 38 of the Constitution). But these are  frowned upon by the Dunkel text.    The second area for focusing attention is Article 48 of the  Constitution. "The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture  and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall,  in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the  breeds...of cows and calves and other cattle." There may be  hindrance in the achievement of this objective by the State due  to proposed provisions regarding patents. (Article 27 of Annex  III to Final Act on IPRS). Since no exception is being made for  pesticides and agricultural inputs and, even for plant varieties  and animals, a regime of patents of sui generis  system is to be established, there can be problems in making  available the genetic material and propagation of improved  breeds for general distribution to farmers. Prices of  agricultural inputs are very likely to rise due to the  introduction of product patents in these areas (the argument is  only about its extent) and their use of consumption which is  strongly correlated to prices, will be adversely affected and in  turn this will affect agricultural production unless farmers are  compensated by corresponding adjustment in output prices.  Difficulty may also arise in multiplying and supplying new  breeds of plants and animals which would negate Article 48.    The Multilateral Trade Organisation (Annex IV to Final Act)  will be something of a supranational body. It would adjudicate,  enforce and punish. Since the text brings within the ambit of  various agreements domestic policies also, there is potential  for conflict of jurisdiction. Our courts testing the actions  under our laws and Constitution may hold them valid (e.g., in  the case of foreign providers of services) while MTO may  consider them actionable and authorise retaliation.    It should be noted that so far "national treatment" concept  was applicable to goods only (Article 3, GATT). The concept is  now being extended to entities and persons of another country in  one's territory. Thus the Agreement on Trade in Services (Annex  II to Final Act--Articles VI, XVII, etc.) extends to aliens, a  right available to citizens, since many services can be provided  only by establishment in the territory of host country.  Restriction on extent of equity holding, aggregate foreign  investment, limitation on number of natural persons of country  providing services, etc., may not be possible in scheduled  sectors (Art. XVI ibid). The jobs for citizens and national  control would thus be affected. It will not be permissible to  restrict transmission of data to the country of providers of  service and their being processed there. Measures which restrict  or require specific types of legal entity through which a  service provider may provide a service, shall not be maintained.  What happens to areas restricted to cooperative sector or  small-scale sector under our Industrial Policy Resolutions?    Lastly, many of the policies covered by various agreements  are within the jurisdiction of states or are concurrent  subjects. No doubt Article 253 of the Constitution allows  Parliament to legislate in such areas also to give effect to an  international treaty. However, since many basic policies of  state governments are involved they must be consulted before any  commitment is made with respect to such areas. A ratification by  Parliament of the emerging agreement and consultation with  states should be necessary, contrary to past practice, as no  such wide-ranging international agreement affecting national and  sub-national policies and of concern to many sections of the  people has been concluded before. After all, it will be possible  to give effect to many of the provisions of the Dunkel text  through legislation only.</p>

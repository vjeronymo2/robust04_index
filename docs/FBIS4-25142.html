			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the operation of the Sino-Japanese  undersea optical fiber cable communications system in December  1993, a contract to build a Sino-Korean undersea optical fiber  cable communications system, the second international undersea  optical fiber cable system in China, was formally signed in  Beijing recently. This system will be built in cooperation with  the directorate general of telecommunications under the Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunications, the telecommunications company  of the ROK, and the Alcatel company of France. To satisfy the  increasingly higher international communications demands of  China and the ROK, the directorate general of telecommunications  under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the ROK  telecommunications company decided to build a Sino-Korean  undersea optical fiber cable communications system. It is  reported that this system links China's Qingdao with the ROK's  Taean, and its total length is about 550 km.</p>

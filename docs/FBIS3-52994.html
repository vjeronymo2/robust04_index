Riak Mashar, leader of a breakaway group of the Sudan  People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said the Islamic fundamentalist  government was also massing troops for a new offensive against  the mainly Christian and animist southern rebels.    Fighting reportedly erupted between rebels and government  forces near the Ugandan border last week, but details were  unclear.    Riak told AFP that John Garang, chief of the mainstream SPLA  faction, was preparing an attack despite a new agreement between  the rival rebel factions to conduct joint negotiations with  Khartoum. "Garang is planning an attack on our positions at  Lafun, north of Torit, in the next day or so," Riak told AFP.  Torit, a town near Sudan's southern border with Uganda, has  often been used by Garang as his field headquarters. "This is  unfortunate, and I am still hoping that the ceasefire will  hold," Riak said.    A spokesman for Garang's group, however, denied the  allegation. "It is not true," said Philip Lomodong, the  faction's east African representative. Riak and Garang said  they had agreed after talks in Nairobi last week with  representatives of regional governments to renew a ceasefire  declared in October.    Riak, however, said Garang's group had broken the ceasefire  only a week after it was agreed, and had captured two of his  positions at Iktos and Chikudum in October. There had been no  other major fighting between the two rival SPLA groups since  October, he said.    Riak said the government was "building up its forces for a  new offensive" and was transporting troops to the south in five  barges on the Nile. "We are expecting heavy fighting soon," he  said.    Riak's SPLA United and Garang's SPLA last week agreed to  negotiate jointly with Khartoum after talks here with foreign  ministers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, members of  the regional group the Inter-governmental Authority on Drought  and Development (IGAAD).    The rebels are demanding self-determination for the vast,  undeveloped south, where UN officials say a million people need  food aid. But they might delay a proposed referendum on  establishing an independent southern state if Khartoum agreed to  interim arrangements, rebel officials said.    Philip O'Brien, head of the UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan,  said an outbreak of fighting between rebel and government forces  would disrupt aid and could spark a huge humanitarian crisis.    Sudanese government representatives who also met the IGADD  ministers in Nairobi last week reiterated Khartoum's refusal to  allow the south to secede.    Riak's faction split from Garang's group in 1991 because  Garang rejected calls for an independent south, insisting that  he could break Moslem domination without dividing Sudan. But  Garang has since changed his position to favour a referendum.  "We are working to form a joint delegation to the peace talks  with Khartoum which we hope will soon be convened by the IGADD,"  Riak said.    "We have been fighting amongst ourselves on the question of  self- determination," Riak said. "Now that Garang has changed,  we are urging the international community to put pressure on  Khartoum so that new talks can be held."    Theoretically the next step in the process to end Sudan's  decade-long war is a new round of IGAAD-mediated talks. But  African diplomats expressed fears that Khartoum, whose relations  with the West are strained, would instead mount an offensive.    Fighting between rebel and government forces, and between  the  rival rebel factions, has often stopped aid from reaching the  inaccessible southern swamplands, UN officials said.    "The humanitarian situation is appalling," Riak said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative or refueling emission control system by component addition, deletion, or substitution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify the vehicles selected for testing and shall not perform any emission tests on vehicles selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are documented in the manufacturer's vehicle assembly and inspection procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For 1984 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, Selective Enforcement Audit testing, and Production Compliance Audit testing in accordance with &sect;86.090&hyph;22(c)(1), to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with &sect;86.090&hyph;22(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than will be possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine or 4,000 miles on the vehicle under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply information to establish such an alternative minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use heavy-duty engines or light-duty trucks. In determining likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine or vehicle performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Prior to performing emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission-data engine corresponding to the configuration specified in the test order. Prior to performing emission testing on an SEA test vehicle, the manufacturer may accumulate on each vehicle a number of miles equal to the greater of 4,000 miles, or the number of miles the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission-data vehicle corresponding to the configuration specified in the test order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Service or mileage accumulation must be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal production vehicles. This service or mileage accumulation must be consistent with the new vehicle break-in instructions contained in the applicable vehicle owner's manual, if any.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The manufacturer shall accumulate service at a minimum rate of 16 hours per engine or mileage at a minimum rate of 300 miles per vehicle during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The first 24-hour period for service or mileage accumulation shall begin as soon as authorization checks, inspections and preparations are completed on each engine or vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate does not apply on weekends or holidays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the manufacturer's service or mileage accumulation target is less than the minimum rate specified (16 hours or 300 miles per day), then the minimum daily accumulation rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's service or mileage accumulation target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Service or mileage accumulation shall be completed on a sufficient number of test engines or vehicles during consecutive 24-hour periods to assure that the number of engines or vehicles tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test vehicles or engines after selection for testing, nor shall the Administrator allow deletion of any test vehicle or engine from the test sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer, and approved by the Administrator before any test vehicle or engine maintenance or deletion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

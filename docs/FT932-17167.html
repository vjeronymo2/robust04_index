			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Japan cut in vehicle exports to EC angers industry JAPAN and the EC agreed yesterday on a 9.4 per cent cut in Japanese car and light commercial vehicle exports to the EC in 1993, after several months of tough but intermittent negotiations. The accord, although meaning that Japan would ship 113,000 fewer vehicles to the EC this year, provoked a hostile reaction from Europe's motor industry. It was also portrayed as disappointing by the Japanese vehicle industry. The European vehicle manufacturers' association claimed that the deal, reached after three days of talks in Tokyo, underestimated the depth of the decline in the new car market facing Europe this year - and left European makers to bear this while Japanese market share increased. It maintains that, even based on the European Commission's cautious forecast of a 6.5 per cent fall in car sales in the Community this year, Japan's total market share share would rise to 12.5 per cent from 11.3 per cent last year. This includes Japanese cars produced at plants in Europe. The agreement was based on a vaguely worded understanding, entitled 'Elements of consensus', reached two years ago between the Commission and the Japanese government. Japan's automotive industry has maintained that it was never bound by a formal limit. This understanding provides for an annual consensus on the acceptable level of Japanese vehicle sales in the EC during each year of its transition to a completely open market by the end of the decade. Japan yesterday agreed that exports of EC-bound cars and light commercial vehicles should be reduced to 1.089m units from 1.202m in 1992 , based on the expectation that EC vehicle registrations will fall this year to 13.03m units from 13.94m in 1992. The agreed export figure does not include vehicles made at Japanese so-called 'transplant' factories in the EC, or Japanese exports from third countries. Transplant sales in the EC, which reached 320,000 last year and are expected to increase by a further 150,000 to 200,000 in 1993, were said by the Commission to have been taken into account. This statement is sure to cause considerable concern to the UK government which, because of Britain's large stake in Japanese car transplant production, was under the impression that it had secured Brussels' acceptance that cars produced at transplants would be regarded as European. However, the Brussels-based Association des Constructeurs Europeenes d'Automobiles (Acea) said a market downturn of at least 10 per cent was expected. It 'therefore expects the Commission to take full account of any decrease beyond the agreed forecast, and to revise the total Japanese import volume accordingly'. In the first two months of this year, Europe's largest national market, Germany, has been 25 per cent below year-ago levels, France 40 per cent and Spain more than 40 per cent. The total west European market was 20.6 per cent down. An EC official close to the talks called the agreement 'a defensible result'. Despite the overall drop in Japanese imports, the agreement provides for Japanese exports to France this year to rise by 12 per cent to 77,300 units, those to Italy by 17.5 per cent to 42,900 units, to Spain by 11 per cent to 34,200 and Portugal by 13.6 per cent to 41,500. The UK will see the biggest rise among the five formerly protected markets, of 20 per cent to 202,800 units. Editorial Comment, Page 13 VW accused of luring away Opel staff, Page 17</p>

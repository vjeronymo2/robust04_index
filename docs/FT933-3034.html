			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Tougher EC line urged on aid for steel: Germans say Commission is compromising over proposals for subsidies discipline THE German steel industry said yesterday that action being considered by the European Commission to enforce cuts in subsidies for state-owned steelmakers in Europe was not tough enough. It said negotiations on a rescue package for the European steel industry would fail if the Commission backed proposals from public producers in Spain and Italy which did not lead to real cuts in overcapacity. 'There are signs that the Commission is compromising too much and departing from its earlier principles to impose strict discipline over subsidies,' Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, said yesterday. He said he would ask the German government to oppose any agreement on subsidies if it amounted to 'window-dressing'. Mr Vondran's warning followed the Commission's proposal, outlined on Tuesday, for the restructuring of the Spanish steel industry which EC industry ministers will be asked to approve on Monday. Under the plan, Spanish authorities will be asked to find a private investor to keep open a mini-mill in Sestao, in the Basque country. The plan also foresees the closure of another Basque plant, at Anzio, by mid-1995, 18 months ahead of schedule. But German private steel producers say such an agreement does not go far enough in curbing subsidies for state-owned producers and in forcing cuts in categories with overcapacity. 'Private investors cannot be used as scapegoats to rescue ailing state-owned steel plants,' Mr Vondran said. He also warned against steelmakers inflating production levels before offering capacity cuts and excluding social rehabilitation payments to scale down subsidies which they are asked to reduce. German private steelmakers want Spain and Italy to undertake half the closures needed to meet the restructuring targets set by the Commission and which aims to cut 30m tonnes of crude steel-making capacity. They are offering to cut 5m tonnes of crude steel capacity this year but refusing to offer larger cuts unless a clear agreement on state subsidies for state-owned producers is reached. The EC timetable for such an agreement has been delayed several times this year after fruitless negotiations with state producers in Europe, particularly in Italy. An overall decision on subsidies, intended for September, has been postponed to November.</p>

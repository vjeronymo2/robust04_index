			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has again  threatened to pull out of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty  (NPT) should Washington continue pressuring Pyongyang over its  nuclear development program.    North Korean Ambassador to Moscow Son Song-pil made the  threat at a recent press meeting, saying the International  Atomic Energy Agency's report on its "unsatisfactory" inspection  of North Korea's facilities and the failed Pyongyang-Washington  talks have heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, NAEWOE  PRESS, Seoul's official North Korea watcher, reported Thursday  in quoting Radio Moscow.    Washington has pressed for strong action and Pyongyang  should  now adopt countermeasures, Son was quoted as saying. North  Korea "could carry out its decision to withdraw from the NPT  last year."    Son reiterated that the nuclear dispute can be settled only  through North Korean-U.S. dialogue, saying the American threat  to use force poses a grave obstacle, NAEWOE reported.</p>

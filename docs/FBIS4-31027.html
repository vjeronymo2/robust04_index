			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Part two of a five-part article by Alexandru I. Mihail: </F> "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"]    [Text] The progressive increase of the interest rate  applied to the bank loans granted over 1991-1992 from 10 percent  to about 70 percent contributed, along with other factors, to a  drop in the production of goods and services, which could have  absorbed the cash available on the market. Such an increase of  the interest rate indirectly caused inflation, as its weight in  companies' spending rose to 30-50 percent. This compelled the  companies to increase the prices of the products or services  they offered.    The idea of increasing the interest rate over the first  years  of the transition period went completely wrong. Instead of  restraining inflation, the high interest rates made it grow even  faster. Besides artificially increasing the prices of products  and services, the growth of the interest rate discouraged  activity in industry, agriculture, services, and tourism,  precisely the branches from which a revival was expected, which  would have strengthened the national currency. The increase of  the interest rate did not achieve the expected results in the  case of the nonprofitable or low-efficiency companies either, as  they proved to be unable to pay the higher interest rates but  still did not go bankrupt, continuing to produce at higher or  lesser losses. The increase of the interest rate was not  something to be recommended at all within the circumstances of  an economy torn by a decades-long structural crisis. The  restructuring of economy should have been stimulated rather than  blocked by the loan and interest rate policy. This could have  been achieved by applying strongly differentiated interests.  Thus, investments should have been protected, including the  building of blocks of apartments. The loans granted to this  purpose, including their interest, could have been easily  regained by selling the apartments to the population.  Protection should have been granted, by a similar loan policy,  to the light and food industry, generally to the small  manufacturers, and especially those in agricultural production.  To compensate for all this, very high interest rates could have  been introduced in commercial activity, where under the  circumstances of a very rapid circulation of goods, encompassing  just 30 days, a 180-percent annual interest rate actually would  represent merely 15 percent. This solution is still valid today.    High interest rates may be applied in economically highly  developed countries, in which the companies own large financial  resources. However, under the circumstances of our country, in  which the majority of the state-owned or private companies, even  the efficient ones, do not have their own financial resources,  high interest rates prevent them from resorting to bank loans.  Considering that owing to a totally wrong policy, foreign  capital cannot be attracted either, actually there is no source  of funds. The lack of capital is the gravest current problem in  the Romanian economy. Currently there is a genuine hunger for  money, both lei and dollars, and, paradoxically enough from the  economic point of view, at the same time there is also a general  refraining from loans, due to the high interest rates.    On the other hand, the accelerated growth of inflation over  the recent period makes it very difficult to maintain the  current level of interest rates, as it would inevitably lead to  the decapitalization of commercial companies and banks. The  recent promise made by Prime Minister Vacaroiu and [National  Bank] Governor Isarescu to reduce interest rates in the near  future cannot be accomplished. As a matter of fact, in 1992 the  governor of the National Bank also promised that by the end of  that year he would reduce interest rates to 30 percent, but he  did not keep his word.    The entire chain of errors and hesitations in the hard  currency and exchange rate policy also contributed to the  gradual depreciation of the leu's purchasing power. In the  years 1990 and 1991 state-owned and private companies were left  50 percent of the hard currency made by them in exports. By the  end of 1991, when the limited convertibility of the leu was  introduced, they were left nothing of the hard currency they  made, thus making it difficult for them to buy supplies from  abroad, which implicitly hindered production. Six months later,  more exactly in May 1992, the government went back on that  decision, leaving the companies the whole amount of hard  currency they earned from exports. This decision was not a  well-pondered one either, because what followed was the National  Bank's lack of hard currency, which created great problems for  importers. This to and fro in the hard currency policy led to  the companies' losing confidence in the National Bank so they  began to place the hard currency they earned from exports in  banks located abroad. The presumed amount of about $800 million  existing in foreign banks is also generating inflation, as the  lei spent for the manufacturing of those goods never returned to  the economic circuit of our country.    Both the previous taking and the leaving, as of May 1992, of  the entire amount of hard currency made by companies from their  exports contributed to the weakening of our economy and national  currency.    The fact that companies have to come up with the entire  amount of hard currency in case of imports continues to cause  great problems, especially to companies which are big energy,  fuel, raw materials, and equipment consumers, the products of  which, however, are not intended for exportation. The negative  consequences of these measures upon our economy are as grave as  those caused by the state's taking all the hard currency  obtained from exports.    A significant part of the country's hard currency assets --  which are quite limited anyhow -- was wasted by the companies  which had to buy their dollars in auctions. The auctions were  also participated in by companies that had debts in lei to be  paid to banks, the state budget, or their suppliers. Should the  participation in dollar auctions of indebted companies be  prohibited by law? There is no way in which such regulations  could really be observed, as hard currency requests for imports  intended to be used to produce export products ought to be  exempted. This means that the companies will continue to buy  hard currency for speculation purposes, which has negative  consequences upon the leu.    The superficial way and the haste with which they introduced  the limited convertibility of the leu (we would have needed at  least $3 billion in assets, whereas all we had at that time was  $400 million) contributed to the gravest devaluation of the leu  in its entire history, that is from 180 to 400 lei to the dollar  within just a few months in 1992. Ever since then the leu has  continued to devaluate steadily at a rate corresponding to the  accelerated growth of inflation. Actually, this was the  beginning of the end.    The use of the foreign loans worth about $4 billion to cover  immediate consumption needs (raw materials, energy, fuel, and  food), rather than to enhance production or make investments,  also promoted inflation. This happened because the loans were  spent without making it possible for the leu to recover.  Besides this, owing to the progressive devaluation of the leu,  now we have to make eight or nine times bigger efforts to pay  those loans back. This additional effort will aggravate  inflation in a catastrophic way. Not having appropriate hard  currency assets or other resources, the National Bank will see  itself compelled to buy dollars in auctions offering 1,600 lei  for the dollar, so that it can pay back the foreign loans  obtained over 1990-1991, when the dollar was worth less than 200  lei.    Well before the revolution, but in a more accentuated way  following that moment, there were and still are a number of  factors that acted as a burden on our national currency, all of  them being caused by a totally wrong economic policy.    A simplistic assessment might lead to the conclusion that to  curb inflation it would suffice if a significant part of the  gross industrial product would be earmarked for the market, that  is to attract the monetary mass currently in circulation.  However, the truth is that over many years in Romania the part  of the gross industrial product that is able to attract the  monetary mass has had a very reduced weight. In the case of a  large number of domestic products, such as clothes, shoes, radio  sets, cigarettes, cosmetics, sweets, sodas, canned food, and so  on, their poor quality and high prices make them difficult to  sell, as the consumers prefer the imported products. Even in  the case of products the quality of which is acceptable  (furniture, automobiles, tractors, color television sets, and so  on), their exorbitant prices make them inaccessible to the  majority of the population. Certain producers' tendencies to  export their products, more exactly their hunger for dollars  (for instance in the case of automobiles, tractors,  refrigerators, and so on) also prevents the absorption of the  cash available on our market.    Similarly negative consequences may be seen owing to the  very  poor quality of the services offered to the population in a  great number of localities of the country. Let alone the  enormous price requested for certain services (heating, electric  power, and so on), services that account for the largest part of  the total spending of the population in the entire world, which  prohibits the purchase of other merchandise, thus gravely  aggravating inflation. If citizens have to spend half of their  earnings on food and the other half on heating, electricity,  transportation, and other services, they are left no money to  spend on nonedible merchandise, which thus remains unsold and  accentuates inflation.    Pressure is exerted upon our monetary mass also by the  freezing of the possibilities for the great majority of the  population to rent or buy living quarters, while their savings  hoarded for that purpose are continuously depreciating. Just by  selling the 64,000 apartments that have been left unfinished  [after December 1989], several billion lei could be absorbed  from the savings of the population made for that purpose.</p>

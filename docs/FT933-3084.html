			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper prices slide further as supply squeeze eases LONDON METAL Exchange copper prices yesterday extended the decline that has continued uninterrupted since the exchange management acted a week ago against the squeeze on supplies that had been propping up nearby delivery positions. The three months position, which stood at Dollars 1,947.50 a tonne before the LME announced that the cash/one day premium would be limited to Dollars 5 a tonne, fell by Dollars 30 yesterday to Dollars 1,858.50 a tonne. The cash position has fallen even more sharply since the announcement, by Dollars 112 to Dollars 1,899.50 a tonne. Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group, said that yesterday's sell-off followed the breach of the support level at Dollars 1,880 a tonne that had been under pressure since the end of last week. The resulting fall was exacerbated by the triggering of stop-loss selling orders, he added. Even before the LME move the holders of short positions who were caught in the squeeze had been heartened by the uneventful passing on the first of this month of a critical options date. It had been feared that this could have been the occasion for the administration of the coup de grace as the influential holders of call (buying) options declared them and forced granters to scramble for cash supplies at ever widening premiums. In the event, however, most of the options holders simply rolled them forward into October and December. That was why, explained Mr Bielski, the backwardation (cash premium) against forward positions remained substantial while the cash/one day premium had been eliminated altogether. The one-month premium yesterday was about Dollars 27 a tonne while the three-months was Dollars 41, having narrowed from Dollars 70 a week earlier. If the 'shorts', further encouraged by the one-day backwardation limit, were feeling more comfortable now, the longs were 'not too worried', Mr Bielski suggested. He thought much of the long options position represented actual physical demand. There were reasons, moreover, for believing that the perceived fundamental situation could have changed substantially by the time those options fell due again. 'We are on the fringes of the seasonal pick-up in demand,' Mr Bielski said. 'Elections are coming in Chile (an important supplier of copper) and there are still a number of production disruptions around the world.' Although LME warehouse stocks of copper stood at a 15-year high, Mr Bielski argued that the overall stock level, at between seven and eight week's of world supply, was 'a low level for coming out of a recession' and could quickly be brought down to size by an upturn in demand. Demand was holding up quite well in developed countries and was strong in developing economies, he said. And there was not enough new smelting capacity in the pipeline to cover probable demand growth over the next few years. In the past few years oversupply had been aggravated by shipments form the former Soviet Union, the analyst noted. But most of that metal had been 'toll' smelted using European concentrates (an intermediate material) that were excess to requirements. Europe's surplus concentrates had now been used up, he said, and there was not enough to keep its own smelters fed. So there was bound to be a sharp reduction in shipments from the Commonwealth of Independent States.  --------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                 +4,675    to    2,137,575 Copper                    +5,850    to      532,000 Lead                      +1,525    to      283,800 Nickel                      +720    to      111,048 Zinc                      +4,100    to      778,700 Tin                          +50    to       21,625  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

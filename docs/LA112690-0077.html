			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST PERSON: SHARKS: IN SEARCH OF THE BIG ONE  </P> <P> I agreed to go shark fishing in the same way people agree to have lunch with  someone they never expect to see again. Saying "yes" is sometimes an easier and  consequently more final form of saying "no."  </P> <P> We arrived at the 30-foot California Dawn out of Balboa Harbor at sunrise.  There were 12 of us, in twos, threes and fours, all in various stages of  expectation. The camaraderie among fishermen begins with thoughts of the strike  and the severity of the fight.  </P> <P> We had heard the stories. There were big ones out there: 20 to 25 feet, 800 to  900 pounds, a six-hour fight only to lose it at the end. These stories were  repeated at the dock with increasing anticipation. I had been fairly silent  until that point, my silence I'm sure taken for confidence, before I decided to  venture a few questions. What if you lose your pole? Who takes out the hook? I  could establish myself in the group as easily as the others.  </P> <P> Some seafaring preconceptions were dispelled the moment we boarded the boat.  Lee, the seasoned captain of these dangerous missions, judging from his visage  and homework, was a history major at an advanced high school.  </P> <P> Jim, his equally young deckhand, could have passed for a choirboy's younger  brother. Jim's looks were deceiving. It would turn out that he liked to wrestle  a shark to submission, mano-a-fin, before taking a baseball bat to its head.  </P> <P> The first order of ship's business, for those of us who didn't have our own  gear, was to outfit the rod and reel. Everything about the equipment appeared  mean, serious, angry. The rod was thick, maybe 6 feet tall, with the  flexibility of pipe. The reel was the size of a grapefruit, with 1,000 feet of  40-pound line.  </P> <P> And the hook was frightening. It was 4 inches of steel, the barb half an inch  long, with a steel wire leader. We were given two each because sharks have been  known to strip the hook or bite through the leader. I was relieved to learn  that most of the fishermen didn't know how to tie the line to the leader, and  was assured when Jim performed this duty with patience and humor. If there was  risk in this adventure, at least it would be well-managed and ultimately  deferred.  </P> <P> As the boat headed out of the harbor, we searched for our sea legs and our  favorite spots about the boat from which to cast our lines. Mine was where the  railing was highest -- thigh-high -- to provide the greatest barrier to being  pulled overboard.  </P> <P> If the Big One could smell fear, I would have the catch of the day. Our  objective was a bank some 16 miles out to sea. The engine churned through the  waves. The air had a penetrating briskness. To add to our sense of oneness  against the elements, a sudden squall brought all, except Jim, into the tiny  galley. Along one wall were photographs of prized shark catches. Over the  photos, a .22-caliber rifle.  </P> <P> Ninety minutes out to sea, far beyond the distance I knew I could swim if the  boat were attacked and sank, Jim began sopping chum from a 50-gallon drum into  the ocean. Chum is a sort of bouillabaisse of fish parts and organic debris  which is supposed to send flesh-eating sharks into a frenzy.  </P> <P> Jim dumped chum in the boat's wake for a mile before Lee cut the motor and told  us to cast our lines. We then drifted back along the chum line, waiting for  whatever terror we had stirred from the deep. That was the procedure. Lay a  chum line and drift against it. Lay a chum line, drift against it.  </P> <P> "Loll" turned out to be the active verb of the day. And it became a beautiful  day. The sun shone brightly. The water in the middle of the channel was a  magnificently clear aquamarine. We sat and talked and lolled, drifting, reeling  in, laying chum. We laid enough chum to qualify as an oil spill, and drifted  for half the day before I hooked the first of two sharks caught on the boat.  </P> <P> I was reeling in, thinking of England, when -- as the hook was about to reach  the water surface -- a six-foot mako came from under the boat and took the  bait. The reel let out its characteristic whine. Jim instantly appeared and in  one smooth movement grabbed the rod, saw the shark beneath us, snatched a gaff,  and hauled the fish on board.  </P> <P> This is what we had waited for, had paid our money for: the catch, the fight of  a man-eating shark. But not on the boat at ankle level. Chomping at the air  with long, jagged teeth, the shark's swimming motion enabled it to scurry about  the deck. In the boat's confines, that meant one direction -- toward us.  </P> <P> It could have been the first case of people jumping into the ocean to escape a  shark attack. People were scrambling to get to the other side of the boat, and  I was first among them. Unfortunately, I was still attached to the other end of  the line. I don't know how many people I entangled with my line and impaled  with my pole as I squeezed to the front of the crowd. Grace under pressure.  Wide-eyed apologies between clenched teeth.  </P> <P> Jim grabbed the shark behind its pectoral fins to divert its direction. This  was part sport for him, part show, and entirely crazy. A false step or reach  would have meant his hand. But it was the ritual necessary, I think, to supply  the adrenaline for what was to follow.  </P> <P> If a shark has a psyche, it doesn't include being attacked. The whomp of the  baseball bat on its head evinced only a look of surprise on the shark's face.  It took several hits to stun it before Jim could unsheath his knife and  eviscerate it. I had what I had hoped for: my own man-eating shark, my own  shark story.  </P> <P> There is a questionable morality about hunting when one's life and livelihood  don't depend on it. At the point one acknowledges being an omnivore, guidelines  arise.  </P> <P> We had been advised before we set out that a shark would be killed only if it  was to be eaten, and only the mako and the Great White were good eating. The  others would be thrown back.  </P> <P> I was going to eat my catch, however eerie it would be to squeeze lemon on  something that would just as soon eat me. And these were not baby seals. Even  eviscerated, the shark continued its motions of attack. (Indeed, skinned and  filleted, the steaks twitched when touched.) Nonetheless, a pall descended over  us after witnessing the savage physicality of the shark's subjection.  </P> <P> We quietly set about our business of drifting and casting with a sober respect  for the enterprise. One other mako was caught that day, its fin snagged as the  line was being reeled. Two hours later, we headed back to port.  </P> <P> Would I shark fish again?  </P> <P> Yes. It's good sport and decent eating, like halibut with too much oregano. I  no longer believe I would be pulled overboard if I caught the Big One. Before I  lost the pole, I would release the drag on the reel.  </P> <P> Would I do anything differently? I'd bring a book, a beach chair and a bat.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: RISKY, THIS DEBATE BUSINESS  </P> <P> I confess I came up here with purposes cynical. It was my aim to attend the  first-ever television debate between Democratic candidates for governor and  examine the entrails for evidence of shallowness and lack of the vision thing.  It looked like an easy day's work.  </P> <P> I was encouraged in my truth-squadding by a colleague who has labored long in  the political fields. "C'mon up," he said with a wink. "You can't miss. They'll  never mention Medfly. They'll ignore our crumbling infrastructure."  </P> <P> Oh, goody, I thought. I would pillory The Feinstein and The Van de Kamp for  their miserable failure to produce Medfly commentary and infrastructure hoopla.  I would make ironic contrasts between these etherized candidates and the likes  of, say, Vaclav Havel in poor but now-ascendant Czechoslovakia. Havel, of  course, will discuss infrastructure at the drop of a hat.  </P> <P> There was potential here.  </P> <P> So I came to San Francisco, turned on my tape recorder, and waited for all the  stuff that wouldn't get talked about. Only, it turns out, that wasn't the  problem.  </P> <P> The problem is, they did talk about it. And talk, and talk, and talk.  </P> <P> OK, maybe they did ignore Medflies. Surely no other subject was spared by these  two people, who sounded like they had been deprived of Wheaties as children and  fed shredded Caltrans reports instead. How did they learn to talk like that?  </P> <P> Want some examples? I got examples.  </P> <P> Feinstein announced herself aggressive on appointive gender balancing and  foursquare behind preservation of set-asides for municipal contracts. She  fence-straddled on indeterminate sentences, warned that the possibility of  judicial commutation should be expunged, and really pounded COLAs. This last  item was not a reference to Pepsi.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp liked Propositions 68, 98, 111, 112, and several others yet to be  numbered. (Pop quiz: Tell me all you know about Prop. 68.) He grew lyrical over  Transitional Assistance from the Peace Dividend. And, in fiery defiance of  Feinstein, he announced his loyalty to COLAs.  </P> <P> Here's what Feinstein said when asked if she would cut COLAs to meet a possible  state shortfall of $3 billion. This reply, incidentally, was the first question  of the night and came at the moment when most viewers were trying to decide  whether to stick with the debate or switch to the Simpsons. Here it comes:  </P> <P> "Let me try to answer this way. I think if the shortfall is $3.3 billion, even  if Prop. 111 passes, the upward computation will only allow about a billion  dollars of additional spending. Consequently, $1.5 billion will have to be cut  from the budget."  </P> <P> For the record, Van de Kamp thought this response was "absolutely wrong."  </P> <P> In truth, the whole thing was not as bad as that exchange makes it sound. For  the hundred or so viewers who stuck it out past the first question, the debate  did have its moments. And it proved why these events, as awkward and clumsy as  they are, can sometimes provide the turning point in a political campaign.  </P> <P> Toward the end of their hour, Van de Kamp turned to Feinstein and played a card  he had been holding back. He referred to comments that Feinstein had made to  John Balzar, a political reporter for this newspaper, that suggested she might  support laws banning abortions performed for the purpose of sex selection.  </P> <P> A touchy business. The notion of sex selection abortions obviously was  repugnant to Feinstein, but freedom of choice for women has formed a  cornerstone of her campaign. If she admitted during a live debate that she  favored calling in abortion cops to interrogate women about their motives, she  was running the risk of losing a chunk of her support.  </P> <P> So she waffled. Such abortions were wrong, she said, but pointed out that her  comments had been made in response to a question about China, where the  practice was once widespread. The question of an abortion inquisitor for  California was left unanswered.  </P> <P> Was a lot of damage done? Probably not, because such abortions are still rare  in this country. But if you watched the debate, you got to see this weak point  develop in Feinstein's campaign armor and you got to see the uncertainty and  ambivalence in the candidate's face as she tried to grapple with it.  </P> <P> And that is the value of the debates. Almost alone among all modern campaigning  devices, debates create an environment of true risk. They are unpredictable and  dangerous. And that makes them worth watching, even if the candidates don't get  to the Medfly, even if they seem, sometimes, to speak in a foreign tongue.  </P></p>

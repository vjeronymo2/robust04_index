			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'TODAY' SHOW HOPES TO FLOOR VIEWERS WITH ITS NEW SET  </P> <P> IF YOU were a mouse in the RCA Building (now called by some the General  Electric Building), you'd get to sneak in and see the a-building set for the  "Today" show.  </P> <P> (You know what they say when shows get into ratings troubles: "Let's just build  a new set, and that will fix it.")  </P> <P> There it is -- mostly shining wood and big mirrors, but with outlines of real,  honest-to-goodness marble set into the floors, and inlaid parquet as far as the  eye can see. (Does the viewing audience ever see a TV floor?) Looks like a fun  place to be in the future with Bryant and Joe and Willard and Deborah (or  whomever).  </P> <P> CONSTANT READERS are familiar with the street-smart private detective known  only as Burke in the novels of Andrew Vachss, books such as "Blue Belle," "Hard  Candy" and "Blossom."  </P> <P> Now Vachss has reached an agreement with David Picker and Paramount Pictures to  produce a series of movies based on this character. The novels mentioned will  be brought to the screen, and Vachss is to create future works for these films.  He has been described as a cross between Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler,  with Burke called "the lord of the asphalt jungle."  </P> <P> Burke will first be seen on screen in "Blue Belle." Other Vachss characters are  also to appear -- Mama Wong, Max the Silent, Prof, Mole and Pansy, Burke's  deadly Neapolitan mastiff.  </P> <P> Until now, Vachss has repeatedly turned down Hollywood's lucrative offers. In  addition to writing books for Knopf, Vachss is an attorney in private practice  specializing in cases of juvenile justice and child abuse.  </P> <P> MOVIE INDUSTRY experts are still puzzling over the surprise success of this  year's two big hits -- "Pretty Woman" and "Ghost." These films did not boast  car chases or excessive macho violence, yet each grossed more than $100  million. Hollywood is flabbergasted.  </P> <P> One insider quips after reading the Variety grosses: "What we need now is a  movie about a hooker who comes back from the dead. That would clear $200  million in no time!"  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other AMA Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AMA Report also suggests that certain other cardiac diagnoses be added to the standards as specific disqualifications. FAA certification experience, however, has not indicated a need for regulatory change in cases of cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease or murmurs, pericarditis, or disturbances of heart rhythm or conduction. The agency agrees with the AMA Report that these conditions pose a potential risk but has found that the existing standards and procedures provide adequate opportunity for identification and evaluation of the affected airmen and a regulatory basis for denial of airman privileges, if appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Electrocardiography  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current standards require that applicants for first-class medical certificates submit a resting, 12-lead ECG at the time of their first examination after reaching age 35 and, annually, after reaching age 40. They must show by these ECG's, ``an absence of myocardial infarction.'' An ECG made within the 90 days before an examination for a first-class medical certificate is accepted as meeting the requirement. There now is no routine requirement for submission of ECG's by applicants for second- or third-class medical certificates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMA Report notes that it is well established that up to 20 percent of myocardial infarctions (``heart attacks'') fail to produce symptoms that bring a person to a physician. The resting ECG often shows evidence of a prior myocardial infarction and patterns of anatomic change and other abnormalities that are also associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. The AMA Report adds that many of the most common alterations of cardiac conduction seen on the routine ECG are not associated with symptoms or with easily discerned physical findings. Yet, each of these electrocardiographic findings causes special concerns regarding medical certification and may result in recommendations for additional assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMA Cardiovascular Committee, in recognition of these facts, recommended that the requirement for electrocardiography be modified in an effort to increase the assurance that significant cardiac disease in pilots will be detected. The committee suggested that, in addition to the current requirement for first-class certificates, an ECG be made on all applicants for medical certification at the time they first apply. These ECG's would serve as a valuable medical baseline for future comparison. Further, the committee recommended that an ECG be made on applicants for second-class medical certificates at ages 35 and 40 years and every 2 years thereafter, and on applicants for third-class certificates at age 40 years and every 6 years thereafter. The committee also suggested that the standard be modified to include the agency's concern for any clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormality rather than the current limited specification of myocardial infarction alone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In proposed &sect;67.211(d), all applicants for second-class airman medical certification would be required to submit ECG's at the first examination after reaching age 35 and, biennially, after reaching age 40. There is reciprocity between the first- and second-class cardiovascular standards in satisfying the ``after reaching the 35th birthday'' and the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' ECG requirements. For example, an application with an ECG that satisfies the ``age 35'' ECG requirement for first-class medical certification also satisfies the ``age 35'' ECG requirement of an application for second-class medical certification and vice versa. In the case of the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' ECG requirement, however, the time provisions of &sect;&sect;67.111(d)(3) and 67.211(d)(3), as discussed below, are also required for reciprocity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed time provision for the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' periodic ECG for first-class medical certification requires that an applicant submit an ECG with the application unless, within the preceding 9 months, an ECG was provided as part of an application for medical certification. That is, if an applicant has submitted an ECG as part of an application for airman medical certification within 9 months of the current application, the applicant does not have to submit another ECG for the current application. Thus, after reaching the 40th birthday, a person who maintains a first-class medical certificate would be required to have an ECG at alternate applications or approximately every year. In a few cases, it could be 1 year and 3 months between first-class ECG's. The time provision for the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' periodic ECG for second-class medical certification is the preceding 15 months. An applicant maintaining a second-class medical certificate would be required to have an ECG at alternate applications or approximately every 2 years. In a few cases, it could be 2 years and 3 months between ECG's. The proposed requirement for first-class medical certification allows more leeway than the current rule. An applicant with a first-class medical certificate could wait up to 9 months and the ECG of the previous application for a first-class medical certificate would meet the requirement for the succeeding application for a first-class medical certificate. An applicant with a second-class medical certificate could wait up to 15 months and the ECG of the second-class medical certificate would meet the requirement for the succeeding application for second-class medical certification. No ECG requirement is being proposed for third-class medical certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

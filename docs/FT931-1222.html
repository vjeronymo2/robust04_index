			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Property sales offset slow jetfoil growth by Shun Tak SHUN Tak, the Macau jetfoil operator owned by casino tycoon Mr Stanley Ho, yesterday announced an 18.5 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 511.4m (USDollars 66m) for 1992, up from HKDollars 431.4m in 1991. The company's jetfoil operations experienced slower growth, but this was compensated for by an increase in property sales. If sales continue according to the current schedule, the company is expected to show a 50 per cent increase in profits for the current year. Shun Tak wrote off the value of its entire investment in Air Hong Kong, the air cargo operator, resulting in an extraordinary loss of HKDollars 187.2m, as the management has accepted it is unlikely to return to profitability. From February, the company has reaped the benefits of a increase in jetfoil fares.</p>

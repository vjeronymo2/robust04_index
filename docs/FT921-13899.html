			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): A prized inheritance YEARS ago my wife's father bought premium bonds (Pounds 25 each) for our three children. With their agreement the bonds were replaced by Pounds 75 worth in my name, to achieve equal benefit from any large win, which is what their grandfather would have wished. Now we see that a win could be liable to inheritance tax. Can the bonds, or replacements in joint names be put into a trust to benefit only the children, with access to any income? From what you say it seems that the bonds are already held on trust for the three children as joint beneficiaries. If so this should be confirmed in a declaration of trust made by the bond-holders. If not, they can be put into trust, but only with the agreement of anyone who might be entitled to a specified bond, or its winnings. There should be no income from such a trust. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

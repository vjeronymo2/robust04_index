			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 27 May -- Kazakhstan has become the 19th  state to join the Partnership for Peace program proposed by the  NATO leadership. At the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on  Friday the republic's Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev put his  signature to the program's framework document. Kazakhstan's  embassy in Brussels noted that the republic was the second  nuclear state, after Ukraine, to give official support to the  initiative put forward by the NATO countries' heads of states  and governments. This has taken place soon after Kazakhstan's  accession to the treaty on the non- proliferation of nuclear  weapons and this, Almaty believes, is clear confirmation of  Kazakhstan's firm political desire to strengthen international  security and stability.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, K.Saudabayev expressed the  hope that the implementation of the Partnership for Peace  concept would make it possible to rule out the emergence of any  grounds for new confrontation after the ending of the Cold War,  would create real possibilities for a smooth transition to an  atmosphere of stability, mutual trust and cooperation throughout  the world and would ensure firm guarantees for the security and  territorial integrity of Kazakhstan.    Acceding to this initiate, he stressed, opens up before the  republic broad prospects for military-political, economic and  technical cooperation with NATO in the sphere of setting up a  modern army in accord with democratic principles and world  standards, for conversion of the defense industry and for  participation in peacekeeping operations under UN aegis. The  minister said that the importance of Kazakhstan's accession to  this program is that it contains a stimulus for the further  development of economic reforms, transition to a market economy  and the construction of a law-based democratic state.    Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister had a conversation with Sergio  Balanzino, NATO Deputy Secretary General.</p>

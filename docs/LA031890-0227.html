			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Moving On -- The first wave of the spring bird migration is under way in Orange  County, with swallows, swifts, hummingbirds and hawks at the vanguard of the  huge avian movement.  </P> <P> Five species of swallow and two species of swift were seen last week during an  Audubon field trip to Yorba Regional Park in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Three types of swallow -- cliff, northern rough-winged and barn -- nest  locally, but their numbers have been augmented by birds migrating from points  farther south. Also spotted were large numbers of migrating violet green and  tree swallows.  </P> <P> Shore birds and ducks that have wintered in local estuaries, meanwhile, are  getting ready to head north to their breeding grounds. Endangered California  least terns, which breed locally, are expected to arrive in April.  </P> <P> Land birds that spent the winter in the county are starting to move around. So,  according to Sylvia Gallagher of the local Sea &amp; Sage Audubon Society,  birds that spent the last few months in a yard across town "might turn up in  your yard now."  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Witan bond issue raises Pounds 56m WITAN INVESTMENT, the largest investment trust managed by Henderson Touche Remnant, is raising Pounds 56.25m via an issue of exchangeable bonds which will mature in 2008. The bonds will be convertible into a basket of shares in three other trusts managed by Henderson Touche Remnant - Electric and General, Greenfriar and Lowland. The bonds will pay a coupon of 6.25 per cent and will be callable, at Witan's option, after 1998. Witan has also sold part of its holding in the Henderson Administration fund management group. The sale of 1.75m shares, 8.2 per cent of Henderson's capital, raised Pounds 14.9m for Witan and reduced its stake to 15.2 per cent. Witan said it had no intention of making any further market sales in Henderson shares over the next 12 months; Henderson will still be the trust's single largest holding. Mr Christopher Clarke, managing director of Witan said that the deal enabled the trust to reduce its exposure to Henderson or Henderson-managed trusts. Previously that exposure had represented over Pounds 100m out of Witan's assets of Pounds 880m. In addition, Mr Clarke said the deal enabled Witan to sell shares in the three other trusts at a premium to their net asset values. See International Bonds</p>

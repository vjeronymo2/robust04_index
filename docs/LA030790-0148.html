			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> CATHEDRAL TO OFFER REFUGE IN SPRAYINGS;  </P> <P> MALATHION: ANAHEIM FACILITY RUN BY REV. SCHULLER WILL HOUSE HOMELESS DURING  AERIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS.  </P> <P> The Crystal Cathedral has agreed to provide a haven where the homeless can take  refuge during aerial malathion spraying, Orange County Supervisor Harriett M.  Wieder announced at a news conference this morning.  </P> <P> Wieder then used the forum to lash out at Gov. George Deukmejian and the state  Department of Food and Agriculture for what she called their bureaucratic  insensitivity to public fears raised by the state's pesticide program to combat  the Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> "While we do have an answer to how do we handle the homeless while the spraying  is going on," Wieider said, the controversy "really reflects poor planning on  the part of the governor and on the part of the Department of Food and  Agriculture."  </P> <P> Under the agreement announced by Wieder, the Rev. Robert Schuller, pastor of  the Crystal Cathedral, will put up the homeless in a facility in Anaheim where  his "Hour of Power" service was once broadcast. The county will provide cots  and blankets for the homeless who will be permitted to stay overnight Thursday  when the Garden Grove area is scheduled for another aerial application of the  pesticide.  </P> <P> The homeless will be picked up in vans provided by the Orange County Homeless  Task Force at gathering sites throughout the area. Those include Pioneer Park  in Garden Grove, the corner of Bristol and Fairview streets in Santa Ana, Hart  Park in Anaheim and a still-to-be-identified church in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The state, Wieder said, has agreed to provide three trained social workers to  staff the overnight shelter. The homeless will be shuttled to the shelter at 5  p.m. Thursday and returned to the gathering points by 7:30 the next morning, a  homeless task force representative at the news conference said.  </P> <P> Wieder said the state has agreed to help with future arrangements for any  future malathion spraying in the area. "They finally are listening and trying  to be reasonable," Wieder said.  </P> <P> At the board's regular meeting this morning, county agricultural officials  announced that the Department of Food and Agriculture will hold a hearing on  the malathion spraying program March 19 in the county Hall of Administration in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Both Wieder and Supervisor Roger R. Stanton questioned the efficacy of such a  hearing. Stanton noted that the sponsor was "not exactly a neutral party." Said  Wieder: "I think it's a lot of spinning of wheels to justify their action."  </P> <P> As they have done since last November, county supervisors renewed by a 3-2 vote  a proclamation declaring a local emergency in the battle against the  infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly. Supervisors supporting the  declaration argue that the local state of emergency is needed to protect the  county against possible massive lawsuits that could arise out of the spraying.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETS;  </P> <P> TOPS FOR TAPAS: LOMITA'S SPANISH DELICATESSEN  </P> <P> La Espanola Deli, 2020 Lomita Blvd. No. 7, Lomita, (213) 539-0455. Hours:  Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-5 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m.  </P> <P> "When I was a housewife, I was a customer here," says Juana Faraone, proprietor  of La Espanola Deli in Lomita. "When the owners wanted to sell, I thought it  would be the perfect business for me because I love to cook."  </P> <P> La Espanola Deli is the only Los Angeles-area store that deals exclusively in  Spanish products. Every weekend, transplanted Spaniards crowd into the  minuscule shop in an obscure area of Lomita to pick up some manchego cheese, or  a chunk of serrano ham and some Spanish paprika for their Fabada Asturiana.  They come in for the northern style chorizos de Bilbao that dangle on racks  behind the shop's compact deli case or for the tiny links of russet  cantimpalito sausages of Central Spain. In addition to those Spanish sausages,  La Espanola carries about a dozen more varieties.  </P> <P> All the sausages are made on the premises, in a USDA-inspected sausage-making  kitchen that is also the only one of its kind in the area. La Espanola produces  Spanish-style hams and sausages, some of which remain up to 18 months in the  plant's curing room.  </P> <P> The company can turn out about 1,000 pounds of sausage a day, which it  distributes to restaurants and stores across the country. That is quite a jump  from what the company was producing when Faraone purchased it from an old  Spanish couple eight years ago.  </P> <P> Faraone trained at La Espanola for a month before the owners turned their  formulations over to her. But the first batches of sausage she made on her own  were a disaster. "My Sobresada, which should always be a beautiful, deep red,  developed white spots and I couldn't figure out why," she remembers. Faraone  consulted a family friend, Father Miguel, a priest from Majorca who had been in  charge of hog butchering and traditional sausage making at a Nevada monastery.  Together they prepared La Espanola's first successful batch of Sobresada  Mallorquena.  </P> <P> Father Miguel counseled Faraone on a few fine points of sausage-making: the  correct temperature for the meat before it is ground, how to watch for  rancidity in sausages as they cure. Faraone then traveled throughout Spain to  observe sausage-making techniques firsthand. Back in the United States she  attended professional seminars and eventually obtained her USDA status.  </P> <P> Spanish food has vivid, earthy flavors and Mediterranean accents that seem  natural for California. But it has only recently been finding a following here.  You can prepare Spanish food without the authentic ingredients you find at La  Espanola, of course, but your cazuelas, egg tortillas and Iberian bean dishes  will be missing that essentially "Spanish" taste. And unless paella is prepared  with the sort of short-grained Valencia rice sold in La Espanola's deli, it  won't have the chewy texture that reminds you you're eating the genuine item.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHOPPING LIST:  </P> <P> * Serrano Ham: Many compare Serrano ham to Italian prosciutto but its flavor is  sweeter and nuttier and, as a rule, it is sliced thicker than prosciutto. In  Spain some of the best hams, including Jamones Ibericos and Jamones de Jabugo,  come from pigs fed on acorns. At the moment no one imports them and La Espanola  cannot obtain acorn-fed pork. But their hams, made with lean, domestic pork and  cured 18 months are very good.  </P> <P> The deli carries the ham sliced in 4-ounce packages, but it is preferable to  slice your own from the whole hams.  </P> <P> For tapas, cubes of the ham are customarily speared on a wooden pick or  hand-cut for pan con tomate y jamon (known in northeastern Spain, where it is a  focus of local patriotism, as pa amb tomaquet): crisp bread rubbed with tomato,  drizzled with olive oil and topped with the ham. In the Basque country the ham  is an essential part of piperade, a dish composed of fresh-roasted sweet green  peppers, onions and tomatoes cooked slowly together until they are meltingly  sweet then swirled with beaten eggs to make a Basque-style tortilla.  </P> <P> Serrano ham hocks, which La Espanola also sells, add their robust flavor to  Cocido Madrileno, a sort of pot-au-feu dinner served in courses or lentil and  bean dishes. Faraone uses the hocks in her spaghetti sauce.  </P> <P> * Manchego cheese: Once the cheese of sheep herders in the region of La Mancha  on the Castilian plateau, Manchego's sharp, complex, buttery flavor is due in  part to the Manchego sheep's milk from which it is produced. Manchego will  always carry a denominacion de origen label, assuring that only cheese made in  the region may bear that name.  </P> <P> The youngest cheeses are cured 60 days; La Espanola sells the three-month aged  cheese that is still semi-soft and considered young enough for eating. Manchego  is typically offered with fresh fruit or the quince paste membrillo and a  chilled fine Sherry. Older Manchego makes an excellent grating and cooking  cheese and is made by simply keeping the wheels of cheese in a cool dark place,  or even in the refrigerator.  </P> <P> * Pimenton: Sometimes called Spanish paprika, this is not the same as Hungarian  paprika although it does come from a related sweet pepper. Pimenton is  indispensable for most Spanish cooking.  </P> <P> * Spanish saffron: La Espanola stocks one-gram vials of true Spanish saffron.  Its threads are the deep red variety with only a little yellow -- an indication  of a good quality. Toast the saffron threads in a dry skillet very briefly just  before you use it.  </P> <P> * Lomo embuchado: Faraone calls this cured pork loin "the Cadillac of the  house." Fresh eye of loin meticulously trimmed of fat is hand-rubbed with a  mixture of white wine and spices. The meat marinates in a cooler for about  eight days, which draws off some of the moisture and allows the seasonings to  penetrate. After being packed in a natural casing it hangs in the curing room  at 63 degrees for three to nine months, depending on the size of the loin. The  lomo is somewhat like a ham but not as salty and is best eaten as simply as  possible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAUSAGES  </P> <P> La Espanola produces fully cured sausages (similar to salami) as well as  semi-cured and uncured or "fresh" sausages.  </P> <P> SEMI-CURED SAUSAGES are dried only a few days, and must be lightly cooked. The  light curing intensifies their flavor but the sausages remain juicy enough to  impart a meaty, well-seasoned taste to beans, lentils or rice casseroles. Even  with lengthy simmering, semi-cured sausages won't dry out.  </P> <P> * Chistorra: The Basque region, known for some of Spain's finest cooking, not  surprisingly produces the country's most flavorful sausages. Chistorra, long  skinny pork links that mingle a deep smokiness with plenty of garlic, really  pack a flavor punch. Basques eat these for breakfast with eggs or simply with  sturdy country bread. Like all the semi-cured sausages, Chistorra makes an  excellent flavoring for cooked dishes.  </P> <P> * Chorizo de Bilbao: One of Spain's most popular cooking chorizos, this is  another sausage originally from the Basque provinces and around Pamplona. Its  pungent, slightly firm meat is seasoned with the usual Spanish trinity of  garlic, pimenton and pepper, but it's also laced with cumin and oregano.  Similar to but more robust than uncured chorizo fresco, Bilbao stores well in  the refrigerator and keeps for longer periods than the fresh sausages.  </P> <P> * Cantimpalito: Stuffed into small sheep casings and tied at 1-inch intervals,  all-pork Cantimpalitos are the size of a single finger digit. They are  garlicky, rosy with pimenton, and have a light, smoky flavor. In bean or rice  dishes or sauteed with vegetables, Cantimpalitos make plump, bite-sized meaty  nuggets. Be sure to pierce each Cantimpalito a few times with the tines of a  fork before heating it through.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FRESH SAUSAGES  </P> <P> * Chorizo fresco: Like chorizo de Bilbao, this is eaten throughout Spain and  makes a wonderful cooking sausage. Because it isn't cured, chorizo fresco  exudes more of its fat -- which isn't actually very much. (La Espanola makes  both its Bilbao and chorizo fresco with less than 20% fat.) What fat there is  becomes the perfect medium for sauteing onions, garlic and tomato to make one  style of sofrito, the all-purpose flavoring base used for hundreds of Spanish  dishes.  </P> <P> * Butifarritas: Chubby, white and mildly flavored, these Catalonian-style  sausages, from around Barcelona, are the leanest of La Espanola's line. They  are reminiscent of Weisswurst but with a firmer texture. As is true of many  Catalan sausages, the familiar pimenton in the seasoning is absent. Instead,  Butifarrita's delicate flavor comes from a mixture of white pepper, garlic and  nutmeg. Catalonians love them in bean dishes, turned over charcoal or cooked  with turnips or cabbage. These sausages are cooked at the factory and need only  be heated through.  </P> <P> * Butifarra Catalana: This is simply a larger version of Butifarrita that is  often sliced and sauteed to serve with white beans or used in sandwiches. The  wide sausages are stuffed in collagen casing rather than the natural casing  that encloses Butifarritas. It should be peeled away.  </P> <P> * Longaniza: These large, light-colored sausages with just a touch of pimenton  seem a close relative of Italian sausage; their flavor, however, is quite  different. Longanizas make good cooking sausages but more often they appear as  an entree with vegetables and potatoes as an accompaniment. Of course, they  make wonderful tapas and fillings for omelets.  </P> <P> * Morcilla: La Espanola prepares two Spanish blood sausages. Their morcilla con  arroz (with rice) is seasoned in the manner of blood sausages from the Levente  region around Valencia, with garlic and cinnamon. Morcilla con cebolla (with  onions), a style favored in the North around Oviedo in Asturias, has a light  sprinkling of cloves and cayenne. Both sausages contain about 60% lean pork --  more meat than the morcillas served on Argentine restaurant parilladas -- those  are more like a soft blood pudding. Since the morcillas are precooked they need  only be warmed and sliced and accompanied by bread for tapas or lightly grilled  and served alongside other grilled meats with a good bottle of Rioja wine.  </P> <P> * Mexican-style chorizos: These are similar to Spanish chorizos frescos but  less lean and much spicier with cayenne and oregano.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURED SAUSAGES  </P> <P> In general the cured sausages are eaten as a cold cut and only occasionally  used in cooking.  </P> <P> * Soria or Spanish Girl sausage: This variety originated in Old Castile around  Soria and Logrono. Although actually a sausage, it resembles a gently seasoned  lean pork loin with a concentrated meaty taste. The meat is diced by hand,  seasoned and cured overnight to reduce its moisture. The mixture is then  tightly packed into a natural, Portuguese net-like casings and air-dried for  three months. Simply eat it sliced and in sandwiches.  </P> <P> * Pamplona style: The snap of garlic mellowed by a hint of pimenton makes this  a good eating sausage. It is similar to salami. To get the right texture, the  pork for these sausages is ground twice with a 24-hour rest period between  grindings. "The meat should look like small grains of rice," says Faraone. A  Pamplona-style sausage is cured three to six months, depending on its  dimension.  </P> <P> * Cantimpalo: Like the Pamplona style, Cantimpalo is similar to a salami but is  the thickness of a broom handle. The sausage is more highly seasoned with  cayenne and cumin, and the beef and pork for its filling are ground separately  -- each to a different coarseness -- giving the sausage its characteristic  double texture. Cantimpalo originated in the regions that include Salamanca,  Segovia and Valladolid. Some cooks there like to include it in cooked dishes  but it must only be heated through to prevent drying out.  </P> <P> * Sobrasada: Sobrasada's deep-wine color comes from the large quantities of  pimenton and cayenne used to flavor it. When it is whole, this Majorcan sausage  resembles a salami, but its texture is soft and almost spreadable. Spaniards  liken Sobrasada to a pate, though I find it a bit firmer, and recommend putting  slices of it on crackers or bread and warming it under the broiler. Sobrasada's  strong, earthy flavor goes a long way to enhance vegetables: Faraone recommends  cabbage and cauliflower. Her advice: "The sausage should be cut up and only  barely warmed to melting before adding the vegetables. Cook the cauliflower,  with a lid on the pan, removing it to stir the vegetable periodically until it  is tender." Many cooks like to add small bits of Sobrasada to their tortilla  Espanola, Spain's famous potato omelet eaten at room temperature.  </P> <P> * Fuet: The name means "whip" in the Catalan language, and as you'd expect, it  is long and skinny. This very garlicky dry-cured all-pork sausage originated in  the Catalonian region and contains no pimenton but is lightly flavored with  pepper and nutmeg. Fuet is loved as a snacking sausage or sliced thinly and  sprinkled on salads.  </P> <P> * Salchichon del Vich: Similar to Italian Genoa salami, this is another cured  sausage made without pimenton. Salchichon is deliciously rich, fatty and  freckled with crunchy bits of black pepper and garlic, dusted with cinnamon and  nutmeg. It is a favorite in Madrid for tapas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ADDITIONAL IMPORTED SPANISH FOODS  </P> <P> * Bacalao sin espinas: "It might seem strange," writes author Colman Andrews in  "Catalan Cuisine," "that a preserved fish should have become so popular in a  land where fish of the fresh sort is so obviously plentiful." Bacalao, like ham  and bacon, remained a favorite food long after practical keeping qualities were  its main attraction. When properly desalinated and sauced, bacalao produces  some of the world's best dishes.  </P> <P> La Espanola carries quality boneless salt cod -- some can be as dry and  board-like as an old packing crate. Theirs is slightly moist, pliable and cut  from the thick center of the fish. It is creamy white rather than dusty gray.  Salt cod must be soaked at least two days in fresh water with a change of water  several times a day. Longer soakings up to four days are even better.  </P> <P> * Valencia rice: Round-grained and slightly sticky, Valencia rice is grown in  the farm regions of Cullera and Sueca. Rice, first introduced to Valencia by  the Moors, is basic to its Middle Eastern-influenced cooking.  </P> <P> Just as you need Arborio rice to make a successful risotto, so a good paella  requires Valencia rice. Apart from paella, the region's hundreds of other rice  dishes are traditionally cooked in an earthenware cazuela, glazed only on the  inside. Just about anything can go into a rice cazuela, from Valencia orange  juice with almonds and raisins to an assortment of cockles and periwinkles.  </P> <P> * Spanish olive oil: As the world's leading producer of olive oil, Spain  markets many fine-quality extra virgin olive oils. Of these, Ybarra and  Carbonell are two of Spain's esteemed dealers. La Espanola carries both brands  along with several others.  </P> <P> * Turron: Another specialty with Moorish roots, Turron is a chewy, crunchy  nougat of honey and egg whites barely holding together whole roasted almonds.  At Christmastime, stores and shops throughout Spain are filled with many  varieties of turron. (The people of the Lavante region, who claim it as their  own, say they are good any time of year except after a visit to the dentist.)  The same dessert comes in a round form sandwiched between paper-thin waffle  cookies.  </P> <P> * Marzipan figurines: These animal-shaped almond-paste figurines look like  three dimensional cookies in that they have been oven-toasted. According to  Faraone, the 1890 brand sold in the deli is the best known and, some say, the  finest in Spain.  </P> <P> FARAONE'S QUICK FABADA ASTURIANA  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 4 ounces bacon (4 or 5 slices), cut up  </P> <P> 1 chopped onion  </P> <P> 4 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon Spanish paprika  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 2 cups beef broth  </P> <P> 1 pound chorizo de Bilbao  </P> <P> About 6 ounces morcilla, optional  </P> <P> 3 (15-ounce) cans white beans (such as cannellini beans), drained  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dry Sherry or white wine  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground pepper  </P> <P> Cayenne pepper  </P> <P> Heat olive oil in large saucepan.

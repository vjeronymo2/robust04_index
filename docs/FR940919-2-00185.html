The Federal government and many States have made a fundamental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to introducing and expanding competition in telecommunications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets. The benefits of that commitment are increasingly apparent and show no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signs of diminishing. There is also some concern, however, about the effects of competition on universal service. While those concerns merit attention, there is much evidence to suggest that competition and universal service are not incompatible goals. Market rivalry both drives prices towards underlying costs and reduces underlying costs by forcing competing firms to operate more efficiently. Competition thus tends to reduce prices for goods and services, making them more affordable for more consumers and ultimately reducing the need for subsidies. At the same time, competition also increases the range of services and products available to consumers and, potentially, their geographic reach as well, further promoting universal service goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The potential effects of competition on rates and consumer choice can be gleaned from the recent history of the long distance and CPE markets in the United States. Prior to the break-up of the Bell System in 1984, most of the United States was served by a single long distance network operated by AT&amp;T. Today, after a decade of government efforts to facilitate entry in the long distance market, there are more than 500 long distance carriers in the United States, offering a wide, ever-changing array of services and pricing options. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Due in part to this active rivalry among firms, long distance rates have declined more than sixty percent since 1984 by some estimations, making long distance calling more affordable for more Americans. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Industry Analysis Division, Common Carrier Bureau, Federal Communications Commission,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Trends in Telephone Service, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at 31 (May 1994) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Telephone Trends <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ).

Kovach, MCI, to Clarence L. Irving, Jr., NTIA, Attachment 1 at 1 (June 9, 1994) (long distance rates, adjusted for inflation, have declined 66% since 1985). As a result of the sharp decline in long distance rates, long distance calling has surged in recent years, especially relative to local calling. Toll calls (measured in minutes of use) comprised 26.6% percent of all calls in 1992, as compared to 19.9% in 1984.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Telephone Trends, supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 13, at 25 and Table 16. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Similarly, when the Bell System controlled the CPE market, customers could lease (but not buy) any telephone they wanted, so long as it was a black  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument that delivered unadorned voice service. Today, customers can choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their phones from a wide variety of colors, sizes, shapes, and designs. Modern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephones also include a variety of features (e.g., speed dialing, re-dial, memory programming) that greatly increase usefulness of that equipment for many customers. In addition, its cost has declined considerably in the last decade (as much as 50 percent in ``real'' terms). <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, NTIA Special Publication 91&hyph;26  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The NTIA Infrastructure Report: Telecommunications in the Age of Information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  204&hyph;205 and n. 707 (1991) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Infrastructure Report <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. The impact of competition on universal service can be examined more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly by reviewing the development of local telephone service after expiration of the original Bell telephone patents in 1893/94 unleashed a twenty-five year period of competition in the provision of local telephone service. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  In 1895, after nineteen years of the Bell System patent monopoly, there were only 251,994 telephones in the United States, or one telephone for every 276 of the nation's 69.5 million people. By 1920, at the close of the competitive era, there were some 13.4 million telephones in the United States, or one telephone for every eight of the nation's 105.7 million people. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  Moreover, fifty-five percent of all telephone subscribers were residential customers, as compared to only ten percent in 1895.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion is taken from Mueller,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 2, at 356&hyph;358, 360&hyph;361. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1895, the number of telephones in the United States was growing by five percent annually.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at 356.

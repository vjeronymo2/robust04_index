			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fanny Wong and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Military sites that China is prepared to turn over  to redevelopment would be worth more than $100 billion,  according to the Chinese team leader of the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group (JLG), Guo Fengmin. China has agreed to release  25 of the 39 sites currently occupied by British forces, noting  their value to Hong Kong's economic growth. A draft accord of  which sites will be retained and developed for the People's  Liberation Army has been drawn up by defence experts attached to  the JLG, and British officials are reportedly hoping for early  acceptance of it.    The use of military land has been discussed in the JLG for  more than seven years. Some technical difficulties are still  blocking full agreement, and Governor Chris Patten is hoping  that he can resolve these by meeting the director of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping.    Mr Lu will visit the territory next week for the Bank of  China's ceremony to launch its Hong Kong banknotes. But he has  not yet agreed to meet Mr Patten due to still strained relations  between Britain and China as a result of the row on  constitutional issues. Mr Lu will deliver a keynote speech on  "one country, two systems" at a function organised by five  chambers of commerce on Friday, May 6.    Mr Patten wants to discuss the defence deal, the airport  financing plan and the question of civil service through-train  with Mr Lu and hopes to resolve some outstanding problems in the  draft defence accord before the JLG holds its plenary meeting  next month.    Defence experts plan to meet early next month and it is  expected the JLG plenum will be held in mid or late May in Hong  Kong. Mr Guo confirmed that the plenum would be held before the  end of May. He said the two sides had yet to finalise details  on the defence land but that it would be discussed again soon.    He would not confirm that the Chinese side had agreed to  release the 25 plots of military land and said only: "We have  agreed to hand a great deal of land back to Hong Kong for  economic and social development. According to some conservative  estimates made earlier, the land to be release would be worth  hundreds of billions of dollars."    It is understood the draft accord produced by the defence  experts in late February envisages that the military estates at  King's Park, Kowloon Tong and Happy Valley will be freed for  development. The value of such prime sites ranges from $4  billion to as much as $10 billion. Sources indicated that the  area covered in the 25 military estimates was not great.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Two administrators of Polly Peck are fined TWO OF the administrators of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics conglomerate that collapsed two years ago with debts of Pounds 1.3bn, have been found guilty by the disciplinary committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales of breaching ethical guidelines. Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gulley, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and Mr Richard Stone, the firm's senior corporate finance partner, were yesterday fined Pounds 1,000 by the committee but will not face further penalties. These could have included their suspension as administrators of the company. The charges arose from the fact that there had been a continuing professional relationship between Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Polly Peck, and its chairman Mr Asil Nadir, during the three years before the company was placed in administration in October 1990. Both Mr Jordan and Mr Stone have always denied that they acted in any way improperly. The hearing began in July and has been closely followed in the accountancy profession, where there was some disappointment at the decision by the committee that the hearing should be held in private. In its ruling, the committee noted that there had been no suggestion that either man had intentionally failed to ascertain the prior connections of their firm with Polly Peck. The committee also emphasised that there was no criticism of the way that Mr Jordan and Mr Stone have conducted the Polly Peck administration. Mr Jordan and Mr Stone now have 28 days in which to consider whether to appeal against the ruling.</p>

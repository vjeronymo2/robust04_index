			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Gillette in Pounds 285m Parker Pen deal GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products group, is writing itself a much bigger role in the world pen market with the Pounds 285m purchase of Parker Pen. Parker, based in the UK since a Dollars 100m (Pounds 51m) management buy-out from its US parent in 1985, said yesterday it had decided against seeking a stock-market flotation. By adding Parker to its Paper Mate and Waterman brands, Gillette should double, to 15 per cent, its share of the world's Dollars 5bn writing instrument market Parker claims to be the world leader in ballpoint pens and roller balls, making about 53m a year. Up market, where Parker sports the Pounds 3,000 18-carat gold Premier Presidential, it makes 6m pens a year and reckons to rank second to Mont Blanc, which is owned by Dunhill. Mr Gerry Grimstone, the Schroders director who organised the sale, said that when Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m of profit-related payments were added to the purchase price, plus the assumption of Pounds 45m debt, the deal was worth Pounds 340m. Mr Jacques Margry, Parker's chairman and chief executive, who owns 2 1/2 per cent of the company, said flotation had been rejected because it would have raised only about Pounds 265m. Parker was nearly sold to Pentland Industries for about Pounds 180m in 1988, but the deal foundered on warranties and indemnities. Mr Margry started with Parker 43 years ago 'in the service department learning how to dismantle and maintain pens', then predominantly fountain pens and propelling pencils. As area manager in Europe, he felt the US parent company - which later changed its name from Parker Pen to Manpower - erred in the 1980s when it tried to push the pens downmarket, a fiercely competitive segment suited to mass production experts such as Bic. 'After the MBO, we returned to our origins which was to make good quality pens.' In its last year under its US parent it lost Dollars 20m. In the 12 months to February 1992, Parker made Pounds 29.5m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 181m. About 60 per cent of Parker's sales are in Europe, 17 per cent in North America, 15 per cent in Asia and the Pacific and 8 per cent in Latin America. Paper Mate sales, which are strong in North and Latin America, concentrate on products costing Dollars 5 or less. Waterman's greatest strength is in the Dollars 50-plus segment. Parker sells heavily in the Dollars 5 to Dollars 50 range. Boston-based Gillette bought Paper Mate in 1955 and Waterman in 1987. The beneficiaries of the sale will be Parker's management, which owns 31 per cent, Schroder Ventures with a similar amount, the Parker family 16 per cent, and Electra and Chemical Ventures, 10 per cent each. The deal must be approved by regulators in various countries.</p>

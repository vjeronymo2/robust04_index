			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTES;  </P> <P> VIRGINIA, MICHIGAN RECOGNIZE THESE TWO  </P> <P> Merv Lopes and Ron Abegglen are not the biggest names among college basketball  coaches, but they certainly have been part of the sport's biggest upsets during  this decade.  </P> <P> It was 1983 when Lopes' Chaminade team toppled No. 1-ranked Virginia and Ralph  Sampson. The victory became the standard against which future  David-over-Goliath upsets were measured.  </P> <P> They became part of the vernacular: In some circles, they were called  "Chaminades."  </P> <P> Abegglen's team from the University of Alaska-Anchorage pulled one off last  week, when the Division II Seawolves beat No. 2-ranked Michigan at a tournament  in Utah.  </P> <P> "In our eyes, it was a big upset," Abegglen said this week. "It was on a  neutral court, with WAC officials. It was an awfully big win for us."  </P> <P> It was in many eyes an even larger upset than Chaminade beating Virginia.  Consider that Alaska-Anchorage played the last 3 1/2 minutes without its  leading rebounder and second-leading scorer, Todd Fisher. And unlike the  Virginia-Chaminade game, when the Cavaliers were coming back from Japan and  Sampson was bothered by the flu, all of Michigan's front-line players were  healthy.  </P> <P> Playing against one of the best programs in the country was nothing new for the  Seawolves. The school has been host to one of the country's best early-season  tournaments, The Great Alaskan Shootout, for several years.  </P> <P> "We get to mingle with the big guys every year," said Abegglen, 51.  </P> <P> And beat them too.  </P> <P> But while Abegglen still is enjoying the greatest night of his career, Lopes'  12-year reign at Chaminade is about to come to an unceremonious end in  Honolulu.  </P> <P> Lopes, who was passed over for several Division I jobs (most notably twice at  Hawaii), resigned Dec. 22, effective at the end of the season. It came a few  days before the start of the Chaminade Classic, the tournament in which the  Silverswords upset the Cavaliers five years before.  </P> <P> "We left the door open for Merv to return," Chaminade Athletic Director Mike  Vasconcellos said from Honolulu. "The fire and determination and energy are  still there, but it's probably the right time for Merv to get out of here for a  while."  </P> <P> Chaminade, coming off a 5-19 season, is 4-12 this year.  </P> <P> Louisiana State Coach Dale Brown, whose team won the tournament in Hawaii, said  that Illinois is one of the best college teams he has seen in recent years. The  Tigers, who beat Maryland Monday, lost to the Fighting Illini last month.  </P> <P> According to Brown, what makes Illinois so difficult to defend is that it's  hard to tell the players apart. "They all look alike, and play alike" said  Brown. "You keep asking yourself which guy scored the basket because they're  all so athletic."  </P> <P> In fact, Illinois' starters are all between 6-feet-4 and 6-7, between 180 and  215 pounds.  </P> <P> What's scary about this season's Illinois team is that sophomore Marcus  Liberty, who sat out last season because of Proposition 48, doesn't start for  the Fighting Illini.  </P> <P> The joke around the Midwest is that Illinois Coach Lou Henson, whose postseason  record has been awful, might not be able to keep this team out of the Final  Four come late March.  </P> <P> By the time most players reach their junior year, they would like to be in  their team's starting lineup. Rhode Island junior Kenny Green isn't any  different. But there is a difference: It's how Green has accepted his sixth-man  role.  </P> <P> After Green went through a tough stretch as a starter early last season, former  Rams Coach Tom Penders (now at Texas) moved him to the bench. As the team's  sixth man, he helped Rhode Island reach the Final 16 of the National Collegiate  Athletic Association tournament.  </P> <P> Al Skinner, who succeeded Penders, kept Green in that role this season for the  Rams. He has appeared in 41 straight games as a reserve and is leading Rhode  Island in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots.  </P> <P> "I really think he's unique," Skinner said. "He wants to start and play as much  as he can, but I think what helps him accept his role so well is his maturity  and the fact that he knows we're going to utilize him to the best of his  abilities."  </P> <P> How much do the Oklahoma Sooners miss their senior center, All-American Stacey  King? Not much, if you judge solely by the box scores. In the four games that  King has missed, the high-scoring Sooners have averaged nearly 115 points a  game.  </P> <P> Oklahoma has scored more than 100 in nine straight games, three shy of  Nevada-Las Vegas' NCAA record. The Sooners should be able to break the mark,  with games against North Carolina-Charlotte on national television Saturday,  Nebraska, Pitt and Kansas.  </P> <P> Perhaps Mississippi Coach Ed Murphy has the right idea. Instead of putting his  leading scorer on the cover of this season's press guide, Murphy featured the  players who performed well in the classroom.  </P> <P> Fortunately, he had four players with a 3.0 or better grade-point average. At  some places, it would be a blank. Funny that Dean Smith, who has gone as far as  featuring assistant coaches on the cover of the North Carolina guide, didn't  think of it first.  </P> <P> Former Marquette Coach Rick Majerus has Ball State off to an 11-0 start in his  second season at the Muncie, Ind., school.  </P> <P> The Cardinals -- who have beaten Minnesota, Purdue and Northwestern -- are more  famous for all the mentions they get from the school's most publicized alum,  late-night talk show host David Letterman.  </P> <P> In the six years since the Big East went to nine schools, the postseason  tournament game between the bottom two teams almost has been the private domain  of Providence and Seton Hall.  </P> <P> The Friars have played in the game -- the winner gets to meet the first-place  team when the tournament officially begins -- four times. The Pirates also have  been in it four times.  </P> <P> It doesn't appear that they will meet this year, unless it's for the  championship. Both teams are undefeated. Providence is 11-0 going into  Connecticut Saturday, and 10th-ranked Seton Hall is 13-0 going into its game at  Syracuse Saturday night.  </P> <P> Four of this year's mainstays for first-year Providence Coach Rick Barnes had  personality clashes with former Coach Gordon Chiesa. Marty Conlon quit the team  after 11 games. Carlton Screen was benched. Both had played prominent roles  when the Friars went to the Final Four under Rick Pitino two years ago.  </P> <P> Barnes is being compared a great deal to Pitino, now with the New York Knicks.  According to Big East followers, about the only things they have in common are  their first names and their successful records. In two years as a head coach,  including one at George Mason, Barnes is 31-10.  </P> <P> "Rick (Barnes) doesn't take himself so seriously, like Pitino did," said one  Providence watcher.  </P> <P> The same can't be said about Barnes' Friars.  </P></p>

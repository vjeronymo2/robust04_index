			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Moody's Downgrades CalFed Debt: Moody's Investors Service downgraded ratings on  debt, commercial paper and deposits for CalFed and its California Federal Bank  subsidiary.  </P> <P> Moody's, which has downgraded credit ratings on several California banks and  thrifts recently, cited the Los Angeles thrift's "somewhat weak" capital,  uncertainty over the health of California real estate and "deteriorating asset  quality measures." About $875 million in long-term debt is affected. A CalFed  spokesman said the company is disappointed, adding that the thrift believes the  action reflects the rating agency's pessimism about California real estate.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'GREEN ACRES' REPRISE BRINGS ALBERT, GABOR HOME TO HOOTERVILLE  </P> <P> Can you sing the theme to "Green Acres?"  </P> <P> Do you remember Arnold the Pig? Goofy Lisa? Mr. Haney? Oliver Wendell Douglas?  </P> <P> Tonight on CBS, they're all down on the farm again in "Return to Green Acres,"  a made-for-TV movie with most of the original Hooterville cast.  </P> <P> Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor reprise their roles as a successful Manhattan lawyer  and his ditsy wife. They played the characters from 1965 to 1971 when CBS ended  its price supports for their make-believe farm.  </P> <P> Gabor -- who is sixtysomething -- is back on the publicity trail these days  doing interviews to promote the movie special.  </P> <P> "Here we are back again," she says. "Except for 'Lucy,' I don't know of any  other show that's been on as much as 'Green Acres.' It's on in Africa; it's  everywhere."  </P> <P> And though she loves the part, she thinks it has stereotyped her.  </P> <P> "Hollywood type-casts you always. It's very difficult to get out of that. I was  never given a chance to do a performance where the audience can see that I'm a  serious actress," she says.  </P> <P> When she arrived here from Budapest, Hungary, Gabor signed with Paramount  Pictures and did two unmemorable movies -- "Forced Landing" in 1941 and 1942's  "Pacific Blackout."  </P> <P> Paramount soon dropped her. Television, however, was kinder, as Gabor tackled  variety shows, guest appearances and even Chekhov, co-starring with Boris  Karloff in "Uncle Vanya."  </P> <P> People recognize her no matter where she goes, she says, oftentimes mistaking  her for her cop-slapping sister, Zsa Zsa. Being mixed up with her sister is  something she has had to deal with most of her life.  </P> <P> "It does not help to be from a family where there is so much chaos," she says,  and laughs. "I walk down the street and people yell, 'Hey, Zsa Zsa,' and I say,  'Not Zsa Zsa -- Eva!' "  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Xie Rong </F> (6200 2837)]    [Text] Ashgabat, 20 April (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng arrived in Ashgabat -- the second leg of his  five-Asian-nation tour -- from Tashkent on a special plane this  afternoon and began his three-day official visit to Turkmenistan.    Today, a wide expanse of clear, sunlit sky was visible over  Ashgabat, where spring was in the air. Slogans such as "Welcome  Chinese Premier Li Peng" and "Long live Turkmen-Chinese  friendship" written in Chinese on large streamers were hung over  the downtown's main streets and at the capital's airport.    A Boeing 767 special aircraft carrying Premier Li Peng and  his party landed at the capital's airport at 1750 (2050 Beijing  time). When Premier Li Peng began to walk down the steps from  his plane, President S.A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan, who was  waiting there, walked forward to him. They cordially shook  hands while exchanging greetings. Amid welcoming music, three  Turkmen girls in their national costumes presented Premier Li  Peng with bread, which symbolizes friendship. Several innocent  and lively boys presented Premier Li Peng and his wife, Zhu Lin,  with flowers.    President Niyazov presided over a grand ceremony. A military  band played the national anthems of China and Turkmenistan as Li  Peng, accompanied by Niyazov, reviewed the honor guard.    Later, Niyazov accompanied Li Peng in cars to the state  guesthouse, which is located in a botanical garden. Patrol  police and mounted police on large horses stood at attention and  saluted when the convoy of state guests passed by.    At the guesthouse, Li Peng and Niyazov had short but cordial  and friendly talks. Niyazov expressed his warm welcome to Li  Peng's visit. He said: The people of Turkmenistan have been  looking forward to Premier Li Peng's visit for a long time.  They have great respect for China's civilization in the past  and rapid economic growth of today. Li Peng expressed his  thanks for the warm reception by President Niyazov as well as by  the government and the people of Turkmenistan.    The two leaders expressed their hopes that in the next two  days they can extensively exchange their opinions on a series of  issues, including developing bilateral relations.    Premier Li Peng issued written remarks upon his arrival at  the airport. He said: China and Turkmenistan are friendly  neighbors. The peoples of the two countries have shared  centuries-old friendly contacts since the "Silk Road" linked the  two peoples 2,000 years ago. Since China and Turkmenistan  established diplomatic relations, their traditional friendship  has gained fresh growth.    He said: China attaches great importance to its relations  with Turkmenistan, and such ties enjoy good prospects for  further growth. He continued: "I am convinced that my visit will  further promote friendly cooperation between China and  Turkmenistan."    Those arriving at the airport on the same plane were Premier  Li Peng's delegation including Ismail Amat, State Councillor and  minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs  Commission; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Office of Foreign  Affairs.</p>

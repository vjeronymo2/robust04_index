			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Mulroney fears US will delay accord on free trade A NORTH American free trade agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico is unlikely to be in place this year, according to Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister. Mr Mulroney said in an interview with the Financial Times that the Nafta negotiations were going 'quite well' and may be completed this spring. But he had 'serious doubts' whether the US Congress would have either the time or the inclination to ratify the agreement before this November's elections. Mr Mulroney blamed the protectionist mood in Congress and the isolationism favoured by some candidates in the US primaries for a lengthening list of disputes between the US and Canada. In the past week, Washington has imposed curbs on Canada's two biggest exports to the US, cars and lumber. 'This has nothing to do with trade policy,' Mr Mulroney said. 'It has everything to do with politics.' The Canadians are especially angry over Washington's decision to deny duty-free access to Honda cars assembled in Ontario, and a Commerce Department ruling last Friday that Canadian softwood lumber exports are subsidised by low tree-cutting charges in provincially-owned forests. A 14.5 per cent countervailing duty has been imposed on lumber shipments. Canada is expected this week to consider retaliatory measures against US exports. 'We are their biggest market and their best customer, so we won't sit idly by and allow low-level functionaries to exercise retribution and harassment', Mr Mulroney said. Ottawa also plans to refer the Honda and lumber issues to bilateral dispute settlement panels set up under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement. These panels have become the Mulroney government's most powerful argument against domestic criticism that the FTA has failed to provide Canada with secure access to the US. 'Had it not been for the free trade agreement, we would have been as dead as doornails in the American market in this hostile climate,' Mr Mulroney said. 'What you have is a colossal volume of trade which is shielded from needless hostility.' Two-way trade between the US and Canada was about Dollars 200bn last year. Mr Mulroney said that he, President Bush and President Salinas de Gortari of Mexico would hold a telephone conference call next Monday to discuss progress in the Nafta talks. Some of the most intractable issues are not directly related to trade. They include Mexican immigration to the US, Mexico's energy, environment and labour laws, and Canadian concerns about automotive investment. Mr Mulroney said Canada remained committed to the Nafta, partly to protect the gains it made in the bilateral FTA, but also to ensure that it was included in any future moves towards a western hemisphere free trade zone. Mr Mulroney added that the US and Canada had an obligation to encourage economic development in countries such as Mexico, which are moving towards both economic and political liberalisation.</p>

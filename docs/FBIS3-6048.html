			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials and an article in vernacular Seoul dailies published  on 13 March on the result of the sixth North-South contact for  the exchange of special envoys.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an  800-word editorial entitled: "We Should Take a Firm Stance  Against the North's Shirking." The editorial denounces North  Korea for "gesturing as if it hopes to settle the issue for the  envoy exchange" and "easing up on its four key demands while not  agreeing to the envoy exchange." The editorial insists, in  return, "there should be no more tolerance nor magnanimity  toward the North." The editorial calls on the ROK and U.S.  Governments to "firmly express their will to put off  indefinitely the U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, set for 21  March, and to push ahead with a plan to resume the Team Spirit  exercise. "    Pointing out that the North issued a fresh demand that the  two sides jointly announce an "agreement on the principle of the  exchange of special envoys" before discussing procedural matters  for the exchange, the editorial reports that "Pyongyang attempts  to use this as overseas publicity that it has fulfilled the  precondition of `the envoy exchange,' while neglecting to  putting this into practice." The editorial concludes that "even  if the North may use the same old trick of placing blame on the  South, it is about time for us to inform the North side the  South is discontinuing meaningless working-level contacts."    The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries an  800-word editorial entitled "North Korea's True Intent is  Imaginable." Terming North Korea's intent of holding  working-level contacts with the ROK a "meaningless show"  designed to realize the high-level talks with the United States,  the editorial questions if working-level contacts are indeed  necessary under such circumstances. Making a detailed analysis  of North Korea's proposal that Seoul's envoy should visit  Pyongyang first around mid-April, the editorial reports "after  all, as Kim Il-song's birthday is 15 April, the North intends to  reduce the envoy's mission to mere participation in Kim Il-song  birthday celebrations and one of a congratulatory delegate."    With the failure to conclude discussions on the envoy  exchange, the editorial forecasts chances that the two sides  will exchange envoys before 21 March deadline have dimmed,  though are not completely dead. Then the editorial calls on the  ROK side to "deeply examine the issue on suspending the  contacts" to further avoid being ridiculed by Pyongyang and "to  manifest clearly to Pyongyang that our side can never accept the  envoy exchange through its insincere show or for the purpose of  its political celebration." The editorial concludes: "The ROK  and U.S. Governments should demonstrate a solid bilateral  alliance and their positive interest in inter-Korean contacts."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on page 3 carries  an  800-word editorial entitled: "We Should Properly Read the  North's True Intent." The editorial deplores that the ROK  Government has committed two mistakes from the start of  contacts: First, "its failure to commit in writing to the envoy  exchange in the North Korean-U.S. agreement"; and second, its  failure "to materialize ROK-North Korean-U.S. tripartite talks  to discuss the North's nuclear issue and inter-Korean issues."  The editorial contends: "This notwithstanding, the government  is optimistic about the North-South dialogues without any  reason." Stating that the North's basic policy toward  unification has not changed a bit, the editorial calls on the  government to "answer Pyongyang with firm principles by reading  Pyongyang's true intent and avoid being caught in a trap set by  the North."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on page 3 carries  a 700-word article by Kang Tae-ho on chances for the  simultaneous realization of the envoy exchange and the North  Korean-U.S. high-level talks. The article appraises Pyongyang  for showing flexibility by its backing down on the four  preconditions it had set for the envoy exchange. Quoting the  Chief ROK delegate Song Yong-tae's remark that "North Korea has  expressed its intention that the four issues can be discussed in  the process of exchanging envoys. This can be interpreted as a  virtual withdrawal of the four preconditions," the article  assesses such a stance of the North as a step forward to the  envoy exchange. Calculating each side's loss and gain from the  sixth round of contacts, the editorial notes "the North gained  the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit whereas the ROK  and U.S. sides have attained International Atomic Energy Agency  inspection of the North's nuclear facilities." The article  concludes: "Based on this, it is possible that the tripartite  parties will agree to the envoy exchange simultaneously with the  third round of North Korean-U.S. high-level talks."</p>

Central Asia Republics  Update Their Positions"]    [Excerpts] Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan government  delegations were in Moscow on Saturday. Agreed with Kyrgyzstan  was the volume of mutual deliveries in 1994. The subject of  negotiations with Tajik Premier Abdudzhalil Samadov was broader  -- not only trade and economic cooperation in the current year,  but also updating the side's positions in connection with the  republic's joining the ruble zone. [passage omitted]    The Tajik delegation faced a more difficult task. Among  other things, it was to finalize the questions of the country's  joining the ruble zone. Those were also discussed with Economy  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and Central Bank Chairman Viktor  Gerashchenko. Tajikistan received the Bank of Russia's "okay"  for setting aside for the republic the second batch of 60  billion rubles in cash to be exchanged for the old money on  condition that Dushanbe provides collateral in gold. It is this  condition that proved unacceptable for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan  last November when projects for a ruble zone consisting of six  states were actively discussed. To all appearances, neither can  Tajikistan, despite the assurances that it is ready to enter the  ruble zone, fully meet this condition. Instead, Moscow has been  offered two electric power stations -- the Nurek and the Rogun.  The Tajik side also promises to introduce into its legislation  on foreign investments specific changes to safeguard Russia's  interests.    The difficult military-political situation in Tajikistan  makes the wisdom of such acquisitions rather debatable for  Russia. A Russian government delegation led by German  Kuznetsov, deputy minister for cooperation with the CIS  countries, is leaving for Dushanbe today. The delegation is to  specify the Russian side's stance on the questions of  Tajikistan's joining the Russian monetary system.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Management: Sir John, get rid of those ties - Lucy Kellaway speaks to an image consultant about the dress sense of Britain's captains of industry When you cross your legs are there two inches of flesh between where the socks end and the trousers begin? Do you polish your shoes only when you notice they are scruffy? Do you hang your suits on wire hangers? Is your hairstyle the same as it was 10 years ago? If the answer is yes to most of these questions you need help. That is the view of Mary Spillane, founder of CMB Image Consultants, who has made a living over the last 10 years telling British men how to look better. She has encouraged the bosses of the former nationalised industries to cast off their cheap suits made from indestructable fibres. She is now hard at work encouraging British Rail managers that executives of go-ahead private companies do not wear ties that end mid-belly. British businessmen generally - and not just those who are being smartened up to be sold off - are beginning to take care about the way they look. Yet according to Spillane, surveys still show that British businessmen are regarded as the worst dressed in Europe. It is not just vanity that is at stake: looking good is said to be an important first step to getting the job, doing the deal and winning the debate. She believes the sartorial style of John Major, the UK prime minister, sets a bad example. She was horrified to see him recently wearing his first double-breasted suit, which he evidently did not know how to do up. 'There was then a hysterical dance by the leader of the country looking for his buttons.' Despite Major's recent conversion, double-breasted suits are out, she says. So, too, are white collars, which decapitate the wearer, and stripey shirts, which are too hard on the eye. The guiding principle is that businessmen should be more conscious of what they wear, should consider their audience and the effect they want to have on it and should dress explicitly with that in mind. Yet just giving their appearance a bit of thought does not mean they get it right. The Financial Times asked Spillane to comment on the appearance of some of British industry's most notable dressers, and found that she was often less than impressed. Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI, is perhaps the most notorious dresser in business. He has become almost as famous for his ties and for his flowing locks as for his oft-repeated views on the ills of British management. Yet Spillane describes him as a 'complete mess' and is horrified by his wayward hair, the flecks of dandruff on his collar and his crumpled suits. She recommends that he change his shampoo, grow his hair longer so that he can wear it in a pony-tail, and buy a trouser press. She also strongly urges him to do something about those ties. 'His personality is larger than life and he does not need the stupid ties.' He can still wear fun ties, but the gardenias flapping around his neck should not arrive before he does. Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, another well-known dresser with his jazzy sweaters and his shirts open to the waist, does not know where to stop, argues Spillane. She applauds the casual sweater he wore for negotiations with British Airways, as it sent out the message that Virgin is the antithesis of the other airline, more user friendly, more trustworthy. Yet to address the conservatively clad Institute of Directors in shirt-sleeves without a tie was going too far. 'It was a very arrogant gesture. His message would have been stronger if he had shown more respect.' While she thinks it appropriate that his unconventional approach to business should be reflected in casual dress, she quibbles with his taste. 'The poor chap is colour blind. You see him on TV and what he is saying is gripping but you can't listen. Your eyes are drawn down to that catastrophe of a sweater.' Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, is not an establishment business figure and his appearance seeks to get the idea across. He sports a beard, which is still regarded as an act of defiance by a captain of industry. Sugar's facial growth is deemed beyond the pale by Spillane. 'Because it is so multicoloured, it looks dirty, as if he still has Marmite and cornflakes in it.' The cut-away collar and the big chunky knot also come in for disapproval: 'They are very 1970s.' She thinks that for someone who has been through difficult times and who has needed the support of shareholders, a cleaner image might have been better. John Birt, director-general of the BBC, is trying to bring about a management revolution at the corporation and deems the best way to present himself for that delicate task is in an Armani suit. The publicity photographs sent out by the BBC show him looking dapper, fashionable in an understated sort of way. Spillane thinks his ties are fantastic: 'They show he knows it's 1993.' She also likes the soft European shirt, which is perfectly matched by his European suit. Yet far from giving Birt high marks for general appearance, she thinks the photograph lies. 'He looks marvellous in the pictures, but when you see him standing up he looks like he is in a bin liner covered in wrinkles.' She advises him to give each suit a two-week holiday in between outings to let the fabric rest. The option of an Armani suit is not open to Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer who is more or less obliged to wear the same M&amp;S suits he sells to the average British businessman. Spillane thinks the look is 'presentable' yet notes that the single button on his jacket strains over his stomach. She does not like the way his handkerchief has just been plonked into the breast pocket and thinks the average paisley tie would be appropriate 'for a guy going nowhere'. For greater authority, in keeping with his status, she recommends a plain, woven silk tie, set off by a patterned handkerchief. Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown), the blue-blooded ex-governor of the Bank of England, sports expensive hand-tailored Savile Row suits with trousers that begin just under the armpits. 'He has no waist. He should never be caught without his jacket on. His suits are very heavy, far too heavy for today's heated offices and do not drape well. To Europeans his image says stuffy, dated, boring.' Yet not everyone gets torn apart by Spillane. She thoroughly approves of Lord Hanson, the chairman of the Anglo-American conglomerate. He looks the 'quintessential businessman' with his trim suits, hand-made shirts, double cuffs and cuff-links. His tie and handkerchief complement each other, but never match. Yet not all the credit for this pleasing effect goes to his tailor nor even to his colour sense. 'You have to think of the raw material you start with. There's a great body under there.' There is a message here for businessmen in general. Looking better may not be about throwing out the old wardrobe and starting again. 'If most British businessmen went on a treadmill three times a week, the clothes they have would look much better on them,' she says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Arturo Gudino] </F>   [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 May (AFP) -- Opposition  presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez today announced  that should the Central Electoral Board (JCE) proclaim President  Joaquin Balaguer the winner, the elected mayors, deputies, and  senators of his party will not take office. This, in all light,  would provoke an institutional crisis that would prevent  Balaguer, should he be proclaimed winner, from ruling the  country beginning on 16 August, date scheduled for the change of  government.    After the 16 May general elections, Pena Gomez made  accusations of a massive fraud in favor of Balaguer, who is  seeking reelection to a seventh term. According to Pena Gomez,  the JCE Computer Center and at least two of its five magistrates  planned the fraud through a computer maneuver that left about  200,000 citizens, who could not vote and were replaced by others  "who voted twice," off from the voting list    In statements to the media, Pena Gomez said that if Balaguer  is proclaimed the winner before clarifying the serious  irregularities that were denounced, his deputies, senators, and  mayors will not take office. With only eight voting tables  pending count, Balaguer was ahead of Pena Gomez, but by only 1  percent of the votes, that is, about 30,000. Should this trend  be repeated in the vote count for deputies, senators, and  mayors, where the PRD [Dominican Revolutionary Party] could win  a majority, Balaguer might be unable to rule, because the  congressional chambers would not be operational.    "No winner has been proclaimed and cannot be proclaimed, but  if they try to do so, they should know that there would be an  illegitimate government in place, which we will combat by all  means," Pena Gomez said. "We will not legalize any usurper,"  added the black Social Democratic leader in a vigorous tone.    Pena Gomez has so far prevented street demonstrations by his  followers, in an effort to avoid any violence, and has shown  impartiality, an image that contrasts with the one that the  official party tried to sell during the electoral campaign.    Pena Gomez said that in the past hours, he has received  solidarity calls from Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres,  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, and Portuguese  President Mario Soares. He added that he will send missions to  Europe and America to show that his charges are based on  reality. Meanwhile, various sectors of Dominican society  started to demand a solution to the crisis through an agreement  between the various political forces and President Balaguer.</p>

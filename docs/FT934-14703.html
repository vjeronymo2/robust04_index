			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Watchdog warns on tendering: Civil service honesty 'at risk' PARLIAMENT'S public expen-diture watchdog has warned the government that civil service reforms such as market-testing and contracting out are threatening standards of public honesty and accountability. Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office, says in his annual report published today that private-sector organisations providing public services need to learn the rules for handling public money and being more accountable for their activities. 'If improved services are to be provided at less cost and under appropriate control, public and private-sector cultures must blend rather than clash,' he says. 'Enterprise and initiative should not be stifled by unnecessary bureaucracy, but probity in the spending of public money must not be sacrificed in the effort to get the job done.' The NAO audits the accounts of almost 500 government departments, agencies and quangos and examines their efficiency. Sir John has been monitoring developments such as the creation of executive agencies to deliver public services, changes in organisations to delegate responsibility to line managers and the market-testing of civil service work. He sees four weaknesses in bringing private-sector disciplines to public services: Weak financial monitoring and controls. These led to 'major failings' in the management of a Pounds 43m computer project in the Wessex Health Authority area. Lack of clear lines of responsibility and accountability. At the Welsh Development Agency redundancy payments were made without approval from the Welsh Office. Conflicts of interest. In the Wessex case a member of the authority was connected with a company tendering for computer equipment. Improper application of financial controls. The Ministry of Defence made Pounds 1.2m of irregular payments under an incentive award scheme. The NAO saved the taxpayer Pounds 238m last year, up from Pounds 200m in 1991 and more than six times the cost of running the office. Annual Report 1993.

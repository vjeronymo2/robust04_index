			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Battle for the heart of once thriving town: Roland Adburgham finds echoes of past defeats in Bridgwater A forlorn handwritten notice at what was once J. Sainsbury's store in Bridgwater, Somerset, and is now an Oxfam charity shop, reads: 'Please do not leave donations in doorway (due to arson).' Sainsbury decamped five years ago to a superstore with 22 checkouts, a coffee shop and petrol station, on the edge of the town centre. At mid-morning its car park is stuffed with cars and the store is buzzing. Meanwhile, back in town, a handful of people wander among the racks of skirts (90p) and jackets (50p) in what locals refer to as 'the largest Oxfam shop in Britain'. In an even bigger shock to the town, Marks and Spencer pulled out of its small but prime site soon after the move by Sainsbury. The nearest M and S is now 11 miles down the M5 at Taunton. Its old premises are occupied by a B Wise discount store with garish orange posters advertising a sale. Bridgwater, with a population of 30,000, was a thriving industrial town, renowned for its now-closed docks and its Guy Fawkes carnival. Its doomed support for the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion is recalled by such pubs as The Cross Rifles and The Volunteer Arms. Three hundred years ago the locals lost the Battle of Sedgemoor. Today another battle is being lost. The town's most famous son was Admiral Robert Blake, who died at sea in 1657. His statue, perhaps symbolically, shows him looking one way but pointing another. In an era of fast-changing shopping trends, Bridgwater shows little indication of knowing in which direction to take its centre. Its modern covered shopping precinct, Angel Place, has a Safeway store, but the company is building a superstore outside the town centre which it plans to open next spring. To help it gain consent it has promised Sedgemoor District Council, the planning authority, that it will continue trading at Angel Place for two years. More competition will come from a retail park being built next to the new Sainsbury. It will include another food store, a Currys superstore, Carpetright and Wickes building suppliers. Much of central Bridgwater already looks down-at-heel. Around the old Sainsbury, 10 other premises are vacant and several other sites are occupied by charity shops. The landlord of a pub says he has tried to sell for 12 months. 'I don't think I'll get much for it.' The pedestrianised main shopping street looks healthier. WH Smith is being refurbished and the other shops include Dorothy Perkins, Boots and Next. The stalls in the old market house may be tatty but there are plenty of customers. Walk a few yards and it becomes rather seedier. A gaggle of young travellers drink cider. In the adjacent high street, there are eight empty premises and yet more charity shops. EH Hooper, 'silk mercer &amp; draper, millinery &amp; mantles', has a half-price clearance sale. The galleried chamber of the former town hall, a handsome building designed in 1823, is occupied by trestle tables with plants for sale. Mr Mike Wain, owner of the Old Vicarage restaurant, said: 'In the town centre there is a complete pattern of downtrading. Bridgwater can never compete with Taunton, but it should be kept with its quaintness and funny little shops. There needs to be complementary shopping to the superstores. It's ever so sad. There's an awful lot of enthusiasm in the town - we want a better town but we don't get any support from the council.' Mr Nick Miles of the local business forum blamed the council for what he described as its intransigence. 'The future is extremely gloomy. A lot of people earn well but go elsewhere to shop. Bridgwater is a massively missed opportunity,' he said. Conservative-controlled Sedgemoor council commissioned Hillier Parker, the property consultancy, to suggest how the heart of the town could be revitalised. Among its recommendations was more pedestrianisation, but last week councillors deferred a decision and will wait to see what impact the new Safeway has on the area. Mr Barry Juniper, the council's principal planning officer, said the council was concerned but added: 'We all have to recognise that a lot of casualties are due to the recession, as opposed to changing retail patterns.' The council, he said, drew a firm distinction between edge-of-town retail development, which it discouraged, and edge-of-centre. He was doubtful whether there would have been grounds for refusing the existing developments, even under the Department of the Environment's recent planning guidance, which shows more concern for the viability of town centres. He said: 'The council can't say 'come back M and S'. We would be wasting our breath. But my own view is that we do need to do something about physically improving the public spaces.' A woman shopper was fatalistic. 'Bridgwater has lost a bit of character  - but it seems to be happening everywhere, doesn't it?' This is the last report in our series on the state of Britain's urban centres. The previous two appeared in the Tuesday and Wednesday editions.</p>

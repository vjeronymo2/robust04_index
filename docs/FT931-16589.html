			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Course charted followed guidelines ENVIRONMENTALISTS have questioned the presence of an ageing oil tanker off the coast of one of the UK's most fragile ecosystems, but there is no evidence to suggest that the Braer was flouting marine guidelines. About 1,000 tankers a year chart the notoriously choppy waters of the 22-mile-wide channel separating Sumburgh Head from Fair Isle. The Braer had loaded oil from Statoil's Gullfaks field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. It had left Norway on Sunday to sail for Quebec, carrying Dollars 11m-worth of oil for Ultramar's Canadian refinery. The tanker's route took it into the channel amid a force 10 storm. The crew charted a course through the middle of the channel, but engine problems caused the tanker to drift out of control. Mr Paul Roberts of Ocean Routes, which tracks the weather and plans routes for tankers, said: 'They (tankers) plot their course based on a weather forecast that extends three days ahead, but that won't show a lot on a 15 to 16-day voyage.'</p>

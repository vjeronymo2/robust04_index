Kotlukhuzhin, </F> Ufa-Magnitogorsk, under rubric "On the Basis of Stability:  Republic President Murtaza Rakhimov Gives Assurance That  Bashkortostan Will Continue a Policy of Mutually Advantageous  Cooperation With Its Neighbors"]    [Text] On 12 December in the neighboring Republic of  Bashkortostan, simultaneously with the election to the Russian  Federal Assembly, the election of the first president in the  republic's history took place. Two candidates laid claim to that  position -- Murtaza Rakhimov, chairman of the republic's Supreme  Soviet, and Rafis Kadyrov, chairman of the board of the Vostok  [East] Bank. The results of the voting showed that M. G.  Rakhimov won with a large advantage.    Our oblast, and especially Magnitka [Magnitogorsk] and  its metallurgical plant in particular, is linked with  Bashkortostan by traditionally deep mutual economic interests.  We are also brought closer together by common sociopolitical  problems and the need to resolve them by combined efforts. This  explains our striving to meet with the president of  Bashkortostan.    Despite the fact that he was extremely busy preparing  for the session of the republic's Supreme Soviet and for his  inauguration, Murtaza Gubaydullovich Rakhimov nevertheless  managed to find time for a quarter of an hour to answer a number  of my questions.    [Kotlokhuzhin] First of all, Murtaza Gubaydullovich, please  accept our congratulations on your having been elected the  president of Bashkortostan. I saw in the republic press that one  of the first persons to congratulate you was B. N. Yeltsin. Does  that mean that the sovereignization of Bashkortostan is being  supported at the highest state level?    [Rakhimov] Thank you for the congratulation. Actually, I  received two telegrams from the president of Russia. Boris  Nikolayevich also congratulated me on my having been elected  deputy to the Federation Council of the Russian Federal Assembly.    But the sovereignization of Bashkortostan could not  encounter  any opposition from the center, inasmuch as it does not present  any threat to the integrity of Russia. Our republic was, and  continues to be, one of the most powerful subjects in the makeup  of the Russian Federation. I might recall that, on a voluntary  basis, we have been part of the Russian state for more than four  centuries. And we shall continue to strive not to weaken, but to  strengthen, that historical unity. We proceed from the idea that  the Russian Federation will be strong in proportion to the  strength of its subjects. Therefore we shall support an  efficient separation of the powers between the federal agencies  of state authority and the republics' agencies of authority, and  the independence of the Federation's subjects in many areas of  socioeconomic life.    We are also convinced that Russia can become strong if we  are  able to unite among ourselves to achieve a common goal -- the  creation of a prosperous society. If we are able to guarantee  the supremacy of the law and a truly federal system, without  infringing upon the rights of anyone, or any nation. In Russia  the Law governs, rather than any single party, clan, or  individual.    [Kotlokhuzhin] Exactly four years ago, at the first congress  of the Bashkir Ural [Urals] Social Center, I proposed including  a small line in the telegram demanding the granting of political  sovereignty to Bashkortostan: "on the basis of economic  independence." At that time the proposal did not find any  support. Today the economic independence of your republic is the  chief condition for sovereignty.    [Rakhimov] Naturally, without any broad economic  independence  there cannot be any true sovereignty. I am convinced that if  Gorbachev had granted the Baltic republics economic independence  promptly, it would have been possible to avoid the collapse of  the USSR. And under today's conditions of the complete collapse  of the country's economy, which I consider to be simply a crime  against the nation, sovereignty is necessary to multi-ethnic  Bashkortostan in order to guarantee to its people a worthy life.  For this purpose it is necessary create in the republic those  conditions in which every citizen -- irrespective of his  nationality, religion, or social status -- can, without any  restrictions, engage in his job, demonstrate all his  capabilities and receive just compensation for his labor, and be  calm concerning his own life and the life of his children. The  republic's economic independence guarantees more rights and  opportunities to the cities and rayons in carrying out their  social development programs.    [Kotlokhuzhin] What paths do you see and plan, Murtaza  Gubaydullovich, for getting out of the present complicated  socioeconomic situation?    [Rakhimov] What we need first of all are political and  social  stability, consent among nationalities, and the prevention of  indecisive actions. It is necessary to restore and stabilize  production, to develop our life on the basis of all forms of  ownership, to encourage private enterprise and business, and to  encourage investments in the republic's economy. I feel that  stability in the regions is necessary in order to save Russia  from collapse.    The main error in reforming the economy, in my opinion, is  the making of encroachments on the producer. In our republic we  are planning a new course. The producer in Bashkortostan will  receive the state's complete support in the high-priority  economic areas. We feel that economic reforms must be carried  out in the interests of people. And we choose as our unshakeable  rule the following: any reform must be carried out only in the  event that it improves people's lives.    Of course, the economy of Bashkortostan cannot develop in  complete isolation from the economy of Russia, or the entire  former Union. The negative consequences of the universal  economic collapse did not bypass us. So, just as pertains  everything, although perhaps only to a lesser degree, our  volumes of production are dropping. Among your neighbors, for  example, at the Beloretsk Metallurgical Combine, a powerful  wire-making machine is standing idle because of the lack of  production orders.    Nevertheless, the steps being taken by us are already  yielding certain positive results. In our republic we have not  allowed a reduction in the volumes of housing construction, and  we consider this to be a major achievement. It apparently will  be important for the people of Chelyabinsk to know that we also  are not allowing a complete drop in agricultural production,  since your oblast, and particularly Magnitka, receives a rather  large amount of food products from Bashkortostan. We plan to  continue to render effective support to agriculture, without  making any distinctions at such time among the forms of  ownership. We are ready to help everyone -- the kolkhozes,  sovkhozes, and individual farmers -- so long as they manage  their farms effectively. That is the main criterion.    And the rural areas respond to this attention by performing  work well. I am aware that in Chelyabinsk and Orenburg oblasts a  rather large number of fields remained unharvested during the  recent serious autumn. That did not occur in our republic. All  the grain was harvested.    [Kotlokhuzhin] One can only rejoice at your successes. Am I  correct in thinking that, with this attempt on your part to  achieve stability and to preserve your previous economic ties,  the Magnitogorsk metallurgists apparently have the right to  count on the continuation of the mutually advantageous  cooperation with Bashkortostan?    [Rakhimov] There should be no doubts about this! The  cooperation will continue on the basis of the long-term contract  that was signed by us two years ago with the leadership of the  Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine. In exchange for metal  products, Bashkortostan will continue the shipment of food  products and of petroleum and chemical products.    [Kotlokhuzhin] The interests of the MMK [Magnitogorsk  Metallurgical Combine] are not limited only to this.  Recreational centers for the combine and for other industrial  enterprises are situated on the territory of Abzelilovskiy and  Belorechnyy rayons. Do your political concept and the program  for developing economic cooperation make it possible to hope not  only for their preservation, but also for further development?    [Rakhimov] Of course. I reemphasize that we are not planning  to isolate ourselves, to separate ourselves, or to speculate  with our sovereignty. We have enough land, both for the  recreational centers for the Magnitogorsk metallurgists and for  other good deeds. So we shall continue to live in peace and  harmony, and, on the basis of mutually advantage cooperation, to  strive for a good life for all working people, wherever they  live -- in Bashkortostan or in Magnitka.    [Kotlokhuzhin] Thank you, Murtaza Gubaydullovich, for the  conversation. On behalf of the readers of our newspaper,I would  like to wish you success in your important endeavors.    [Rakhimov] Rakhmat. Khau bulygyz! Good luck!</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honolulu, March 20 (XINHUA) -- APEC [Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation] finance ministers agreed here today that  sound macroeconomic policies, stability and cross-border  exchange would enhance economic development in the Asia-Pacific  region.    The consensus was included in a joint ministerial statement  on guiding policy formation of the APEC members which issued at  the end of the ministers meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC).    The ministers recognized the "sound macroeconomic policies  and stability should remain a pillar of sustained, low-inflation  growth in the region."    "Increasing cross-border flows of goods, services and  investment should be another pillar for strong economic  performance in the region," the ministers said in the statement.    They also agreed that further development of capital markets  is needed for effective mobilization and allocation of private  and business capital.    The one-day meeting discussed some of the fundamental  economic challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region, including  sustaining growth with low inflation, financing investment and  infrastructure development.    The ministers also discussed the issues of promoting capital  and market development. It had been stressed at the meeting  that large and growing inflows of private investment from  external sources have been, and will continue to be crucial.    The ministers agreed that they will pursue policies which  promote ongoing large and diversified inflows of foreign direct  investment.    The ministers decided to meet again next year in Indonesia  to  consult on specific issues as well as regional economic  development as a whole.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told a press  conference  after the meeting that the ministers also "agreed on the  importance of concluding the Uruguay Round and implementing its  results."    Asked about relations between China and the United States,  Bentsen said, "I must say that U.S.- China relationship is very  important to the United States, to China and to all of Asia."    The APEC finance ministers meeting was convened under the  vision statement issued November 20, 1993, in Seattle, when the  APEC leadership conference was held.    APEC accounts for over 40 percent of world trade and over 13  trillion in output. It groups Australia, Canada, Brunei, China,  Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea,  Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States.    Chile was invited to the meeting as an observer pending to  its full membership to the organization in 1995. The 17-member  group was founded in 1989 as a loose organization aimed at  promoting trade, investment and economic cooperation.</p>

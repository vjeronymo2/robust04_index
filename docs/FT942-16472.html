			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Property: Buy now while new homes last - Gerald Cadogan foresees some major changes in how and where people live New homes are as old as residential property. They started thousands of years ago when men first moved out of caves into shelters they had built. Since then, humans have never stopped building and moving. New homes are a reliable indicator - anywhere in the world, at any time - of an economy's strength. And revived interest in them probably is the clearest sign that the tide of a recession is turning. Although business is slow in the higher reaches of the UK market, where many potential vendors are not yet confident enough of recession's end to offer their houses, business has been booming at the lower end where you find most new-home sales - so much so that builders have been able to clear units that were in the pipeline, and too late to stop, when recession struck. The House Builders' Federation (HBF) has reported that a steadily-growing number of people viewed houses in February while 28 per cent of companies reported price increases (the March figures will be out soon). The HBF says, too, that more detached houses are selling and fewer flats. The Corporate Estate Agents are not quite so optimistic. Viewing the market as a whole, they reported a 4 per cent fall in offers subject to contract in January and February, compared with 1993. This suggests that builders of new homes have been taking a larger share of a slightly reduced overall market; housing starts rose 18 per cent in 1993 over 1992. Several builders have gone public (such as Beazer Homes and Wainhomes, both now on a small discount to offer price reflecting the general change in the stock market) or are going public (such as Redrow). And, with a purr of pleasure, companies report that more clients are buying off plan before building has begun. This more or less guarantees a sale. Builders, however, are starting to complain that development land prices have risen too sharply, which soon works its way through into higher house prices. Many blame restrictive government planning policies for producing a shortage of what they see as good sites (those in greenfield areas being top of the list). A fundamental change of government attitude seems to be emerging in that there appears to be a tilt against the motor car. That would, for instance, have the immediate effect of making planning permission far harder to acquire for out-of-town shopping centres. The patterns of American-style daily life to which Britons have grown used in the past five to 10 years are, apparently, going into reverse. If true, the effect on new homes would be dramatic. Drive around now and you see that most of these are being erected on the edges of towns and villages on the greenfield sites which the builders find easy to work. Such developments are in the mainstream of modern new homes, and not just those in Britain. Fundamentally suburban, such as the UK's 'garden suburbs,' they grew quickly after the first world war through the spread of commuter trains and cars, coupled with a belief in owning a house on your own plot. Sooner or later, though, builders of new homes will have to turn to such town-centre eyesores as derelict factories and warehouses, and open spaces sprouting nothing more productive than weeds. These need more initial clearing and preparation of the ground than greenfield sites, and there could well be social problems in the middle of a town or city. But, with imagination, these can be overcome. In the meantime, buy that traditional, edge-of-town new home while they remain available. Local newspapers offer plenty of choice, although without the discounts and extras that enticed buyers two years ago in the worst of the recession. Pebble dash renderings and rising sun motifs in the garden gate or the fanlight over the front door - popular themes in the 1930s - are out; indeed, garden gates have almost disappeared as another US habit reaches the UK. (This also saves the builder money). Contrasting brickwork is the fashion just now in new homes, shopping centres and office blocks. Expect also that a new home will be far more energy-efficient than its predecessors, and ask what certification it has. Ideal Homes finds that its three-bedroomed 'Surrey' house, designed for the growing family, is particularly popular. One feature is the amount of wardrobe space, including making proper use of the dead area under the stairs. And two-bedroom houses go well with the 'trade-down' section of the market, perhaps for such buyers as professional (perhaps divorced) women who need an extra room for guests or even visiting children. At the top of the market, Crosby Homes in Cheshire (part of the Berkeley Group) is selling new houses at up to Pounds 500,000. Several are in a consciously Victorian style (and, thus, use polychrome brickwork). One development at Broom Lane in Higher Broughton, Salford (Greater Manchester), is intended for the local Hasidic Jewish community. Almost opposite the synagogue, it is ideal for those who must walk to worship.

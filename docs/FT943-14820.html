			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: UK seeks to recoup South Africa ground Britain's trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, and 60 businessmen are in South Africa this week to try to recoup lost ground in what was once a leading trade partnership. Partly as a result of the UK Conservative party's resistance to sanctions during the apartheid era, British relations with the new government are weaker than with the old. At the same time the UK finds itself fourth in South Africa's trading league behind the US, Germany and Japan. Mr Heseltine's visit follows ones by US commerce secretary Ron Brown and French president Francois Mitterrand which have been seen as part of a drive to reap possible commercial rewards for those countries' support for sanctions during the anti-apartheid struggle. 'South Africa is now perceived as a country with which to do business,' says Mr John Doble, British consul-general in Johannesburg, who says British companies have made more than 60 investments since 1990. On the investment side, the UK has for more than a century remained unchallenged as South Africa's single biggest foreign investor with about R50bn (Pounds 8.8bn) in stock and assets. South Africans hold about R35bn in Britain. Two-way trade between the UK and South Africa amounted to R10.25bn in 1993 slightly in the UK's favour. Britain's imports are primarily of raw materials and food and vegetable products. It exports mostly pharmaceuticals, machinery and, more recently, telecommunications equipment. The UK Export Credits Guarantee Department already has Pounds 1.3bn in export credits outstanding in South Africa, the agency's fourth-biggest commitment. In the first four months of this year British exports to South Africa grew by 20.2 per cent. Imports from South Africa increased only 2.3 per cent, although some sectors, such as fruit and wine, are expected to grow by about 30 per cent for the year. In the defence sector, South Africa is known to be in the market for up to six navy corvettes worth about Pounds 1bn, and if Britain could secure the contract it might help save the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside. At the same time Britain is considering buying South African Rooivalk attack helicopters as part of a total order for 90 helicopters costing about Pounds 2bn and there is speculation that a reciprocal arrangement could be worked out. Mr Heseltine discussed the issue yesterday with Mr Joe Modise, South African defence minister, and an announcement may be made before the end of the week. 'We're cautiously optimistic that something will be achieved,' said a British defence official.</p>

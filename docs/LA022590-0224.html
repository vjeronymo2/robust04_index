			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> The new TV movie -- and series pilot -- A Family for Joe (NBC Sunday at 8 p.m.)  stars Robert Mitchum as a homeless man recruited by four orphans to pose as  their grandfather.  </P> <P> Challenger (ABC Sunday at 8 p.m.), another new TV movie, tells the story of the  seven astronauts who died in the misfired 1986 Challenger flight. Karen Allen  heads the cast as schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.  </P> <P> Sparks: The Price of Passion (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), still another new TV  movie, stars Victoria Principal as an outspoken, recently elected mayor of  Albuquerque.  </P> <P> Losin' It (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) is an unfortunate 1982 movie about three  Southern California high school boys (Tom Cruise, Jackie Earle Haley and John  Stockwell) trying to lose their virginity in Tijuana in the '60s. Most of the  film smirks and sneers at every conceivable stereotype of Mexican border-town  corruption.  </P> <P> The Fourth Protocol (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 8 p.m.)  is a misfired 1987 spy thriller, laying waste to Michael Caine, Pierce Brosnan,  Joanna Cassidy and others.  </P> <P> Michael Tucker and Juliette Lewis star in Too Young to Die (NBC Monday at 9  p.m.), a new TV movie about a minor forced to stand trial for murder as an  adult.  </P> <P> Another new TV movie, Daughter of the Streets (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) stars Jane  Alexander as a mother determined to rescue her teen-age daughter (Roxana Zal)  from prostitution.  </P> <P> Stolen: One Husband (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Valerie  Harper as a wife determined that her husband (Elliott Gould) of 25 years is not  going to leave her.  </P> <P> The Squeeze (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a by-the-numbers romantic comedy  with Michael Keaton as a free-spirited New York artist-designer who joins  forces with scrappy skip tracer Rae Dawn Chong.  </P> <P> The Electric Horseman (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a sleek entertainment  which finds TV reporter Jane Fonda in pursuit of Robert Redford, a former rodeo  champion who rebels against his current employer, a breakfast food  conglomerate.  </P> <P> Michael Crichton's Looker (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a diverting  science fiction thriller obsessed with the possibilities of human duplication.  Albert Finney and James Coburn star.  </P> <P> Jonathan Demme's 1984 entertaining Swing Shift (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is  an astonishingly accurate evocation of World War II L.A. Goldie Hawn stars as a  demure housewife transformed by her new job as a war factory riveter. Kurt  Russell and scene-stealing Christine Lahti co-star.  </P> <P> Noel Nosseck's fine little 1981 film King of the Mountain (Channel 9 Saturday  at 8 p.m.) tells of the vintage, lethal ritual of young men racing their  souped-up cars on Mulholland Drive. Harry Hamlin and Dennis Hopper star.  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P></p>

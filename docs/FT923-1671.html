			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / MAI lifts profits by 7% to Pounds 71.2m MAI, the UK-based financial services group headed by Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, increased its pre-tax profit by 7 per cent to Pounds 71.2m in the year to June 30. Growth came mainly from money and securities broking, which accounted for two thirds of group sales, and from the much smaller information division, which includes the NOP market research organisation. With Pounds 100m cash in hand, interest income rose from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 10.4m. Lord Hollick, managing director, said the year-end cash position was unchanged in spite of capital spending of Pounds 62m, up from Pounds 24m a year earlier. MAI's main investment project is Meridian Broadcasting, which won the ITV licence for the south and south-east of England, replacing TVS Entertainment. MAI has 61 per cent of Meridian, which will begin broadcasting next January. Lord Hollick said MAI's share of the investment in studios and start-up capital would amount to Pounds 30m. TVS's Southampton studios had been bought for Pounds 7.5m and another site had been leased, saving about Pounds 20m compared with the cost of building new facilities. Meridian, which would have annual turnover of more than Pounds 150m, should start to contribute to profit in 1993-94. Operating profit from the main part of the business grew by Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 55.2m on turnover of Pounds 389m, up from Pounds 361.5m. But a disappointing result from Avenir, the French media business in which it has reduced its stake to 15.5 per cent, dragged down the proceeds from associates. Wholesale broking contributed Pounds 44m to operating profit, up 11 per cent. Lord Hollick said the US wing had done well in money broking and corporate bonds. The cut in dollar interest rates had stimulated activity. The weaker pound would help MAI's earnings this year. 'With nearly 50 per cent of our profits in US dollars, we were having to peddle very fast to stay abreast.' The group would also benefit from the recent high level of activity in the money markets. 'A reduction in European interest rates would also help the markets,' he said. Earnings per share rose to 13.7p, from 12.6p. A final dividend of 4.6p makes a total of 6p, up 9 per cent.

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Banking fears hit Japanese stocks Japanese stock prices dived 2.9 per cent yesterday, as fears gathered about the health of the banking system and the onset of an economic recovery, which is fading into the distance. The Nikkei average fell below 17,000 to 16,726.37, ending the week down 6.8 per cent and reflecting renewed concern about the country's banks after they disclosed sharply lower profits and higher non-performing loans. Tokyo's index of banking stocks slipped 5.4 per cent yesterday, as attention was drawn to the banks' attempts to cope with the consequences of their reckless lending during the late 1980s and, now, with the effects of a deepening recession. Investors in Tokyo recall that weakness in bank prices last year heralded the market's fall to a six-year low of 14,309.41. Stock price falls are particularly damaging in Japan, where many companies, financial and non-financial, rely on a large pile of unrealised equity gains as a buffer against hard times. Aware of that danger, the country's leading brokers this week held talks with the Japan Renewal party, which dictates economic policy within the seven-party coalition government. The brokers want the government to stimulate the economy to prevent an asset price fall that could send the economy into a downward spiral. 'Something has to be done about the banks' problems,' said Mr Yutaka Nakai, a general manager at Daiwa Securities. Ministry of Finance officials have insisted that public funds will not be used to help the banks. They hope an easing of tax regulations will encourage write-offs. Another reason for the stock price fall is technical. The newly introduced Nikkei 300 index, likely to replace the Nikkei 225 as the market's benchmark next year, is heavily weighted with banking stocks. Traders who recently accumulated Nikkei 300 stocks were surprised by the banks' poor earnings and sold their stakes. Corporate capital spending figures announced yesterday reflected deteriorating confidence in the economy. Large companies were expected to cut capital spending by 3.5 per cent this year, according to a survey by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Consumer spending is also falling. Large retailers reported that sales slipped 3.6 per cent in October, against a year earlier, the 17th consecutive month of decline.

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Schlesinger yields to pressure from all sides - Why the Bundesbank acted THE package from the Bundesbank contained a little of something for everyone. The most important, German economists said, was support for the battered European exchange rate mechanism, within which the Danish krone was yesterday singled out for speculative attack. The cuts in key short-term lending rates - 50 basis points off the internationally sensitive Lombard rate and 25 off the discount rate - sent important psychological signals to struggling European economies. Similar signals were also received within the German economy, where a welter of black data has recently forced all but the most blinkered to acknowledge that recession has struck at last. By suggesting that more relaxation can be expected to help domestic recovery and save jobs, if wages and inflation can be better controlled, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, central bank president, offered a carrot to trade unions now embroiled in pay negotiations. Also, as Mr Schlesinger's laid-back, even genial manner suggested, the bank itself might be able to enjoy a little respite from the weight of domestic and international pressure bearing down on it. But the operative word was 'little'. 'Markets are not getting much of a signal on easing,' said Mr Richard Reid, economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt. The Bundesbank's package appeared to be aimed primarily at aiding the European exchange rate mechanism. 'It did not want to be put in a position where it could be blamed for the krone leaving,' he added. Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, described the move as a 'symbolic shift', following recent speeches by Mr Schlesinger in which he had indicated that he was concerned about the ERM. Mr Dietrich Beier of the Berliner Bank was one of the overwhelming majority of economists surprised by the rate cuts. The January inflation figure of 4.4 per cent was 'still ringing in our ears', and no change had been expected for at least another four weeks. But the decisive factor had been renewed ERM turbulence and market pressure on the Danish currency which threatened to spill on to the French franc. At the same time, economists agreed, the Bundesbank had clearly taken on board complaints from Bonn and industry that the rapidly deteriorating internal economic climate demanded action sooner rather than later, if only to bolster plummeting confidence. According to the central bank's own rule-of-thumb reckonings, the impact of interest rate changes normally take eight or nine months to filter down to frontline businesses. Meanwhile, there was a consensus that, as Mr Schlesinger claimed, the rate reductions yesterday did not reflect any basic change in the central bank's commitment to D-Mark stability. Western German inflation is still well above 4 per cent and is not expected to come even close to the central bank's target of 2 per cent this year. Most forecasts suggest an annual average rate of 3.5 per cent. The M3 measure of money supply growth showed a swelling still far beyond the target range in December, and the government has still not delivered its promised solidarity pact coupling wage restraints with sweeping public spending cuts. By the Bundesbank's own rigorous standards, spelt out at length in recent months, this is simply not good enough. There are hopeful signs that wages, inflation and money supply growth are slackening - factors acknowledged by Mr Schlesinger yesterday - but, as he said, they were not the real reasons for the cuts. They were merely part of a process which had begun last September, when the discount rate was cut by 50 basis points and the Lombard by 25, and since when the bank has steadily steered down money market rates to just under 8.6 per cent. As the Bundesbank has striven to convince its critics, it considers these rates, which are manipulated through its regular securities repurchase arrangements with banks, are the ones which really matter. Mr Schlesinger repeated yesterday that the so-called 'key' Lombard and discount rates apply to only about 17 per cent of German borrowing. The cuts yesterday were intended to retain equilibrium - the Lombard reduction to prevent money market rates moving up again and the adjustment in the discount rates, regarded as the 'floor' in money market rates, to take account of the steady downward shift in 'repo' rates. In the light of this, economists were disappointed that yesterday's announcement gave no indication of further possible reductions in repo rates. Tense negotiations with the public sector unions in Germany last night showed all indications of producing a welcome result, with a wage settlement possibly even lower than the 3.5 per cent considered tolerable by the Bundesbank. Economists are also forecasting that the money supply explosion is past and that the January figures for M3 expansion could be within the new target range of 5.5 to 6.5 per cent. A stop on new defence orders underlined the government's commitment to rein in spending. It is not in the Bundesbank's rigid nature to deliver before payment, but it has made an exception this time. For an institution which counts credibility as its most important asset, it has taken a gamble for which all those benefiting from yesterday's relaxation will have to pay if the promises are not fulfilled.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (4): Beyond the bureaucrats - The informal economy is a necessity of life It is impossible to get by in Egypt without making use of the informal economy. Taking a taxi, getting a leaking pipe fixed, having laundry or ironing done, repairing a car and a host of other services are all largely the preserve of the informal sector. A good range of products, too - items ranging from tourist souvenirs to furniture - are put together in small workshops, many or even most of them unlicenced or otherwise outside the reach of the bureaucrats. And it is becoming increasingly clear to economists and businessmen vexed by the task of heaving Egypt's leviathan economy to higher levels of growth that perhaps the country itself cannot get by without making better use of its informal sector. According to most estimates and most definitions of what precisely constitutes the informal sector, it is the biggest part of Egypt's private sector. As such, many believe that fostering its faster expansion may prove more effective than livening up foreign investment or Egypt's traditional business elite as a means to growth. The trick would be to find a way to manage it. It is easy to give an estimated magnitude for the informal sector, but it is impossible to calculate precisely its dimensions - not least in a country where basic economic statistics on more observable phenomena are pretty hit-and-miss. Moreover, no specific study has been published on the size of the private sector which operates beyond state registration or the reach of the tax man. Existing data in Egypt on the informal sector tend to be based on evaluating the extent of small enterprises. Some of these enterprises are - and others are not - 'formal', in the sense of being licensed, registered or tax-paying. However, research conducted by Mr Marcelo Guigale, the World Bank's resident economist in Cairo, leads him to estimate that up to 99 per cent of all private sector units in the country employ fewer than nine people. These, he reckons, account for 80 per cent of the country's overall private sector employment and 75 per cent of the private sector's value-added. Furthermore, according to Ms Heba Handoussa, head of the Economic Research Forum in Cairo, the sector has been booming. She argues that it is into this part of the economy that large chunks of Egypt's worker remittances are funnelled. 'That's the potential for the future,' she says. 'You have this vast mass of individuals in the lower income bracket who have this vast flow of funds available to them - and continuing at consistent levels.' The size of Egypt's informal sector already helps to explain how the country somehow has managed to absorb so many new entrants to the labour force each year. But Ms Handoussa and others believe that finding ways for the sector to expand will provide the single most important means of addressing Egypt's continuing acute need to create yet more jobs. 'Until now, the whole system has been geared to ignoring these small enterprises and pretending they don't exist,' she says. Mr Farouk Nasser, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce's investment committee, also believes attention should be turned, as a matter of urgency, to somehow supporting the 'unclassified and undisclosed' economy. 'The only hope lies in the 25 per cent of the country's workers who work in the black economy,' he says. He adds that it is a question of finding ways to give such small enterprises credit, easing their access to property for expansion and other means of support, but without scaring them away by overtaxing them. But that would be a delicate trick. Many of Egypt's atomised tens of thousands of small workshops and enterprises keep themselves small to stay out of the way of the tax man and the dreaded bureaucrat. Egypt's informal sector flourishes despite the government, and by minding its own business. The 3m-4m workers in the sector might quite plausibly have concluded, given the state of the rest of the economy around them, that small is more beautiful.</p>

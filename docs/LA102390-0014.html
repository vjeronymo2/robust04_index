			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> DEFENDANT DISRUPTS JOGGER RAPE TRIAL  </P> <P> A defendant in the Central Park jogger case disrupted the second rape and  attempted murder trial.  </P> <P> "No! No! No! I can't deal with this!" Kharey Wise, 18, cried out after  Assistant Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer's opening statement. Wise then vomited  next to the defense table. As officers led him out of the courtroom, Wise  screamed: "I can't take this! It isn't true! She's lying! She's lying!" Wise is  one of two youths on trial in the gang rape and beating of a woman jogger in  Manhattan's Central Park. Three others were convicted earlier of rape and  assault but acquitted of attempted murder. The jury had left for a recess  before the outburst.  </P></p>

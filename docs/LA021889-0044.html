			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH JUDGE LIMITS DISCLOSURE OF SECRETS, DECLARES THAT TRIAL WILL RESUME  TUESDAY  </P> <P> A federal judge, resolving the remaining disputes over the use of classified  information, declared Friday that the much-delayed trial of former White House  aide Oliver L. North will resume Tuesday.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, issuing orders to limit disclosures of  secret materials at the Iran-Contra trial, said that members of the jury he has  chosen will take their oaths of office after the three-day holiday weekend and  hear opening statements from government and defense attorneys.  </P> <P> After meeting in closed conferences most of the day with prosecutors and  North's defense attorneys, Gesell gave general approval to plans by independent  counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to consult with the Justice Department on unforeseen  issues of national security that may arise during the trial. North is accused  of lying to Congress and to a presidential panel about his activities on behalf  of the Nicaraguan Contras.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question of Authority  </P> <P> The trial has been held up for nine days because of disputes over how much  authority the attorney general has to intervene in court proceedings involving  questions of national security.  </P> <P> Gesell originally objected to demands by the Justice Department that their  lawyers be allowed to sit at the prosecution table, so they could object if a  sensitive document were introduced. Gesell said that it would be too disruptive  and that there should only be "one government" representative in the courtroom,  meaning Walsh.  </P> <P> To meet Gesell's objections, Walsh pledged to give Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh  veto power over sensitive matters about to be introduced instead of having  Justice Department lawyers sitting with the prosecutor. Thornburgh is  responsible for protecting national security in criminal cases under a 1980  law.  </P> <P> Gesell said Friday that he would allow such consultation by Walsh outside the  courtroom as long as it "does not unreasonably interfere with the orderly  processes of the court." North's lawyers had objected that the latest plan  would "cripple" court proceedings by giving Thornburgh too much leeway to  interrupt the trial.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seek to Bar Use of Act  </P> <P> They filed a 21-page document Friday renewing North's motion that the 1980  Classified Information Procedures Act be declared unconstitutional as it  applies to his case. Gesell made no immediate ruling on the motion.  </P> <P> Thornburgh will have the power to withhold evidence on a subject altogether,  even if it could cause the dismissal of certain charges against North, the  judge has said.  </P> <P> Gesell has laid out general categories on what may and may not be disclosed at  North's trial and has instructed government and defense lawyers to confer with  him in private before raising any specific matters that are not clearly covered  by his rules.  </P> <P> Settling another issue Friday, Gesell heard final arguments behind closed doors  from prosecutors and defense attorneys on the wording of a government statement  about efforts by the Ronald Reagan Administration to obtain military aid for  the Contras from foreign countries.  </P> <P> North's attorneys have argued in court papers that the jury must be told that  Reagan and his top aides obtained this aid and ordered the operation concealed  from Congress at a time when Congress had barred the Administration from giving  direct aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.  </P> <P> North attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said that this information goes to "the  heart" of North's defense. But to shield the names of the countries involved,  which allegedly were promised CIA support by the Administration in return,  Gesell approved the wording of an agreement in which the government  acknowledges that the Reagan Administration enlisted military support from 13  countries. But the agreement contains no statement that this was ordered  concealed from Congress.  </P> <P> The acknowledgement will prevent North's lawyers from identifying the 13  countries.  </P> <P> But Gesell said that North's lawyers may introduce evidence to support their  claim that Reagan and key officials of his Administration kept the policy  secret and "openly encouraged or condoned . . . (North's) alleged concealments,  obstructions or incorrect responses" with which he is charged.  </P> <P> North, 45, a former official of the National Security Council, benefited last  month from dismissal of the two principal charges against him -- conspiracy to  defraud the government and theft of government property. The charges were  dropped after Thornburgh determined that government documents dealing with  North's alleged diversion of $14 million in Iranian arms-sale profits to the  Contras were so sensitive that they could not be produced in court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 12 Lesser Charges  </P> <P> As a result, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel is being tried on 12 lesser  criminal charges. He is accused of concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986  his efforts on behalf of the Contras and of lying to the attorney general and a  presidential board of inquiry about the NSC's role in diverting money from the  arms sales to the rebels.  </P> <P> North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security system at his  home from an associate, converting to his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's  checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury  of tax revenue in connection with contributions supporting the Contras.  </P></p>

Executive Order 12356, National Security Information (April 2, 1982), prescribes a uniform system for classifying declassifying, and safeguarding national security information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(1) The Department's requirements personnel, reviewing officials, the contracting officer, and the approving official shall jointly confer on using this authority and the extent to which national security pertains to the acquisition(s). The Department shall examine the acquisition in its totality, including any antecedent and/or consequent acquisitions and related actions, to make these determinations. The Director, Diplomatic Security Services, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is the authority for the determination that specific information should not be released on all proposed acquisitions funded by the Department of State that involves national security information. The Chief, Controls Division, Office of Intelligence Liaison Directorate for Coordination, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, is the approval authority for such acquisitions derived from or funded by other agencies. The requirements office is responsible for obtaining the approval of the appropriate official and ensuring that all documentation necessary for the decision is accurate and complete with respect to information that should not be released. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(1), acquisitions involving national security information shall be publicized if identification of the individual acquisition or class or acquisitions would not compromise national security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions involving national security information, it is expected that requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in maximizing competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 606.303&hyph;1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 43.

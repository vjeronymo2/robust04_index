			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Greece drags its feet on public utilities sell-off - There is opposition even within the cabinet THE GREEK government's decision last month to call off negotiations for a 600MW gas-fired power station at Lavrion near Athens, to be constructed using the build-operate-transfer (BOT) form of private financing, will have disappointed the two international consortia shortlisted for the Dollars 500m project. But it will hardly have come as a surprise. The ruling conservatives' privatisation programme is being challenged as fiercely by cabinet members in prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis's government as it is by the trade unions and the socialist opposition. Moreover, the state-owned Public Power Corporation (Deh), the potential customer for power from the Lavrion plant, appears reluctant to give up its monopoly of electricity production with the introduction of BOT. Under a BOT contract, an infrastructure project is built and operated by a private concern which pockets the profits for an agreed period before transferring it to government ownership. International companies bidding for public procurement contracts in Greece are resigned to enduring bureaucratic delays. But Deh's unwillingness to start co-operating with a private partner was underlined by what, even by local standards, seemed excessive foot-dragging. It took two years for the Lavrion project, the first of four thermal plants planned under the BOT system, to reach the stage of shortlisting bidders. The start of contract negotiations with Tractebel of Belgium, which heads one of the two shortlisted international consortia (the other was headed by Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group) was postponed for three months after it emerged, by a narrow margin, as the low bidder. By contrast, the government is only a few weeks behind schedule in a more complex project, the sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE, the state telecoms group, to an international telecoms operator, together with a stock market flotation of another 14 per cent of the company. However, the economy ministry, prevented from financing large infrastructure projects by the size of the public sector deficit, remains an enthusiastic advocate of BOT, in highway and bridge-building as well as the energy sector. Under the BOT system, the contractor would assume the risk of financing the Lavrion project, paying off the debt with revenues earned from operating the plant for 25 years before transferring it to Deh. Mr Stefanos Manos, economy minister, argues that Deh's poor management record and huge debt, amounting to Dr900bn (Pounds 2.7bn)leaves the government with no alternative but to turn to the private sector. 'With such a high level of debt, Deh can't go on commissioning turnkey projects. But almost everyone is opposed to letting in the private sector,' he says. Both management and unions voice doubts whether a private contractor can produce electricity at cheaper rates than Deh. In private, however, they sound more concerned about jobs and influence being lost. Almost every extended Greek family has at least one member employed or on pension from one of the big state enterprises used by politicians for making patronage appointments. 'The politicians think they won't be elected unless they get their voters jobs and public sector managers don't want to upset cosy relationships with suppliers and contractors. The government isn't being determined enough about privatisation,' says Mr Stelios Stavridis, a private consultant recently appointed to oversee the privatisation of Aspropyrgos Refinery. The government's record on privatisation was not helped by revelations that officials at Calcestruzzi, a subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group which paid Dr124bn last year for a state-owned cement producer, Heracles General Cement, were involved in paying kickbacks to Italian politicians. However, privatisation officials brush aside allegations that some smaller companies included in the privatisation programme were sold on favourable terms to Greek businessmen with close ties to the conservative New Democracy party. So far, about 70 companies out of 200 originally listed for privatisaion have been disposed of. The socialist opposition has been quick to exploit the government's discomfiture, pledging that if it returns to power in the election next year, it will re-examine privatisation deals and reverse any BOT contract signed by Deh. Mr Mitsotakis says the government is still committed to BOT financing for the Lavrion project. However, the decision to start the tender process over again, ostensibly to ensure maximum transparency, smacks of political expediency. There is little likelihood that tender procedures can be completed in time for a contract to be awarded before the election next year.</p>

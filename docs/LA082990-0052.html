			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> THERE'S MORE THAN JUST A BIG 3 THIS YEAR  </P> <P> Oregon football Coach Rich Brooks contends that there isn't a bad team in the  Pacific 10 Conference and the previous have-nots in the league have narrowed  the talent gap with USC, UCLA and Washington.  </P> <P> If so, this could be the year an upstart team wins the conference title.  </P> <P> Parity hasn't been evident, though, in the league since 1972. USC or UCLA have  represented the Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl 14 times in that span, with Washington  making three appearances and Arizona State one.  </P> <P> USC has been the dominant team recently with three consecutive championships  and only one conference loss in that span, to Oregon in 1987.  </P> <P> The Trojans are widely favored again but that is primarily based on USC's track  record, not necessarily on the relative strength, or experience of its team  this season.  </P> <P> It's not likely that Oregon State or California will suddenly be a contender,  but a case can be made for several teams preventing USC from winning a fourth  consecutive conference title.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody can get through the league without a loss, as USC has in  the last two years," said Brooks, who is in his 14th season as Oregon's coach.  </P> <P> "However, USC has to be the favorite for what they've done in the last three  years. They have some questions, though, and everybody else has a chance, and  some have better chances than others.  </P> <P> "The three teams that finished second last year have to be in the hunt --  Oregon, Arizona and Washington. Most of the preseason people move Arizona and  Washington up and drop us to the bottom half and that remains to be seen.  </P> <P> "If somebody forges upward, somebody has to go downward. UCLA obviously is a  team that is going to rebound and be a major factor, and I hear great things  about Arizona State. Stanford and Cal have legitimate cases for improved  records. And Washington State and Oregon State return skilled people and  talented quarterbacks.  </P> <P> "It's a tough league. You can't say someone is terrible, like it was. If you're  not ready every week, you can get beat, and it didn't used to be that way."  </P> <P> Schedules may be the determining factor as to which team represents the  conference in the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> In that regard, Washington apparently has an advantage, playing USC, UCLA,  Arizona and Oregon at Husky Stadium.  </P> <P> With the exception of Brigham Young, Oregon has a relatively soft nonconference  schedule and doesn't play USC.  </P> <P> "That doesn't break my heart," Brooks said, referring to the omission of the  Trojans on the schedule.  </P> <P> Once again, the Pac-10 will be recognized for its proficient quarterbacks.  </P> <P> Almost every team has an experienced quarterback, among them Arizona State's  Paul Justin, USC's Todd Marinovich and Oregon's Bill Musgrave.  </P> <P> "This league is incredible when you look at the quarterbacks," Brooks said.  "For instance, the NFL's No. 1 draft choice, Troy Aikman, was only honorable  mention in the conference two years ago."  </P> <P> A closer look at the teams, excepting USC and UCLA, with 1989 overall and  conference records:  </P> <P> </P> <P> ARIZONA  </P> <P> 1989: 8-4, 5-3, second place  </P> <P> The Wildcats are the only Pac-10 member that hasn't played in the Rose Bowl  game, but they're closing in on it.  </P> <P> "We have a better chance to be a better football team because, hopefully, we'll  throw the ball better," Coach Dick Tomey said.  </P> <P> If so, quarterbacks Ronald Veal, a better runner than passer, and George  Malauulu will have to deliver on a team that led the league in rushing last  year with its option, I-bone attack, but was last in passing, averaging only  81.6 yards a game.  </P> <P> Malauulu showed some promise as a passer until he missed the last two games in  1989 with a knee injury.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the Wildcats appear solid with 12 returning starters and a strong  running back corps that will be bolstered by the return of Art Greathouse, who  was inactive with a foot injury last year.  </P> <P> Inspiration will be provided by Arizona linebacker Kevin Singleton, who has  been medically cleared to play after having been found to have leukemia 13  months ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ARIZONA STATE  </P> <P> 1989: 6-4-1, 3-3-1, fifth place  </P> <P> In a quarterback-talented conference, Paul Justin stands tall, figuratively and  literally, at 6 feet 5.  </P> <P> He threw for nearly 1,500 yards in the last four games last season, including  534 against Washington State.  </P> <P> Justin will be throwing to young receivers and Coach Larry Marmie could take  the pressure off his quarterback with a solid running game.  </P> <P> Leonard Russell, a 6-foot-3, 235-pound back, could be the catalyst. He has  returned to ASU after two years at a community college, Mt. San Antonio.  </P> <P> The defense was the worst in the conference last year, allowing an average of  406.7 yards a game. But eight starters are back, among them talented free  safety Nathan LaDuke.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's a more productive player in America than Nathan," Marmie  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> 1989: 4-7, 2-6, 10th  </P> <P> California, which was a finesse team with graduated quarterback Troy Taylor, is  trying to change to a more balanced attack.  </P> <P> Taylor is the school's leader in passing yardage but also might have set  another record as the most sacked quarterback in the school's history.  </P> <P> The previously one-dimensional Bears will rely more on running backs Greg  Wallace and Greg Zomalt, who will be operating behind a huge, experienced  offensive line.  </P> <P> Coach Bruce Snyder hopes to take the pressure off inexperienced quarterbacks  Mike Pawlawski and Perry Klein with an improved running game and six returning  starters from a defense that yielded an average of 26.2 points a game in 1989.  </P> <P> Cal hasn't had a winning season since 1982 and it remains to be seen whether a  new offensive philosophy will dramatically alter its second-division status.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OREGON  </P> <P> 1989: 8-4, 5-3, second place  </P> <P> Oregon made its first bowl appearance -- Independence -- in 26 years last  season and Brooks has improved his program to the point that he will be  disappointed if the Ducks don't go to a bowl game again.  </P> <P> "We've got a good team and I think we can make a run at it," Brooks said.  </P> <P> Oregon has lost its two leading ground gainers, Derek Loville and Latin Berry,  but Brooks is enthusiastic about tailback Ngalu Kelemeni and Brandon Jumper, a  250-pound fullback.  </P> <P> Then there's Musgrave, who passed for 2,761 yards and 20 touchdowns last year.  </P> <P> "I think he's the best quarterback in the conference and one of the best in the  nation," Brooks said.  </P> <P> As for defense, Brooks said, "We lost some good players, but I feel good that  we have a good group stepping up. We were second in total offense and defense  in the conference last year and I don't think we should fall far in those  phases."  </P> <P> The Ducks also have seven home games for the first time in the school's  history.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OREGON STATE  </P> <P> 1989: 4-7-1, 3-4-1, sixth place  </P> <P> Four wins in a season the last two years may not seem like much to most  schools, but for Oregon State, it's a steppingstone.  </P> <P> With the exception of Nebraska, Oregon State has a light nonconference schedule  and, with some luck, it might even win five games this season.  </P> <P> The Beavers have an overachieving quarterback, Matt Booher, who lifts weights  with the linemen and passes effectively on the run.  </P> <P> He'll have to move quickly this year with a rebuilt offensive line.  </P> <P> Coach Dave Kragthorpe has another battering fullback in 244-pound James Jones,  replacing Pat Chaffey, a fifth-round draft choice of the Chicago Bears, and an  exceptional nose guard in Esera Tuaolo.  </P> <P> Oregon State upset UCLA last year and may surprise some unsuspecting team this  season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STANFORD  </P> <P> 1989: 3-5, 3-8, seventh place  </P> <P> Stanford, once the quarterback school of the country with the likes of Jim  Plunkett and John Elway, is changing its image.  </P> <P> The quarterback position has been mediocre, at best, in recent years and it  remains to be seen whether Jason Palumbis, who plunged to No. 4 on the depth  chart last season but won the starting job in spring practice, is any more  effective a passer than Steve Smith, who ranked eighth in the conference last  year.  </P> <P> The Cardinal should have an effective running game with Jon Volpe, a 1,000-yard  rusher who missed most of last season with injuries, along with Glyn Milburn  and Ellery Roberts, transfers from Oklahoma and Miami, respectively.  </P> <P> Green also has some gifted receivers, notably Ed McCaffrey. And four of last  year's five starters on the offensive line return.  </P> <P> Defensively, Stanford has six starters from a unit that that was just average  last season.  </P> <P> More will be known about Stanford after its opening two games, Colorado and  UCLA, both on the road.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WASHINGTON  </P> <P> 1989: 8-4, 5-3, second place  </P> <P> Rose Bowl fever is prevalent in Seattle, and even the new quarterback,  left-handed Mark Brunell, is caught up with it.  </P> <P> "This is definitely a Rose Bowl team," he said. "That's our No. 1 goal. That's  all we talk about. We want the Rose Bowl, or we don't want anything."  </P> <P> The Huskies have lost some skilled players, such as All-American center Bern  Brostek, quarterback Cary Conklin and 300-pound defensive lineman Dennis Brown.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, there is reason for optimism in the Husky camp.  </P> <P> Operating behind a mammoth offensive line, a trademark of Don James' teams,  will be talented tailback Greg Lewis, who rushed for 1,100 yards in James'  one-back set last year. There are skilled wide receivers Orlando McKay and  Mario Bailey, and a robust defense led by linebacker James Clifford.  </P> <P> Now in his 16th season at Washington, James is the dean of Pac-10 coaches with  a record of 119-51-2. He has also coached the Huskies into 11 bowl games, the  most recent a 34-7 victory over Florida in the 1989 Freedom Bowl.  </P> <P> Washington hasn't played in the Rose Bowl, though, since the 1981 season -- and  it apparently believes it is long overdue to return.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE  </P> <P> 1989: 6-5, 3-5, seventh place  </P> <P> Coach Mike Price is known for his motivational gimmicks, such as "shooting" a  student, who was dressed as a USC Trojan and riding a horse around the practice  field, with a track starter's pistol.  </P> <P> He has also walked to practice in a duck-hunting outfit the week of the Oregon  game and dressed like an Arizona State mascot while giving his team a pep talk.  </P> <P> Price will need more than gimmicks to inspire his Cougars this year, though,  since he has only four defensive starters returning.  </P> <P> Price does have All-American kicker Jason Hanson and proven quarterbacks in  Brad Gossen and Aaron Garcia.  </P></p>

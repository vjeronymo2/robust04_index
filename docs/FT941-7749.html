			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pifco advances 18% despite patchy consumer spending Pifco, the manufacturer of small appliances, announced an 18 per cent increase in half year profits despite patchy consumer spending and difficult trading conditions in Europe. The Manchester-based group saw pre-tax profits increase to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 1.03m) in the six months to October 31. Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said the rise had been achieved despite lower sales on products marketed under brands names including Russell Hobbs, Salton and Carmen. 'Our market share has fallen off in the past year, but we've gone for profitability rather than volume sales,' he said. Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 20.4m) as retailers cut prices in a bid to kick start consumer spending. Faced with erratic demand for so-called hard goods - ranging from toasters and kettles to hair dryers and Christmas lights - the company has embarked on a new strategy to maximise sales. The Pifco and Salton brands have been repositioned to exploit the budget market, while some Russell Hobbs, Tower and Carmen products have been redefined as higher priced 'premium' goods. 'We're looking to regain market share with revised brands,' Mr Webber added. The company, which ended the half year with a net cash balance of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 100,000), said it was also considering acquisitions in the UK and continental Europe. Mr James Wallace, finance director, said such acquisitions would probably be funded by a rights issue and would aim to increase exports, currently 23 per cent of sales. 'We're looking for well-run businesses in our core industry. We can do so because cash generation has been strong and we've kept costs under control,' he said. Earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 7.1p (5.9p). The interim dividend is 1.9p, up 9 per cent.</p>

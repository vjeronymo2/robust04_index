			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Computer characters champing at the bit - Gary Mead finds battle already joined in the Christmas toy trade October 1 - it must be time to start thinking about Christmas. At least, that's the reasoning of manufacturers and retailers eager to grab a slice of this year's estimated Pounds 1bn spending on gadgets, games and gizmos for children. Among those ready for take-off are the world's two leading producers of electronic video games, Sega and Nintendo, both Japanese companies with a global reach. Their march into the living rooms of the industrialised world has strafed the traditional toy market and demolished a central icon of American folksiness, the baseball bat. According to Nintendo, electronic video games outnumber baseball bats in the US. That warms the heart of Brian Moore, senior product manager at Bandai UK, which markets Nintendo products in Britain; where the US has pioneered, the UK will follow. In the US and Japan, electronic video games have a 40 per cent household penetration; that drops to just 14 per cent in the UK, though 50 per cent of British homes with children have some form of electronic video game installed. There is thus room for growth - and room for a mega-drive marketing battle. Peter Skinner, marketing manager of Hamleys, the London toy shop, says electronic video games were 'the biggest selling toy item last Christmas and we expect the same this year'. Nintendo and Sega calculate the retail value of the UK market will be Pounds 500m this year - almost double that of 1991, and about half of all toy sales  -from a standing start of just Pounds 20m in 1989. Worldwide, Nintendo claims to have sold 615m items of games hardware in the last six years, 10m of those in the UK. In the US, Nintendo claims the retail value of its sales alone this year will be Dollars 4.8bn. Nintendo claims an overall 80 per cent share of the international video games market but clearly there is a marketing battle in progress over the hearts and pockets of the world's children. According to the UK magazine, Computer Trade Weekly, Sega dominates the emerging and more technologically sophisticated 16-bit game console market in the US, with a 61 per cent share, against Nintendo's 34 per cent. The other 5 per cent is taken by NEC. In the UK, Nintendo is spending Pounds 15m on marketing its three versions of hand-held, 8-bit and 16-bit consoles which plug into ordinary television sets. Its rival, Sega, with its own versions of the same products, claims a UK marketing budget of Pounds 19m this year, including a Pounds 2m sponsorship deal during the summer of Independent Television's coverage of the European football championship. By the end of this year, Sega will have spent about Pounds 100m on marketing across Europe. In the UK, the less expensive hand-held games market is dominated by Nintendo, which has about 60 per cent market share, compared with Sega's 40 per cent. The superior technology of the 16-bit consoles means they provide the graphics and entertainment of arcade-style video games. Sega launched its 16-bit console in the UK two years ago - Nintendo came along earlier this year - and Sega currently appears to be winning the battle. According to one of London's leading toy retailers, 'Nintendo has not yet got the word-of-mouth awareness that Sega has; last week we sold seven Sega 16-bit machines and two of Nintendo's'. Price is another factor; in the UK, Sega's 16-bit machine retails at Pounds 129, against Nintendo's Pounds 180. To capture the high ground in the UK, both companies are launching lavish television advertising campaigns at the start of October; Nintendo has spent Pounds 500,000 in production costs alone. Part of Sega's strategy has been to take a leaf out of the Hollywood movie, Big - where a teenager suddenly finds himself transformed into an adult, and is recruited by a toy manufacturer as a product tester - by inviting 13-15-year-olds to attend its quarterly board meetings. According to Philip Ley, marketing director of Sega Europe: 'Their role is to discuss our plans for Sega, future product launches, the type of software we should be launching, reaction to our promotions and TV advertising plans. We also set them projects in between each board meeting; for instance, one of them was how can we make Sega more appealing to women? They have a lot of practical imput.' But in the long-term, both Sega and Nintendo need to broaden their appeal. Getting noticed by kids was the priority once - 'they are our best sales people' says Brian Moore - but the new television advertising campaigns are aimed at enticing the relatively untapped older teenage and adult markets. Hence Sega's interest in event sponsorship. 'We wanted to leap-frog Nintendo in terms of the way consumers, both dads and lads, perceived Sega as a brand. In this market place - it's not the same everywhere - big is better. We need to be seen as a big brand because kids tend to think if you are big, you are going to have the best technology, the best games and the biggest number of games. What we wanted to do in a very short space of time was to catapult Sega into, for instance, the echelons of Coca-Cola,' says Ley. There is nothing quite like a movie for generating interest in spin-off products. But as part of its marketing strategy, Nintendo has taken the unusual step of manufacturing the product first and producing the movie second. Nintendo claims that one of its characters, Super Mario, now has a popularity rating in the US higher than that of Mickey Mouse. Sure enough, Mario is to feature in a 1993 movie - The Super Mario Bros - played by the character actor Bob Hoskins. While market saturation is not yet on the horizon, the long-term future dictates that both Sega and Nintendo must grow into new, demographically older, markets. 'It is not so much that we fear market saturation as that we wish to position Sega as a large credible brand, with a future not to remain simply in the games consoles market but, over the next few years, to become a home entertainment brand,' says Ley. Moore supports the view that Nintendo's three hardware products require different marketing: 'Initially, video games had a bad perception in parents' minds. With (the hand-held) Game Boy, we took a softly-softly approach, introduced consumer services, a free magazine and a telephone hotline for problems. Our profile was young. Our structure for Super NES is different, with a more street-credible approach, to go after an older audience.' But for the next three months, the battlefield is squarely sited on the playground. And the big marketing spends have one simple end - get the brand name noticed and win credibility. According to David King, product manager of Virgin Games, one of the larger retailers of electronic games, 'as far as kids are concerned, at the end of the day it all comes down to something called 'street cred'. How do you get that street cred? If you could bottle that, you'd make a million.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HAMLEY'S PROJECTED BEST-SELLER LIST FOR CHRISTMAS:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Sega (all versions) 2  Nintendo (all versions) 3  Troll dolls 4  Lego 5  Teddy bears 6  Barbie 7  Board games 8  Tomy Charge's (radio-controlled cars) 9  Character merchandising (particularly Thomas the Tank Engine,    Thunderbirds and Batman 10 Dinosaurs  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

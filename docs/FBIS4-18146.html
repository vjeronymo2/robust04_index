			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, March 31 (AFP)--Four Turkish ministers  symbolically handed their resignation to Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller late Wednesday [31 March] after failing to win election  as mayors in municipal elections Sunday, a government source  said.    In a statement, Ciller thanked the four, all members of her  True Path Party, for their "gesture" but said she had no  intention of reshuffling the cabinet at the moment.</p>

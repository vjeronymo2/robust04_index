			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (8): Herd treads carefully / Profile of Merrill Lynch The thundering herd is gathering speed in Germany - but is taking care to tread carefully, writes David Waller. While Merrill Lynch is renowned for its aggressive approach to investment banking, its hooves are muffled as it sets about expanding its presence in the German financial markets. Conservatism is the watchword for the bank's German activities, says Mr Tim von Halle, Anglo-German head of the bank's capital markets activities in Frankfurt - an under-appreciated dimension to the Merrill Lynch culture which the bank claims fits in well with the German business environment. Couple the bank's conservatism with its undoubted financial muscle - Merrill raised more capital for its clients in international financial markets than any other institution last year - and the bank is convinced that it has an attractive proposition for Germany's capital-hungry corporations. Having set up a subsidiary in Frankfurt in 1988, Merrill Lynch has 35 'front office' professionals on the ground in Frankfurt plus about 25 back-office staff. Separate from the investment banking activities is a network of five offices throughout Germany which provide private banking services to high net worth individuals. This operation was set up more than 20 years ago and now employs 80 people. Merrill's plans to expand from this base are understated - Mr von Halle says simply that the bank intends to grow profitably. There is no declared aim to achieve a spectacular increase in the headcount within a given period. The growth plans are in part driven by broader changes within the Merrill group. Traditionally highly centralised, Merrill has more recently taken a strategic decision to devolve power away from the New York headquarters to its regional operations around the world. In addition, Merrill sees a wealth of opportunity for its services in Germany in the years ahead. 'Foreign banks have traditionally brought all the innovation to the German capital market,' comments Mr Andreas von Buddenbrock, who recently joined Merrill Lynch's German operations as head of investment banking after more than 14 years with rival J. P. Morgan. 'Over the past 20 years, foreign banks have introduced German corporations to the international foreign exchange markets, to the Euromarkets and Eurobonds,' he says. 'We will be at the forefront of the next wave of developments - the globalisation of the German equity markets and an upsurge in demand for mergers and acquisitions advice.' The past two years has seen a noted increase in the willingness of the German Lander - federal states - and the public sector Landesbanken to make use of foreign investment banks when raising D-Marks on international capital markets. Foreign countries also use US houses to raise D-Mark funds, rather than relying on the big three German banks as in the past. Merrill has led or co-led 29 fixed-interest D-Mark issues which raised DM28bn since July last year. The bank has also played a leading role in two pioneering international equity issues involving German companies. It was co-book-runner with Deutsche Bank in the Dollars 810m placing of a 3 per cent stake in the Daimler-Benz group with US investors; more recently it was joint global co-ordinator with Dresdner Bank in the bank's innovative DM1.14bn placing of new shares with international investors, completed in early May this year. Merrill won these mandates less because of its strength within Germany than because of its powerful position as the world's largest distributor of new equity. Merrill's team of advisers to the Dresdner issue, for example, was flown in from the investment bank's European HQ in London. Merrill aims to bolster the local presence with a strategy of partnership with Germany's leading domestic institutions.</p>

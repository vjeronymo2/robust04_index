But NBC  officials denied suggestions that the project would be an Ed Sullivan-type  variety show, describing it instead as an informational program. There is no  deal yet; King said that the discussions started when NBC Entertainment  President Brandon Tartikoff appeared on King's radio show. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: When inequality rules EMPLOYERS who ease the path to early retirement by topping up payments to those too young to qualify for state benefits can breathe more easily following an opinion from the Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice. The case, which will have implications for employers in several European states, centres on what have become known as 'bridging pensions.' These pay top-up benefits equal to those which would be offered by state social security provided the individual was old enough to receive it. Because Britain has unequal ages at which men and women qualify for state pensions, men are given more generous bridging pensions than women. This practice flies in the face of other ECJ rulings which say that a pension is deferred pay and that employers may not discriminate over pay on the basis of sex. British employers had feared they would be forced to offer the more generous terms to their women workers as well, either causing them to absorb additional costs or to abandon their efforts to ease early retirement for men. In this case, though, the ECJ seems to be saying that inequality is acceptable under some circumstances. Bridging pensions can make a significant difference in the value of an individual's retirement package, as the case before the ECJ shows. It involved Mrs Friedel Roberts, formerly employed by Birds Eye Walls, the ice cream-maker as a slicer of its Swiss Roll product. She took ill-health retirement at the age of 57, receiving an annual bridging pension of Pounds 1,302 a year. But this was cut by more than half, to Pounds 546, at 60 when she became eligible for the state pension - with the difference to be provided by the state. Some lawyers had argued privately that her case was a poor one to bring as a test because her pension entitlement was so paltry that a judge might have been hard pressed to deny her the extra cash. Also, the British government intervened unexpectedly at the last minute, arguing that to allow some discrimination would open the door to legal challenges from individuals seeking exceptions in many different circumstances. Allan Jenkinson, policy director at consulting actuary Noble Lowndes, said the advice - which is almost certain to be accepted by the ECJ - will certainly create more work for lawyers. For one thing, it contradicts the ECJ's own landmark 1990 ruling in Barber v GRE in which it said that each aspect of a pension must paid equally to men and women. It has now created the very first exception to its own rule.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Kampuchea [DK] representative in  Phnom Penh announced on 18 June that Chan Youran, DK Party's  representative to the meeting of the Phnom Penh Roundtable  Commission, and his assistants left Phnom Penh by plane on the  morning of 18 June. All other officials of the DK  Representative's Office will be leaving Phnom Penh on 19 June at  the demand of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]'s Ministry  of Interior.    On the night of 17 June, DK Chairman Khieu Samphan sent an  urgent telegram to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk informing  him of the Ministry of Interior's demand that all DK  representatives leave Phnom Penh.    On the morning of 18 June, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk  sent a reply calling on DK representatives to quickly leave  Phnom Penh to avoid any incident that might lead to the  deterioration of the situation. In his reply, the King also  said that he would maintain good relations with Mr. Khieu  Samphan and the DK Party as before.    On the night of 17 June, the RGC Ministry of Interior issued  an expulsion order released through radio and television, saying  that due to the failure of the 15-16 June meeting of the Phnom  Penh Roundtable Commission, the DK representatives and staff  must leave Phnom Penh before 19 June because the Ministry of  Interior might not be able to provide security for them.</p>

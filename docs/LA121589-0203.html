			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RICHTER WIS. ATHLETIC DIRECTOR  </P> <P> Pat Richter, who led the 1963 Wisconsin football team to the Rose Bowl, today  was named the university's new athletic director and was charged with the task  of turning around a financially troubled program.  </P> <P> Chancellor Donna E. Shalala announced Richter's appointment at a news  conference, saying she is confident that Richter will solve the problem of the  athletic department, including a million-dollar budget deficit, losing football  program and declining football ticket sales.  </P> <P> Richter replaces Ade Sponberg, who resigned under pressure last month after  just more than two years as athletic director. Sponberg will remain on the job  until May 1.  </P> <P> Richter, 48, who graduated from Wisconsin in 1963 and played eight seasons in  the NFL with the Washington Redskins, is currently vice president for personnel  at Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. in Madison.  </P> <P> Shalala said Richter will immediately begin searching for a new football coach  and assume his other responsibilities later. Don Morton was fired as coach late  last month after compiling a 6-27 record over three years.  </P></p>

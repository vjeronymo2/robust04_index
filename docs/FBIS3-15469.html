Unlike </F> the Government, Oleg Poptsov Still Holds Television Dear"]    [Text] Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the Russian Television  Company, told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent yesterday  about his vision of the new situation in the electronic media  that emerged after the budget financing of television companies  was slashed nearly four-fold against the requisite level.    Television and radio company chiefs were invited to attend  yesterday's government meeting. According to Oleg Poptsov,  President Yeltsin dwelled on the electronic media in his  address. His statement was in line with the ambiguous stance he  expressed in his message to the Federal Assembly on 24 February:  The state is no longer able to finance television and radio  companies, but it is "important to make sure that Russia's  information space is not torn apart and divided in the course of  practical steps. A state television and radio channel must be  preserved."    The financial support the state is able to give the mass  media this year, however, will hardly be enough to preserve the  "information space." For instance, under a tentative agreement  with the Finance Ministry, the "Ostankino" State Television and  Radio Company could receive no more than 653 billion rubles [R]  for 1994 instead of the R1.2 trillion it had requested. The  Russian Television and Radio Company received R471 billion  instead of the requested R910 billion. But now the initial  two-fold cut has turned out to be four-fold. The Finance  Ministry is going to appropriate only R679 billion for the  federal companies, including "Ostankino," the Russian Television  and Radio Company, and local television and radio companies.    In Mr. Poptsov's view, these cuts in government subsidies  show that the government's "mechanism of assessing priories is  out of balance," and if the authorities do not see the mass  media as a priority, "the cabinet must have lost either its  hearing or its eyesight. Russia is still governed by the word,  which alone can say if there are deeds in Russia or not."    Mr. Poptsov said that he did not oppose joint-stock  television companies, but he thinks that an across-the-board  conversion into joint-stock companies is contra-indicated for  Russian television groups. At any rate, in his opinion, the  state should not quit the game so obviously. "It is possible,"  Mr. Poptsov noted, "that a lobby pursuing the interests of  commercial businesses is trying to clear the 'television field'  for a large-scale penetration. Naturally, the four-fold decrease  in financing (and, hence, in air time) will mean that the volume  of information on the government will be slashed  proportionately: Why should we sacrifice movies or other  programs that hold much greater interest for viewers."</p>

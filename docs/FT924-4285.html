			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM plans Danish solution MR John Major tabled new proposals last night designed to break the deadlock over Danish ratification of the Maastricht treaty at next week's European Community summit. But the outlook for the Edinburgh meeting was simultaneously clouded by an admission from Downing Street that the prime minister has been unable so far to agree a time for pre-summit talks with French President Francois Mitterrand. Relations between the two leaders have been frosty since Mr Mitterrand criticised last month Britain's handling of its EC presidency. British officials sought to play down the significance of the apparent snub by Paris, insisting that official contacts between the two sides had established a large measure of agreement over the most prominent summit issues. As Mr Major returned from a three-day tour of European capitals, Downing Street said its latest proposals were designed to meet Denmark's demands for a dilution of its treaty commitments on defence, citizenship, interior and justice issues and monetary union. But the presidency compromise - framed in terms of a legal declaration  - would respect also the insistence of other European governments that there should be no re-opening of the treaty. Speaking on Mr Major's return from talks with Mr Poul Schluter in Copenhagen, the Danish prime minister, British officials said that the British presidency was hopeful rather than optimistic of an overall deal at the summit. They warned that the North-South division within the Community over future financing remained as wide as ever, with Spain in particular threatening to block progress on other issues if its demands for more 'cohesion' funds were blocked. Mr Major will resume his tour of capitals at the weekend.</p>

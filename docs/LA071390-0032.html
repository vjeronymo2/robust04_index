			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A DOWNSCALE HOUSE IN AN UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD, LA  JOLLA SEAS TAKES MIDDLE ROAD  </P> <P> Shopping center food courts are not a peculiarly local phenomenon, although the  dining zone in the Golden Triangle's new Costa Verde Center may be unique in  one rather amusing aspect: Smack in the middle of the collection of full-scale  eateries, sandwich shops and frozen yogurt parlors is a Jenny Craig Weight Loss  Centre.  </P> <P> If the Craig outlet's presence fails to give dinner-bound visitors pause, it  may at least give them food for thought.  </P> <P> Anyone who has followed the remarkably rapid development of the Golden Triangle  with condominium and apartment complexes may note that the one truly  full-service restaurant in the Costa Verde collection, a new place called La  Jolla Seas, was carefully crafted to suit its surroundings. If the area can be  called an instant neighborhood, La Jolla Seas can be called an instant  neighborhood restaurant.  </P> <P> In a press release, proprietor Shige Hashimoto makes the observation that "The  Golden Triangle does not need another expensive restaurant." Hashimoto took an  intelligent line when he chose to open a downscale house in an upscale  neighborhood, although, as with any sort of restaurant, an inexpensive one is  only worth the trouble when it's good. La Jolla Seas makes the grade some of  the time.  </P> <P> The restaurant's single strongest point may be its service, which on both of  two recent visits was thoroughly professional and pleasant. The atmosphere  suits La Jolla Seas' overall approach and might be described as comfortable but  modest. The banquettes are reasonably deep, but as a small and very noticeable  economy, sheets of glass cover the tablecloths to save on laundry expenses.  Lithographed studies of palm trees and birds of paradise line the walls and  seem oddly appropriate to the location, since Costa Verde is planted with  impressive stands of palms.  </P> <P> Hashimoto also owns two restaurants in Salt Lake City, which may explain why  the menu might most accurately be described as "Middle-American melting pot."  Chef Terry Miyake oversees a list that, according to Hashimoto, is written "in  a health-conscious manner," a point of view that here translates into  low-sodium cooking free of preservatives and animal fats.  </P> <P> But "health-consciousness," real or claimed, does not necessarily provide a  gastronomic focus, and the menu seems mostly an amalgam of styles. There are  the blunt Americanisms of oysters Rockefeller, shrimp and crab cocktails, the  "turkey club croissant" sandwich (the croissant may be French, but this sort of  sandwich is as resolutely American as chop suey and clam chowder. Pasta --  fettuccine, to be precise -- appears both on its own in several guises and as a  garnish, and usually seems more all-purpose than specifically Italian. The menu  makes much of seafood and finishes it with Japanese, Italian, French, Mexican  and American sauces or garnishes.  </P> <P> Sometimes the culinary mix leads to confusion, as it did at lunch when the  pepper steak sandwich sounded like a very good bet. The dish the diner  visualized was a thin, cracked pepper-coated steak, sauteed in the French style  and tucked into a roll; the reality was Philadelphia-style layers of grilled,  paper-thin beef dressed with sauteed green peppers and onions. For all that, it  was perfectly tasty and satisfying, but nonetheless a good illustration of the  point that it pays to ask questions. The lunch menu, by the way, basically is a  lower-priced repeat of the dinner list.  </P> <P> When the kitchen succeeds, it succeeds handily. The appetizer list includes an  offering called "house special chicken," which, although it is not identified  as such, is simply a smaller-scale serving of the entree called "Newport  chicken." The boned breast is given a light batter coating, carefully  deep-fried to a fine finish, brushed with a nicely sweet teriyaki glaze and  topped with sauteed snow peas and mushrooms. The dish comes together well, as  do soups; chef Miyake turns out a light-bodied clam chowder of fine flavor and,  on occasion, a cream of mushroom of some depth.  </P> <P> The entree named "seafood confetti" also seemed a fairly well-put-together  dish, although the guest who ordered it found that salt was needed to develop  the flavors.  </P> <P> Based on the success of the chicken appetizer, the entrees with Oriental  influences may be the best. These are primarily in the seafood category and  include mahi-mahi with pineapple glaze, ahi in the restaurant's own teriyaki  sauce, orange roughy in a gingered orange sauce and a shrimp-and-vegetable  tempura combination. Dishes with sauces from other cuisines include swordfish  with pesto; salmon with sauce maltese (properly a hollandaise flavored with  bitter blood oranges, which are hard to find in this country); red snapper Vera  Cruz topped with fresh salsa and veal scallops served in the Oscar (French) and  piccata (Italian) styles.  </P> <P> * LA JOLLA SEAS  </P> <P> Costa Verde Center, 8650 Genesee Ave.  </P> <P> 458-4225  </P> <P> Lunch and dinner served Monday through Saturday; closed Sunday.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $30 to $60.  </P></p>

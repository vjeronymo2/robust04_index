			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Abbey puts home cover cost up 26% ABBEY National, the country's second-largest mortgage lender, announced yesterday that it is to increase premiums on home contents insurance policies by an average of 26 per cent, underlining the recent upward trend in premium rates. The rise follows increases elsewhere in the insurance market and comes after a steep increase in theft costs. Last week the Association of British Insurers announced that the the cost of theft claims in 1992 had risen 27 per cent on the previous year to Pounds 749m. Although the increase appears to be slightly ahead of the trend of rises elsewhere in the insurance market, the premiums charged until now by Abbey are understood to be cheaper than its main rivals. Abbey sells home structure and contents policies on behalf of a a 'panel' of three insurers: Commercial Union, Royal Insurance and Legal &amp; General. Earlier this year all three announced that they had increased premium rates in most classes of insurance following heavy underwriting losses over the past three years. The rises will take effect from the date that policies are renewed. However, customers renewing their policies between May and the end of the year will also pay an average rise of 10 per cent announced in December last year, taking their total increase to 37 per cent. Mr Ambrose McGinn, head of product marketing at Abbey, said the increase was 'regrettable'.</p>

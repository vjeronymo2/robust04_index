			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bad luck or bad plan? Sir, Is it not typical of the government's bad luck (or poor judgment) that just as the controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant is about to start, a story in the FT ('Plutonium plan may be suspended', February 24) reports how the Japanese government is about to suspend its plutonium recycling programme and, with it, Thorp's major customer? The FT also mentioned the French government's decision to cease the production of electricity (and plutonium waste) at its Superphenix fast breeder reactor ('Utilities could sue over reactor', February 24). The two countries normally described as having made a success of nuclear power are clearly having second thoughts. Russell Sparkes, Ethical Investment Consultants, East Sheen, London SW14 7RL</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KRENZ, IN MOSCOW, PLEDGES REFORMS FOR EAST GERMANY  </P> <P> East Germany's new Communist leader, Egon Krenz, said here Wednesday that he  will submit a program of political and economic change to his ruling Socialist  Unity Party when its policy-making Central Committee meets next week. He  predicted that its adoption will mark a historic turning point for his country.  </P> <P> Krenz, speaking after three hours of talks with Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, said he wants to apply the lessons of perestroika (restructuring) to  East Germany. But he cautioned that he intends to strengthen -- not weaken --  socialism through reform.  </P> <P> With tens of thousands of East Germans continuing to demonstrate daily,  demanding free elections, legalization of opposition groups, an end to press  censorship and other changes, Krenz said the party leadership is committed to  reform and to opening a political dialogue with its critics.  </P> <P> "Many people are out on the streets to show that they want a better socialism  and the renovation of society," Krenz said. "I consider this to be a very good  sign, an indication that we are at a turning point in the life of the German  Democratic Republic. . . .  </P> <P> "We will take up every idea that is expressed," Krenz said. "I cannot, of  course, promise that we will solve all the problems, but we should not just be  making promises but getting down to work."  </P> <P> He said the party will propose changes in the country's election laws before  the 1991 parliamentary elections and put forward legislation soon that will  permit every East German to obtain "a passport and visa for travel to every  country in the world."  </P> <P> Referring to the mass flight of more than 120,000 of the country's 16.6-million  people to West Germany this year, Krenz said he believes that reforms will  persuade East Germans to stay.  </P> <P> "When we make socialism more attractive in our land, then there is no doubt  that trust will be regained and people will stay at home," he said.  </P> <P> Widely regarded as a hard-liner, the 52-year-old Krenz sought to project an  image of conciliation and reform at his first full-scale news conference since  replacing Erich Honecker, the longtime East German party leader who was his  political mentor.  </P> <P> The time has come for change in East Germany, he said of Honecker's retirement  two weeks ago, adding, "Those who do not want to accept changes are not real  politicians."  </P> <P> He rejected the characterization of himself as tough and ideologically orthodox  in the Honecker mold. "I am not a hard-liner -- I am a Communist," he declared  in the course of a lively, 75-minute exchange with the press.  </P> <P> Honecker had rejected perestroika, the Gorbachev reform program, as  unnecessary, at least for East Germany, and had told other East European  leaders that he feared it threatened the ideological purity of socialism. But  Krenz emphasized that he wants to implement similar changes.  </P> <P> "We wholeheartedly support the process of revolutionary perestroika in the  Soviet Union," he said. "The process of perestroika determines the future of  socialism in the world, and the future of the world depends on its success."  </P> <P> The Soviet experience is a valuable lesson, he said, in political, economic and  social reform. He said his party intends, as the Soviet Communist Party has  tried, to draw everyone into the reform process and not to restrict politics  and power to party members.  </P> <P> But every socialist country must make its own decisions, he said, and East  Germany is not looking to the experiments in political pluralism in neighboring  Poland or Hungary for inspiration.  </P> <P> "The main idea we think we can use is that perestroika is aimed at making  socialism more attractive and more effective," he said.  </P> <P> But Krenz, who led the East German youth organization and then was in charge of  security matters, made it clear that some things remain immutable. The Berlin  Wall will not come down, he said, and German reunification is out of the  question.  </P> <P> The wall, erected in 1961 to halt an earlier exodus of political refugees to  West Germany, is not only "a barrier to prevent people meeting each other," as  the West has charged, he said. "This is not just a border between two states  but between two social systems and two military blocs with a great  concentration of military power in the vicinity. . . .  </P> <P> "This border is a kind of protective shield. . . . The reason for it still  exists. We should have a realistic point of view and not live in illusions."  </P> <P> German reunification is also an illusion, Krenz said. "This question is not on  our agenda," he said, asserting that there is "nothing to reunite" between  socialist East Germany and the capitalist West. "The stability of Europe is  more important."  </P> <P> EXODUS GROWS -- Hundreds more East Germans flee to Czechoslovakia. A18  </P></p>

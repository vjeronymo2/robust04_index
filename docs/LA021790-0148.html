			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> NEUGEBAUER TO RUN FOR WIEDER'S POST  </P> <P> Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer will challenge Supervisor Harriett  M. Wieder in her expected bid for a fourth term on the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Neugebauer, 62, a three-time former mayor, said she will take out nomination  papers next week to run for Wieder's District 2 seat.  </P> <P> Instead of paying a $752.96 candidate filing fee, Neugebauer is collecting the  3,012 signatures needed to have her name placed on the ballot.  </P> <P> "We've collected signatures in each of the cities represented in the district  to test my name recognition," Neugebauer said.  </P> <P> Cities in the 2nd District include all of Cypress, Huntington Beach, Los  Alamitos, Seal Beach and Stanton, and parts of Garden Grove, La Palma, Midway  City and Westminster.  </P> <P> Neugebauer said she is not intimidated by the prospect of facing Wieder.  </P> <P> "I feel I'll be elected on my strengths and not anybody else's weaknesses,"  Neugebauer said. "I have a longtime pattern of staying in touch with people, of  listening to them and seeking their input on important issues."  </P> <P> The councilwoman said her major concerns are transportation, crime, drugs and  health care.  </P> <P> This is not Neugebauer's first run for higher office. In 1974, she ran  unsuccessfully for the 38th Congressional District seat. She came in second in  the Republican primary with 46% of the vote.  </P> <P> "I've had a long-term interest in higher office," Neugebauer said. "Now that my  children are grown, I want to work full time to make government responsive to  the people it serves."  </P> <P> Neugebauer was elected to the first of five terms on the City Council in 1968.  In 1984, she became the first mayor to be elected by popular vote.  </P> <P> Wieder, 69, of Huntington Beach, and Marie Alexis Antos, 45, a Seal Beach  homemaker, will face Neugebauer in the June 5 primary election.

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / TUC wants oil rig safety consultation OFFSHORE OIL and gas operators should be required to consult employee representatives when preparing safety measures, the Trades Union Congress says in a submission today. Under new Health and Safety Commission proposals - which follow the recommendations of the Cullen report into the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988 in which 167 men died - operators will have to prepare detailed safety cases setting out how they would deal with all issues related to health and safety. Each safety case will have to be accepted by the Health and Safety Executive. In a memorandum to the executive, the TUC said it welcomed the proposed framework for 'one of the most hazardous working environments'. But it said those at the sharp end of industrial risk should have the opportunity to have an influence on safety measures. About 150 survivors and relatives attended the opening of a memorial to the victims of Piper Alpha yesterday. A 2.5-metre high pink granite stone was unveiled in Strathclyde Park, near Glasgow.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (1): A shock for the senses - First impressions: From the moment that you land in bustling, colourful Hong Kong, the experience sends the adrenalin rushing, says David Dodwell Head glued to the window of the jumbo descending into Hong Kong, you first get seriously alarmed when you realise you can see the chopsticks of the family eating supper in the tenement block passing beneath the outstretched wheels. Just when you are sure the undercarriage is about to rip nests of television aerials from the rooftops, the plane banks judderingly right, and you hit the runway, with brakes full on and nothing but sea on either side. You would not be human if the adrenalin were not rushing. It is a rare human that does not find the adrenalin rushing in similar fashion throughout a stay in the territory: 'Hong Kong shocks the senses from the moment you land,' a fellow passenger noted: 'It may thrill you. It may appal you. But it is certain to shock the senses.' Whether it is the teeming streets, the Manhattan skylines, the maritime hub-bub, the night-time neon technicolours, or joss-scented Taoist temples, one walks Hong Kong wide-eyed. Small wonder that it provides home for some of the world's most creative entrepreneurs, and counts among the world's most bustling business centres. Small wonder, too, that the world's recession appears to have passed it by. Here you can hold seven meetings in a day, and still have time for cocktails before dinner. You can eat haute cuisine from every corner of the world. You can rest your head in some of the world's best hotels, paying a fraction of what even mediocre European or US hotels would cost. The community is as cosmopolitan as New York  - the city with which it is most frequently compared, and which it most resembles. In less than a decade this will be China. Some say this will spell the end of Hong Kong's 'golden age.' Others say that Hong Kong can forge its own future as the capital of a south Chinese economy that encompasses 120m people in Guangdong, Fujian and Taiwan. At present, as the leadership in Beijing edges nervously towards creating a more open society, there is a good chance Hong Kong's optimists will be right. It is these optimists that are driving growth that has averaged almost 8 per cent a year over the past decade. They have put down 25,000 factories inside China, where they employ about 3m people. They are encouraging the metamorphosis of Hong Kong from a simple manufacturer into a centre of sophisticated services ranging from product design to quality control, including the panoply of business and financial services, and providing the main communications hub for east Asia. Few places are likely to be more exciting  - or, for the business person, more fruitful  - in the decade ahead.</p>

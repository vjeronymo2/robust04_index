			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Polish miners join copper, car strike EMPLOYEES at four Polish coal mines went on strike yesterday, joining copper and car workers, in response to a call by radical trade unions which want to make the government back down from painful economic reforms, Reuter reports from Warsaw. At the Gdansk shipyard where the Solidarity trade union was born, about 80 workers were fired for staging an illegal protest, a sign that the authorities were unlikely to give in, PAP news agency said. 'There are four coal mines on strike now, and there are rallies in more than a dozen,' said Mr Marek Opasnik, a spokesman for the former communist union OPZZ. 'This is just the beginning. There will be many more mines and factories joining if the government doesn't start negotiations on our 21 demands,' he added. These demands include an end to Poland's 13 per cent unemployment, 'the immediate abandonment of the current chaotic and fraudulent privatisation,' lower interest rates and the abandonment of strict wage controls in state industry. The six unions have also taken up the cause of workers at the huge state-owned copper combine KGHM Polska Miedz SA and the plant which makes Fiat SA's Cinquecento minicar, both of which have held pay strikes for the last month. The six, which unite a radical offshoot of the Solidarity trade union with miners, farmers and railway workers' groups led by former communists, claim the support of 5m members. Few of these have so far taken part in the protests. The Solidarity union itself, which claims just under two million members, has distanced itself from the protest calls, although it is also demanding urgent government action to help ailing state industry. Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka's coalition government has promised measures to help relieve heavy debts owed by enterprises, but has refused to give in to strikes or negotiate workers' demands while stoppages continue. Solidarity leaders have agreed to co-operate with their former colleague, President Lech Walesa, in trying to break the stalemate and have appealed to workers to end the strikes.</p>

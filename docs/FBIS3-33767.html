The members said the state finds itself in a dangerous  situation because of the spreading famous trio: unemployment,  corruption, and terrorism.    The members noted the very high prices of all basic  commodities and services, demanded a fixed, standard price for  bread, and cautioned against the continuing rise in water,  electricity, and medicine prices.    They called for social justice in the government's measures  and for protecting and securing free medicine for students and  workers.    Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi leveled sharp criticism at  some newspapers and described what they publish about the  officials' corruption as "coffee shop and street talk."</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 0050 GMT on 2 June carries a report on General Raul Castro's  24 May tour of Youth Labor Army [EJT] camps in Camaguey  Province. The report begins with file footage of Castro's August  1993 address to mark the Batalla de la Sacra anniversary, during  which he announced the EJT's creation.    The report then switches to footage of the 25 May final  analysis meeting with several Politburo members, generals, local  officials, party officials, enterprise representatives, and a  large group of journalists. He emphasizes that "the EJT was  primarily created to solve the lack of manpower in the  sugarcane, agrarian, and livestock sectors in the fertile lands  of Camaguey." Aerial shots of the farms and EJT members at work  are shown while Castro speaks.    He says the EJT flag has been hoisted in 56 municipalities,  "from the coffee-growing mountains of Baracoa on the eastern tip  of Cuba to the Isle of Youth and the tobacco plantations in  western Pinar del Rio," and that their unselfish efforts and  higher productivity and efficiency were praised by Commander in  Chief Fidel Castro at the 7th Science and Technology Forum,  where he said the EJT continues to grow, and is the most  productive force in the agriculture sector.    Raul Castro indicates that the EJT is in charge of "19  integral farms owned by eight enterprises, which produce  assorted crops in Havana Province. The integral farms encompass  830 caballerias, which represent half of the tillable land owned  by those enterprises. The other half is organized in production  cooperatives. The two forms of organization using state-owned  land encompass 60 percent of the area destined for the  production of edible roots and vegetables, and the remaining 40  percent belongs to the peasants." This means that "the EJT  fighters are responsible for 30 percent of the area destined to  provide these products for the population in Havana Province,  which has close to 3 million inhabitants."    The announcer indicates that "all this work must be done  despite the shortage of fuel, fertilizers, pesticides, farming  tools, spare parts, assorted materials, clothes, shoes -- even  hats, which are essential in the tropical sun."    Within the meeting, various camp leaders review the work  carried out on each farm, the types of problems encountered, the  efforts to find appropriate solutions, the Union of Young  Communist's [UJC] efforts in the area. Colonel Jorge Romero  says, "The Minfar [Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces]  commission adapted its work to the control system used by EJT  leaders. This allowed an in-depth analysis of the work methods  and styles. The most evident advantages include the possibility  of confirming results and developing production processes and  work systems," as well as "learning about current deficiencies  and problems and pinpointing their causes more accurately;  evaluating the overall results rather than partial or individual  results; being more objective in our assessment and enabling us  to solve certain problems during the visit." Col. Romero says,  "Officers are prepared to control all of the farm's activities  regardless of their specialty;" adding that "compliance with the  measures and recommendations" has helped train the Havana  Division, and that this "will be systematically checked until  their full implementation."    Other camp leaders discuss the EJT members' education  levels,  relations with the community, visits to the capital,  entertainment programs, costs of food and clothing, and minor  issues brought up by the workers.    Castro reviews the final report and asks that a copy be  given to the journalists so they can review it and ask  questions. One of the journalists says he is "impressed with the  report because it is very specific and reviews problems  honestly, but without pessimism."    In reply to another journalist's question, Castro responds:  "We will let no one [pauses] we will act within the law, and I  say this before someone interprets this as a threat to anyone.  We will act within a legal framework so nothing, neither the  illegal street vendors nor the deficiency of our government  bureaucracy, prevents the fruits of our soldiers' work from  reaching their final destination -- the local market, the  people."    The meeting continues with reports from various Minfar  officers. Some of them review visits to other farms and their  assessment of the technical and material supplies, time allotted  for travel, EJT members' complaints about meals and potable  water supplies. Other officers refer to farm machinery, fuel  consumption and delivery, work attendance, salaries, costs, and  production levels.    Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan also addresses the  meeting and says that "undoubtedly, the transformation process  currently being implemented in the agriculture sector, based on  the Politburo agreement, actually represents five forms of  production" because it involves state-owned farms; 29 UJC farms;  28 agrarian and livestock cooperatives; and 49 credit and  service cooperatives. The sum of all this must necessarily  increase production."    Minister Jordan adds: "We recently checked the integral  farms' work during the first period, here in Havana. We said it  was necessary to adapt an overall control system for the  in-depth simplification process we must logically continue in  the agriculture sector. We must change the agriculture sector  from top to bottom. We must evaluate the work and we must do it  correctly. We will refer to the EJT integral farms' work based  on what we have seen here. We will also evaluate the work done  by agrarian and livestock cooperatives, individual peasants, and  credit and service cooperatives."    The official also admits there prevail "a series of  difficulties and problems; they are part of the overall process  currently underway. Like I said in the beginning, I am fully  convinced, fully and truly convinced that, under the current  circumstances and despite the limitations of resources we have,  the number of things we can do is infinite, and the information  presented here proves it. I think this was ascertained everyday  wherever we went -- how much more can be done with the fuel we  deliver, how much more can be done with the fertilizer we  deliver, how much more can be done with the chemical products we  deliver, and how much more can be done by the leadership to  optimize the manpower we have. The number of things that can be  done concerning crop production is infinite."    Furthermore, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, first  vice minister of the Minfar and chief of the Armed Forces  General Staff, summed up the work carried out when he said that  "this is the second work visit the Minfar has carried out in the  Havana Division, according to the method we have created to  periodically ascertain the work carried out by this great unit,  the results of its production tasks, the problems it faces, and  the help it needs."    He says every effort is being made to overcome "the  shortages  we still have and the problems which preclude the achievement of  higher levels. This is where we must fulfill our duty to  guarantee and support the processes and systems. We cannot let  this production effort be limited or go to waste due to the lack  of means that could have been obtained on time, an activity that  could have been carried out in advance, or a lack of effort,"  because "that is our role, and we are sure the EJT will fulfill  its role -- as it recently showed us with the results achieved  in the latest potato harvest," which "resulted in more than  744,000 quintals and obtained a profit in excess of 300,000  pesos. Twelve farms achieved positive economic results. Upon  evaluating the EJT's production results on this occasion, we  stress that the EJT has again demonstrated its determination to  not only produce and achieve a high yield, but also to become  more and more efficient and feasible."    Gen. Rosales concludes his statement by praising the EJT  soldiers and commanding officers for their work and dedication,  to fulfill their main task, while dealing with the shortage of  agricultural products.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Let us start by looking at Silvio Berlusconi's march  towards the premiership. Giovanni Masotti reports.    [Masotti] There were smiles and optimism, which was an  unexpected development. Only yesterday Umberto Bossi had said  no for the umpteenth time to Berlusconi's bid for the  premiership. But today, following a 90 minute meeting, Bossi  gave Berlusconi the go-ahead.    [Begin Berlusconi recording] In this alliance Forza Italia  is  the major force. Berlusconi is the leader of Forza Italia, he  practically created this movement. So I cannot see how there  can be any doubt on this matter, and this will be confirmed to  you by the Northern League and its representatives. [end  recording]    [Masotti] Berlusconi is pushing ahead, and hinted at what an  organizational chart might look like. He also revealed that he  has contacted the Center. Berlusconi did not rule out that the  deputy premiership could go to a Northern League politician. He  added that the National Alliance would be part of the  government, although party leader Gianfranco Fini would not join  the government by his own choice.    Bossi has also spoken of a first, reasonably clear and  positive signal. He said that they are starting from a fixed  position -- that of federalism. Bossi will meet Berlusconi  again on Friday [1 April], and the meeting could be decisive.</p>

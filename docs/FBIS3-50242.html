			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petko Koprivica] </F>   [Excerpts] [Koprivica] No more worries and guessing. The  republic of Serbian Krajina has a new president. He is 39-year  old lawyer Milan Martic, a man who embodies dignity, bravery,  steadiness, firmness, and the freedom-loving spirit of the  Krajina residents [passage omitted]. Here is his first  statement in the role of the president of the republic of  Serbian Krajina:    [Martic] I believe that the changes I have promised will be  experienced very soon because I want capable, intelligent, and  above all, honorable people to join forces. I know that they  are everywhere in the republic of Serbian Krajina, in the  republic of Srpska, and in Serbia, and I know a good many of  these people wish to help. I am not important, it is these  people who matter and what we have accomplished thus far. I  believe that we will succeed in all this and that the republic  of Serbian Krajina will soon take its place in this unified  Serbian country.    [Koprivica] Do you expect, now that the people have  expressed their desire that you be the president of the republic  of Serbian Krajina, that the negative tendencies in this region  created over the last year or two will subside and the people  will turn to real issues such as defense, reconstruction, and  finally, the merging of Krajina with its core, Serbia?    [Martic] I am firmly convinced that this will be the case.  Personally, I am not one to bear a grudge. Those people who  have perhaps been misled and deceived by something that was not  true and had no grounds, will finally understand. I believe  that we will all very soon tackle these common goals. All the  current negative tendencies will soon disappear and the people  who might have been misled will understand. I am convinced that  this program must succeed.    [Koprivica] It goes without saying that the residents of the  republic of Serbian Krajina, with the election of Milan Martic  as president, have won another great and historic victory that  should at the same time be understood as a message to the world  that not a single inch of the present territory of this most  western Serbian land will ever again, under any circumstances,  be part of Croatia.</p>

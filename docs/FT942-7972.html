			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Open options Pricing this week's Pounds 2bn auction of convertible gilts promises to be a daunting task for even the most brilliant rocket scientist. The three year gilt can be converted on four separate dates into 9 per cent bonds due in 2012. It thus effectively includes a series of options to buy long-dated paper whose value must be factored into the auction price. From the Bank of England's perspective this is a good time to be selling such options, since recent cash market volatility has made them more expensive. For options traders, the challenge lies in deciding whether the price of the gilt is such that they can acquire the embedded options at a price lower than the options market itself would charge. Market imperfections mean that there is a chance of this happening. The price of the auction stock will tend to reflect movements in short-dated gilts, whereas the options relate to long-dated issues. Indeed any gilt market weakness which discourages institutional buying at the time of the auction may only make the convertible gilt more attractive to options specialists. Yet the difficulty in calculating option values and the deal's complex structure makes it hard for any participant to know what represents value at the end of the day. The 2012 issue would have to yield less than 7.2 per cent to make conversion worthwhile at the most distant date in February 1996. That compares with almost 8 per cent on Friday. Any institutions which really believe rates will fall that far during the next two years would be better off buying longer-dated paper now in order to collect the full capital gain. Any which believe rates will be higher should buy a conventional three-year gilt and reinvest the proceeds on maturity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Sadao Hirano, Shinseito (Japan Renewal </F> Party) member close to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa,  and Shusei Tanaka, "the No. 2 man" in Sakigake, by AERA editor  Yoshiyuki Shuto: "Ichiro Ozawa Versus Masayoshi Takemura--Their  Close Associates Give a True Account of the Recent Change in the  Government"; places and dates not given]    [Text] The Hosokawa Administration Was Wrecked by  Those Who Tried To Form an Alliance To Protect the Peace  Constitution    [Shuto] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden  announcement of his resignation sparked various disputes within  the ruling coalition over the question of whom to select as his  successor. What was the cause of this trouble?    [Hirano] The ostensible reasons for Prime Minister  Hosokawa's  sudden resignation were the improper management of his personal  funds by one of his old friends and the Diet deadlock over the  FY 1994 budget bills, which was brought on by scandal  allegations against him. Prime Minister Hosokawa decided to  step down from a sense of responsibility. However, behind the  scenes, there was a more important problem.    The Hosokawa administration, which was launched as a reform  government, achieved its goal with the enactment of the  political reform bills. Therefore, after the passage of the  bills, it was indispensable to strengthen the coalition's unity  by reviewing the previous agreement reached by the coalition  parties, and by working out a new policy platform.  Unfortunately, Prime Minister Hosokawa failed to strengthen the  framework of the ruling coalition, and this was the real reason  for his resignation.    In my opinion, what brought about the collapse of the  Hosokawa administration was the secret attempt by a certain  group in the ruling coalition to form an alliance with the  members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who  favor preservation of the peace Constitution.    [Shuto] Are you talking about Sakigake's [Harbinger] plan to  form a grand alliance with the LDP and the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ]?    [Hirano] Yes. There are some indications that Sakigake has  been pondering the plan since the middle of February. According  to sources close to Prime Minister Hosokawa, at the Japan-U.S.  summit meeting February, U.S. President Bill Clinton said to the  prime minister, "When the Japanese Government has to make a  decision about North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons  development program, a certain key person in the ruling  coalition might become a bottleneck."    [Shuto] I guess that President Clinton was alluding to  Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura. By the way, how did  Sakigake carry forward its plan to create a grand alliance with  the LDP and the SDPJ?    [Hirano] According to sources close to Prime Minister  Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura had planned to submit  his resignation to the prime minister on 13 April if the LDP's  demand that the prime minister agree to summon his former aide  to testify to the Diet about Hosokawa's personal finances had  continued to hold up deliberations on the FY 1994 budget. I  think that his resignation from the cabinet was part of his  scenario to form a grand alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ.    Meanwhile, the heads of three parties--the SDPJ, the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake--have stressed  that the process to select a successor to Hosokawa should be  handled by the heads of the parties rather than by the  secretaries general. The call for a top meeting by the heads of  the coalition parties in effect meant that they wanted to set up  a completely new government. Sakigake's plan to create a grand  alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ was lurking in the background.    According to the information available, those who had  planned  to create the grand alliance had already reached agreement on  such issues as tax reform and a revision of the UN Peacekeeping  Operations [PKO] Cooperation Law. I heard that they had agreed  not to raise the consumption tax and to continue the freeze on  participation of Self-Defense Forces personnel in UN  peacekeeping forces [when the so-called PKO law was enacted in  1992, it was agreed that the provision prohibiting participation  in PKO would be reviewed after three years].    [Shuto] I have one more question. I have heard that these  people expected an early dissolution of the lower house so that  the next general election would be held again under the old  multiseat electoral system. Is this true?    [Hirano] I suppose so. They should have planned the  following scenario: win a majority in the lower house election  held under the old electoral system, kill the new electoral  system in a vote, or divide the nation into single-seat  electoral districts in their own way, if it is not possible to  kill the system.    [Shuto] Sakigake has decided to support the new government  from outside the cabinet. What do you think of this?    [Hirano] Sakigake has been proposing its own policy goals,  using fine language. To me, it seems that this party is only  making irresponsible statements. It always says nice things,  but it never wants to bear responsibility. Such an attitude  could be seen during the debate over the rice issue and during  the turmoil caused by the prime minister's plan to impose a  7-percent welfare tax. It seems to me that Sakigake is just  trying to hold the deciding vote while advocating its policy  goals.    When Sakigake set out its basic stand on major issues, it  pledged to respect the peace Constitution. However, its respect  for the peace Constitution is qualitatively different from the  SDPJ's principle of safeguarding the peace Constitution.  Therefore, even if Sakigake tries to push its policy under the  slogan of "respect for the peace Constitution," the public will  probably give the party a frigid stare, although most Sakigake  lawmakers are taking it seriously.    [Shuto] Could you please explain the basic stand taken by  Shinseito leaders, including Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa?    [Hirano] Policy goals should be consistent with political  ideologies, and this should be the basis of a government. It is  only right for political groups sharing similar political  ideologies to join hands in forming a government. Shinseito has  always assumed that an alliance was possible, not only with  Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, but also with other LDP members having the same  aspirations as ours. Meanwhile, the Hosokawa administration  valued cooperation with the United States above everything else.  Our party is trying to follow this line, but those who wanted  to form an LDP-SDPJ alliance have different beliefs. For  instance, they think that Japan should not take a firm attitude  toward North Korea, which is suspected of developing nuclear  weapons.    [Shuto] Parties in the ruling coalition have finally reached  a policy agreement on which to form a new government, after a  tense deadlock over different issues, including the question of  how to deal with the DPRK's alleged development of nuclear  weapons.    [Hirano] The North Korean nuclear issue is really important  because it directly affects Japan's national security. If worse  comes to worst, and if the government is unable to take  appropriate actions to cope with the situation, then Japan will  fall into utter confusion. As for tax reform, if the government  does not come up with a concrete plan before this summer, Japan  will be isolated at the annual G-7 economic summit to be held in  Naples. It is because these issues are so important that our  party has insisted that the coalition members work out their  differences before forming a new government. I believe that the  public has understood why the coalition has put in so many hours  on working out a new policy platform.  <H5>  Sakigake Wanted To Join Hands With LDP Members Favoring the </H5> Peace Constitution    [Shuto] During the process to select a successor to Prime  Minister Hosokawa, Sakigake once tried to check the influence of  the Shinseito-Komeito bloc by forming an alliance with the SDPJ  and the DSP. What was Sakigake's real intention?    [Tanaka] Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, SDPJ Chairman  Tomiichi Murayawa, and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi were of the same  opinion that many things had to be reviewed on the way that the  ruling coalition had been running the government.    The first point at issue is that some coalition members have  made several attempts to do so in view of the next stage of the  political realignment, under the pretext that these moves would  support the coalition government. The Hosokawa administration,  which was launched as a "political-reform government," gradually  lost its uniting force after achieving its sole mission of  political reform. Prime Minister Hosokawa tried to regain a  uniting force by strengthening the framework under which the  coalition government was formed. The problem was that some  people had considered effecting the solidification of the  framework in connection with the creation of a coalition-wide  "new new party" in view of the next lower house election, which  is supposed to be held under the new single-seat electoral  system. Our party could not accept these two separate matters  being treated in one lot.    Meanwhile, those who considered the Hosokawa administration  to be a non-LDP government before everything else thought that  the problem would be settled simply by putting a new face in the  prime minister's office. However, our party had a different  view. The ruling coalition had been entrusted with a special  mission to implement political reform. Now that it has  accomplished its original duty, putting a new face in the prime  minister's office was not enough. That was our opinion.    [Shuto] Sakigake has unveiled its basic stand toward major  issues, and it has advocated respect for the peace Constitution.  Was this a message addressed to LDP members who are against  revising the peace Constitution, saying that your party is  willing to form an alliance with them?    [Tanaka] Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, former  Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda, and some other LDP members  have inherited the pacifist policy that the so-called  "mainstream conservative faction" has embraced since the LDP was  formed in 1955. Our party always had a friendly feeling toward  these LDP members, who have the same view that we do concerning  the peace Constitution and the evaluation of the postwar period.  If possible, we would like to join hands with them, and we  still wish to do so.    Sakigake thinks that Japan's peace Constitution should be  preserved, at least until Japan can form a clear view of the  situation on the Korean peninsula, a clear view regarding the  prevention of nuclear proliferation. In this context, we can  say that our statement was addressed to every political group  that respects Japan's peace Constitution.    [Shuto] The SDPJ's principle of safeguarding the peace  Constitution is basically the same as yours. How far has  Sakigake's plan to form a grand alliance with the LDP and the  SDPJ been carried forward?    [Tanaka] It is true that some LDP members have approached  me on the matter, because at that time, there was a story going  around that Mr. Watanabe would leave the LDP to join forces with  Shinseito and Komeito. Meanwhile, our party is giving the SDPJ  credit for being a strong supporter of the peace Constitution.  However, to tell the truth, we were far from reaching the stage  of forming a new government under the framework of an LDP-SDPJ  alliance for the protection of the peace Constitution.    [Shuto] What was the meaning of the last political drama?    [Tanaka] The most important result is that antagonism  between  LDP and non-LDP forces has decreased. This tendency should be  welcomed. It has become clear that the LDP is neither able to  stand as a powerful opposition nor determined to seize back the  reins of government by solidifying its unity. In other words,  there is no possibility of going back to the so-called "1955  order," the postwar political structure monopolized by the LDP.  Metaphorically speaking, the non-LDP side has many new  locomotives, while the LDP side has only railroad cars and  unusable locomotives.    There is no doubt that Shinseito constitutes a locomotive.  As for Sakigake, it also wants to become a locomotive. In my  opinion, the non-LDP side has been completely transformed into a  new political force in the true sense of the word, and it is now  clear that the new force will be divided into two groups in the  near future. We have already entered the next phase of  political realignment.    [Shuto] Sakigake has decided to support the new government  from outside the cabinet. Don't you think that this would mean  the isolation of Sakigake in Nagata-cho?    [Tanaka] We do not want to be isolated, but at the same time  we are not afraid of becoming isolated. We had such a sentiment  when we decided not to accept any position in the new cabinet.  We do not feel isolated, because we do not think that  Nagata-cho's political map corresponds exactly to the political  map drawn by the public.    On the contrary, we strongly feel that we have obtained a  free hand, by staying under another framework of the ruling  coalition. We can now speak with more freedom about political  realignment and about the future of our country. Every move we  make will no longer be perceived as being a result of a fierce  power struggle within the ruling coalition. We have finally  created a situation under which we can treat the question of  political realignment and the question of maintaining a  coalition government separately. We expect to set out our party  platform in June. As a result, we now feel somewhat refreshed.</p>

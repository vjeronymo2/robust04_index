			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Doctors open the debate on care rationing BRITAIN'S doctors yesterday opened the way to involving the government and the public in discussions on one of the most sensitive of medical issues, the rationing of health care. The British Medical Association plans a national conference early next year and intends to invite senior ministers. Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the association's council, said the conference would also draw speakers from a wide range of backgrounds including doctors, philosophers, economists and patients. 'Rationing health care is not a party political issue,' he told the association's annual conference in Nottingham. 'It is an unavoidable fact of life and there is no doubt in my mind that it must be done openly.' There is growing recognition by governments that not all medical demands can be met with equal speed and that some form of priority setting is required. This has been done most controversially in the state of Oregon in the US where the authorities have developed a league table of medical and surgical priorities related to available funds. In the UK, the separation of healthcare purchasing from its provision under last year's health reforms is making health authorities more critical about allocation of resources, bringing the issue higher up the National Health Service agenda. Delegates at the association's conference supported a motion declaring that the rationing of health services was 'an unfortunate fact of life' and that it should be done openly by agreement between the Department of Health and the medical profession. Dr Lee-Potter said that the issue of rationing had to be faced as a matter of urgency, with clear guidelines agreed to bring consistent decisions on medical and surgical priorities throughout the NHS. Healthcare resources would always be finite while demands for services were not. A number of speakers in the debate supported this view but opponents, such as Dr Tony Hicklin from Surrey, argued that if the association endorsed the principle of rationing, ministers would regard it as the medical profession's agreement to 'any cuts in funding they decide to make'. Leaders of the association hope that opening up the debate on priorities may draw renewed attention to the relatively low level of GDP devoted to health care in the UK, which they regard as the NHS's worst structural problem. Dr Lee-Potter said that rationing 'must never be allowed to become another word for underfunding'.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Yugoslav army downs EC aircraft: Air force commander suspended - Defence Ministry plans urgent inquiry YUGOSLAVIA last night suspended the commander of its air force after the federal army admitted shooting down a European Community helicopter, killing five peace monitors. The European Commission roundly condemned the incident, in which four Italian soldiers and a French officer died, and called for a full inquiry. However, EC officials said international efforts to end the fighting would be stepped up. In a short, but unusually frank, statement issued through Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, the Defence Ministry said one of its aircraft had shot down one EC monitoring helicopter and damaged a second. The federal secretariat of national defence expressed 'deep regret' over 'an unwanted and tragic event'. It promised an urgent inquiry and said it would take legal measures against those responsible. Western diplomats said that the move by the Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav presidency to suspend Colonel Zvonko Jurjevic, the air force commander, might be an attempt to bring the armed forces under political control. Diplomats were surprised by the Defence Ministry admission. One said: 'The fact that the army admitted to it . . . quickly, and promised a full inquiry, makes me cautiously optimistic that the peace process can continue.' Previous army statements have tended to be sharply critical of independence moves by the republics of Slovenia and Croatia, which are expecting recognition by most EC countries on January 15. The incident happened early yesterday as EC officials and monitors were being flown from Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, via Hungary, to Zagreb, the Croatian capital. The five dead, the first casualties among EC monitors in the Yugoslav civil war, included the Italian pilot and co-pilot of the helicopter, which exploded in mid-air. The second helicopter, carrying four Italians and a Belgian, crashlanded safely. The EC said it was 'appalled and dismayed' by the incident but Britain and Portugal, current EC president, said it would not be allowed to damage the chances of peace. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'The tragedy is bound to influence people's attitudes, but I think it will have the effect of redoubling efforts to achieve peace rather than weakening them.' Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace talks which are due to resume in Brussels tomorrow, described it as a 'tragic incident' and hoped it would not scupper peace hopes. The UN Security Council continued with its peace plans. It is asking 21 countries to provide two to three military observers. Anti-peace forces strike a blow, Page 2</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] While a debate rages on over the real extent of the  hike in the defence budget announced in Parliament last month,  the fact remains that it provides little for any worthwhile  modernisation or major acquisition. Defence, ironically,  continues to remain a low priority area for a country which has  fought four wars and still faces a proxy war. In the present  defence environment, each of the three arms is important.  Ignoring one at the cost of the others would be far from  judicious.    For the navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF), the prevailing  resource crunch and the low budgetary allocation is an issue of  particular concern. While the army is manpower-oriented, both  the navy and the air force are dependent on technology and  capital. Both these requirements go together, ruling out any  scope for compromise on either.    For the IAF, the going has been particularly worrisome. Even  the air chief had conceded at a news conference at the Bangalore  air show last December that managing the IAF with the prevailing  resource crunch was "damn tough".    The reality is indeed harsh. Not only have modernisation  plans suffered, but also the operational capabilities of the air  force, which had performed heroically in the 1971 Indo-Pak war.  Worse, the IAF has become an aged air force, with a fleet that  is almost obsolete in today's state-of-the-art en vironment. And  tragically for the IAF, the onset of the decline has coincided  with the Gulf war, which has left no doubt about the vital role  air power will play in future wars.    Most of the IAF aircraft are Soviet-made and very old. Over  half of the IAF's combat aircraft need to be replaced or  upgraded. The IAF, like the other two services, is faced with a  severe resource crunch following the collapse of its  long-standing defence ally, the Soviet Union. Further, it lacks  an advance jet trainer (AJT), is short of spares, lacks adequate  modern electronic equipment, weapon systems and force  multipliers, and needs a better air defence ground environment  system (ADGES), including more sophisticated early warning  systems and surface to air missiles (SAMs).    There is an absence of any strategic thinking on the part of  defence ministry policy-makers, who are mostly bureaucrats with  little experience or professional understanding of defence  issues. The three services have been reduced to begging for bare  essentials.    The bulk of the IAF's 39 combat squadrons comprises the  MiG-21 fighter-intercepters. Nine of these squadrons, which are  of 1960s vintage, are beyond upgradation and ought to have been  phased out years ago. But there is simply no money. Also, the  MiG-21 bis squadrons urgently need upgrading with modern  avionics and weapon systems. Unfortunately, the government  continues to procrastinate, paying little heed to the cost and  time-sensitive frame needed for this frontline defence aircraft.  These need to be operational for at least 15 more years so as to  be replaced with the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), scheduled to  fructify by 2005.    The four MiG-23 BN (ground attack) squadrons are similarly  outdated and are in the process of being replaced by the MiG-27,  an updated version, currently being assembled by HAL [Hindustan  Aeronautics Limited] at Ozhar (Maharashtra). The MiG-27, of  which the IAF has squadrons, is a uni-role tactical air strike  aircraft (TASA), which again has a limited range. About four  years hence, these too will require upgradation. Thus by 2005,  the MiG-27 fleet is more likely to resemble today's MiG-21  fleet, with little scope for replacement.    A similar picture is that of the Jaguars. This British  strike  aircraft, currently being assembled by HAL in Bangalore, is of  early 1970 vintage. The 4.5 squadrons available to the IAF  comprise half a squadron of the maritime strike version, the  only squadron of its kind in the IAF. Of the remaining four  Jaguar squadrons, two squadrons require urgent upgrading.    Thus, the only modern aircraft with the IAF today are the  two  squadrons of the French state-of-the-art, fly-by-wire,  multi-role Mirage-2000 aircraft and three squadrons of the  Soviet MiG-29 uni-role air superiority aircraft. In January, the  IAF had lost a Mirage-2000 to a bird hit, taking the total of  Mirage-2000s lost so far to four. In early February, the IAF  lost a MiG-29 taking the number of MiG-29s lost also to four.  While the Mirage-2000, then valued at Rs 43 crore, was inducted  in 1985, the MiG-29 entered the IAF only in 1987.    While the IAF continues to maintain its aged air force, the  Pakistani and Chinese air forces, by contrast, have been  involved in a steady modernisation programme. Despite the  Pressler amendment, not only has the PAF [Pakistan Air Force]  managed to regularly service and get, spare parts for its F-16s,  but also reportedly managed to increase flying hours on its  F-16s by about 10 per cent.    The IAF top brass is convinced that the US, will find some  way to deliver 71 more F-16s that are being sought by the PAF,  the Pressler amendment notwithstanding. Should that happen, the  government will have no option but to provide funds to buy  additional aircraft in order to make up for the imbalance caused  by this induction into the PAF. The IAF has already submitted a  proposal for inducting a squadron each of the Mirage-2000 and  the MiG-29.    A tempting option is to reduce the force level of the IAF  and  make it into a leaner and meaner force. This would mean  compelling the IAF to think carefully about its roles and  missions and start taking tough decisions.    But the IAF rules out this option, pointing out that threat  perceptions have only increased and not reduced. They point to  India's vast border and the huge army which will need air  support in case of a war. The only option, according to them, is  a more realistic budget in keeping with the security environment  that prevails in India's neighbourhood. While the government  confines its concerns to the intentions of a foreign government,  the armed forces are more concerned with the capabilities of  real and potential adversaries. Intentions can be temporary, but  capabilities take time to build and are permanent.</p>

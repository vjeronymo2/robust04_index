			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Kits give a new meaning to DIY - decoupage it yourself MOST of us have come across decoupage work at some time or another and marvelled at its beauty, its finesse, its intricacy but few of us, I imagine, ever dreamed that we might do it ourselves writes Lucia van der Post. Decoupage, in case the you are unfamiliar with the technique, involves using stencils, cut-outs, pictures, photographs to embellish anything from a tray to a screen or a piece of furniture. The pictorial elements are stuck on and then covered in coats of veneer to strengthen them. If you have the talent or inclination for time-consuming creative work there is no reason why you should not embark on this elegantly decorative craft. Belinda Ballantine, who has run decorative painting courses and clearly has limitless skill and patience for embellishing domestic objects, has produced a little collection of decoupage kits which simplify the whole fiddly business. The simplest of Ballantine's kits is the starter. For Pounds 15 you get a small box, the suggested designs and the rest of the necessary equipment. Trays start at Pounds 14.50, candlesticks at Pounds 18, and a planter is Pounds 18.50. She has written a book on the subject - The Decoupage Kit - which covers the technique in much more detail and offers more suggestions. The prime function of the kits, it seems to me, is to offer a smooth and easy introduction to the skill - once the basics have been learned endless decorative possibilities can be indulged in. Write to Belinda Ballantine, The Abbey Brewery, Market Cross, Malmesbury, Wiltshire SN16 9AS for her leaflet listing the kits and for any other details.</p>

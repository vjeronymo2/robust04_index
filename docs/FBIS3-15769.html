			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An extensive meeting was held at the Supreme Soviet  today under the chairmanship of Rasul Guliyev, speaker of the  parliament.    Our correspondent Gulsefa Ahmedova reports:    [Begin recording] [Ahmedova] The situation on the fronts and  in the Army and measures to end the more than five-year war were  discussed at a meeting that was devoted to the  military-political situation in the Republic and problems  connected with the creation of the army.    Rasul Guliyev informed the meeting that, despite contacts at  various levels to put an end to the Armenian aggression, the  opposing side is doing everything to prevent the resolution of  the conflict by peaceful means. No matter what the difficulties  are, the Azerbaijani people will shape their own destiny. Only  we ourselves should solve all our problems.    [Guliyev] The future and destiny of Azerbaijan rests solely  in the hands of the people. No one, be they our close neighbors  or countries friendly to us elsewhere, will solve the  Azerbaijani people's problems. For that reason, we must have a  strong army, internal unity, and economic potential. We must  also deal decisive and courageous blows against the enemy. Such  blows will bring peace closer. The opposing side will opt for  peace only when faced with force.    [Ahmedova] The chairman of the Supreme Soviet also informed  the meeting that Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of the Armenian  parliament, phoned him and expressed his wish for a meeting. It  is highly possible that this meeting could take place on  Saturday.    Prime Minister Suret Guseynov and heads of main departments  at various ministries were taking part in the meeting.    The meeting is continuing behind closed doors. [end  recording]</p>

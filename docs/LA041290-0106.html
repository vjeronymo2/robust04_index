			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> FRIENDS SAY VICTIM TRIED TO CHANGE LIFE  </P> <P> A 21-year-old Santa Ana man, gunned down on a street corner while holding the  hand of a 4-year-old girl, was described by friends Wednesday as a man trying  to pull his life together to please his mother.  </P> <P> Martin Julian Gonzalez was walking with the girl and her aunt to a nearby store  Tuesday evening when the girl's aunt started walking back to the house to get  money. It was then, police said, that a man jumped out of a passing car, ran up  to Gonzalez and shot him in the neck and chest as the 4-year-old looked on.  Investigators say the shooting may be gang-related, but no arrests have been  made.  </P> <P> The assailant sped away in a green car believed to be a late 1960s or early  1970s GM model. Police said they are not sure if the gunman was in the car  alone.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred about 6:20 p.m. on the southwest corner of Myrtle and  Baker streets. Gonzalez, who police said was a known gang member, had been  helping friends paint and move out of their Baker Street house where the  4-year-old lived. The mother of the girl, Ofelia Hernandez, 26, said she had  known Gonzalez for two years and recounted how she learned of his death.  </P> <P> "She kept screaming, 'They killed Martin! They killed Martin!' " Hernandez  quoted her daughter as saying. "I ran to her. Martin was already down. He was  on his way to the dairy around the corner to buy milk for my little girl and  sodas for all of us.  </P> <P> "He used to get along with everybody in this house. He offered to help us clean  out our house and paint it because we are moving from here. I wanted to pay  him, but he would not take the money."  </P> <P> Hernandez described Gonzalez as a helpful man who wanted to straighten out his  life.  </P> <P> "He didn't have a job and went out a lot. I asked him to start acting like a  grown man and stop worrying his mother so much," Hernandez said. "He said that  he was going to get a job. He was going to try to be a good son for his  mother."  </P> <P> Andreas Vargas, 33, who was at Hernandez's house when Gonzalez was shot, said  the gunman "fired three times. It was at close range. All the neighbors came  out of their houses." LUZ VILLARREAL  </P></p>

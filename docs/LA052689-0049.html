			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS' SEGOTA COULD MISS OPENER OF FINALS  </P> <P> Branko Segota, leading the Sockers in playoff points with 13, may not play the  opener of the Major Indoor Soccer League championship series Monday night at  Baltimore.  </P> <P> Segota reinjured his hamstring Saturday in a 1-0 victory over the Dallas  Sidekicks in Game 7 of the semifinal series. The odds Segota will be ready  Monday are about 50-50.  </P> <P> "I'd say it's no better than that," said Bill Taylor, the Sockers' trainer.  "He's torn some scar tissue in the same hamstring he's had trouble with all  year."  </P> <P> The injury occured minutes before Segota scored the winning goal. Taylor said  he and Segota discussed the possibility of him coming out of the game but  decided to let him try one more shift.  </P> <P> Segota hasn't practiced this week but is expected to do some light jogging  through the weekend.  </P> <P> "He's basically walking now without pain," Taylor said. "It's a day-to-day  thing." DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

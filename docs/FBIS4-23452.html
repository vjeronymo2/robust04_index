			<p>BFN     [Text] Rwanda's interim transport minister, Mr. Andre  Ntagerura, has blamed Uganda for the escalating bloodshed in his  country and called on President Nelson Mandela of South Africa  to play a role in ending the conflict.    Addressing a news conference in Pretoria today, he accused  Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is a Tutsi, of deploying  40,000 troops in Rwanda. Tutsis and Hutus are involved in the  tribal killings in the country. Mr. Ntagerura is in South  Africa to brief the government on the current state of affairs  in Rwanda and is scheduled to meet Mr. Mandela tomorrow. He  expressed the hope that Mr. Mandela can use his influence to  persuade Mr. Museveni to drop his support for the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF], which he blamed for the widespread human  slaughter in his country.    Mr. Ntagerura also alleged that Mr. Museveni is also  destabilizing the country by arming RPF troops. He further  blamed the Belgian contingent of UN peace keepers for allowing  the conflict to get out of hand in the first place, through what  he claimed was their failure to control arms acquisitions by the  RPF. He said due to a lack of supervision by the Belgians, the  RPF grew to 2,000 heavily armed soldiers who infiltrated the  entire country and sparked the current bloodshed by shooting  down President Habyarimana's plane.    Mr. Ntagerura denied that the interim government is in  hiding  or has gone into exile, saying it is holding regular meetings in  the capital, Kigali.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (2): 'Pragmatism doesn't mean short-term solutions' / Interview with President Fujimori - the questions were put to him by Stephen Fidler, the FT's Latin America editor QUESTION: Many people have told me that the economy is in better shape and the security situation has improved significantly over the last year or two. If you have achieved these gains under the existing constitution, why are you seeking a new one? Answer: It's a good question. The political system clearly didn't function in the battle against terrorism and in the search for development. The democracy established in Peru resulted in violence, corruption, inefficiency of the state. Also poverty, authoritarianism, weak growth, low incomes, hyperinflation and general indebtedness. One of the biggest problems was violence, which advanced - not because Sendero Luminoso had any merits - but because the state was so inefficient. This produced the rupture of April 5 last year. That was a break with the previous system and now we want to normalise the situation from what is evidently a period of transition. The changes proposed include some important reforms concerning the legislature and the judiciary. We are seeking a more efficient Congress and a judiciary less dependent on political party interests, less subject to manipulation and corruption. These are fundamental reforms, without which we would continue to suffer political instability. Q: Are the economic reforms you have introduced to date irreversible or could they be in danger at some point in the future? A: I think that the reforms are irreversible, and the new constitution will make sure of that in respect of the economy and the restructuring of the state. For example, the process of privatisation would be legitimised by the referendum. Q: If the changes are irreversible, why would you need another term as president? A: The irreversibility will derive from my remaining in office until 1995 and from the new constitution. The possibility of another period has been incorporated so that the people can decide as in other aspects of the referendum, including the death penalty. Q: Would you like another term as president? A: I've no ambition at all to follow this with another period in office. I don't have this obsession. What interests me is to put in place the steps for development and to consolidate all the reforms that have been made. This consolidation will be obtained in the period until 1995. Q: Even some of your supporters say there is a danger in your pragmatism and the fact that you don't seem to have a strong ideology. For instance, they fear that you might change policies should you suffer a fall in popularity. Is this fair? A: No, because popularity derives from the coherence of the government's policies. And pragmatism doesn't necessarily or in any way mean short-term solutions. During these three years we have applied solutions based in the medium and long term. It is a pragmatism that has its sights on the medium term, independent of popularity. People don't want short-term solutions. Q: You often draw a contrast between yourself and traditional politicians. But don't you also have a tendency towards 'personalismo', which is far from being new in Latin American politics. A: Yes, I think most people want a strong executive power which exercises its mandate to the full, that uses all its faculties to achieve important objectives. Here there is a president of the board or a general manager who controls, supervises, prosecutes and tries to ensure things go well. Q: You often talk about the transparency of your government, but in some respects your own government lacks transparency. For example, your brother is in an important office, as is Mr Montesinos, someone about whom people know little. (Mr Santiago Fujimori is a presidential adviser who, among other things, co-ordinates the use of international aid donations. Mr Vladimir Montesinos is a senior intelligence official and adviser to the president.) A: I would say that if we are only talking about two people, it's very few. A brother close to the president who works in various areas doesn't necessarily have to be in the limelight. And I would like to be precise about Mr Montesinos. You have said that people don't know him, but the people don't worry about Mr Montesinos. He preoccupies a certain section of the press which wants to assassinate his character. As a result, he's been satanised. Intelligence people work everywhere without being identified. I don't think intelligence people in London have to identify themselves. Q: But a survey in the magazine Debate of the most important people in Peru suggested that Mr Montesinos was the second most powerful person in the country. I don't think this is so in other countries. A: The survey in Debate was of 1,000 people of a certain level - intellectuals, journalists - but didn't include people in general. These people follow the comments made particularly by magazines. The best-known magazine in Lima takes a position openly - position for position - against the government. As a result, it has satanised (Mr Montesinos) . . . I don't agree with the conclusions of the survey. Q: Then who is the second most powerful person in the country? A: I think it has to be Jaime Yoshiyama, president of Congress. Of this I've no doubt. REASONS BEHIND DELAYS IN THE PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME Q: To change the theme, why has been a delay in the privatisation programme? A: There are various reasons. The first is that some of these public companies required some adjustments to be made by the state in order that we sell a more profitable company. Point two: privatisations require large resources because each one of the medium-sized and large state companies had very heavy liabilities in the way of debt and excess personnel. Third: the legislation didn't permit adequate privatisation. We therefore had to introduce modifications to the laws which related to the functioning of these companies within the framework of a market economy. Fourth: nobody was going to invest in Peru while there was terrorism - nobody, particularly foreign companies. The large companies which are the most profitable - telecommunications and electricity - would have sold but at very low prices. The shares of the telephone company a year and a half ago cost 40 centavos; today, the price is seven soles. I think like the manager of the state, and I want good business for the government, for Peru. Now we are selling companies in a secure country and without liabilities, in good shape, and therefore there is a lot of interest. A year and half ago no mining company, Peruvian or foreign, would have considered investing in Peru because it was impossible to work in the mines  -terrorists attacked them and took the dynamite and killed the engineers. Now there is a large quantity of investment in the mining sector, including Centromin, for which nobody would have given anything. Now Centromin's in good shape and many companies are interested in its privatisation. Therefore, in the large companies, it is a question of 'timing'. The economic programme would not have made sense had terrorism continued. Q: The privatisation programme will be completed when? A: In 1994 we will have sold all the companies - or nearly all. In some sectors we are still discussing - for example in electricity - if we are going to sell the generation capacity and the distribution system. This is not yet settled. Q: Will you allow foreign debt to be used as payment for privatisations? A: Now we are going to open the possibility of using it, but we'll do it on a case-by-case basis. This we have told the banks. Q: Peru's membership of the Andean Pact was suspended this year (from April 1992 until the end of 1993, when a review was planned). Is it going to rejoin? A: Yes, at some point we are going to rejoin, but not necessarily at the end of this year. There are still problems, but we have had bilateral negotiations which have allowed there to be a fairly open market among these countries. We had problems with products that were, in effect, subsidised. Q: For example? A: In the steel sector and in general, all that had to do with the intensive use of energy. Q: But isn't Venezuela - for example - going to have cheap energy in the long term? It seems that the problem won't be resolved quickly. A: It can also be resolved by the greater efficiency of Peru's national industry which would permit greater equilibrium. Q: On the debt question, is there really any room to pay more interest to the banks? You're currently negotiating with banks; in reality will it be possible to give them anything? A: It's true that there's not much room in our economic programme in a strict sense. We hope for some form of treatment that allows us to face this problem in that we are entering a period of reduced government income. Q: Why? A: The tax system is not 100 per cent efficient; tax collection is relatively low. Q: So you need to reform the tax system? A: What we need is more efficiency and better management of the system. Nonetheless, it has made enormous advances. Q: Aren't the bank negotiations going to be difficult, in the sense that you haven't much money to pay them? A: They are going to be difficult and we are going to ask for good understanding and much imagination in order to find some kind of solution for the refinancing. We think that there is confidence since the debt has increased in price from 5 per cent (of face value) to over 40 per cent. This is a sign of confidence abroad. Q: What will happen in the struggle against drugs traffickers, particularly since the policy of the US may be changing? A: I don't think there is enough force in the international community over this issue. The drugs trafficking problem is a world problem. In Peru we are trying to avoid the expansion of drugs production, controlling it the maximum possible to avoid an increase in production. This is not only a problem here in Peru, nor in the Andes. If the resources we receive fall, this is not only a reduction in resources for Peru but a reduction of resources for the fight against drugs. Q: Is it true that Foncodes (the state social emergency and development fund) has run out of funds until the end of the year? A: The tax collection problem also affects Foncodes. This will reduce certain social works, which isn't good either for pacification or for social development. We face this type of problem. What we have done so far (in social works) has mainly been achieved with national resources and there has been little international help. For some years, Peru has been a country that hasn't received much aid. After April 5, some countries that had restarted aid suspended it once more. Now, happily, these countries are renewing co-operation - a concrete case is Germany. Still, this co-operation remains limited and will remain so given the relations between the developing world and Latin America. Q: What effect did the adverse reaction of other countries to the events of April 5 have on your plans? A: Government policy was fundamentally concerned with the fight against terrorism. If I'd thought that the international reaction would be as strong as it actually was I would have taken exactly the same measures. No country in the world would accept that in their country 25,000 people would die in the fight against terrorism. Q: But did the force of the negative reaction surprise you? A: Yes, it was larger than I had foreseen. The reaction was significantly different inside and outside the country, but outside they had not suffered 25,000 dead. Q: Did this then advance your plans for reinstalling Congress, for example? A: Certain adjustments had to be made but towards an end that was totally unchanged: the authentic democratisation of the country and a country more secure. Q: Was there some luck in the capture of Abimael Guzman in September 1992? A: I think that at the start we worked to seek efficiency in the police, and put emphasis on the development of intelligence. The policy yielded results.</p>

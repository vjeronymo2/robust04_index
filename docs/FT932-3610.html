			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Barclays on short-list to buy DoT computer services agency BARCLAYS, the UK's biggest bank, is on the short-list of bidders to buy the organisation that provides computer services to the Department of Transport and its executive agencies. DVOIT, based in Swansea, was formerly the drivers, vehicle and operators information technology arm of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which remains its largest customer. It became a separate executive agency just over a year ago, with an annual turnover of about Pounds 26m and about 480 employees. There are four other bidders on the short-list: EDS-Scicon, the information technology subsidiary of General Motors of the US, Computing Sciences Corporation of the US, Hoskyns, the UK computing services group, and a consortium combining DVOIT managers and IBM of the US. Barclays said it wanted to exploit the expertise it has acquired over the past 30 years from running one of the country's biggest computer systems, which provides money transmission, cheque clearing and settlement services. Its bid is part of a bold strategy to reduce its dependence on earnings from traditional banking activities. In common with many banks, Barclays expects only modest growth in sales of banking services in the next few years. No other UK clearing bank has gone as far as Barclays in seeking to sell its computer expertise to other companies. A year ago, Barclays set up a trading business, Barclays Computer Operations, which runs the bank's computer operations and also competes to manage other companies' computers, a service known as facilities management. Since launching BCO, it has made an abortive bid to manage the Inland Revenue's computer operations, which are being contracted out to the private sector. The bank said that in the past year BCO had acquired 10 clients in addition to working for the bank. It said these included some substantial UK companies, though it declined to name them. It also refused to comment on its bid for DVOIT because it has signed a confidentiality agreement with the government. DVOIT has three mainframe computers which can be accessed from 4,000 terminals in 200 offices throughout the UK. The DoT said it hoped to complete the privatisation by the end of the year.</p>

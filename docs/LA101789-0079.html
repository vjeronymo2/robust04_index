			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBOUND ON WALL STREET;  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> DOLLAR CLOSES MIXED AFTER RISING ABROAD  </P> <P> The dollar finished mixed in hectic U.S. trading Monday after rising on  overseas markets early in the day in response to the rebound of the Dow Jones  stock market index.  </P> <P> Analysts said a rebound in the Dow Jones industrial index was responsible for  the dollar's improved showing in domestic trading compared to closing levels  overseas. The dollar finished below Friday's closing levels in New York in  relation to the West German mark, Japanese yen and Swiss franc.  </P> <P> The rise in blue chip stock prices in New York, after the big selloff Friday,  was viewed as taking some of the pressure for lower interest rates off the  Federal Reserve Board.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before the business day begins in Europe, the  dollar fell to 140.75 yen from 144.00 yen Friday. Later, in London, the dollar  was quoted at 141.10 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 141.80 yen, still  below its level of 142.05 yen Friday.  </P> <P> In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which rose to $1.5820  from $1.5625 late Friday. But the pound declined in relation to the dollar in  New York, to $1.5750 from $1.5820 on Friday.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Friday's rate, included:  1.8680 West German marks, down from 1.8720; 1.6340 Swiss francs, down from  1.6420.  </P></p>

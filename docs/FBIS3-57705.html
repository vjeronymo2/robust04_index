It consists of five points:    1. To approve the state privatization program.    2. The Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea and  Congresses of People's Deputies of all levels should elaborate  and approve by 1 March 1994 corresponding regional privatization  programs based on the state program.    3. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, jointly with the  Supreme Council commission for issues of economic reform and  management of the national economy, is to prepare and submit for  the Supreme Council's consideration by 1 March proposals on  introducing changes and additions to Ukraine's legislative acts  with the aim of creating conditions for the implementation of  the state privatization program for 1994 and ensure that the  interests of the socially unprotected strata of Ukraine's  population are protected.    4. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is to prepare by 15  February and submit for the Supreme Council's consideration the  draft law on privatization of land plots and proposals on  introducing additions to the criminal code and Ukraine's code on  administrative violations in the part that relates to imposing  sanctions for violating the privatization legislation.    5. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers is instructed to  ensure that a single computer information network for  implementing privatization and a single data base on  privatization facilities is created by 1 April 1994.    People's Deputy Popov, the head of the commission on basic  sectors of the national economy, made a speech. He informed  deputies about the situation that had arisen with regard to  "Blasko" Black Sea shipping company. An analysis of the  activities of the Black Sea shipping company for the first six  months of 1993 had indicated a 16-fold drop in the level of  annual clear hard currency receipts, compared with 1992. The  total indebtedness of the Black Sea shipping company to the  state budget is 106 billion karbovantsi. The hard currency debt  of the Black Sea shipping company over nine months of 1993 was  $5.6 million. Information about the construction of an  administrative building for $10 million, the purchase of a nine  seater luxury plane, and the construction of a business center  for more than $3 million was confirmed. The commission  qualified these actions as an "irresponsible and inexpedient use  of state property and funds that led to material losses for the  state in the form of state enterprises." "Some irregularities  in the way the accounts were kept give grounds to suspect the  existence of 'double accountancy,' which enabled those  responsible to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars to  Ukraine's hard currency fund," said Popov.    The conclusions that Popov made in his speech were: Such  actions "forced the commission to approve a demand to the  cabinet of ministers to dismiss Ukrainian Transport Minister  Klympush and the president of "Blasko," Mr. Kudyukin, from their  posts."</p>

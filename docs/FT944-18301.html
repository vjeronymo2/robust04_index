			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Momentum gathers for CGS as Genesis reaps rewards - The troubled computer services group has forged a multinational structure in order to survive Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French-based contender in the international computer services industry, has taken a beating during the past few years. Losses of FFr430m (Dollars 81.2m) last year raised questions about its ability to respond to the increased competition and recession in the sector, and the efficacy of its ambitious restructuring programme - grandly dubbed Genesis. The message from the company's smart Parisian headquarters, however, is that the worst is over. Two years after the birth of Genesis, CGS believes its aim of forging a coherent multinational structure from a disparate range of operations is entering its final stages and the benefits are emerging where they matter - on the bottom line. 'The momentum is gathering,' says Mr Geoff Unwin, chief operating officer. After announcing a slight narrowing in first-half losses late last month, to FFr115m from FFr197m, he predicts a return to profit in 1995. But, as Mr Unwin concedes,there is still much to be done. The end of recession in many markets, apart from southern Europe, has helped revive demand and taken a little of the sting from price competition which followed the expansion into the sector of industry hardware producers, such as International Business Machines. 'The hardware producers came in with crazy prices,' says Mr Unwin. 'We are now seeing signs of sanity on the pricing front.' With the introduction of new service offerings, such as information systems management, the improved economic environment enabled the company to reverse the trend of declining revenues in the second quarter. Sales have continued to rise in the second half, while order books at the end of June were up by about 12 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. More significant, claims the company, are the tangible benefits of the Genesis programme. The restructuring was launched in 1992 with the aim of welding a series of acquisitions, such as Hoskyns of the UK and Programator of Sweden. It has involved the division of the company into geographical and sectoral centres with the aim of re-using products and services across its markets. France, for example, has become the centre for telecommunications services, while the US is the base for energy and oil-related systems. The process has been expensive and difficult. Mr Unwin estimates that FFr600m has been invested in the programme, about one-quarter of the expenses relating to payments to the company's Gemini consulting arm, the architect of the restructuring plan. The balance has gone largely to training and communications charges. The result of the upheaval, says CGS, is that the company can now offer clients a broader range of services, more quickly. 'In the first half, we derived about 10 per cent of revenues from transferring expertise and know-how from one country to another,' says Mr Unwin. He cites as an example the award of a telecoms contract in Hungary, won by a Danish team using technology from the company's French operation. For Mr Unwin, the company had little choice in its decision to launch the ambitious programme. Medium-sized, country-based computer services groups will find it hard to survive, he argues, in an industry where delivery times and the ability to re-use programmes have become the main priority. 'Hoskyns (Mr Unwin's previous company) was doing well, but we would be beaten out of contracts from big companies which could import know-how.' Unlike Hoskyns, CGS has enjoyed the protection of a solid shareholder base during the upheaval. Mr Serge Kampf, founder of the group, and Daimler-Benz of Germany, which holds 34 per cent of CGS, have provided a valuable umbrella. 'We could not have undergone such change without them. We might have been gobbled up,' says Mr Unwin. The future of the company's shareholding structure is, however, a source of uncertainty. Daimler-Benz has an option to take control of CGS from February next year through the exercise of its convertible bond holdings. The German group has expressed an interest in a stronger management role in CGS, but most industry observers believe it is more concerned to find an additional partner to strengthen its French associate's operations. Such a partner could come from the telecoms sector. 'Large telecoms operators are looking increasingly at what happens at the end of their networks, for both business clients and consumers,' says Mr Unwin. 'They all have, or are seeking, a presence in this industry.' France Telecom, the state-owned operator, is one potential candidate. But talks have yet to yield results. Like other possible partners and Cap Gemini's existing smaller shareholders, it is likely to need more convincing of the rewards of life after Genesis.</p>

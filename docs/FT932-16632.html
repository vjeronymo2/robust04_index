			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / People: Imbert joins ranks of Securicor Securicor has recruited its first ex-policeman on to the board in a non-executive capacity. Sir Peter Imbert, who retired at the beginning of February after five years as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, comes in as part of a drive to widen the pool of expertise available from the company's non-executive contingent. Until now, many have been Securicor career men. Roger Wicks, Securicor's chief executive, says that Sir Peter will be useful in helping develop the overseas operations. Slightly more than half the group's employees work abroad, concentrated in continental Europe and the Pacific Rim. Within the past two years, the company has started up in St Petersburg and has branches in Hungary. 'Naturally, we already know the police forces in the UK very well, but Sir Peter's top-level relations with forces around the world will be very helpful to us,' says Wicks. Imbert, who turns 60 at the end of the month, joined the Met in 1953, serving for many years in the Special Branch. During his time as Commissioner he is credited with helping to repair the Met's tarnished image, and successfully concentrating on police service to the community. While Securicor numbers many ex-policemen in its ranks, and ex-deputy commissioner Sir Colin Woods has been a director and consultant to parts of the firm though not on the main board, no Met commissioners have been involved to date. Two non-executive directors, Eric Hollis and John Delaney, retired last year; both were ex-Securicor executives. Sir Neil Macfarlane, MP for Sutton and Cheam until the last election, has already joined the board, partly to help smooth the way when the firm has dealings with government. Wicks says he plans to add another non-executive in the course of this year, bringing the total to seven out of the 12-man board.</p>

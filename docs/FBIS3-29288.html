			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Huang Zhenzhong] </F>   [Excerpts] Thai Ambassador-designate to China Sawanit  Khongsiri told our correspondent yesterday that current  Thai-Chinese relations are smooth, steady, and sustainable.  Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between  Thailand and China in 1975, Thailand has recognized only the  Beijing government, has adhered to the joint statement signed  during the establishment of diplomatic relations, and has upheld  the one-China policy.    He said that Thai-Chinese relations date back to time  immemorial. The long-standing relations are based on similar  traditions and religions. Relations between the two countries  will develop naturally despite the absence of any motivating  force. The peoples of the two countries will benefit under the  principle of mutual reliance and mutual assistance.    Sawanit, who will leave for Beijing on 17 February to assume  his post, said that he will continue to push for the development  of bilateral relations during his tenure. In particular, he  will follow Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's policy of stressing  bilateral trade and investment. Although Sawanit was the first  secretary of the Thai Embassy in Beijing from 1978 to 1981 and  understands some Mandarin and has knowledge about China to a  certain extent, he considers his duty a challenge because of the  changes there. Businessmen and investors from all countries are  paying attention to the huge Chinese market of 1.2 billion  people. They want to do business and invest there, and Thailand  must make efforts in this regard.    He also wants to see the realization of the quadrangle  economic development plan among Thailand, China, Laos, and  Burma. Thailand has been working hard for this plan. It will  soon hold a meeting for businessmen from the four countries to  discuss details of the plan and to make friendly contacts.  [passage omitted]    Sawanit said that he wants to promote exchanges of visits  between the leaders of Thailand and China because the two  countries maintain good relations. Prime Minister Chuan has  visited China, and Thailand is ready to welcome Chinese leaders  to the country.    He said that Thailand and Taiwan maintain only labor  relations. There is no development of relations in other fields.  Thailand now has about 100,000 laborers in Taiwan whose  presence also benefits that country.    Sawanit also told reporters that Thailand will set up a  consulate general in Kunming, China's southwestern Province of  Yunnan, this fiscal year. He stressed that there are no current  problems in Thai-Chinese relations, which are proceeding in all  fields.</p>

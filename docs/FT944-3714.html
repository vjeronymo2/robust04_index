			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: What flabby Nato needs to get fighting fit Sir, If Nato is to survive ('In search of a unifying threat': December 7), it must introduce convincing post-cold war security concepts and perspectives. Only clearly thought-out objectives such as Article Five of the Washington Treaty should be included in its strategy. The alliance must stop paying lip service to commitments it has no intention of fulfilling. Rivalry between the west's security alliances (UN, CSCE, WEU and Nato) has resulted in the farce of interblocking rather than interlocking security institutions. Nato must also define its position on enlargement. If Nato fails to address these challenges, the 'No action together organisation' may become a more appropriate title. Stephen C. Calleya, Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL</p>

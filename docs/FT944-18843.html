			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BFI bid impossible to rubbish - Attwoods still insists the price is too low Even Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive of Attwoods, cannot fault the logic that has prompted a hostile Pounds 364m bid for his waste services company. Attwoods makes a sound fit with Browning-Ferris Industries, the US company valued at Dollars 6bn which is offering 109p a share in cash. 'You cannot argue with it from their point of view,' Mr Foreman says. 'But you can point out it is worth a lot more than they are paying.' BFI disagrees, of course. It says it has factored in the benefits of synergies in the US and a premium to what it believes is the true trading level. BFI bases its offer on two main arguments: price and industry dynamics. On the first issue, it is convinced that Attwoods has been inflated by bid speculation following management changes at Laidlaw of Canada, its largest shareholder with 29.8 per cent of the ordinary shares and 73 per cent of the preference stock. BFI also argues that the shares have been kept artificially high by a belief that Laidlaw would not take a further writedown on its stake. In 1991, Laidlaw halved the carrying value of its original Dollars 900m investment to Dollars 10.25 per American Depositary Receipt - equivalent to five ordinary shares. Yet Laidlaw has agreed to sell its ordinary shares to BFI at Dollars 8.50 per ADR, and its prefs at 85p, even if a second bidder enters with a higher offer. Attwoods' shares did rise sharply in the months after the arrival of Mr Jim Bullock as Laidlaw's chief executive. However, at about the same time, the group announced the sale of its loss-making recycling business, Mindis, and institutional investors began buying in earnest. But the gains were wiped out by March soon after the Attwoods board met to consider second-quarter results that would show disappointing performance in Germany. Attwoods argues that, contrary to BFI's claims, Laidlaw's intentions to sell depressed the shares when 1995 recovery potential should have enhanced them. The fact that Laidlaw agreed to take 109p, the closing price the day before the offer, simply reflects the pressures on one shareholder, Attwoods argues. This has no relevance to what others should be demanding of their investment. Outsiders are divided over whom to believe. Most UK analysts think the offer is opportunistic. Industry insiders and US analysts, however, tend to agree with BFI's assessment of an inflated share price. 'Absolutely. There is no doubt that they were buoyed by bid speculation,' said one waste executive. BFI's second, and more convincing, argument is based on industry dynamics, largely in the US. It claims Attwoods could be severely handicapped in an industry demanding higher levels of investment and more sophisticated solutions to waste disposal. 'The market in the US is responding to public concerns about the environment,' BFI says. 'They want their waste managed in different ways.' To return real earnings growth in the US, where Attwoods earns more than three-quarters of its profits, BFI argues companies must do everything from collecting to disposing of waste, or recycling it for eventual resale. Yet Attwoods has limited itself largely to collection in the us, which is lower margin. Regulation is also forcing companies to adopt an increasingly integrated approach. In California, for example, legislation demands that 50 per cent of waste which is collected must be recycled. Yet Attwoods last year sold its only recycling business at a huge Pounds 91m loss, just before the prices of recycled materials began to firm. BFI says Attwoods' strategy has left it depending on rivals to dispose of waste. That was fine when landfill prices were falling, but now they too have begun to stabilise, says BFI. Furthermore, the increasingly competitive nature of municipal contracts, on which Attwoods relies heavily in both its US markets, mean it will face price pressure in its everyday business. Many of BFI's arguments about trends in the US waste industry are supported by analysts and rivals. Mr Hugh Holman of Alex Brown, a leading US waste analyst, says 'integrating collection and disposal operations provides the best opportunity for stable margins'. WMX Technologies, the world's biggest waste group, has also been pursuing a policy of integrated services. Yet BFI has, remarkably, not broadcast a more immediate bonus from the acquisition of Attwoods. The target's business would give a nice boost to BFI's own solid waste collection operation, expected to return flat profits this year. While acknowledging that a takeover makes sense strategically, Attwoods dismisses as rubbish BFI's claims that it would create an integrated company in its largest market, Florida. BFI does not own landfills there, while Attwoods has three. Yet BFI does have recycling operations there. Attwoods also dismisses BFI's attacks on its recent performance as unjustified. All waste companies have suffered earnings declines and write-offs, Mr Foreman claims. BFI itself, he says, has had exceptional charges of Dollars 793m in the last five years and its credit rating is under review. Finally, Attwoods will also give BFI a significant boost in the recovering UK market, where it has both collection and landfill interests. All this means that any offer, hostile or otherwise, deserves a premium, Attwoods says. Which brings investors neatly back to the issue of price. As Mr Foreman has admitted, Attwoods will be hard-pressed to discredit BFI's strategic arguments.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Buyers line up for Clarke Foods THE FUTURE of FAB and Zoom ice-creams looked slightly more secure yesterday when the administrative receiver appointed to Clarke Foods, owner of these and other brands, said nearly 50 potential buyers had come forward since the receivers were called in on Tuesday. Mr Ipe Jacob, joint administrative receiver from chartered accountants Robson Rhodes, said several leading companies in the ice-cream trade as well as outsiders had expressed 'serious interest'. Clarke, founded by Mr Henry D Clarke Jr, an American, became the UK's second largest ice-cream maker last year when it bought Lyons Maid from Allied-Lyons. But Clarke ran into trouble missing the early summer heat wave because of problems with new equipment. Mr Jacob said he hoped the company could be restructured or sold as a going concern in 'six to 12 weeks'. Last night some 80 workers were occupying the Lyons Maid factory in Kirkby, near Liverpool, after being told by receivers that 67 of them were losing their jobs.</p>

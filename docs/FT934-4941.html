			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet collapse distorts world dairy market The world dairy market is being strongly affected by economic and social changes in central and eastern Europe, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in its 1993 review of dairy trends and prospects. Commercial shipments of dairy products to Russia, formerly the world's leading butter importer, have fallen sharply. At the same time, other countries in the region have boosted cheap butter exports, reflecting lower domestic consumption in response to higher prices and the need for hard currency earnings. The result has been a continuing butter market imbalance that has kept stocks high and prices weak, despite falling production, the Gatt report says. World butter output fell by 2.5 per cent in 1992 and is expected to fall by a further 2 per cent in 1993. Butter prices have also been depressed by concessional sales and donations to Russia and by US export subsidies. US dairy exports rose sharply last year, lifted by the dairy export incentive programme, which paid out Dollars 140m on exports of milk powders, butter and butter oil, and cheese. Algeria and Mexico were the main beneficiaries of the programme, which applied to exports to 76 nations. World milk production fell by 2 per cent between 1991 and 1992, mainly reflecting lower output in western and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Gatt is predicting another 1 to 2 per cent drop in 1993. However, New Zealand had record milk production in 1992 and may surpass this level in 1993. Australia's 1993 output is expected to be the highest in two decades. The Gatt report points out that, although milk consumption in developed countries is flat or declining, it is rising steadily in Asia and Latin America and there is strong demand worldwide for milk products, especially cheese. Exports of skimmed and whole milk powder rose in 1992, and stocks of skimmed milk powder have fallen to low levels, underpinning relatively high prices. Trade in cheese, meanwhile, remains brisk. High prices and global consumption growth of 2 per cent a year have encouraged rising production, of 2 per cent in 1992 and a likely 1 per cent this year. The World Market for Dairy Products 1993.

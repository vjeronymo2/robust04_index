			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: First-quarter recovery at Skandia SKANDIA, one of Sweden's two leading insurers, showed a strong recovery in the first quarter, as it posted a SKr700m (Dollars 95m) operating profit compared with a SKr300m loss in the same period of 1992. The result, which includes unrealised changes in asset values, was struck after premium income rose to SKr11.7bn from SKr9.6bn, largely because of increased life insurance business. The figures were provided by Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia chief executive, at the group's annual general meeting. The group's net asset value is estimated to have risen to SKr12.6bn from SKr11.4bn at the year-end, thanks to rising share and bond prices and exchange rate movements. It saw a 20 per cent fall in net asset value last year which prompted the company to suspend its dividend for the first time in its history. Skandia said its position is also being strengthened by its decision to reduce non-life reinsurance operations, which should help boost its solvency margin to 65 per cent by the year-end, compared with 51 per cent at the end of 1992.</p>

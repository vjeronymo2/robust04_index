			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Management: Rover's cultural revolution - Richard Donkin discovers what white-collar workers do at the car manufacturer when their old jobs disappear Assembly-line workers jeered Terry Morgan, the chief executive of Land-rover, when he addressed a factory meeting wearing grey overalls. They thought it was some kind of gimmick. That was three years ago, he is still wearing them, and people don't jeer anymore. Managers admit that outsiders can still find it disconcerting to be greeted by a British executive in a grey 'workers' suit, rather like coming across someone from the Chinese communist party central office, mid-cultural revolution, on a number seven bus. The comparison grows more acute at Rover which, perhaps more than any other British manufacturer, has been undergoing its own cultural revolution. New Deal, the company's agreement with the unions in 1992, secured a management pledge of job security for all. The way that it is being engineered has led to some tough career decisions for managers and administrative staff watching their old jobs disappear through technological change. Current Rover vacancies are almost all in assembly-line jobs but when the company asked for volunteers last November from white-collar staff to move across, few stepped forward. So far only 200 out of a hoped-for 500 or so have crossed over to hourly-paid production jobs and not all have yet signed new, blue-collar contracts. Others are thinking about it. Staff report a lowering of morale among many of those canvassed to consider changing jobs and the company admits it will have to recruit from outside. The need to encourage cross-overs became apparent when Rover found itself top-heavy with clerical and administrative employees. Its shift from volume car producer to niche manufacturer has led to greater emphasis on front-line production workers. At Landrover, for example, after the vehicle frame has come out of the body shop into the main assembly plant, there are no robots, and all the work is done by hand. Computer-based ordering, which allows any specification on any model to be tapped down the telephone line, is reducing the clerical roll. This has led management to seek greater flexibility in the workforce. Part of this process includes encouragement of and opportunities for continuous skills development through course work at Rover's training and development centre. Much of the groundwork on harmonisation of conditions of service has already been established, but removing the old white-collar, blue-collar distinction in employees' minds is more difficult. One way has been to encourage white-collar staff to take part in assembly-line work on Saturdays. Another practice developed to create all-round awareness of the assembly role has been for new graduates to complete what has been dubbed 'national service' for three months on the production line. The main difficulty for those who have opted to cross over has been making the adjustment (see above). Complex emotions are involved when people who are used to arriving with a briefcase are asked to don overalls and wield a spanner. Although the management has tried to remove the trappings of status they have not been completely banished from people's minds; and for some the physical demands of the new job are too much. Equality in the workplace is beginning to happen, led by management. Equality, used in this context, does not mean equal pay for all or even equal perks. But it does mean a removal of the 'us and them' barriers, the boss-worker relationship and the old concept of status. Executives not wearing overalls are more likely to attract sarcastic comments today. When Bernd Pischetsrieder, the BMW chairman, visited the Rover plants immediately after BMW's takeover announcement in February, 'we had some overalls run up for him although the name tab was a bit of a problem. It almost ran down his sleeve,' says David Bower, Rover's director of personnel. Rover name tabs do not indicate position. Like many of Britain's newly restructured companies, Rover has a flattened-out management structure. 'I'm only one step away from the managing director's job,' says Bernard Sullivan, Rover's training and development manager. Sullivan enjoys a reputation as something of a management specialist on the conference circuit and his views command respect - yet you could not tell him from a council binman by his dress and that is how Rover wants it. The philosophy on working practices goes much deeper than dress, however. Many of the ideas are drawn from Japan, although management was sceptical that Japanese culture could be transported to Rover before they saw how it had been adapted in a US Honda factory in Marysville, Ohio in 1986. 'Suddenly we were thinking if it can happen in the US, it can happen here,' says Bower. The need for change had already been established that year when the company carried out the first of a series of attitude surveys among employees. 'The things people told us were important to them have not changed over the years. They wanted a degree of challenge in their work and to participate in problem solving. They were concerned about the quality of training to develop the skills to do their job and they wanted opportunities to advance themselves in the business. They were concerned about the quality of communication and the quality of leadership,' says Bower. Sullivan explains the new approach to flexibility thus: 'There may well be a job for life but it won't be the same job. You may start out as a fitter, become managing director and end up as a fitter.' Rover says Pischetsrieder has no plans to change working practices at the Rover plants, nor do Rover managers plan to copy BMW systems. The main impression from visiting Rover plants today is that there is a much greater degree of honesty between management and the workforce. It is a far cry from the British Leyland days. 'There is no end to this story,' says Bower. 'Continuous change is part and parcel of being competitive and staying alive. The challenge is to maintain the bulk of the improvement so people become part of it but not overwhelmed by it.'</p>

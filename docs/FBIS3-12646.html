			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 2 Mar (MENA)--A highly-placed Palestinian  source has stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has  sent a number of proposals to the Israeli Government in an  attempt to end the crisis resulting from the massacre at the  Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied West Bank and return  the Palestinian and Israeli delegations to the negotiating  table. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to  the Washington peace talks, will hand these proposals to the  Israelis today. This source disclosed that the proposals, on  which agreement was reached after the Palestinian leaders met on  Sunday and Monday, include:    First, disarming the Israeli settlers and allowing an  international presence [tawajud dawli] in the self-rule areas.    In a message to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin, which 'Urayqat  will deliver, 'Arafat pointed out that these proposals are in  line with the Declaration of Principles agreement. He said that  the Cairo agreement provides that the Israeli army will protect  the settlements while the Palestinian police will be responsible  for security in the self-rule areas. The source said that  'Arafat's proposals did not specify the type of international  presence, UN forces or observers, but was content with the  phrase "international presence."    The Palestinian source said that the second proposal  requests  restructuring certain settlements that are close to Palestinian  population centers or those where extremist Jews live, such as  the Netzarim settlement near Gaza, which 'Arafat proposed  merging with the Gush Qatif settlement in south Gaza and Qiryat  Arba' in Hebron. 'Arafat also proposed that Palestinians  purchase these settlements. The Palestinian source noted that  the third proposal requests Israel stop expropriating Arab land  and building new settlements. He pointed out that 'Arafat has  become convinced that the current crisis between Israel and the  PLO can only be solved through direct dialogue between them, not  by bringing other parties into the crisis. He said that  intensive diplomatic efforts are under way in Cairo, Washington,  and other capitals to convince both parties to reach a  compromise and return to the negotiating table.</p>

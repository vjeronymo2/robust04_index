			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAYAKOA ASSIGNED HIGH WEIGHT OF 127 IN CHULA VISTA HANDICAP  </P> <P> Bayakoa, who was scratched once this year because her connections did not like  the weight assignment, has been assigned high weight of 127 for the $158,000  Chula Vista Handicap at Del Mar on Saturday.  </P> <P> That means the 6-year-old, which was the 1989 Eclipse Award-winning mare, will  concede from 13 to 17 pounds to her six rivals in the Grade II race for fillies  and mares ages 3 and up.  </P> <P> The Argentine-bred horse was scratched from the $200,000 Vanity Handicap at  Hollywood Park on July 15 because owner Frank Whitham and trainer Ron McAnally  did not like the fact that she was assigned four pounds more than a rival who  had beaten her in an earlier race.  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay Jr., who has ridden Bayakoa in most of her races, will be aboard  this time.  </P> <P> Bayakoa has won four of seven races this year, with a pair of seconds. Two of  her losses have come when she's taken on colts, most recently in the San Diego  Handicap here on Aug. 4 when she finished second to Quiet American.  </P> <P> Bayakoa has won more than $2 million, which is far more than her six rivals  combined.  </P> <P> Bayakoa ran in the Chula Vista last year, but could not handle a furious speed  duel and finished well behind Goodbye Halo.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MAZOLA DROPS CHOLESTEROL CLAIMS  </P> <P> The manufacturer of Mazola Corn Oil is dropping claims implying that the  product reduces cholesterol.  </P> <P> CPC International Inc., based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said it has signed  agreements with the Federal Trade Commission and the attorneys general of 10  states, including California.  </P> <P> In a statement, CPC said its future advertisements will avoid the "use of  statements which might be misinterpreted to mean that the use of corn oil  would, by itself, lower serum cholesterol."  </P> <P> Massachusetts Atty. Gen. James Shannon said he and his colleagues challenged  ads that made claims such as, "Mazola does what? They said it could turn back  my cholesterol. I didn't believe it until my level dropped 17%."  </P> <P> CPC did not admit any violations of law, and said it was trying to avoid  expensive legal proceedings.  </P> <P> The agreement calls for the company to pay $100,000 to cover the costs of the  investigation, Shannon's office said.  </P></p>

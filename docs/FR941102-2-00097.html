			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the Exchanges' proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. Specifically, the Commission believes the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Act <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  in that they are designed to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market, and to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission approved these proposals in October 1988, the DJIA has not experienced a one day, 250-point decline that would trigger a market halt. Nevertheless, the Commission continues to believe that circuit breaker procedures are desirable to deal with potential strains that may develop during periods of extreme market volatility, and, accordingly, the Commission believes that the pilot programs should be extended. The Commission also believes that circuit breakers represent a reasonable means to retard a rapid, one day market decline that can have a destabilizing effect on the nation's financial markets and participants in these markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change filed by the Exchanges, including NYSE Amendment No. 1 and Phlx Amendment No. 1, are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6 and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> because there are no changes being made to the current provisions, which originally were subject to the full notice and comment procedures, and accelerated approval would enable the pilots to continue on an uninterrupted basis. Due to the importance of these circuit breakers for market confidence, soundness, and integrity, it is necessary and appropriate that these procedures continue on an uninterrupted basis. Therefore, the Commission believes that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule changes is appropriate and consistent with sections 6 and 19(b)(2) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.

Copies of such filings also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal offices of the above-mentioned exchanges. All submissions should refer to File Nos.

Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  that the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx proposed rule changes (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;40, SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;33 and SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;44), including NYSE Amendment No. 1 and Phlx Amendment No. 1, are approved until October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

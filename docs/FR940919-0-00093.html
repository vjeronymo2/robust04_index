			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second issue the Agency wishes to clarify and correct today concerns the language in &sect;268.45(b)(2) of the August 18, 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This section states that the contaminants subject to the alternative treatment standards for hazardous debris, which were promulgated in the August 18, 1992 rule, are those constituents for which BDAT standards are established in &sect;&sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.41 and 268.43. The Agency has received several letters asking why section 268.42 was not included in that language. Section 268.42 lists those wastes for which EPA established a treatment method as the standard. The reason section 268.42 was not included in the language in &sect;268.45(b)(2) is that only the wastes themselves, and not waste constituents, are listed in &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.42. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency fully intends, however, that debris contaminated with those wastes be subject to the alternate debris standards. Therefore, &sect;268.45(b)(2) is being clarified today to read ``The contaminants subject to treatment for debris that is contaminated with a prohibited listed hazardous waste are those constituents or wastes for which BDAT standards are established for the wastes under &sect;&sect;268.41, 268.42, and 268.43.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third issue the Agency is clarifying concerns exactly when surface impoundments which are newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) are expected to be in compliance with the requirements of &sect;265.221 (a), (c), and (d). As is stated in &sect;268.5(h)(2)(v) (as promulgated at 57 FR 37270, August 18, 1992), such surface impoundments must be in compliance within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics for the identification of hazardous waste. This is the maximum time allowed by RCRA section 3005(j)(6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA mistakenly stated in two separate places in the preamble to the August 18, 1992 rule that the compliance date was 48 months from the effective date of a waste identification or listing (57 FR 37220). The Agency wants to make it clear that the compliance date which was promulgated in the regulations, and which is mandated by RCRA 3005(j)(6), is correct (57 FR 37270). These surface impoundments are thus required to be in compliance 48 months from the promulgation date of a new identification or listing. &sect;268.5(h)(2)(v). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The promulgation date is the date the Administrator signs the rule which lists the new waste(s). The effective date is the date the new waste must come into compliance with hazardous waste management requirements, and may be six months from the promulgation date. The Agency believes that 48 months to retrofit a surface impoundment is a reasonable amount of time, and believes that effort should begin as soon as the listing of a waste is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; there is no reason to wait to begin retrofitting until a new listing or identification actually becomes effective. In any case, section 3005(j)(6) allows no other option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in &sect;268.38(a) of this rule, EPA is prohibiting debris that is contaminated with the wastes that were prohibited in the Phase I rule. EPA inadvertently omitted to include such contaminated debris in the August 18, 1992 rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Amendment of Boiler and Industrial Furnace Rules for Certain Mercury-Containing Wastes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency proposed a technical clarification to the Boiler and Industrial Furnace (BIF) rules on July 21, 1994 (59 FR 31964), that would exempt certain mercury-bearing hazardous wastes generated by the Chlorine Industry from the provisions of 266.100(c). Under this provision, owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces that process hazardous wastes solely for metal recovery are conditionally exempt from regulation. To be exempt, the owner or operator must comply with certain notification, sampling and analysis, and recordkeeping provisions (see 266.100(c)(1)(i)). In addition, as indicated above, the waste must be processed solely for metal recovery; to be processed solely for metal recovery, the waste can not have a heating value greater than 5000 BTU/lb or have a total concentration of organic compounds listed in Appendix VIII of Part 261 greater than 500 ppm by weight. Wastes that have a heating value greater than 5000 BTU/lb or have a total concentration of hazardous organic compounds exceeding 500 ppm are considered by EPA to be burned for energy recovery and destruction, respectively and, thus, are subject to the BIF rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency generally believes that most wastes that meet these criteria are appropriately subject to the BIF regulations. However, in certain instances, wastes that are burned for legitimate metal recovery can also exceed the 5000 BTU/lb and 500 ppm organic compound limits, in which case standards other than those in the BIF rules are likely more appropriate. (See 59 FR at 29776 (June 9, 1994) proposing CAA MACT standards for secondary lead smelters and indicating why RCRA air emission standards are not needed.) In fact, the Agency has specified a set of lead and nickel-bearing hazardous wastes that exceed the energy recovery or destruction limits, but are still conditionally exempt from the BIF rules if these wastes are legitimately burned for metal recovery (see 266.100(c)(3) and Appendices XI and XII to Part 266). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed technical clarification, the Agency defined some additional hazardous wastes_specifically, those generated by the Chlorine Industry and which are suitable for mercury recovery_that could be recovered in mercury retorting units without those units being subject to the BIF rules (provided the owners or operators of these units meet certain conditions). The Agency proposed this change based on the fact that these wastes contain high levels of mercury (from hundreds of parts per million to as much as 45%) and, thus are appropriate for recovery; in addition, the retort units in which these wastes are processed must be subject to emissions controls under the Clean Air Act. See &sect;268.42 (treatment standards for high mercury subcategory wastes that require retorting units to be subject to the CAA or comparable standards for control of mercury). It should also be noted that the Chlorine Institute, as part of their comments on the Phase II LDR proposal, requested that the Agency exempt these wastes from the BIFs rules. The remainder of this section of the preamble discusses the comments received and our response to those comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FFEL program regulations (34 CFR part 682) govern the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Students (Federal SLS) Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Family Education Loan programs (formerly the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) programs). With respect to 34 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 682, the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Federal Consolidation Loan programs are hereinafter referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to as the Stafford, SLS, PLUS and Consolidation Loan programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239), enacted December 19, 1989, amended the HEA to authorize the Secretary to promulgate regulations governing the limitation, suspension, or termination of the eligibility of an individual or organization to contract with an educational institution to administer any aspect of the institution's participation in any Title IV, HEA program. That act further amended the HEA to authorize the Secretary to promulgate regulations to take emergency action against or to fine such an individual or organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted July 23, 1992, amended the HEA to expand the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to regulate the activities of those individuals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations, now called  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> third-party servicers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 102&hyph;325 authorizes the Secretary to promulgate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that are applicable to third-party servicers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish minimum standards with respect to sound management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accountability of the FFEL programs and include standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility and the assessment of liabilities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL program violations. These proposed regulations would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement those statutory provisions. In addition, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations would strengthen and clarify the procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for fining an institution or limiting, suspending, or terminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its participation in any Title IV, HEA program, and make other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minor changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that establishing accountability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines for an institution's continued participation and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation of an institution's third-party servicer in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs is an important element in the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort for better and more accountable schools, as called for in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Education Goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Negotiated Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 492 of the HEA contains procedural requirements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary is to follow in developing proposed regulations for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts B, G, and H of Title IV of the HEA, as amended by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Higher Education Amendments of 1992. Section 492(a) requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to convene regional meetings to gain input on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of proposed regulations. Section 492(b) requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, subsequent to these meetings, to draft and submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations implementing parts B, G, and H to a negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the requirements of section 492, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary convened four regional meetings to discuss issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to implementation of parts B, G, and H. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invited representatives of groups involved in student financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance programs, such as students, legal assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations that represent students, institutions of higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education, guaranty agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a precursor to the regional meetings, the Secretary held a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting in Washington, DC, in August 1992, to invite comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from interested parties as to the key issues that should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed at the regional meetings. At the four regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings, the Secretary provided participants with a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues, based upon those identified in the meeting in August 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that needed to be addressed in these proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional meetings were held in New York, New York; San Francisco,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1992. Participants in the meetings were invited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nominate individuals to serve as participants in negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking sessions. The Secretary selected participants for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations process from individuals nominated by groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in the regional meetings and attempted, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent possible, to have participants reflect the diversity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those participating in the student aid community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Negotiated rulemaking sessions were held in April, June, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 1993 in and around the environs of Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taking into account views expressed at the regional meetings, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Education prepared draft regulations on the main  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues discussed. The draft served as the basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiated rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

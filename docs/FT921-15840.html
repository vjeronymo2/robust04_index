			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Education: the casualties and the consensus Sir, Your leader on Kenneth Clarke's plans to change the teacher training system in the UK ('Education and the election', January 6) rightly refers to them as 'panicky electioneering'. In the subject I represent, mathematics, there is little support for yet more change in the schools and on the cheap. Already Mr Clarke's policies have guaranteed that we will be short of mathematics teachers for the foreseeable future. He has ensured that those mathematics teachers who are still teaching will be so overworked, overburdened with bureaucracy, and stressed, that they will have little time, energy or enthusiasm left to take on other responsibilities. His new plans are unlikely to stem the flow of experienced teachers out of school and will not attract more newcomers into mathematics teaching. What these plans will do is change Britain from a country which has many of the best-trained maths teachers in Europe to one having many of the worst-trained. Teacher trainers come from all countries to study and learn from our methods and our professional approaches are admired worldwide. Some politicians do recognise the complex nature of learning to teach successfully a subject like mathematics to all children. Mr Clarke clearly doesn't, and his ideological actions should be questioned by all who understand the nature of professional responsibility.

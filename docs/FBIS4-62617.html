			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Pogorelyy of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: </F> "`Technologies From Russia' Astound United States"]    [Text] The three-day conference "Technologies From  Russia-94" in the United States has been a real triumph for  Russian applied science and leading sectors of industry. But  the exhibition of the latest achievements of Russian designers  and manufacturers held simultaneously at the Washington  conference center evoked even greater interest among American  entrepreneurs. Over 200 Russian firms presented the latest  developments in the sphere of machine building, the aerospace  and medical industries, information technology, and  communications for the verdict of U.S. specialists.    Judging by the U.S. press reaction, what made the greatest  impression on visitors to the exhibition was the "Thermoplane"  [Termoplan] -- the product of a consortium of enterprises in the  Russian oil and gas complex and mining and timber industries.  It is an airship of a fundamentally new design in the form of a  "flying saucer" capable of carrying 3.5 tonnes of freight or  15-20 passengers. The industrial version of the "Thermoplane"  will be capable of delivering up to 600 tonnes of freight  distances of up to 5,000 km -- superb transportation for the  north and taiga and desert regions.    Transatlantic businessmen also showed interest in units for  the production of synthetic diamonds and metal-cutting tools  produced on the basis of them, whose productivity is 7-10 times  higher than metal tools. The six-wheeled minitractor employing  technology from our "lunokhods" [moon buggies] also aroused  public curiosity. In general, many of the projects on show at  the exhibition were characterized by extensive use of conversion  developments.    Over two dozen contracts for joint production or further  development of promising technologies and technical prototypes  have already been signed as a result of the conference and  exhibition.</p>

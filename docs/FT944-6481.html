			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Coles Myer in property sell-off Coles Myer, the large but troubled Australian retailer, said yesterday it had arranged to sell more than ADollars 500m (USDollars 370.3m) of retail property. The move is part of a plan to rationalise its ADollars 1.5bn property portfolio, offset the current ADollars 4.1bn capital investment programme and prevent it becoming 'overweight' in property. Coles is selling its 50 per cent interest in the WestMyer Trust, which owns shopping centres in Adelaide and Southland, to the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the life office. The deal values the two properties and development costs to date at ADollars 580.8m - or Coles' share at ADollars 290.4m. In addition, a joint venture is being established with the Industry Superannuation Property Trust, which will take in ADollars 113.8m of properties from Coles, mainly shopping centre interests. ISPT will have a 75 per cent interest in the venture, and Coles, 25 per cent. The disposal of a variety of smaller property interests makes up the balance of the ADollars 500m. Coles' gearing has risen significantly recently, as result of buying back the 21.45 per cent of its shares held by Kmart, the US retailer.</p>

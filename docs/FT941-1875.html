			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Loan losses hit Gota Bank Gota Bank, merged by the government at the turn of the year with fellow state-owned Nordbanken, yesterday reported an operating loss in 1993 of SKr13.57bn (Dollars 1.71bn) reflecting the damage wreaked by loan losses on Sweden's banks. This was more than five times its 1992 loss of SKr2.4bn. The loss came despite the transfer during the year of SKr38.3bn out of Gota's total loan portfolio of SKr78.4bn into a separately-run, so-called bad bank called Retriva. The transferred loans included SKr23.4bn out of Gota's SKr27.2bn problem loan book. Despite this, credit losses - mostly from the property sector - stood at SKr11.98bn in 1993, including the write-down of assets transferred to Retriva. The figure was only slightly below the 1992 loan loss figure of SKr12.5bn. Net interest income also slumped by 53 per cent to SKr1.7bn, partly because credit losses before the Retriva clean-up had to be loan-financed, pushing up interest costs. However, the Retriva operation meant problem loans after provisions for losses at the year-end stood at SKr1.1bn, compared with SKr12.4bn in 1992, out of a total outstanding loan portfolio of SKr40bn. Apart from setting up Retriva, the state kept Gota afloat by pumping in SKr20bn in capital. It then decided to hand over Gota to Nordbanken, which itself was only kept afloat by huge injections of state assistance and a similar 'bad bank' operation to deal with non-performing loans. Nordbanken, which will report its results for 1993 later this week, has since bounced bank into profit. But it has already had to spend SKr3bn on a further capital infusion to keep Gota's capital adequacy ratio above the internationally-required level of 8 per cent.</p>

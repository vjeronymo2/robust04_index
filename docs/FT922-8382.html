			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs urge swift move on Maxwell MINISTERS faced calls to provide a 'mini-lifeboat' for Maxwell pensioners from a cross-party group of MPs which met yesterday. As a first step, Mr Richard Page, Tory MP for Hertfordshire South-West, who convened the meeting, and Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security committee in the previous parliament, are to seek urgent talks with Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. If necessary they are ready to appeal to Mr John Major, the prime minister. More than 60 MPs attended the meeting at which many Labour and Tory MPs expressed anger at the plight of the pensioners. The MPs have also called for an immediate government statement or time for a debate so that ministers' positions can be clearly set out. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a Foreign Office minister and the MP for Watford, proposed that the group should make contact with lawyers to see what legal actions might be taken. The MPs were particularly concerned about pensioners who worked for companies other than Mirror Group Newspapers. There are fears that some of these pensioners could lose all their pension money from the end of this month. The case of the Headington pension fund was especially highlighted. The renewed pressure on ministers came as Mr Major confirmed that the government had alerted social security offices to be aware of the need to put emergency support from the benefit system in place if necessary. Among the offices reminded within the past month of the support available was the Leeds office, which is expecting to deal with many Headington pensioners. Mr Page said that a majority of the meeting endorsed the call for a government examination of ways of keeping the pension funds alive 'until this tangled web is unwoven and we know where we are'.</p>

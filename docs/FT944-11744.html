			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Multimedia manoeuvre Revitalisation is the new motto at Philips. After years of painful restructuring in which jobs have been cut and businesses sold, the Dutch electronics group plans to expand again. Investment is being stepped up and Philips is eyeing multimedia acquisitions. The sharp turnaround in the group's financial performance, underlined by yesterday's tripling of third quarter earnings before extraordinary items, certainly justifies a shift in strategy. But operating margins are still a modest 5.7 per cent, so investors will be wary if the expansion is not extremely cautious. Only in the semiconductor and components division, where operating margins are 13 per cent, is the case for greater investment compelling. Margins in the core consumer electronics business are a mere 2 per cent. Meanwhile, the priority in the loss-making professional products division must be further restructuring. The biggest concern surrounds Philips' multimedia ambitions. The group is excited by the high margins in software compared with consumer electronics hardware. But that does not mean that Philips can add value to such businesses. Precisely because of their high margins, software groups are pricey. Nor is it enough to argue that hardware and software businesses should, in some vague way, be combined. Similar logic lay behind Sony's and Matsushita's disappointing Hollywood acquisitions. Until Philips articulates its strategy more clearly, investors will worry that it will make the same error.</p>

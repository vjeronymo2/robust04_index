			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: House prices September's 3.1 per cent fall in house prices, as measured by the Halifax index, cut the wealth of UK homeowners by some Pounds 30bn. Prices are now 7.5 per cent below the level of a year ago, which is hardly the stuff of economic recovery. The re-imposition of stamp duty in August hardly provides a convenient excuse for September's figure. House prices also fell in the previous two months. While Black Wednesday's threat of 15 per cent base rates can hardly have helped sentiment, there are deeper forces at work. Houses are no longer expensive when compared to earnings. Yet there is still an over-supply. About 70,000 repossessed properties are up for sale, and housebuilders have 40,000 unsold homes. On the demand side there is said to be a queue of first-time buyers, but they have absolutely no incentive to act before the market stabilises. Unemployment is still rising and earnings are only increasing slowly. Given its fiscal constraints, the government can be of little practical help. Interest rate cuts only make mortgages more affordable. They do not address the supply-demand imbalance directly. That puts housebuilders in a real bind. Many need to sell stock and free up cash, but in such a weak market that will mean further price cuts. Any who hoped that there would be no further decline in the value of their land banks may have to think again.</p>

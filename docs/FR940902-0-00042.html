			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.310(a) sets forth the parameters for the provision of supportive services. The preamble to the interim final rule noted that ``limited supportive services'' were permitted for applicants. A few commenters requested that this be stated in the regulations. This provision can now be found at &sect;627.310(b). A comment was also received requesting that the ``limited'' in limited supportive services be defined. The Department declines to define ``limited''; rather, the final rule is revised to indicate that such payments may be made to provide the applicant with an opportunity to complete the application process. The Department expects the restriction on the training-related supportive services cost category to act as a natural control on SDA's and SSG's while still permitting flexibility for local level decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.310(g)(1) provides that supportive services may include financial assistance under title II. In order to ensure a comprehensive system of supportive services and payments, there have been changes to the definition and allowable usage of financial assistance. Financial assistance is intended for the purpose of general support typical of stipends and allowances. A number of commenters indicated that requiring additional documentation in order to receive any type of financial support was redundant, particularly with JTPA's hard-to-serve population. The Department agrees that participants pass through significant income eligibility tests upon entering the program and that additional eligibility checks are unnecessary, inefficient, and discourage the provision of necessary services. Therefore, the final regulations state, at &sect;627.310(g)(2), that financial assistance may be deemed to be necessary for eligible participants and, as a supportive service, may be a fixed payment or based upon a schedule of payments. The SDA shall include financial assistance in its policy on supportive services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.305(g) of the interim final rule dealing with needs-related payments is redesignated &sect;627.310(h) to reflect the similarity of needs-related payments under title III with financial assistance under title II. However, needs-related payments are the only form of general ``cash'' assistance (excluding cash provided as a reimbursement for transportation expenses, etc.) allowable under title III. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters disagreed with the statement in the preamble to the interim final rule that supportive services could not be based on a group characteristic, such as welfare. In light of the other changes made in the final rule, this statement is no longer applicable. In developing the policy called for in the final rule, an SDA may use a group characteristic as a basis for determining supportive service needs. For example, under title II, a financial assistance payment to a participant may be fixed, based upon an income schedule or group characteristic (such as welfare recipient) identified in the objective assessment and reported in the ISS, or may be determined in accordance with another method determined by the SDA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations reflect the Department's intent that financial assistance be treated as a supportive service for the general welfare of the participant. This assistance is to be based upon the financial needs of an eligible individual to permit the individual to participate in training. With this basic premise, the Department intends that financial assistance payments, in addition to not being considered as income in accordance with section 142(b) of the Act, should not be subject to income and employment taxes. However, all such decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Benefits and Working Conditions. The provision of &sect;627.310(b)&hyph;(d) of the interim final rule are redesignated and revised as a new &sect;627.315. One commenter suggested that the regulations should not require participants to work for employers that are violating labor laws. In response, &sect;627.315(a) is amended to reflect this concern for compliance with applicable labor laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addressing a number of other comments, redesignated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;627.315(b) (&sect;627.310(b) of the interim final rule) is amended to clarify that if a State workers' compensation law is not applicable, recipients and subrecipients shall secure insurance coverage for injuries suffered by participants in all JTPA work-related activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Administrative Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant Agreement and Funding. Section 627.405 establishes a new annual grant agreement process to facilitate the obligation, accounting, and closeout of JTPA funds by year of appropriation. No specific comments were received on this section and comments generally related to this section and other sections are responded to in other sections of this Preamble. No changes are made to this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reallotment and Reallocation. Section 627.410 implements the new section 109 of the Act, which requires the Governor to reallocate, among SDA's in the State, unobligated funds in excess of 15 percent of any SDA's program year title II allocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters responded on the provisions of this section. Almost all of them recommended basing reallocations on obligations rather than expenditures and questioned whether a State could adopt a more restrictive reallocation policy based on expenditures. Most of the other comments were requests that the regulations further clarify the reallotment and reallocation provisions of the Act including an interpretation of section 109(a)(3) of the Act concerning SDA's that have the highest rates of unemployment for an extended period of time and the highest poverty rates. One commenter pointed out a potential conflict between the provisions of section 109 of the Act, which bases reallocation on obligations, and section 161(b)(1) of the Act, which ties reallocation to expenditures. Another commenter raised the issue of whether Title II&hyph;B (summer) funds could be reallocated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the legislative history of the statutory provision, particularly the 1991 House Committee Report (H.R. Rep. No. 102&hyph;240, 63 and 64 (1991)), the Department believes that the intent of Congress was to ensure effective, timely use of the funds. The Department previously suggested that another interpretation, based upon the provisions of section 161(b) of the Act, might permit a more rigorous standard, such as expenditure. However, upon further review, the Department believes that the language in the statute is clear in providing that the basis for reallocation is to be the ``obligation'' of funds and the Department now believes that an interpretation that is more restrictive would be inconsistent with the Act. A new paragraph (a)(2) is added that prohibits the Governor from imposing reallocation requirements that are based on other than obligations. While it may be true, as some commenters suggested, that basing reallocation solely on obligations may lead to last minute obligations of funds which have little program purpose simply to avoid reallocation, the Department is constrained by the statutory language and cannot use that possibility as a basis for varying from a clear statutory requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Ruipu (3769 3843 3877)] </F>   [Text] "Decisions by the Central Committeee of the  Communist Party of China Regarding Several Issues Concerning  Establishing a Socialist Market Economic System" points out that  "a socialist market economic system is one integrated with the  basic socialist system" and "a modern enterprise system with a  public ownership system as the main part is the foundation of  the socialist market economic system." There are two main items  in the basic socialist system: One, public ownership of the  means of production, and two, the Communist Party in power. One  item is economic, one is political; these are the essential  differences between it and the basic capitalist system. There  will be no questions about establishing a socialist market  economic system if we do not firmly uphold the position of the  Communist Party in power and public ownership of the means of  production. To firmly uphold a socialist public ownership system  requires enlivening large- and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises because they are the backbone of socialist public  ownership.    The current matter is: In general, the mainstays of the  public ownership system--medium- and large-sized state-owned  enterprises--still lack vitality. A relative number of them have  suffered losses while there is flourishing growth in the  non-public ownership economy. We naturally cannot clutch onto  policies to control growth in the non-public ownership system  economy to protect the publically-owned economy. On the one hand  we must continue to encourage the growth of the non  publically-owned economy. On the other hand we must enliven  state-owned medium- and large-sized enterprises through deeper  reforms. We may very possibly be compelled to privatize if the  latter cannot be enlivened for a long time and are powerless to  compete against the non publically-owned economy. Therefore,  enlivening medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises is  both a fundamental economic issue as well as a fundamental  political issue.    Overall, medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises  still lack vitality. This is a fact. However, there are two  opinions regarding how to treat this fact. One regards their  lack of vitality as due to the public ownership system. Some  believe that having medium- and large-sized state-owned  enterprises is in itself a mistake. A second treatment is to  seek truth from facts, with specific analyses for specific  issues. The lack of vitality seen in medium- and large-sized  state-owned enterprises is in terms of comparison with the non  publically-owned economy and the collectively-owned economy. On  the surface, considering vitality and competitiveness, the  state-owned is not as good as the collective, the collective is  not as good as the individually-owned, the individually-owned is  not as good as the privately-owned, and the privately-owned is  not as good as enterprises with the three types of foreign  ownership. Nonetheless, this is not a material fact but purely a  surface phenomenon. The fact of the matter is that they  basically are incomparable. First, medium- and large-sized  state-owned enterprises were created under a highly unified  planned economic system. They operated for several decades under  the old system. Now we must undertake reform, a reform of the  highly unified planned economy, transform enterprise operating  mechanisms and establish a socialist market economic system.  There is a switching process for enterprises to enter the  marketplace as independent economic bodies. The non  publically-owned and collectively-owned economy as swift-footed  arrive first, reaching it in one step. For them there is no  process of switching from the old to new systems. They create  enterprise operating mechanisms directly according to th e needs  of a market economy. Second, the developmental histories differ.  Medium-and large-sized state-owned enterprises always have been  pillars of the national economy. The individual economy, the  private economy and enterprises using the three types of foreign  investment are products arising in implementing reforms of the  economic system following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th  Central Committee Meeting of the CPC. Because medium- and  large-sized state-owned enterprise directors for a long time  used a policy of unified state control over income and  expenditure, the state added value on enterprises by tax profits  and other methods and allocated seriously insufficient funds for  the technological transformation of enterprises. This brought on  the aging of enterprise equipment, backward technology, and no  readjustment of the industrial mix, product mix or tecnological  mix of enterprises for a long time. Under highly unified  planning, this contradiction was somewhat hidden. After  reforming the economic system and once enterprises directly  faced markets, this contradiction immediately became clear. From  the day they were set up, the individual economy, the private  economy, and foreign-funded enterprises faced the market. Their  industrial mix, product mix and technology mix were naturally  rational. Even though certain things are irrational, small boats  are easy to turn about and readjustment is relatively simple. It  is relatively hard to readjust the industrial, product and  technology mixes of medium- and large-sized state-owned  enterprises. Third, social contributions and burdens are not the  same. Most medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises are  old. All have made outstanding contributions to the state in  terms of providing tax income and training and moving personnel.  At the same time, they have constituted a considerable core of  retired worker. Because social security mechanisms still are  unformed, retired workers still rely on enterprises for living  security and medical benefits. Retired workers account for  one-third of those on the job in most enterprises. In particular  enterprises, the proportion of workers on the job to those  retired is one to one. This undoubtedly will increase costs,  lower profit levels and correspondingly weaken competitiveness.  Prior to reform, China's employment road was narrow. There also  was a desire to sustain social stability. Medium- and  large-sized state-owned enterprises only had a responsibility to  expand employment but no authority to reduce the number of staff  and workers. As a result there was surplus labor on the job.  Generally speaking, there was 20 percent to 30 percent surplus  of workers at medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises.  Speaking in terms of the needs of a market economy, this is an  irrational allocation of resources. Surplus workers should be  pared down to attain the best combination of the means of  production and labor and improve economic results. Considered  in terms of the needs of social stability, enterprises are not  allowed to push surplus workers out into society. Although the  "Regulations for Transforming the Operating Mechanisms of  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" stipulated that those  responsible for an enterprise have this authority, practically  noone responsible for an enterprise dares use it. The individual  economy, the private economy and foreign-funded enteprises need  not have such worries. Medium- and large-sized state-owned  enterprises have paid an enormous price to the state and  society. This price will lead to higher enterprise costs, lower  profit levels and weaker competitiveness. For a long time now,  we have had enterprises run society, from cafeterias to  elementary and middle schools. Some even run colleges. Although  this is a contribution by enterprises, it also is a burden. The  individual economy, the private economy and foreign-funded  enteprises have neither such a contribution nor any such burden.  It clearly is unfair if it is sweepingly and abstractly stated  that medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises are not as  good as the individual economy, the private economy, or  foreign-funded enterprises, in terms of vitality, without  differentiating these different circumstances. If medium- and  large-sized state-owned enterprises are allowed to smash the  "three knives": One, give retired workers to the state and  society, and enterprises will no longer care for them; two, pare  down all surplus workers; and three, stop the running of middle  and elementary schools and colleges. In this way, enterprises  would immediately be enlivened by one-half. The current problem  is that none of the three knives can be smashed. Enterprises  still must practice exercises to benefit the internal organs and  digest [workers] themselves. This requires procedure.    The process of enlivening medium- and large-sized  state-owned  enterprises also is one of economic development and reform. The  "Decisions of the Central Committee of the CPC Regarding Reform  of the Economic System" notes "full development of a commodity  economy is a stage which socialist economic development cannot  overstep. It is an essential condition to realize the  modernization of China's economy." The "Decisions by the Central  Committeee of the Communist Party of China Regarding Several  Issues Concerning Establishing a Socialist Market Economic  System" by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee note, "transform the operating mechanisms of  state-owned enterprises and establish a modern enterprise  system" and "a modern enterprise system with a public ownership  system as the main part is the foundation of the socialist  market economic system." The two meetings, two documents and  their policy regulations are a summary of economic development  and reform experience. They also are a deepening of reform  theory reflecting that our understanding of socialism and reform  have reached a new level. Nevertheless, establishing a socialist  market economic system is an unprecedented pioneering  undertaking that requires resolution of many extremely  complicated issues. Economic system reform is a profound reform  relating to the foundation of the economy and many areas of  superstructure. Of course we must change various irrational  interest situations inherent to the old system and those newly  created in the process of transforming the system. We cannot  avoid this or that difficulty or obstruction which may be  encountered. Overall, we must handle well the relationship among  reform, development and stability. We must handle well interest  relationships in all respects, motivate all positive factors and  create conditions for healthy growth of the national economy.  Ths requires that we develop market economies. We cannot negate  the primary position of the public ownership system. To enliven  enterprises we must not create social upheaval. To rationally  allocate resources we cannot create enormous armies of  unemployed.    Reform is a mass undertaking. The "Decisions by the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China Regarding Several  Issues Concerning Establishing a Socialist Market Economic  System" make clear stipulations regarding basic reform ideology,  basic theory, basic policy, basic principles, and basic  requirements. Reform theory is further clarified and the  direction of reform is further defined. Whether there is success  in transforming the operating mechanisms of state-owned  enterprises, in establishing modern enterprise systems, in  fostering and developing market systems, in changing political  functions, in establishing a full macroeconomic readjustment and  control system, and in establishing rational individual income  allocation and social security systems, the practice of the  masses must be relied on. A successful example is provided to us  by overall and complete reform of the Beijing Number One Light  Industry Headquarters; the secret of success lies in the two  words, "overall and complete." Their method was to pull out of  secondary and enter tertiary industry -- enterprises situated in  urban golden areas pull out of secondary industry and enter  tertiary industry; pull out of fourth and enter secondary --  enterprises situated in golden areas pull back beyond the fourth  ring and develop secondary industries with high results at high  starting points; added asset value -- rationally deploy  resources through the direction of land use and development  models to attain the greatest added value of assets; industrial  shift -- on the basis of added asset value, readjust and  reorganize the industrial mix; transform mechanisms -- change  mechanisms and establish systems while transforming enterprises  and reorganizing industries; have headquarters manage assets  instead of enterprises; personnel circulation --asset  redevelopment creates new employment opportunities, allowing the  best arrangement of surplus personnel; industrial mix  readjustment -- personnel changes and function readjustment are  all deep reforms and enormous changes. While deepening reform by  enormous change, economic growth was maintained and state-owned  assets increased in value, while maintaining social stability.  This must be called an extraordinary wonder. Of course the  Beijing Number One Light Industry Headquarters has the  superiority of occupying a golden area which others do not.  Nonetheless it also should be seen that others have  superiorities which it does not. The outcome still depends on  human effort. A certain large-sized enterprise in Jiangsu has an  on-the-job worker to retired worker ratio of one-to-one, with 30  percent surplus workers, long-term losses and near-bankruptcy.  The threat of bankruptcy oppresses the director and workers.  Oppression engenders a feeling of crisis and the feeling of  crisis brought on a courageous search for a way out. After  several years of struggle, they got out of difficulty. What was  the general character of these two experiences, that of the  Beijing Number One Light Industrial Enterprise and the Jiangsu  large-sized enterprise? It is as discussed in the "Decisions by  the Central Committeee of the Communist Party of China Regarding  Several Issues Concerning Establishing a Socialist Market  Economic System": "Respect the pioneering spirit of the masses.  Give heed to the individual interests of the masses. Summarize  in a timely way the practical experience of the masses. Respect  the desires of the masses. Guide, protect and develop well the  enthusiasm of the masses. In the process of deepening reform and  developing the economy, handle appropriately the relationships  among accumulation and consumption, the whole and the partial  and long-term and near-term interests. Continually raise the  living standards of the masses. Make reform win a broad and deep  mass foundation." Establishing a modernized enterprise system  with Chinese characteristics and establishing a socialist market  economic system are unprecedented pioneering undertakings; thus,  we especially must emphasize people's creativity and respect the  masses's pioneering spirit. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said  on his 1992 southern tour: In a certain sense, firmly upholding  socialism, developing the economy, reforming and the open door  policy, and firmly upholding the cause of the two civilizations  depend on the people.    Integrating a basically socialist system and a market  economy  requires firmly upholding the position and leading role of the  public ownership system. Firmly upholding the position and  leading role of the public ownership system requires enlivening  medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises. This accords  with the logic of theoretical and practical developments.</p>

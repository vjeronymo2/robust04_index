			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Growing expectations that the Bank of Japan will lower the nation's official discount rate this month to boost the domestic economy will lift the No 157 10-year benchmark government bond this first week of 1994. The argument for lower interest rates was strengthened recently with economic data that revealed a 6.9 per cent year-on-year decline in the nation's retail sales for an 18th consecutive monthly drop, and a 2.8 per cent rise in Japanese unemployment, the worse figure in six years. Bleak corporate earnings reports will add more evidence to the case of easier credit. A cut in the ODR rate, which is already at a record low of 1.75 per cent, is likely to prompt investors to move money from short-term debt into higher yielding, long-term securities. Some investors still worry, however, that bond prices, after months of an extended rise, will soon decline on profit-taking. But this kind of anxiety is countered by the widely held view that weakness in the Japanese economy will continue, and that long-term interest rates will remain low. And brokers expect buying on dips. Even an end to the bond gains will hardly result in an automatic transfer of monies into stocks.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (9): Prepared to consider alternative approaches - Russia The important thing is that after months of agonising over how to start privatisation, Russia has at last begun the process which all reformers in the former Soviet Union agree is essential to moving towards a market economy Before it was privatised, the windows of Moscow's Gastronom number 44 were decorated with empty cartons for milk which it rarely sold. Now that it has been privatised and renamed Ukraine Trading Firm, the cartons remain and there is still no milk for sale on a regular basis. This is the meagre result of a mass privatisation of the capital's shops by virtually handing them over to their workers for a nominal price by Mr Gavril Popov, the capital's former mayor. His aim, he said was 'smashing state property at any cost' to reverse 75 years of socialism. Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation minister, argues that such transfers of assets to workers for an extremely low book value are 'socially unfair, economically ineffective and politically dangerous'. However, he also admits that the task of taking out of state hands an economy which is 97 per cent state owned is 'so great that one should not forbid or exclude alternative approaches'. Mr Chubais's biggest worry about his approach is that there wil be insufficient demand for enterprises that will be offered for sale. The important thing is that after months of agonising over how to start privatisation, Russia has at last begun the process which all reformers in the former Soviet Union agree is essential to moving towards a market economy. The next headache is how to progress from small privatisation to the privatisation of big enterprises, most of which badly need painful and costly restructuring, and many of which are so obsolescent or so polluting that they need closing. While some republics have gone further in some directions - Armenia, for example, has privatised most of its farming land - others, such as Belarus and the central Asian republics have not even begun taking the economy out of state control. For the small-scale privatisation which Russia is trying to achieve this year, Mr Chubais favours auctions to dispose of shops, restaurants and small enterprises in those parts of he country over which he has some control. The extent of his authority falls far short of the formal borders of the Russian federation which stretches from St Petersburg to Vladivostok and everything in between. Moscow, for example, has special permission to use its own approach with the city boundaries. The autonomous republics within Russia, such as Tataria, simply do not obey the government, while everywhere else the rules are frequently broken by acts of so-called nomenklatura privatisation. This is the process wherebye state-owned assets are transferred, usually at nominal prices, to private companies owned by friends or family of the managers involved, defrauding both the state treasury and ordinary citizens. Earlier this year the untypically enlightened local authorities of Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, teamed up with the World Bank to conduct a model auction of shops, which was a big success. Using this politically useful but rare example Mr Chubais, in his welcoming speech, underlined that collective or state owned enterprises need the shock of competition, and the experience of having to pay real money for their acquisitions, in order to change their behaviour. Although Moscow provides impressive statistics for the creation of property owners, there is little incentive for a change in habits. There is no danger of going bankrupt because there is no law on bankruptcy, there is little competition, and for the time being shops are simply passing increased costs on to the beleaguered consumer. 'There is a big political danger that Muscovites will read the newspapers, and hear that trade has been privatised but then when they go to the shops, they'll see nothing there,' Mr Chubais warns. Mr Chubais believes his method is the least prone to corruption, while Mr Popov, a man of older years, says corruption is inevitable, and indeed desirable. That there should be few practical benefits from the privatisation conducted so far in Moscow is also a sign of how much more needs to be done in the rest of the economy. There is no wholesale system to speak of - just an inefficient state-controlled distribution system and virtually no competition. While Gastronom 4 bought pineapples from a local hard currency store and sold them for a big rouble mark up, it rarely has basic items such as milk (other than extremely expensive long-life milk from Italy). This is a consequence of the poor supply, storage and transport facilities which blight all aspects of the economy. The need to think of the entire food chain as one long, series of unbroken links stretching from the field or dairy, through to the wholesaler or processor and on to the eventual consumer is the principal lesson which the British Food Consortium, consisting of the UK's biggest food and distribution companies, has been emphasising. It sees it as part of the uphill struggle to improve and privatise food supply in Russia and Ukraine. For the privatisation of large enterprises, which is due to start next year, Mr Chubais believes that the Czechoslovak system of distributing vouchers to the population is the most promising route for Russia to follow. Just back from a trip to Prague, he noted that 420 investment funds set up to manage shares had appeared spontaneously. The Russian government plans to launch its own voucher distribution scheme this autumn - after sorting out practical details such as whether they should be given out for free or paid for, and who would receive them. The situation in Russia is complicated by the fact that it was born out of the Soviet Union's collapse. In the absence of Russian citizenship laws, the government had to find an effective criteria for supplying vouchers to Russians only. Not all the inhabitants of Russia are Russians, while a lot of Russians live outside Russia. For this reason the government will be declaring a deadline for Russians to return to Russia in order to receive vouchers, while everybody who is permanently resident in Russia will receive vouchers even if they are not Russian. The government is also in the process of sorting out what to do about foreigners. Having dropped plans for a special exchange rate for foreigners (to prevent Russians from being squeezed out of the race by an extremely weak rouble), the government is casting around for an alternative system of giving its own nationals equal opportunities. The suggestions it has come up with so far - setting aside special enterprises for foreign investors or multiplying the price of assets bought by foreigners by special coefficients - are all difficult to operate in practice. Mr Chubais claims to prefer avoiding any special practices for foreigners on the grounds 'that the more foreign investment there is the better'. In the absence of a bankruptcy law on which is a prerequisite for closing down inefficient enterprises and a threat for those which fail to restructure, privatisation of large enterprises is likely to remain a limited for some time to come. The government has ordered them to turn themselves into joint stock companies in preparation for possible privatisation starting next year, or earlier if they are ready. Attempts to attract foreign investment to big enterprises show this is likely to continue to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. But foreigners are reluctant to buy into enterprises which are heavily overmanned and over which they are unlikely to have control. What is more likely is that there will be a prolongation of the present system where joint ventures are limited to those assets which foreign investors are interested in. These are then hived off from the rest of the enterprise in order to insulate them from the inefficiency of the complex as a whole.</p>

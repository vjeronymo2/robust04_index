			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UPDATE ON MAQUILADORAS;  </P> <P> WORRIES OVER LABOR APPEAR TO HAVE SUBSIDED IN TIJUANA  </P> <P> The shock waves caused by the labor strife in maquiladora operations in Reynosa  in northeast Mexico rippled across the Tijuana maquiladora scene over the  summer, striking fear in the hearts of local boosters who have long touted  Tijuana's relative absence of labor unions as one of the region's principal  selling points.  </P> <P> But the ripples apparently subsided, judging from the continued strength in  applications for maquiladora permits from U.S. and other foreign manufacturers.  New permits are running nearly as strong as last year, when maquiladoras in  Tijuana, Tecate and Ensenada increased a record 45% to 579 plants at year's  end.  </P> <P> Jose Luis Ascolani, the local delegate in the federal Secretary of Commerce and  Finance (SECOFI) office in Tijuana, which is in charge of granting maquiladora  permits, said his office has averaged 11 new permits a month so far this year,  not to mention 15 ampliaciones, or expansions, per month. Total maquiladoras in  the Tijuana region now are pushing 700. Employees total 64,000 in the three  cities, up from 53,000 at the end of 1988.  </P> <P> Ascolani said the strongest current demand for permits is coming from U.S.  woodworking companies, from furniture manufacturers to picture-frame makers,  who now number 110 plants, or more than 15% of all maquiladoras in the Northern  Baja California region.  </P> <P> One of the highlights of the year so far, from Ascolani's point of view, was  the opening in August of a maquiladora by Scripto Tokai, Japanese manufacturer  of pens and disposable lighters. The plant, which employs 400, is the largest  new maquiladora to have set up shop this year. Payroll is growing rapidly and  is scheduled to cover 1,200 workers by December, he said.  </P> <P> The Scripto Tokai plant's work force, which has appeared virtually overnight,  illustrates that labor is still abundant in Tijuana, Ascolani said.  </P> <P> "The problem in Reynosa grew out of a power struggle among the labor leaders  there and had nothing to do with Baja California," he said. "Tijuana is quiet,  and there is a lot of work."  </P> <P> Still, some American companies are not taking any chances. One Palm Springs  insurance company that writes policies for U.S. companies to insure them  against production losses at maquiladoras, reported a significant increase in  new policies in the aftermath of the Reynosa strikes. CHRIS KRAUL Ascolani's  SECOFI office recently presented awards for special recognition to several  companies that operate Tijuana maquiladoras. Among those cited are: * Mattel,  for maintaining Tijuana's largest maquiladora payroll. Mattel employs 3,600  during its peak toy-making season in the weeks before Christmas, and 2,800  during the balance of the year. * Sanyo, the Japanese consumer electronics  giant, for making the largest capital investment in a Tijuana maquiladora.  Sanyo has invested $300 million, Ascolani said, in half a dozen plants in  Tijuana totaling more than 1.5 million square feet of manufacturing space.  Sanyo assembles a variety of products there, from electric fans and  refrigerators to televisions and blenders. * Kyocera, a semiconductor  ceramic-wafer manufacturer, for technology innovations in new chips. * Solar  Turbines, a maker of oil-field turbine engines, for technology transfer, or the  maquiladora whose technology most benefits Mexican technological development. *  Ocean Designs, a furniture manufacturer, for administrative efficiency.  Turnover at the Ocean Design plant is the lowest among Tijuana maquiladoras,  Ascolani said.  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Officials to probe Du Cann dealings The investigation into the past business dealings of Mr Edward du Cann, the former Conservative party chairman, was stepped up yesterday when creditors appointed two trustees in bankruptcy to look into his financial affairs. Sir Edward was made bankrupt last March with liabilities estimated at more than Pounds 1.2m. A creditors' meeting in Exeter yesterday voted to appoint Mr Christopher Morris, of accountants Touche Ross, and Mr Christopher Hughes, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, as trustees. This allows greater investigation into Mr du Cann's financial affairs than the appointment of the official receiver.</p>

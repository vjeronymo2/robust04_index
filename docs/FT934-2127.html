			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Southern Radio ahead to Pounds 0.96m Southern Radio, which provides independent local radio services in Hampshire, Sussex and Kent, lifted pre-tax profits by 24 per cent in the year to September 30. On turnover ahead 13 per cent to Pounds 8.61m (Pounds 7.64m) the pre-tax figure came out at Pounds 956,000, against Pounds 774,000. The results were the first to reflect a full 12 month period for the enlarged group following the merger of Southern with Invicta Radio in December 1991. On current trading, directors said revenues for the first months of 1993-94 were well ahead of last year. Earnings per share rose to 2.26p (2.02p) and an improved final dividend of 0.95p (0.794p) is proposed for a 1.25p (0.794p) total. The shares rose 7p to 65p.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Judge clears cabinet ministers Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and his predecessor Mr Kenneth Clarke were cleared by a judge yesterday of contempt of court in trying to deport a young Indian woman despite her status as legal guardian of her younger sister and five brothers. Lawyers for Ms Dalvinder Kaur, 22, of Nottingham, whose parents have been deported to India as illegal immigrants, claimed the Home Office 'rode roughshod' over a 1991 High Court order making the children , now aged four to 17, wards of court and placing them in their sister's care and control. But Sir Stephen Brown, Family Division president, refused to make a finding of contempt. He said the case was an 'abuse' of the court pro-cess.</p>

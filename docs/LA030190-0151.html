			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHATTY HACKERS;  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: HARPER'S DRAWS COMPUTERPHILES INTO SPIRITED ELECTRONIC DEBATE ON THE  ETHICS AND DANGERS OF BREAKING AND ENTERING DATA BANKS.  </P> <P> Don't look now, but you may have company. In your office. In your home. A  visitor may, at this moment, be prying into the most intimate details of your  existence.  </P> <P> That intruder would be a computer hacker, and even if you don't own or work at  a computer, he can probably "access" the facts of your life as they exist in a  multitude of government and corporate data banks.  </P> <P> By their nature, hackers tend to be hard to track down. So the editors of  Harper's Magazine invited a few of them to chat via a medium they can relate to  -- the computer bulletin board.  </P> <P> The forum was sufficiently intriguing that within three hours of launch, a  Pentagon-funded anti-hacker group contacted Harper's to scold the magazine and  to request unedited transcripts of the electronic conversations that occurred,  senior editor Jack Hitt said. The request was denied, he added.  </P> <P> Here's how the forum worked: For 11 days, 20 well-known and underground  computer wizards logged onto a Sausalito, Calif.-based computer bulletin board  at their leisure. Guided by questions from Harper's editors, they discussed the  ethics, dangers and potential benefits of electronic breaking and entering, as  well as the implications of this budding technology on issues of privacy and  free speech.  </P> <P> One highlight in the discussion came when a former cattle rancher and  Republican county chairman-turned-hacker and lyricist for the Grateful Dead  offended a 17-year-old participant, known only as Phiber Optik, by comparing  his rebelliousness to that of a skateboarder.  </P> <P> Optik responded, according to Harper's, by quickly breaking into the computers  at TRW and sharing with the other forum participants his antagonist's complete  credit history.  </P> <P> "Any fool knowing the proper syntax and the proper passwords can look up a  credit history," Optik said.  </P> <P> In fact, according to these master hackers, gaining access to anything from  White House data banks to Joe Citizen's electronic mail can be "a trivial  undertaking."  </P> <P> Many of these computerphiles argue -- not always convincingly -- that hacking  is an honorable affair, a "moral obligation" even.  </P> <P> "Since World War II, we've been governed by a paramilitary bureaucracy that  believes freedom is too precious to be entrusted to the people," argues the  aforementioned lyricist-hacker. "The government has become a set of Chinese  boxes. Americans who believe in democracy have little choice but to shred the  barricades of secrecy at every opportunity."  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees. "The government is justified in taking extreme action to  protect itself and the rest of us from you," one programmer snaps,  electronically.  </P> <P> In this forum, however, he was in the minority. As a hacker named Dave said, "I  don't want any congressional King Georges treading on my cursor. We must  continue to have absolute freedom of electronic speech!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> MUST READ  </P> <P> * The Los Angeles Times is a-changin', but for better or worse? Some reporters  complain that it is leaning toward the spare McJournalism style of USA Today.  Some East Coast types think it's too long-winded. In this week's New Yorker,  Joan Didion ponders the matter for many pages and seems unable to reach a  conclusion. She does deliver a nice history of the newspaper and its place in  Southern California, though.  </P> <P> * The February Manhattan Inc. also takes a look at The Times, in this case by  examining the paper's new publisher, David Laventhol. Best quote on Laventhol:  "He may look like an old sofa, but you have to remember they've got steel  frames."  </P> <P> * Ask one of the million or more people who have taken one of the increasingly  popular personal growth seminars what it was like and they're likely to say,  "You've just gotta experience it." Writer Paul Keegan did just that. In the  February-March Boston Business he reports that the popular Life-spring training  made him laugh, made him cry, and came darn close to transforming him into  another happy graduate -- a breed he characterizes as blissfully compliant  "zombies."  </P> <P> * Are kids growing up too fast? The March Redbook asks that question  rhetorically, already armed with a catalogue of figures to back up its emphatic  answer: Yes.  </P> <P> * The March Connoisseur offers Westerners a look at East Germany's "Communist  Pleasure Domes," complete with photos. The magazine reached two conclusions:  "Corruption on the extreme left usually cannot match that of the extreme right;  and that when it does occur, the Communist general public is more shocked than  we Westerners by it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> START THE SHREDDERS  </P> <P> * People Weekly put eight reporters on the tail of alleged Trump femme fatale  Marla Maples. They never tracked her down, but the March 5 issue does feature  11 photos of Maples, including a cover shot, and six pages of stunningly sappy  reportage.  </P> <P> * With Sting exploring the rain forests, can Ralph Lauren be far behind? Not  according to the March Vogue. The fashion industry is ready to face the  environmental crisis, the magazine reports. How? By making hats out of lichen,  for example. In another feature, the magazine devotes four pages to photos of  leotards, vests, purses, gloves, belts and shoes made of exotic snakeskins.  Endangered? Doesn't say.  </P> <P> * In the March Esquire, 12 men reveal their feelings about the termination of a  pregnancy they caused. How did abortion affect them? Their impassioned  responses range, in essence, from "Gosh, quite a bit" to "Not much."  </P> <P> * Pssst! Here's the dirt, as dished by the cover story in this week's Time:  Gossip is back in vogue, darling. This is a refreshingly intelligent look at a  dumb subject. But Time should know better than to use the oxymoron "gossip  journalism."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW ON NEWSRACKS  </P> <P> * Pleasure Quest -- "Your Success Guide to Sensual Adventures and Romance."  This new quarterly, based in Mesa, Ariz., is just what the name suggests.  Articles in the premier issue include pieces on vibrators, aphrodisiacs,  massage, gambling, finding good work, and "the pleasure of a bubble bath for  two."  </P></p>

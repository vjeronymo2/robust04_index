			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Convenience food sales rise steeply Ready-made meals comprised almost 35 per cent of the average household's food bill last year, a rise of nearly 10 per cent since the early 1980s, according to the 1993 National Food Survey. Sales of pizzas, frozen chips, crisps and other potato snacks also rose, while consumption of beef and lamb has dropped, according to the survey, which was published yesterday by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food. The Meat and Livestock Commission said high lamb prices probably accounted for the drop in consumption, while beef sales had been influenced by adverse publicity about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy - mad cow disease. The survey showed that fresh potatoes accounted for 40 per cent of household consumption by weight in 1993 compared with 48 per cent in 1983, but frozen vegetable sales rose. Fresh fruit sales were the same, except for bananas, which grew in popularity. Consumers in the south-east and East Anglia ate most frozen foods, while shoppers in Scotland and the north of England spent most on convenience foods. The Fruit and Vegetable Information Bureau said bananas were increasingly popular because they were easy to peel. 'Vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli which are easy to prepare and cook are also increasing in popularity. But it's not the same with root vegetables which take longer to cook, which is a pity because they are cheaper and very nutritious. 'Salad vegetables are also selling well because they are easy to prepare and go with many convenience meals like pizzas.' Families were drinking less full-fat milk than skimmed and fat-reduced milk. Cheese was also less popular, the survey said. The survey also showed: Bread sales - particularly white bread - were lower in the south of England than in the north and Midlands. Consumption of frozen cakes and pastry increased, while biscuit and breakfast cereal sales fell. Convenience foods provided 28 per cent of the total intake of energy in 1993, up from 20 per cent in 1983. Spending on food was 2.2 per cent higher in 1993 than in 1992 at Pounds 13.21 per person per week. National Food Survey 1993. Annual Report on Household Food Consumption and Expenditure.

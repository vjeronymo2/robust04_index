			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AIRLINE PLANS MAJOR OVERHAUL  </P> <P> Northwest Airlines said today it will spend $422 million over the next five  years to try to bring more flights in on time, improve in-flight food and  redecorate its 300 planes.  </P> <P> Northwest President Fred Malek said Northwest, the country's fourth-largest  airline, wants to become the first choice of more travelers by 1995.  </P> <P> Malek did not divulge results of market surveys on how Northwest fares among  competitors currently, but said the results were "not too good."  </P> <P> The plan includes spending $100 million to serve more meals and add choices to  the standard fare. About an equal amount will be spent to step up maintenance  capability and increase spare parts inventories, cutting down on delays due to  mechanical problems, Malek said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER FINED FOR HITTING REDONDO HOUSE WITH TRUCK  </P> <P> A Torrance police officer has been placed on probation and ordered to pay a  $612 fine after he pleaded no contest in South Bay Municipal Court to  misdemeanor hit-and-run driving for slamming his truck into a Redondo Beach  house.  </P> <P> Officer Roland Sabara, 34, still faces possible disciplinary action by his own  department when an internal affairs investigation is completed.  </P> <P> Sgt. Ron Traber, spokesman for the Torrance Police Department, said state law  prevents officials from revealing what action the department takes.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge Sandra Thompson ordered Sabara last Tuesday to pay the  fine and serve two years of unsupervised probation after Redondo Beach City  Prosecutor John Slawson submitted a recommendation urging leniency.  </P> <P> "This is a routine hit-and-run with a person who has a perfect DMV history and  who (pleaded) at the earliest opportunity, without any motions, trial, etc.,"  Slawson wrote in the report.  </P> <P> Sabara, who faced as much as six months in Los Angeles County Jail and a $1,000  fine, represented himself in court. He could not be reached Wednesday for  comment.  </P> <P> Sabara was accused of driving his blue 1989 Chevrolet Blazer through a wooden  fence and into the corner of a house at 615 Diamond St. about 2 a.m. on Aug.  21.  </P> <P> A witness told police that the driver of the truck backed up and drove off  without getting out to look at the damage.  </P> <P> Investigating officers found a half-mile trail of fluids that leaked from the  truck, but the trail dried up before leading them to the vehicle.  </P> <P> The owner of the house, who told police that he slept through the incident,  found a vanity license plate -- PRFLVSN -- in the debris. It belongs to  Sabara's truck.  </P> <P> Sabara went to the Redondo Beach Police Department's public counter about 10  hours after the accident to report his involvement. He said he had fallen  asleep at the wheel, and reported that he was not under the influence of  alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident.  </P></p>

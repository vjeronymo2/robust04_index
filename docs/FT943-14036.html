			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Technology is road to wealth creation in long term Sir, In his article 'Innovation Technology' (Economic Eye, July 11) Guy de Jonquieres expresses doubts about the value of new technology. Surely he would agree, however, that new technology - created by R&amp;D - is the only long-term source of wealth creation. After a few decades of development, industry based on a single unchanging technology approaches a plateau of efficiency, and the cost and performance of a manufacture plateaus too. Without the necessary (but not, I agree, sufficient) condition of new technology coming along, long-term prospects are invariably limited. It is possible for individual companies to flourish without new technology if they are looking for short-term gains, or if they are small niche firms. (No doubt a stone-axe manufacturing plant could still today be made a paying proposition). These possibilities have a tendency to blind us to the essential role of new technology in wealth creation. For the larger firms, those looking for long-term advantage, and for nation states, new technology is essential. On a national level, for example, high technology companies are very important. In my own sector, that of semiconductor equipment manufacture, UK companies typically export 75 per cent of their sales. The fact that worldwide governments feel the need to inject taxpayers' money into it is a reflection of the importance of new technology, and the failure of private industry to invest in it sufficiently. I fear for the future of UK industry if we carry on as we are: we have many companies bent on short-term returns and ignoring investment in new technology, and at the same time, we have government policy decisions which are withdrawing taxpayers money too.

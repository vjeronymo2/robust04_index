			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAe hit by share placing THE PLACING of a large line of stock in British Aerospace sent the shares tumbling to a five-year low, making BAe one of the day's worst performing stocks in the FT-SE list in percentage terms. At the day's low, the shares were down 21 at 188p as dealers reacted to a placing by securities house SG Warburg of a block of 5.5m early in the session at 185p a share. Later, bargain hunters helped the stock to end a net 10 down at 199p, on hefty turnover of 15m. The sale of the block of BAe shares at well below the market price inspired a renewed spate of negative stories regarding the woes of one of the UK's leading manufacturing companies, and in particular over the company's cash position. Reuters crumbles Dealers were surprised by the speed of a fresh fall in Reuters shares. The stock was under no pressure at the outset yesterday but plunged in mid-morning when a block of 400,000 shares was said to have been offered around the market by one leading securities house, with no takers. Other marketmakers responded by chopping their quotations. By the close the shares had weakened 60 to 1030p after relatively keen turnover of 1.8m. So far this week the stock has fallen by 134p. The shares have been under sustained selling pressure all week following the interim profits statement which was accompanied by a cautious comment on revenue outlook. A presentation to analysts in New York on Wednesday evening was believed to have gone well, however. Boots optimism An optimistic trading statement from Boots took the market by surprise, the shares jumping 19 to 447p in heavy turnover of 4.4m. Chairman Sir Christopher Benson told the annual meeting 'we are bucking the trend', and disclosed that group sales were up 10.8 per cent in the first quarter. Analysts suggested that sales growth of 7 or 8 per cent would have been more than acceptable and that these figures are exceptionally good. Mr Ian Macdougall, at Nomura Research, said this shows that in spite of a depressed retail background it is still possible to do well, but he warned against using Boots as a guide for the whole sector. Nomura, which admits to being towards the bottom of market forecasts on Boots, lifted its profits forecast for 1992/93 to Pounds 410m from Pounds 395m. Amstrad shock Recent worries about trading at Amstrad proved well-founded as the group disclosed that losses in the year to end-June will be approximately Pounds 25m higher than it had previously expected. The news saw Amstrad shares drop to 24p before late support left them only a net penny down at 29p. The rally came when the market decided that the group was likely to maintain the dividend in view of its Pounds 100m cash holding. Turnover was a heavy 26m, with one leading agency broker said to have been offering a sizeable block of shares during the afternoon. Two blocks of 5m and another of 1.5m were traded at 26 1/2 p late in the day. The stakebuilding story in Mirror Group Newspapers continued, with the shares pushed 3 3/4 higher to 69p on turnover of 6.2m. Since the MGN relisting last Friday some 54.8m of the shares have changed hands. Dealers said it was entirely feasible that a stakebuilder could have acquired a near 3 per cent holding, or around 14m shares, but that any stake in excess of 3 per cent would have to be revealed by today. Dealers in Lucas Industries quickly moved to sell the shares after what appeared to be a severe downgrade from Midlands-based broker Albert E. Sharp, making the stock the day's worst market performer in percentage terms. The shares fell 7 to 102p, after traders at first failed to take note of a Pounds 90m pension fund refund, thus mistaking a Pounds 10m current-year profits downgrade to Pounds 15m from the broker as a much bigger cut. Sentiment was further weakened by a lowering of estimates from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which is predicting that the company will make no profits this year, and from Strauss Turnbull, which is forecasting an underlying loss. Spring Ram dropped to 122p before stabilising and closing 7 down at 126p after an agency cross of some 3.9m shares at 122p, thought to have been carried out by the group's own broker, Panmure Gordon. A big agency cross of some 5m shares at 330p was partly responsible for turnover of 17m in HSBC, which ended 2 1/2 off at 335p. The banks sector provided two exceptionally strong performers in Barclays and Lloyds, both of which were given a strong push by the banks team at Robert Fleming Securities. The broker issued buy notes on both stocks. On Barclays, Fleming said the shares were 'oversold', that the bank's underlying profits growth before bad debts this year 'would be the best of the major UK banks', and that a dividend cut at the interim and final stages is 'unlikely and unnecessary'. Barclays closed 14 higher at 314p and Lloyds 12 better at 421p. BP delivered the outstanding performance in a mixed oil sector, advancing 5 to 207p on notably high turnover of 16m. Specialists said the stock was boosted by a mixture of switching from Shell and straight buying from overseas. The closure of the tender offer in Wellcome shares today was enlivened by a statement from the company that it would not sell any shares below Pounds 8 and that it was willing to reduce the amount of shares on offer - initially 330m - in order to create a healthy after-market. Wellcome firmed a penny to 830p. Lloyds Chemists surged ahead 36 to 235p on turnover of 2.4m shares, helped by good news from Boots and by a reassuring statement from Mr Allen Lloyd, the chairman and chief executive. New shares in Taunton Cider closed 13 above the offer price, at 153p. In spite of pleading strong attendances, Euro Disney said high costs would push it into the red for the first quarter to September 1992. The news left the shares 8 off at 1015p, their lowest since January last year. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (10).

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Brierley Investments to merge meat subsidiaries BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and industrial group, yesterday announced it was merging various subsidiaries in the meat industry to form a company with a projected turnover of NZDollars 185m (USDollars 100.5) and a forecast profit of NZDollars 8.3m. A main component of the new company will be Huttons Kiwi, a company BIL said last year would be relisted on the New Zealand Stock Exchange this year. Huttons Kiwi, a producer of bacon, ham and other meat products, is to be merged with the Riverland Group which exports beef to the US and Pacific rim countries. The two companies are to merge with a Brierley controlled retail group Apparel Holdings, which is listed on the stock exchange and seems destined to be the vehicle to launch the meat group. Apparel, which is 96 per cent owned by BIL, will then sell its assets to the parent company for cash. In the year to December 1990 Apparel made a NZDollars 55m net loss but reduced this to a NZDollars 199,000 loss in the year to last December.</p>

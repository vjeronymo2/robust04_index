			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T extends 1992 scheme to phase out jobs AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US communications and computer group, yesterday said it would close 40 offices and phase out 3,000 to 4,000 jobs by early 1995, writes Karen Zagor in New York. Most of the job cuts will affect AT&amp;T operators. The move, in response to the growing use of automated operator services, is an extension of the company's 1992 plans to cut between 3,000 and 6,000 non-management and between 200 and 400 management jobs by the end of 1994.</p>

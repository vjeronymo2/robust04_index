			<p>BFN     [Text] The Israeli enemy forces have committed another  crime to add to their bloody record. At 1845 today, Israeli  artillery located in 'Alman and al-Shumariyah bombarded the  township of Frun. Hasan Hayik, 35, Dalal Hayik, 25, and Munirah  Ahmad, 54, were martyred in the bombardment. Ahmad Hasan Hayik  and Ibrahim Ja'far, 16, were slightly hurt and Muna Hayik was  critically injured. They were all in the home of Qasim Bazzih,  which was burned down.    The UN Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] deployed in  al-Ghanduriyah prevented citizens from entering Frun because the  town was still being shelled.    The Israeli forces also pounded the villages of Qa'qa'iyat  al- Jisr, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, and Zawtar al-Sharqiyah and the  al-Litani River basin. The shelling was accompanied by Israeli  helicopter flights over the al-Litani River basin.</p>

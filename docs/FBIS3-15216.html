			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In accordance with a presidential decree signed by  Igor Smirnov, the state of emergency has been prolonged on the  territory of the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian republic till  March 31.    As it was reported earlier, the state of emergency was  introduced in Transdniester for one month late January. This  was officially explained by the need to stabilize the internal  political situation, exchange bank notes, and to improve the  economic situation.    Independent political observers assess this move as an  attempt to prevent the Transdniestrian population from  participation in the elections to Moldova's new parliament  scheduled for March 27.    The decree on prolonging the state of emergency points out  that this measure is aimed at further stabilization of the  situation in this region.</p>

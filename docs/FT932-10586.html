			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (16): Inflation complicates the figures - The structure of the banking sector still looks a little fragile ON FIRST impressions, Turkish banks would seem to be making handsome profits. But first impressions can be misleading. For even here, in one of the more robust sectors of the economy, inflation and the lamentable state of public finances are starting to make their mark. It is difficult, without inflation accounting standards, to be confident about the figures. Reported profits certainly have increased, even adjusting for the depreciation of the lira. However, as far as the balance sheets are concerned, many bankers acknowledge there has been a steady deterioration in some of the key financial ratios. High real interest rates mean that many institutions remain extremely liquid, as managers struggle to place the mushrooming level of savings deposits. Moreover, foreign exchange accounted for half of all deposits at the end of 1992 - a trend which has left many banks exposed to increased currency risk. To the consternation of the banking authorities, the phenomenon of 'currency substitution' is taking a grip on the sector. Emlak, a state-owned housing bank now offers index-linked housing loans. Meanwhile, the consumer boom has been fuelled largely by short-term foreign borrowing by commercial and state banks. The regulatory authorities have not favoured the banks. Turkish managers complain that they face legal reserve requirements much higher than the European average - a measure of the central bank's concern to control credit liquidity. While the central bank continues to maintain these levels, bank intermediation costs - the spread between lending and borrowing - will remain high. The problem of the lack of a developed spot and forward foreign exchange market, meanwhile, continues to bedevil overseas investors trying to hedge the lira. Just to rub salt in the wounds, the banks suffered from the loss of key tax concessions in 1992, with a minimum effective corporation tax established at 23 per cent. Hitherto, because of the tax incentives offered to holders of treasury bills and other incentives, few banks incurred the standard 46 per cent corporation tax. Indeed, many banks were able to offset all their liabilities, incurring only the 10 per cent withholding tax. The latest legislation is aimed at diverting funds to the stock exchange. However, for the more conservative institutions, like the privately owned Akbank, the tax move was a major blow. In 1992, Akbank suffered its first fall in profits since it went public in 1989, in large part as a result of a hefty 140 per cent increase in its tax charge. For all the changes of recent years, the structure of Turkish banking still looks a little fragile. The landscape is dominated by the state-owned banks. As for the private sector banks, most are owned by, and largely dependent on, the performance of parent holding companies. Ak, for example, is controlled by the Sabanc family. The World Bank has had some success in helping to restructure the balance sheets of some of the state banks, although the problems at Ziraat Bank, the state-owned agricultural credit bank, has meant the last tranche of a financial sector reform loan was held back - and has now been cancelled altogether. The issue, as with all of the state sector, is to introduce financial disciplines to meet the market. Ziraat is perhaps an extreme case. The bank, after all, acts more like an arm of the Treasury, collecting road and bridge tolls in rural areas, and making payments to civil servants. The bank calculates it makes around 63m transactions every year. Ziraat's reported profit was more than five times that of the next most profitable bank. 'Our branch next door makes more than a medium size bank,' claims Mr Caner Oner, executive vice-president. However, the vast proportion of its loan book - he estimates around 85 per cent - is to the agricultural sector, where levels of default are notoriously high. Moreover the bank does not make provision against lines extended to state-owned crop co-operatives, where there is often little realistic chance of recovery. The bank is accruing interest, thus inflating its income while deflating costs. One economist, familiar with the bank, said that if real provisions were made it would probably wipe out the net worth of the bank. For all its problems, Ziraat has been leading the way in the development of personal finance, where Turks have taken quickly to the advent of plastic credit cards and automatic teller machines. To keep up with the demands created by the market-based economic reforms, set in motion by the former Ozal administration in the early 1980s, many banks are now investing in the infrastructure of automation. 'The basic reason we invested so much in computerisation was to keep the customers out of the bank,' says Mr Oner. Ziraat, with some 10m retail customers, now has 16 different types of card. The bank has the largest ATM network, and is introducing phone banking. Isbank, Turkey's largest commercial bank, has gone one step further. Customers can now make share transactions through an ATM, even on a Sunday when the Istanbul Stock Exchange is not trading. Consumer lending, too, is a growing activity. However, recent bank performance has been driven by Treasury bill activity, which offers an attractive risk-free high yield investment. The banks, in effect, are feeding on the inability of the government to contain its hunger for funds. 'In today's market, if you go to a triple-A customer, they are not ready to pay more than 65 per cent,' says Mr Unal Korukcu, Isbank general manager. The high cost of funding has hit foreign banks, too. One French banker said European institutions that set up retail operations in earlier years were now reassessing their strategies, as big blue-chip Turkish companies turned to local banks to organise their offshore credit needs. Given all the difficulties, many observers believe Turkish banks are still some way from reaching the capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank of International Settlements. The broader exercise of harmonisation of Turkish banking with those of the European Community has even further to go. In line with BIS requirements, many banks have started a programme of disposals of their equity participations. Isbank, which at one stage saw itself as a leader of industry, has sold its interests in Unilever, the Anglo Dutch conglomerate, one of more than 100 equity participations. The bank has also sold cement factories, and interests in Tofas, the Fiat assembly operation. For all that, Mr Unal Korukcu, the Isbank general manager, says the portfolio has actually increased as a result of capital expansions. In addition, in some cases of non-performing loans, the bank has been forced to take new equity positions under debt-for-equity arrangements. Now the highly liquid state of the bank is also impairing the effort to reach the capital ratios. 'We now have to be very careful we do not let our deposits rise too high,' says Mr Korukcu.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      THE TOP TEN BANKS (TL m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Tier One   Capital/assets                                       Capital     ratio (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 TC Ziraat Bankas                   5,231,804       5.22 2 Akbank                             2,985,187       9.51 3 Turkiye s Bankas                   2,304,257       4.58 4 Turkiye Garanti Bankas             2,258,652      11.00 5 Yap ve Kredi*                      1,319,320       6.93 6 Turk Ticaret Bankas                1.152.874       7.89 7 Turkiye Kalkinma Bankas*             799,286      14.98 8 Turkiye Ihracat Kredi Bankas*        703,968       8.84 9 VakifBank*                           658,602       4.28 10 Iller Bankas*                       554,205       8.91  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Pre-tax        Assets                                        profits  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 TC Ziraat Bankas                    5,588,584    100,132,815 2 Akbank                              1,622,534     31,076,166 3 Turkiye s Bankas                    1,092,393     50,314,021 4 Turkiye Garanti Bankas              1,230,758     20,539,717 5 Yap ve Kredi*                         513,308     19,030,351 6 Turk Ticaret Bankas                   155,064     14,602,632 7 Turkiye Kalkinma Bankas*               96,484      5,336,290 8 Turkiye Ihracat Kredi Bankas*         104,352      7,962,792 9 VakifBank*                            125,870     15,400,455 10 Iller Bankas*                         83,690      6,217,054  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *End-1991; all others end-1992 Exchange rate: End-1991 dollars1=TL5,079.9; End-1992 dollars 1=TL8,564.4 Source: The Banker, May 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

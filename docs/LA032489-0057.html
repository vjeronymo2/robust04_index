			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH STEPS IN, MEDIATES SPAT OVER NITZE  </P> <P> President Bush, stepping into a State Department spat, worked out a compromise  with Paul H. Nitze that keeps the veteran arms control specialist working for  Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a part-time basis, Administration  officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Nitze, 82, wanted to stay on the job full-time as the Administration prepares  to resume negotiations with the Soviet Union on nuclear weapons reductions.  But, the officials said, he initially was offered only the role of  ambassador-emeritus, meaning he would be on occasional call, and turned it  down. Nitze's resignation as a full-time adviser, effective May 1, stands.  </P></p>

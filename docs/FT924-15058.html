			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / M&amp;G to seek rises in profit margins MERCANTILE &amp; General Reinsurance, the subsidiary of Prudential Corporation and the UK's biggest reinsurance company, is prepared to reduce its share of the general reinsurance business if it is unable to obtain satisfactory rate increases. 'If we fail to turn the market, we will turn away from it,' said Mr John Engestrom, the chief executive who took office in July. 'In the light of continuing losses and with minimal evidence of a significant hardening of the market, we intend to adopt a tough stance on imminent renewals.' With net premium income of about Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 780m) in 1991, M&amp;G is the 10th largest reinsurer in the world, although some 65 per cent of earnings are generated by life reinsurance. Mr Engestrom accepted that the company's rating stance would lead to a sharp reduction in market share next year. Rates from catastrophe reinsurance, marine and aviation business - in which Lloyd's of London and London market companies specialise - have increased, but elsewhere reinsurance rates were not increasing by a sufficient margin to guarantee profitability, he said. Softness in rates for proportional business - in which reinsurers insure a fixed percentage of risks insured by direct insurers - reflected low rates in direct business, both in North America and Europe. Markets in Germany, Italy and elsewhere in Europe had been 'slow to react' to increases in claims, said Mr Engestrom. Mr Engestrom said that since the Prudential had published its interim results last month 'there had been a deterioration in the company's general business'. Losses at the interim stage amounted to Pounds 25m, compared with Pounds 2m at the same stage last year. Claims from hurricane Andrew, which hit the US in late August, and hurricane Iniki, which devastated Hawaii last month, amount to about Pounds 30m. M&amp;G announced last month that it expected claims of some Pounds 20m. The group expects further losses on its LMX retrocession business underwritten between 1987 and 1990 - in which London market companies and Lloyd's syndicates reinsure each other's catastrophe exposures. It is keen to increase its share of the less volatile and more profitable life reinsurance market. Lex, Page 20</p>

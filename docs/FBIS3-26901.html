According to Mr. He, Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong  Province, now has 673 Taiwan-funded enterprises and 277  enterprises invested in by people who have relatives in the  island and of these enterprises, 10 each have investment of  U.S.$10 million and 90 percent of these enterprises are earning  profits. The newly-set-up enterprises of this kind have their  businesses shifting away from simple shoe-making into light  industry, chemical industry, electronics, textiles, machinery,  real estate and domestic animal-breeding.    Mr. He said that the new tax system starting to be  implemented this year would pose no bad influence to Taiwan  businessmen's earnings in the city and the city's favorable  policies set for them remained unchanged. Moreover, the city  would continue to improve its services to them.    Mr. He held that though much effort was being made in the  introduction of funds from Taiwan, the city was backward in this  sector compared with the Yangtze River delta area. The city  would, therefore, grasp the present opportunity, make every  effort to improve the environment for investment and find new  ways for making greater progress in the introduction of capital  from the island.    Mr. He revealed that the city would engage in four main  activities in this sector. First, it will convene a meeting on  Taiwan-related economy and trade. Second, it will invite a  batch of Taiwan compatriots to take part in the Litchi Festival  to be held in the city. Third, it will send a delegation of  entrepreneurs from the city to visit Taiwan and fourth, it will  invite big financial groups, famous entrepreneurs and personnel  from economic circles in the island to pay inspection visits to  the city.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Equal Opportunity 12866 and the Department of Transportation's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was reviewed under Equal Opportunity 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review.'' This action has been determined to be ``significant''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and procedures because of the significant public and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional interest in the rulemaking. NHTSA has estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the costs of the amendments in a Final Regulatory Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FRE) which is included in the docket for this rulemaking. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in that document, NHTSA estimates that testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the vehicle requirements will cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $54,480 for light vehicles. More generally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency believes that the cost of the final rule is mostly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing costs and the benefits are derived by ensuring an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent level of safety with gasoline vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's evaluation, I certify that this rule will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities. Information available to the agency indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently there are very few businesses manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger cars or light trucks for CNG use. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further believes that as the market expands for CNG vehicles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original vehicle manufacturers will begin to produce CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles because they will be able to do so at less expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than final stage manufacturers and alterers. Few, if any,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original vehicle manufacturers which manufacture CNG vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12612. NHTSA has determined that the rule will not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a Federalism Assessment. Nevertheless, the agency wishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to elaborate about its preemptive authority with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal motor vehicle safety standards given comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM about potentially inconsistent State law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AAMA and the NGVC/AGA stated that a Federal standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was necessary to preempt possible State and local regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing CNG vehicles. AAMA stated that_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Because the U.S. Energy Policy Act will require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both Federal and state governments become mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``fleet customers'' of alternative fuel vehicles, AAMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is apprehensive about the potential promulgation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a plethora of state alternate fueled vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, each slightly different from one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another, with an imposed standard or an alleged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher standard than the finalized applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal safety standard. In such a circumstance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there would appear to be no federal preemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection for the vehicle manufacturer. It is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, conceivable that to market these mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternate fuel vehicles, numerous vehicle versions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to be designed, manufactured, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, NGV/AGA expressed concern that State authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may initiate different or more stringent standards for CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. It was particularly concerned that NHTSA cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preempt separate regulation of vehicles procured by State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmental agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As both commenters are aware, section 103(d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Traffic and Motor Safety Act sets forth NHTSA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preemptive authority as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established under this title is in effect, no State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or political subdivision of a State shall have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority either to establish, or to continue in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect, with respect to any motor vehicle or item of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicle equipment any safety standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the same aspect of performance of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle or item of equipment which is not identical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Federal standard. Nothing in this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be construed as preventing any State from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcing any safety standard which is identical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Federal safety standard. Nothing in this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be construed to prevent the Federal Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the government of any State or political  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subdivision thereof from establishing a safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement applicable to motor vehicles or motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle equipment procured for its own use if such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement imposes a higher standard of performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than that required to comply with the otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable Federal standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to this statutory provision, once Standard No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 303 takes effect, no State or local government can have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard in effect addressing the fuel integrity of CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles unless that standard is identical to Standard No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 303. Nevertheless, the statute permits a State to issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher performance standards for CNG vehicles procured for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's own use, notwithstanding AAMA's desire for the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government to preempt States from doing so. In other words,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has no authority to prevent States from issuing more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent standards for vehicles procured for their own use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

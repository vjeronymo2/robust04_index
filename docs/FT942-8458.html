			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Drink, drugs, rock and roll It sounds like an invitation to crime. The UK's Transport Research Laboratory intends to ply drivers with alcohol and drugs and see how they perform behind the wheel. But this will take place in a safe environment - in TRL's new car simulator. Only the drink and drugs will be real. TRL, part of the Department of Transport, developed the simulator with the help of Silicon Graphics of the US. It uses technology previously associated with complex applications such as flight simulation. Designed and built by Maritime Dynamics of the UK, it contains a standard saloon car, modified to provide realistic motion and operation. Four screens surrounding the car will show realistic scenes and the sounds of the engine and starter motor will also be simulated. 'The driver had to be completely convinced that the car was moving, so the images had to be totally realistic and generated instantaneously,' says Robert Sharples, Maritime Dynamics' software manager.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington D.C., 4 Apr (PL) -- Today, the United  States recognized Cuba's cooperation in the struggle against  international drug trafficking in a U.S. State Department  document on the issue.    In an annual report on worldwide drug production and  trafficking, the U.S. Government corroborates that Cuban  authorities continue placing top priority on their anti-drug  policy, and it also indicates that Cuba cooperated with the  Unites States in this area in 1993.    According to Washington's opinion on how the nations of the  world are meeting the commitments made at the 1988 UN Drug  Convention, the report contends Cuba is engaged in a struggle  against drugs, despite the island's problems of fuel shortages  and the lack of spare parts, all of which limit Cuba's capacity  to combat drugs.    Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention on this issue and  has signed bilateral agreements with many nations in the region  to fight the scourge of drug trafficking.    Also, in 1988 it declared its willingness to sign an  agreement of this type with the United States, an offer which up  until now has been ignored by Washington.    Cuban cooperation in this struggle includes the interception  of planes and ships in its airspace and territorial waters as  well as supplying information to U.S. services in charge of  confronting this problem.    The United States is the world's largest drug consumer, and  the report admits that although cocaine continues to be the main  threat to U.S. drug users, the danger of the use of heroine is  growing at an alarming rate.</p>

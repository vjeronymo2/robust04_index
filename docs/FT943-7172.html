			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Bonn coalition in tax dispute Germany's coalition partners are at loggerheads over tax policies as the federal election campaign enters its final phase before voting on October 16. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, economics minister and a Free Democrat, wants the budget deficit held steady, instead of being reduced further, to leave room for tax cuts. The finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, has dismissed the idea, not only on behalf of his own Christian Social Union, but also in the name of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. Mr Rexrodt made his proposal in a campaign debate on Monday night with Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the opposition Social Democrat tipped to become finance minister if the SPD wins in October. Seeking to counter the SPD's campaign promise to implement a programme of swift and huge tax cuts for middle wage-earners, Mr Rexrodt suggested the government keep the deficit high to finance its own tax reductions. Attacking the idea, Mr Waigel insisted yesterday that 'there will be no tax reductions without compensating revenues.' Mr Rexrodt, however, in defending his proposal, cited progress in consolidating the federal budget, adding that the government could finance tax cuts by keeping the deficit at 2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1998 instead of cutting it to 0.5 per cent as planned. 'There would be room for tax cuts totalling more than DM50bn (Pounds 21bn),' he said.</p>

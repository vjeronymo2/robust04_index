			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (1): Europe takes a bigger share - Derivatives are likely to remain among the fastest growing and most profitable financial markets, as an increasing number of exchanges compete for business, and more banks develop derivatives units WHILE BANKS have been shrinking their loan books and cutting back their trading operations in recent years, the vogue for futures and options business has gathered pace. The market in futures and options and other so-called derivative products is at the forefront of technological development in the financial markets, and banks are keen to operate in those areas where higher margins can be charged. However, innovative instruments are often quickly subsumed into the mainstream. Many products which once earned rich commissions for traders are now widely understood and commonly available, and trade just like bond markets. Indeed, some markets have become so liquid that they tend to drive trading in the underlying cash market, rather than the other way around - for example, the Bund future on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). But at the other end of the scale, the market in specially-tailored products, designed to suit the specific needs of a corporate treasurer or a fund manager, is also growing. As soon as a financing technique invented by a particular firm is no longer proprietary, derivative specialists start looking for new twists. Banks no longer offer just straightforward options, but a seemingly endless variety of products, such as caps and range-forwards, which slightly alter the degree of exposure to different market movements. The technology used in the derivatives market is often applied throughout a range of underlying products. Swap technology, allowing counterparties to exchange interest-rate and currency flows, is now being applied to the equity and commodity markets. Futures contracts, once limited to interest-rate products, are being developed on clean air and insurance at the Chicago Board of Trade, the largest US exchange. The application of some techniques is limited only by investor-demand, which has not responded to some of the more outlandish products on offer. The development of futures markets has also been fuelled by the liberalisation of bond and equity markets in Europe and the Far East, which has opened up new markets for investors and new sources of funds for companies. The emphasis on US markets has shifted as investors focus more keenly on European markets, boosting the market share of futures exchanges outside the US last year to 47 per cent. Absolute volume continues to grow, however. January was a record month for exchanges and products in both Europe and the US. As well as a steady flow of new products - and new exchanges - in Europe, other financial markets, such as Latin America, are also set to join the fray. The shape that futures markets will take is still hard to predict. Talk of links between exchanges, common a few years ago, has faded, although there are signs that cross-listing of products may become more common. Equally, the automation of exchange-traded business has lagged expectations. The Globex trading system - developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the CBOT and Reuters - is still being tested, after repeated delays to its start-up schedule. Although some efforts at screen-based trading have been successful, such as the Deutsche Terminborse in Germany, the world's most actively traded contracts still use the traditional open-outcry system. The expansion of futures and options markets is expected to be fuelled by growing use of derivatives by investment managers. The managed futures fund industry in the US has grown dramatically in the last few years, and now has about Dollars 20bn under management. There is also increasing interest in managed futures in Japan. In most parts of Europe, fund managers are less familiar with the attractions of using futures and options than with the potential risks. In the UK, the Securities and Investment Board last year opened the door for unit trusts, offered to retail investors, to use futures, with certain limitations. However, they have shown some resistance to the concept. Of the two funds launched so far, only one was aimed at small retail investors. But interest among European pension and insurance fund managers is gradually growing, particularly in the use of futures to shift exposure from one market to another, generally a more efficient method of asset allocation than buying and selling in the cash market. The level of sophistication among European corporate treasurers has generally been quite high (with a few notable exceptions, such as Allied-Lyons which last year lost Pounds 150m through its use of currency options). The use of derivative products has become almost a pre-requisite for larger international companies, because it is no longer acceptable for companies to blame poor performance on movements in the foreign exchange markets. The derivative markets, both on the exchange-traded and the over-the-counter sides of the business, continue to attract an increasing number of banks. Indeed, some non-bank players have also entered the market, benefiting from the decline of credit quality among many banks which, particularly in the swap market, can have a negative impact on business. For example, AIG Financial Products, a subsidiary of the large insurance company, American International Group, has built up a successful swap business. Some banks have tackled the issue of credit quality. Last year, Merrill Lynch set up a specially-structured unit with a strong capital base, called Merrill Lynch Derivate Products, which gained a triple-A rating. Although other banks have considered that structure, many have fought shy in the belief that the return on capital would be insufficient. The decline in bank credits quality has left only a handful of triple-A-rated banks. Consequently, the hurdle has dropped to double-A - that is, banks only start to lose business when their rating falls below double-A. Credit concerns do not appear to have driven clients away from the OTC market to the futures markets, where credit risk is assumed by the exchange. Meanwhile, banks and broking firms are approaching the derivatives business from many different angles, depending on their own strengths and on their view of the market's future development. Some firms, such as GNI, have concentrated on developing their expertise in exchange-traded business. Others have developed specialist product units, where highly complex instruments are tailored to suit clients' needs. One example is Credit Suisse Financial Products, set up two years ago, which has developed a highly-successful client-driven business. Few firms can claim to offer a fully-comprehensive range of products across the three main areas of interests rates, foreign exchange and equity, and across both exchange-traded and OTC markets. Only a few banks, mainly US investment banks, claim to offer such a spectrum. Swiss Bank Corporation, which early this year took over O'Connor, the Chicago-based options trading firm, is now well positioned to offer strength across the board. Other banks, however, have grown their derivatives business on a more ad hoc basis, according to the relevant underlying market, so that, for example, equity derivative traders are part of an equities group. No particular formula has proved the key to success. However, the most profitable derivatives businesses have generally been the most innovative. Bankers Trust, which has been at the forefront of origination of equity derivatives, is generally cited as the classic example of a highly profitable, highly specialised derivatives house. The large number of new entrants to the market, including some Japanese firms, is generally welcomed, because new players are seen as providers of liquidity. However, as the market becomes more competitive - and the complexity of hedging risk assumed in the course of OTC business increases - some participants could lose out. But, while banks may be in for some disappointment, their staff are generally benefiting, particularly in expanding sectors such as equity derivatives. According to a recent survey on futures and options salaries by Jonathan Wren, the recruitment consultancy, the development of the equity derivatives market in 1991 brought 'an enormous upswing in salaries.'</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: The Vixen prowls again AWAY FROM arias, starring roles, magnificent sets, epic stories, Janacek's The Cunning Little Vixen is one of the jewels of opera. Only a composer coming from outside the standard operatic tradition could have lighted upon a cartoon story of a young fox and told it in music of such radiant beauty as to make his work one of the great human operas of all time. The piece has none of the ingredients for an international company. (How could one possibly cast roles such as the Caterpillar, Mosquito and Chief Hen with jet-setting stars?) So it was a surprise when the Royal Opera put on its first ever production of this opera in 1990, and sung in English, what is more. This week it has returned for its first revival, opening during the Covent Garden Proms week alongside more standard fare. Bill Bryden's production has been widely praised. It is abstract rather than literal, imaginative, poetic, humorous, all the things one wants a production of this delightful opera to be, except that its ingenuity sometimes gets the better of it. Janacek's aim is to show us how the natural world outlives us all, how it is unchangeable, ever-renewing. But this staging represents nature by a machine, in the form of large concentric circles turning like cog-wheels in a clock, which is difficult to reconcile with the opera's fundamentally green message. Perhaps the intention was to tell us that nature is timeless. If so, the visual metaphor makes the wrong connections. Best to set that aside and enjoy instead the way the production communicates a wide-eyed delight at the natural world and a high musical standard. In the duet between the Vixen and the Fox Janacek explores more touchingly than in any of his human operas the first faltering steps of young love. 'Do you smoke?', he asks her. 'No', she replies, with the defensive afterthought, 'not yet]' Lillian Watson is marvellous again as the Vixen, as spritely and youthful in movement as she is in voice, and she is partnered with a caring, confident, but never pushy Fox from Rita Cullis. Anthony Michaels-Moore sings well as the Forester, who is younger than usual. He seems a resourceful man, who would not be caught out by the playful antics of his young vixen; a degree of mature wisdom, of worldly depth is missing. Donald Adams as the Badger stood out among the animals, Robin Leggate's Schoolmaster and Roderick Earle's Poacher among the humans, because they managed to get more of the words across - a constant problem throughout the evening. It may be that Bernard Haitink will be able to balance words and music more effectively as the performances continue. The orchestral playing is already above average and Haitink has the gift for making this music release its immense human sympathy without lapsing into sentimentality. Ideally the opera does belong in a smaller theatre, where its scale would fit. But I would not for one moment wish to deprive the Royal Opera's audience of the opportunity to discover one of 20th-century opera's minor masterpieces. (There are further performances until July 10.) In Arthur Jacobs' Garsington piece on Thursday the director of Ariadne auf Naxos should have read Aidan Lang</p>

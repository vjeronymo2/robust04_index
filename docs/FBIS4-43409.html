			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan </F> Papazyan by unidentified correspondent in Istanbul; date not  given]    [Text] [TDN, TURKISH DAILY NEWS] What significance does it  have for Armenia to participate in the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council's meeting?    [PAPAZYAN] Rather than dwell on any particular significance  of Armenia's participation in these meetings, I want to  concentrate on the outcome of the meeting that has just been  held. It's well-known that some of the problems recently  discussed are of special interest to Armenia. For example, the  Karabakh problem had a place in the final communique of the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). It was stressed that  the problem cannot be brought to a conclusion through force of  arms but only in peace, through meetings and within the  framework of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE). The emphasis put on this made us feel positive  and happy.    [TDN] How would you evaluate the visit to Istanbul of  Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev at the invitation of  President Suleyman Demirel, and his meeting with the U.S.  Secretary of State?    [PAPAZYAN] It is a mistake to put any particular  interpretation on this. Everyone knows that there is the  possibility of bilateral -- or multilateral -- meetings and  discussions. This meeting has no special significance in our  eyes.    [TDN] From time to time officials from the Armenian  government are in Turkey for the Black Sea Economic Cooperation,  NATO or other reasons. Have the meetings between the Turkish  state and Armenian government officials helped improve  Armenian-Turkish relations?    [PAPAZYAN] The normalization and development of  Armenian-Turkish relations are as always a topic in our  bilateral meetings. For example we spoke about this Friday [10  June] in our meetings with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and  Ozdem Sanberk. I am hopeful that there will be some  developments soon. In Turkish-Armenian relations certain  conditions have been imposed by the Turkish side. Naturally,  efforts have to be made to put the problems which exist between  the two sides behind us. Obstacles to improved relations do  exist, but our meetings have taken place in an atmosphere of  cooperation.    [TDN] Could you say that the Karabakh issue is the only  obstacle to the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations?    [PAPAZYAN] Turkey ties the normalization of relations with  Armenia, and the establishment of diplomatic ties between the  two countries, to the solving of the Karabakh problem. That is,  the difficulties that exist can be put behind us when progress  is made towards a peaceful solution in Karabakh. However it is  necessary to say that, from our point of view, linking the  normalization of relations between our two countries to the  Karabakh issue is a mistake. It's true that there are problems  which have to be solved between the two countries and some  continuing sources of tension. But we do not think it useful to  make preconditions concerning the improvement of relations. The  normalization of relations between us has important  repercussions for the stability of the entire region.    [TDN] How do you perceive Turkey's having created a military  post in Erzurum which is directed at Nakhichevan and Karabakh  and that will be used in line with Turkey and CSCE's desire to  contribute to peacekeeping forces in Karabakh?    [PAPAZYAN] We haven't received an official request  concerning  this desire. Our government will evaluate any such request  whether from Turkey or any other country.    [TDN] It has been said for a long time in the Turkish press  that Armenia has opened its arms to the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan], or supports the PKK, or shelters them. Although we  know you have been asked this question very often, what can you  say on this subject?    [PAPAZYAN] I'm sick and tired of having to make a statement  on this topic. What I know is that my Turkish counterparts that  I meet at all levels have been aware that this is simply not  true. But what a pity it is that the Turkish press and media  always fuel Turkish public opinion with groundless suspicions  like this. In my opinion this hinders the normalization of  Turkish-Armenian relations. I don't wish to believe that the  Turkish press doesn't want the two countries to normalize their  relations. I would say that this business is Turkey's own  internal problem and that we have no intention of interfering in  Turkey's internal affairs in any way. How Turkey reaches a  solution on this issue doesn't interest us at all.</p>

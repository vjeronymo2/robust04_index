			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (5): Seat-belt warning is on - Airlines are experiencing turbulent conditions TURBULENCE has been a world-wide feature of the airline industry since the start of the 1990s. Australia's aviation sector has been no exception - although some of the bumps been peculiar to the region. First, on the domestic front, there has been the fall-out from deregulation. Liberalisation of the Australian airline industry took effect in October 1990, when route licensing restrictions and pricing constraints were removed for internal flights. Almost immediately, the two existing domestic carriers  -Ansett and Australian - confronted a new competitor in the shape of Compass, a start-up airline. Domestic air fares fell dramatically; cuts of as much as 70 per cent occurred on some routes, although the official estimate for the reduction in 'average fares' stood at around 30 per cent. Compass, however, was a short-lived incarnation. It failed first in December 1991, when lessors repossessed its aircraft, only to be reborn under new management in August 1992. Compass Mark Two died in March this year, when the receivers were called in, and the airline wound up. Three years on, then, deregulation has scarcely delivered what its proponents hoped for - and, with other fledgling airlines failing to take to the skies, recriminations surfaced in the wake of Compass' collapses. On one side, management was accused of negligence. On the other, there were allegations that government had reneged on a promise to protect new entrants; that domestic facilities were too congested to accommodate competitors; that more government-sponsored travel needed to be directed towards new carriers, and so on. In the short-term, the net result of this messy experiment has been to recreate a duopoly situation - against a background of fairly weak, and extremely price-sensitive, demand for air transport. According to the Department of Transport, domestic revenue passenger kilometres rose by 28.5 per cent between 1990 and 1991 when fares were tumbling, and then by just 3.24 per cent in 1992. Air fares, meanwhile, have increased - but only modestly. The Price Surveillance Authority calculates an increase of about seven per cent, during the June quarter which followed the second Compass collapse. 'Fares are still about five per cent lower than in the same period last year, and 23 per cent down in real terms on the pre-deregulation levels of September 1990,' says its chairman, Mr David Cousins. Airline executives support this sluggish picture. 'Traffic is slow-growing and people only respond to very low pricing,' comments Rodger Robertson, director of corporate planning at Qantas. But in spite of deregulation's failure to generate new domestic carriers, matters have not returned to the pre-1990 status quo. Last year, the government made a new attempt to 'revolutionise' the sector. This time, it talked of creating a common aviation market in Australia and New Zealand, while effectively doing away with the long-established divide between international routes, serviced by Qantas, and domestic routes, handled by Australian and Ansett. After some angst, the revised policy paved the way for government's sale of Australian to Qantas, and the beginnings of a privatisation process for the merged entity. Evidence of this tie-up is now clearly visible to any traveller: Qantas food has been appearing on internal flights for some months, for example, and the Australian name vanished from ticket counters and the like this month. On the privatisation front, meanwhile, British Airways came in as a 25 per cent shareholder in February, buying its stake for ADollars 665m. But the Qantas-Australian flight plan has not been trouble-free. Integration, notoriously difficult in the airline industry, has been slower and more costly than some had hoped. Qantas, although reporting a slim ADollars 32.9m profit after financing charges, took a ADollars 446.4m hit for costs and write-offs related to the merger in the year to end-June. Moreover, in August this year, John Ward, Qantas' veteran chief executive quit - and was replaced by James Strong, a Qantas director and former chief executive of Australian, who formally took up the reins this month. Finally, the next stage in the privatisation process, originally due to take place this autumn, has been delayed until the 1994-5 financial year. Meanwhile, over at Ansett, the first international flight took off in September, to Bali, and the airline - owned jointly by TNT, the transport group, and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation - has also accumulated rights to other parts of south-east Asia. Ansett, it should be noted, is not be the only new recipient of international route authorities. The International Air Services Commission has a clear policy of favouring new entrants in the international arena and that, in turn, has meant route awards for the likes of National Airlines, on the freight side, and for Australia-Air International, a untried passenger carrier. But on the trans-Tasman front, matters are largely in abeyance. Synchronising operating procedures, such as customs and immigration, between Australia and New Zealand has proved no simple task, and government negotiations are continuing. In the meantime, Ansett has decided against flying trans-Tasman routes at this stage. It will review its position when it gains access to more city pairs in November, and has a better grasp of the operational details of the single market. To an extent, the consolidation seems to be improving profitability. Ansett, for example, managed to deliver a ADollars 59.5m operating profit in the year to end-June, compared with a ADollars 91.2m loss last time round, although there was still a bottom-line deficit. Qantas also traded profitably in the first quarter of 1993-4, compared with a loss in the same period a year ago. Nevertheless, all the upheavals have produced additional capital requirements, in an industry which has already been drained by fare-discounting, at home and abroad, and by recessionary conditions. Both TNT and News Corporation have made clear that they would like to bring a new partner in at Ansett at some stage. Finally, there is the issue of foreign competition and bilateral relationships. On the one hand, some recent retrenchment - for example, by Houston-based Continental Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa - may ease conditions for remaining players. But two other large US carriers, United and Northwest, have had furious spats with the Australian authorities this year, over frequencies and traffic restrictions on Japan-Sydney portions of their US-Australia route authorities. Such rumpuses are a clear reminder of everyone's determination to claw out the maximum possible profit, in a generally depressed industry sector.</p>

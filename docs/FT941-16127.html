			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Clinton places environment on top in Gatt President Bill Clinton yesterday put environmental protection, anti-trust regulations and labour standards at the top of the agenda for future world trade negotiations. His stand drew applause from the European Commission in Brussels, where Mr Clinton held talks on the third day of his maiden presidential trip to Europe. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, followed up with a plea to Mr Clinton to support a global campaign for a carbon tax. Officials said the aim was to curb energy consumption and create new tax revenues to make labour cheaper in Europe. The need to create jobs was the principal theme of the meeting at the Commission. All sides described the talks as 'friendly and constructive', dispelling tensions caused last year over trade and policy toward Bosnia. Mr Clinton emphasised that the advanced economies of the US, Europe and Japan had 'common maladies', and could learn much from each other on how to tackle unemployment and promote economic growth. He looked forward to a further exchange of ideas at a 'jobs summit' this spring under the auspices of the Group of Seven countries. 'As we bring others into the orbit of global trade . . . we must ensure that their policies benefit the interests of their workers and our common interest in enhancing environmental protection throughout the globe,' Mr Clinton said. 'I believe that dealing with the environment creates jobs; it does not cost jobs if you do it in the right way. I think we now have about 20 years of evidence that supports that.' The president's new Gatt priorities will encourage France, where Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, recently called for the EU to push for protection against unfair foreign competition based on lower wages, currency rates and environmental standards. But it may disappoint critics at home who want more emphasis on dismantling barriers to foreign investment and greater EU market access. Those subjects were covered in separate talks between the Commission and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Brussels officials emphasised that it would not be easy to reach a deal on full liberalisation of public procurement contracts by April 15. The EU says it will withhold full liberalisation of telecommunications contracts deals until the issue of US contracts below the federal level is resolved.</p>

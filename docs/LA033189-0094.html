			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT LIMITS INSURERS' RISK ON HOME DAMAGE;  </P> <P> STATE JUSTICES RULE THAT COMPANIES MUST PAY ONLY WHEN POLICY COVERS PRIMARY  CAUSE OF LOSS  </P> <P> In a major victory for insurers, the state Supreme Court on Thursday limited  the ability of California homeowners to collect for property damage partially  caused by landslides, earthquakes or other natural disasters.  </P> <P> The justices held 5 to 2 that insurance companies must pay only when a policy  covers the "predominant" or primary cause of the damage.  </P> <P> Under most general, or so-called "all-risk" policies, coverage for disasters is  excluded. But some lower courts had held that homeowners could collect when  damage results from a combination of covered risks, such as negligent  construction, and uncovered risks, such as earthslides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impact on Homeowners  </P> <P> Attorneys in the case said the ruling will have broad impact among the state's  7 million homeowners -- most of whom hold the kind of general policy at issue.  Currently, there are thousands of claims, involving hundreds of millions of  dollars, that have been pending awaiting the decision.  </P> <P> But it will not affect those policyholders who have obtained coverage for  earthquakes and other disasters at an extra cost. And its impact is uncertain  on policies written in recent years that seek to specifically bar any claims  where a covered risk is not the prime cause, lawyers said.  </P> <P> Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, writing the majority opinion, said the rule the  court set forth will provide "a fair result within the reasonable expectations"  of both insurers and homeowners when damage results from multiple causes.  </P> <P> Justice Stanley Mosk, who dissented along with Justice Allen E. Broussard, said  the court should have held that coverage exists when both an included risk and  an excluded risk produce a loss and are independent of each other -- neither  setting the other in motion.  </P> <P> "The majority, I must acknowledge, have succeeded in reaching a clear result:  In this court, the insurer wins and the insureds lose. But they have failed to  offer a sound rationale in support (of the decision)," Mosk wrote.  </P> <P> David W. Rudy, an Oakland attorney representing the homeowners who brought the  case before the court, said, "The sad part about this decision, in terms of  general consumer impact, is that it imposes a tougher standard on the  policyholder. It will reduce the number of claims that would be paid."  </P> <P> Richard Norton of Los Angeles, a lawyer who has represented numerous property  holders in such cases, acknowledged that the new standard imposed by the court  will be "more difficult" for homeowners to meet.  </P> <P> "These policies were sold as 'all-risk' policies," he said. "Most people would  have thought they were insured in the event of a major catastrophe."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Less Oriented to Consumers'  </P> <P> The outcome was not too much of a surprise in view of the realignment of the  more conservative court, Norton said. "The California Supreme Court is less  oriented to consumers than it used to be," he said. "This is one of the  products of its change in philosophy."  </P> <P> But Susan M. Popik of San Francisco, lawyer for State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty  Co., the defendant in the case, hailed the decision, saying a contrary ruling  would have resulted in vastly higher premiums for homeowners, denying many of  them affordable coverage.  </P> <P> "There were tons of claims being filed in precisely these circumstances," she  said. "Where someone had a landslide, they argued that the cause was the  failure to properly construct, even though the landslide was clearly the  cause."  </P> <P> Ellis J. Horvitz of Encino, attorney for a number of insurance groups in the  case, said that had the court approved broader homeowner coverage in such  cases, insurers would have found it very difficult to meet claims in a  disaster. "The terrifying part was that if a major quake occurred, it would  have brought a lot of insurance carriers to their knees," he said.  </P> <P> The case was brought by Jack and Rita Garvey of Fairfax, Calif., who in 1977  bought an "all risk" homeowners policy from State Farm that specifically  excluded coverage for property loss resulting from earthquakes, landslides, mud  flow and volcanic eruption.  </P> <P> A year later they noticed that an addition to the home had begun to pull away  from the main structure and that there was damage to a deck and garden wall.  The couple sought payment from the insurer, but the company refused to pay,  saying the damage was caused by earth movement that was not covered in the  policy.  </P> <P> The Garveys then brought suit in San Francisco Superior Court, saying that  negligent construction, which was covered by the policy, was either the main  cause or contributing cause to the damage. A trial judge held that if negligent  construction contributed to the damage, the suit could proceed, regardless of  the effect of earth movement. Later, a jury awarded the couple $47,000 for  property damage and $1 million in punitive damages against the company.  </P> <P> The insurer took the case to a state Court of Appeal, which overturned the  damage award the couple had won. The appellate court in a 2-1 ruling said the  homeowners must prove that faulty construction was an independent cause of the  damage or that faulty construction set the damage in motion.  </P> <P> Lucas' opinion was joined by Justices Edward A. Panelli and David N. Eagleson  and retired Justice John A. Arguelles, participating by special assignment.  Justice Marcus M. Kaufman concurred in a separate opinion. The justices sent  the case back for retrial to see whether the covered risk -- negligent  construction -- was the predominant cause.  </P> <P> "If the earth movement was the (major) cause of the loss, then coverage would  be denied," Lucas wrote. "On the other hand, if negligence was the  (predominant) cause, then coverage exists."  </P></p>

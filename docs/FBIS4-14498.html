			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko has  warned against a crucial foreign policy review by the new  parliament. In an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine about the  first round of general elections, the minister pointed to a  polarization of views of the first group of 49 candidates who  had won parliamentary seats. "A radical shift either way will  not help consolidate our independence," he said.    Zlenko stressed that any crucial policy shift may cause a  similar change of heart towards Ukraine by the international  community.</p>

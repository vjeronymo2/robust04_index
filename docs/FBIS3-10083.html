For this reason, we have called Valle Governor Carlos  Holguin Sardi at this time of the morning, 0702 to be exact, to  ask him about the truth to television reports by the "TV Today"  and "AM-PM" newscasts. According to these two newscasts, the  U.S. troops that spent 60 days in Valle del Cauca Department  reportedly buried toxic waste.    Mr. Governor, good day. What is the basis for these  televised reports?    [Holguin Sardi] Good morning. Believe me, I am very  surprised by all of this. I was accompanied by Admiral Ross and  Major General Jesus Maria Vergara, commander of the Army's 3d  Division, in Juanchaco on Friday, and no one, absolutely no one,  expressed any concern or commented on any rumors or hearsay  about the report disseminated by the television newscasts. In  fact, television reporters were there, and I do not know when  they received such reports or why they failed to ask us about  them there. Had they asked us, we would have at least found out  about these claims. It seems that this is a new episode in the  soap opera revolving around the presence of U.S. soldiers in  Juanchaco. Nevertheless, the report is baseless. I repeat, no  one mentioned such a tale to me.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Governor, the engineers of the U.S. military  forces came to build a school, a clinic, and to help work on the  Juanchaco-Ladrilleros road. All of these projects were left  incomplete. Do you or the national government have a plan to  complete the projects so that the walls built by the U.S.  engineers -- who caused so much controversy by their very  presence -- will not be left abandoned?    [Holguin Sardi] The clinic needs plumbing and electrical  work; everything else is done. The Colombian Army and Navy,  which are building the nearby Juanchaco airstrip, will oversee  the completion of the work. The school is a bit behind  schedule. It needs plumbing and electrical work, as well as  part of the roof and the inside walls that divide the various  classrooms. About 80 percent of each of the two projects is  complete. As I already mentioned, the Army and Navy will be in  charge of completing the projects. It is estimated that 20 Navy  workers will finish off in one month what 60 soldiers did in  eight days in terms of building the school and the clinic.    [Arizmendi] Other media have reported that another  contingent  of U.S. troops will return to Colombia within two months to  conduct an operation similar to the one just completed in  Juanchacho. What do you know about this?    [Holguin Sardi] Absolutely nothing. After what has happened,  I do not believe there will be new similar experiments. The  fact that the deadline originally set in the agreement for this  project was not extended is an indication that there is no  interest in having U.S. troops return for this type of work in  Colombia.    [Arizmendi] After having described the report about possible  toxic wastes as a soap opera, will any action be taken to deny  this report?    [Holguin Sardi] Yes, it will be very important for the media  that obtained the report to remember where they got it from.  [Words indistinct] keeping the source a secret.  Notwithstanding, if any citizens know anything about this  report, it is very important for them to inform us about it in  order that we can conduct the relevant investigations on such a  terrifying and unpleasant story.    I repeat, however, I think it is only a soap opera. No one  in his right mind thinks that such a thing could happen. The  Pacific naval forces maintained very strict and complete  vigilance over the soldiers' activities. There were many  opportunities to oversee what they were doing. No one could  prove that they were doing something other than building the  school and the clinic. They were always concentrating on their  work. Therefore, I repeat, it is only a baseless rumor, a soap  opera. However, if we are informed about where, who, and how,  we would be willing to begin the relevant investigations.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bullough restates after shortfall Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, has been forced to restate its full-year results following the discovery of a Pounds 1.4m shortfall in the assets of a subsidiary. As a result the group yesterday reported restated audited pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.78m for the year to October 31 and earnings per share of 2.29p. The shares closed 12p lower at 161p. The shortfall was discovered in one of the branches of the group's General Refrigeration business. Investigations are under way to determine the exact nature of the loss. However, the company said that until the investigation was completed it was not known how much of the loss was represented by the misappropriation of assets nor how much might be recovered from insurers. A member of the branch accounting staff had been dismissed.</p>

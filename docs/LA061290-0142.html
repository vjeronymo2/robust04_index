			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS BATTLING RACE TRACK CONCERTS  </P> <P> Pat Howard tolerates the noise from the daily races at Los Alamitos Race Course  because he has to. He knew when he bought his home more than 20 years ago that  the horses and jockeys would be his neighbors.  </P> <P> But when singer Juice Newton and her entourage pulled into town for a gig at  the race track last month, the noise was more than he could take.  </P> <P> "I could understand every word Juice said when she talked to the crowd," said  Howard, a 23-year resident of Laurel Avenue, a housing tract across the street  from the track.  </P> <P> So Howard and some of his neighbors went to City Hall for help. Speaking at a  recent council meeting, residents of Laurel Avenue and surrounding streets  recounted how they couldn't hold a conversation in their homes during Newton's  concert and a previous one.  </P> <P> "We wanted no more concerts to be held," said Jim Young, who represents the  neighborhood group. But because of a loophole in a city ordinance, Young may  have no choice.  </P> <P> Ironically, the ordinance was intended to prohibit concerts at the race track.  It was passed more than nine years ago after then state Sen. Paul Carpenter  held a fund-raiser at the track that included a country-style barbecue and  band, and the neighbors complained about the noise. The City Council decided  that all future events not related to the track would require a conditional use  permit.  </P> <P> But Juice Newton and the previous concerts were part of a promotional package  for the racing, City Manager Darrell Essex told the current City Council. Her  show was included in the regular price for admission to the park. Because, it  was a "race-related" event, there was little the council could do, Essex  explained.  </P> <P> "We sent a letter suggesting that they would have to decrease (noise) or apply  for a conditional use permit," Essex said. But enforcing that request might be  tough, officials admitted.  </P> <P> The neighborhood group is confident that this ordinance is all they needed to  fight the concerts.  </P> <P> "Our understanding going back to 1980 is that there are to be no more  concerts," Howard said. "It was a violation of an agreement."  </P> <P> The residents and race track officials are trying to reach some accord. During  a recent meeting, race track officials agreed to adjust the volume during the  next concert, on June 23. They will also try to reduce the echo effect produced  in the stands by turning the speakers in a different direction. In return, the  residents agreed not to try to prevent the next concert.  </P> <P> But residents insist that even the measures to tone down the noise will not be  good enough. "I just don't think it (lowering the noise to an acceptable level)  can be done," Howard said.  </P> <P> During their meetings, it was also tentatively agreed that if the neighbors  "can hear the music, there will be no more concerts," Young said.  </P> <P> But track general manager Don Galloway said that with attendance figures  skyrocketing by up to 3,000 people on the nights of the promotions, "I would  like to see if we couldn't continue with it. It is very popular."  </P> <P> If the music is still too loud for the residents, he said, "we will address  that when we come to it. We don't know what the city might want us to do."

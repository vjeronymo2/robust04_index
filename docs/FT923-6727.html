			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UN envoy leaves Iraq without deal Mr Jan Eliasson, a UN envoy, said yesterday he had not been able to finalise a new agreement for relief operations in Iraq after five days of talks and was leaving Baghdad to report to UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Iraq has paralysed UN relief operations since the last pact expired on June 30 by not issuing enough visas for UN staff. Mr Eliasson said no further meetings were planned at present, although there were 'still major issues remaining'. Iraq yesterday called on Mr Boutros Ghali to prevent the US, France and Britain from barring Iraqi aircraft over the south of the country, Reuter reports. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Saeed al-Sahaf said the western move was a grave threat to international peace and security in the region and designed to divide Iraq on an ethnic basis.</p>

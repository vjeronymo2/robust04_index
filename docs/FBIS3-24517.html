Dotsenko, Marine Hydrophysics Institute, </F> Ukrainian Academy of Sciences; UDC 551.466.81]    [Abstract] The existence of vertically spaced local maxima  of the Brunt-Vaisala frequency N(z), playing the role of  waveguides for IW, usually leads to the appearance of anomalous  frequency dispersions (AFD). This problem is examined using data  for a region of the Atlantic to the northwest of Great Britain  where the upper waveguide corresponds to the seasonal pycnocline  and the lower waveguide to the principal pycnocline. The  existence of several pycnoclines and extended layers with  quasiconstant N(z) values is characteristic of the North  Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Black Sea. An anomalous frequency  dispersion of IW is expressed in the appearance of local extrema  of group velocities in the range of relatively large wave  numbers. This is attributable to the characteristics of vertical  density stratification in the ocean. The characteristics of such  dispersion in an ocean with several pycnoclines are examined.  Its influence on the vertical structure, evolution and  generation of wave fields is analyzed. Manifestations of the  anomalous frequency dispersion of internal waves in real wave  processes are discussed. Among the aspects of the problem  examined are: energy exchange between waveguides, BKW  approximation for internal waves in ocean with two pycnoclines;  cluster character of dispersion; Airy wave packets; IW  generation.

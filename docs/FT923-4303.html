			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Rover enforces immediate cut in list prices ROVER is cutting the list prices of most of its cars by up to 7 per cent with immediate effect to introduce greater 'transparency' into its new car pricing. The reductions will not necessarily cut the price of a new Rover car to the customer as the company is simultaneously cutting dealer profit margins from 17 per cent to 10 per cent, which will reduce dealers' scope for discounting. The move is expected to cut customer 'haggling' with dealers and extends the system introduced experimentally earlier this year for the Rover 800 executive car range. The cuts are expected to bring list prices more into line with actual transaction prices and reduce uncertainty over new car prices. The Rover initiative follows initial steps taken by Vauxhall late last year to cut dealer profit margins from 17 per cent to 10 per cent on three of its new model ranges, the Astra, Frontera and Carlton. At the time Vauxhall said that the industry and car buyers alike would benefit if other manufacturers adopted a similar approach. List prices for new cars in the UK have been far out of line with actual transaction prices for some time, but the confusion has been exacerbated during the recession with most carmakers launching a series of discounting and price-cutting campaigns, often in order to sell old stock. Rover said that its changes would reduce the list prices of some its models by more than Pounds 1,000. The list price of a Rover 420GSi will be reduced by Pounds 1,082 to Pounds 14,120, while the price of a Metro 1.1S will be cut by Pounds 753 to Pounds 8,550. Rover yesterday attacked carmakers such as Ford and Vauxhall for confusing customers 'by offering limited discounts and other short-term incentives on some stock, while at the same time recently increasing list prices'. In spite of this attack Rover admitted that its dealers will also be mounting 'special campaigns' to sell currently held stock. These campaigns are being undertaken as part of radical changes that Rover plans for its system of stocking and distributing cars in the UK. The aim is to cut the number of vehicles in the pipeline and Rover believes the new system could produce savings totalling up to Pounds 80m a year for it and its dealers. From the end of the month it is opening a group of seven wholly-owned regional distribution centres, which will hold most of its stock of new cars in the UK and will remove this function from the dealer network. The new distribution process means that Rover dealers will no longer carry bulk stocks in their compounds, but will call up cars as they are ordered from regional distribution centres. The dealers will carry only showroom stock and test vehicles. The focus of cost-cutting in the motor industry, which previously has chiefly concerned manufacturing and engineering, is turning to distribution.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings are revised down at Siam Cement SIAM Cement, the largest cement producer in Thailand, yesterday disclosed that its audited net profit in 1992 was substantially lower than the unaudited profit figure announced last month. The audited, unconsolidated figures showed net profit of Bt3.56bn (Dollars 142m), more than Bt400m below the previously announced sum of Bt3.98bn, and also below the Bt3.89bn made in 1991. The discrepancy is largely due to higher operating expenses. According to Siam Cement's audited statement, operating costs were Bt5.38bn in 1992, higher than the unaudited figure of Bt4.96bn. A Siam Cement official told Reuters that the revision of costs was partly related to investment in its new Khao Wong plant, one of the world's largest cement factories; it cost nearly Bt10bn and has a capacity of 3.6m tonnes a year. Investors were disappointed with Siam Cement's 1992 performance even before yesterday's announcement. Yesterday, the shares closed unchanged at Bt488 in a rising market. The cement shortages which characterised the Thai construction boom of the late 1980s have given way to overcapacity in the industry, with newcomer TPI Polene investing heavily in new plant. Demand for cement in Thailand is now estimated to be growing at a modest 4 to 5 per cent a year, after 18 per cent only a year ago, but is likely to be boosted by numerous projects to improve transport and other infrastructure, including the construction of a new Bangkok airport, in the years ahead. Siam Cement's unconsolidated sales in 1992 slipped to Bt33.35bn from Bt33.80bn in 1991. The company also declared an unchanged final dividend yesterday of Bt9 a share, making a maintained total of Bt18 for the year.</p>

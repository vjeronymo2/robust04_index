			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand yesterday invited Burmese Foreign Minister  Ohn Gyaw on an official visit to Bangkok as guest of the Foreign  Ministry. The visit is separate to that for the ASEAN meeting  in July.    "We extended the invitation to Burmese Foreign Minister U  Ohn  Gyaw to visit Thailand, and hope to meet him in July at the  meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers," said Foreign Ministry  spokesman Suwit Simasakun after hour-long talks between Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Burmese counterpart.    Thailand also informed Burma members of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations were considering its status at the ASEAN  foreign ministers meeting due to take place in Bangkok, he said.    Sqn Ldr Prasong said his visit was not intended simply to  extend an invitation to Rangoon but was aimed at explaining the  whole ASEAN process and to assess the situation in Burma.    He said Burma had given a "very" positive response to his  approach for Rangoon's participation at the July meeting.    It not has not been decided what status Burma should be  offered in joining the meeting since Thailand has to consult  further with other ASEAN members, the Foreign Minister said.    ASEAN senior officials last month raised no objections to  Thailand inviting Burma as a "guest of the host country".    Burma also expressed interest in Thailand's initiative to  organise a 10-nation meeting which would not be under the  framework of ASEAN, said Sqn Ldr Prasong.    The meeting plans to bring together the six ASEAN countries,  three Indochinese states--Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam--and Burma.  The idea was raised by Sqn Ldr Prasong in an attempt to speed up  the integration of the 10 Southeast Asian nations.    The Foreign Minister arrived in Rangoon yesterday for a  two-day visit in the capacity of chairman of the ASEAN Standing  Committee and Thailand's foreign minister.    On bilateral issues, the two sides agreed to hold a second  meeting of the Thai-Burmese Joint Commission in September in  Bangkok, the spokesman said.    Sqn Ldr Prasong said Thailand and Burma also agreed to  discuss in detail the construction, use and management of a  bridge across the Moei River from Mae Sot in Tak province to  Burma's Myawaddy.    A technical team will be discussed as soon as possible to  settle all details to facilitate construction, he said.    The Cabinet early this year approved construction of the  bridge.    Burma has agreed to reconsider Thailand's request to reduce  the sentences of Thai prisoners, said Mr Suwit.    Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday also held talks with Gen Than  Shwe,  chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and  SLORC secretary Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt.</p>

At an NDS-NA  constituent congress vote here today, Cernak received 136 votes  out of a total of 137 cast. Cernak, former chairman of the  Slovak National Party (SNS), was the only candidate for the  post. Delegates to the constituent conference of the National  Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) decided that the  party, which declared itself a conservative one, would seek  admission to the European Democratic Union (EDU).    According to preliminary consultations, the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) and some conservative parties of the  Visegrad group countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland  and Slovakia), which are EDU members, would support the  newly-established party in its effort.    Cernak said the party intended to cooperate with Czech  members of the EDU -- the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS)  and the government coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA).  The NDS-NA would run for the forthcoming early elections in a  coalition with the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR) of  ex-Foreign Minister Milan Knazko and the Slovak Democratic Union  (DUS) of Premier Jozef Moravcik. Negotiations are underway with  the Greens Party on its participation in the pre-election  coalition bloc.    The party's primary goal is preparation of coupon  privatisation. Privatisation Minister Milan Janicina said he  sought to speed up privatisation in such a way that it became  irreversible. Coupon privatisation is to concern 80 to 100  billion crowns (2.6 to 3.3 billion USD) worth of property.</p>

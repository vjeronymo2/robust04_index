He has actually made himself available  to pick up checks from prospective donors who needed his encouragement.  </P> <P> Jim has appeared on our telethon several times to ask his fans and other  viewers to make a pledge to UNCF. Many athletes who are donors to UNCF today  are doing so in part because Jim Hill asked them to.  </P> <P> VINCENT BRYSON,  </P> <P> Development Director,  </P> <P> United Negro College Fund, Inc.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Editor's note: The preceding three letters were received by The Times after  having been sent to Jim Hill's attorney, Ed Hookstratten.  </P> <P> </P></p>

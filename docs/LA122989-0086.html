			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HEALY MAKES 41 SAVES AS ISLANDERS WIN 5TH IN ROW  </P> <P> Coach Al Arbor of the New York Islanders believes in giving credit where credit  is due, and after his team beat the St. Louis Blues, 3-2, Thursday night in New  York, he thought all of it belonged to goalie Glenn Healy.  </P> <P> "He won the game by himself," Arbour said after Healy made 41 saves in helping  the Islanders extend their winning streak to five games.  </P> <P> Pat LaFontaine provided the offense with his third consecutive two-goal game  and added an assist as the Islanders continued their home domination of the  Blues. St. Louis is 4-22-9 at Nassau Coliseum.  </P> <P> LaFontaine tied the game, 1-1, at 17:29 of the first period, and Alan Kerr put  the Islanders ahead to stay at 6:35 of the second.  </P> <P> North Stars 1, Blackhawks 1 -- Denis Savard scored late in the second period at  Chicago to give the Blackhawks a tie with the North Stars in a game preceded by  a seven-minute brawl.  </P> <P> The North Stars took a 1-0 lead at 7:53 on Neal Broten's goal.  </P> <P> The disturbance broke out midway through the pregame warmup when Chicago's  Wayne Van Dorp and Minnesota's Shane Churla began fighting near the penalty  benches. Players from both teams quickly joined the melee.  </P></p>

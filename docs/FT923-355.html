			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Sheffield censured over student games THE government's watchdog on public spending has severely criticised Sheffield City Council for failing to monitor and manage last year's World Student Games, held in the city. The games unexpectedly lost Pounds 10.4m after the council had budgeted Pounds 5m of public funds to cover a shortfall of income. Mr Gordon Sutton, the district auditor responsible for monitoring the council's spending, says those running the games failed to install proper systems of financial control and had no idea of the scale of impending losses only weeks before the games took place in July. The games failed to achieve expected revenue from television rights, commercial sponsorship, merchandising and ticket sales. Sharp cutting of costs as the shortfall became apparent led to some loss of control. One economy measure - to cut resources in the box office - resulted in it becoming impossible to reconcile ticket sales with cash receipts. The report deals only with the running of the games themselves. Capital costs of more than Pounds 140m for an athletics stadium came out of borrowings and will be paid back over several decades from local taxes. The report comes as the council contemplates up to 800 redundancies to eliminate a potential Pounds 7m overspend on its budget of more than Pounds 700m. Mr Mike Bower, leader of the Labour-controlled council, last night refused to link the losses on the games with the job cuts, saying the budgetary problem could just as well have come from overspending on education, housing or cleansing. The council will consider the report on Friday, when it will go into secret session to consider a confidential document by Mrs Pamela Gordon, its chief executive, on the role of Mr Ray Gridley, Sheffield's director of housing. Mr Gridley was seconded to run the games after the council took on their management in 1990. Previously, the idea was to keep the games at arm's length, with the company Universiade GB set up specially to run them. But the company had constant funding problems as it struggled to win sponsorship. Mr Sutton says council officers failed to set up systems to monitor Mr Gridley, and he unintentionally misled councillors about how well things were going. There was then a failure to press for more detail. Mrs Gordon says in her own report on the games, also published last night, that the line between optimism and over-optimism is sometimes difficult to draw. Mrs Gordon said last night that she saw no reason to resign but would await councillors' reactions at Friday's meeting. Mr Gridley said he did not accept all Mr Sutton's findings and that the positive achievements of the games should be 'included in the balance'.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Treasury stalls Tube gates deal London Underground is attempting to win Treasury approval for a Pounds 4m deal to lease automatic access gates for 12 of its busiest stations but has yet to reach an agreement on the financing terms. This is the second time within a month that a London Underground proposal to bring in private finance to pay for investments has met Treasury objections. A Pounds 500m deal to lease 100 trains for the Northern Line from ABB Transportation has also run into difficulties with Treasury rules. The latest deal involves a proposal from Westinghouse Cubic, a maker of revenue collection and control systems, to supply automatic gates for busy stations on the Underground including Harrow-on-the-Hill, Uxbridge, Whitechapel, Hammersmith, Balham and Morden. The others are East Ham, Edgware, Tooting Broadway, Gants Hill, Leyton and Plaistow. Treasury talks are understood to have run into problems over the transfer of risk to Westinghouse Cubic. The Underground is believed to have suggested that payments be linked to the number of passengers using the stations, but the Treasury wanted it tied to the success of the gates in reducing fraud. London Underground said that if agreement on the leasing deal could not be reached, it would fund the project from its own resources if forced to. It was, however, hopeful of reaching Treasury agreement. London Underground is keen to extend the use of gates to combat fraud, which costs it Pounds 30m a year. The government has attempted for several years to persuade the private sector to finance public transport infrastructure schemes, but with only limited success. A private finance panel was set up last autumn to identify promising projects and remove blockages to implementation.</p>

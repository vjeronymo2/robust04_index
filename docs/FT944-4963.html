			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Pillar Prop at Pounds 34,000 and makes acquisition Pillar Property Investments, the investment and development company which joined the stock market in August, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 34,000, the purchase of a shopping centre and a new director, writes Simon London. The result for the six months to September 30 was struck after charging Pounds 2.17m interest on loan stock which was repaid on flotation. Mr Raymond Mould, chairman, said Pillar had moved strongly into profit since then. The company did not publish comparative half-year figures but in the nine months to the end of March pre-tax profits were Pounds 744,000. Pillar also announced the acquisition of the Fairhill Shopping Centre in Ballymena, Northern Ireland for Pounds 11.5m, through its joint venture with SITQ Immobilier, the Canadian investment fund. The joint venture has now spent Pounds 62m on shopping centres out of a potential budget of Pounds 250m. Mr Mould added that Pillar was in advanced negotiations for the acquisition of a number of other investment properties. Mr Nicholas Sheehan will join the board in January following the departure of Mr Robert Maxted, property director, in October. Until March, Mr Sheehan was chief executive of London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the development company.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A PRICELESS 'LOOT' COMES TO S.D. REP  </P> <P> It's a wicked world we live in. And don't the characters in "Loot" enjoy every  wicked moment in it?  </P> <P> Joe Orton's farce about Hal and Dennis, two polite young bank robbers who use  Hal's soon-to-be-buried mother's coffin to stash their cash, is one of those  comedies that try the soul.  </P> <P> These fellows have no redeeming qualities, and you know you shouldn't laugh  when Dennis trips over a glass eye that slips out of the embalmed body, but, by  then, Orton has you so wired into his weird sense of humor that it would be  downright painful to resist.  </P> <P> A sterling production of this black comedy is playing at the San Diego  Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Stage through Sept. 8. It is directed by Walter  Schoen with a clarity that makes the actors' performances sparkle.  </P> <P> If you don't see characters you love, you will certainly see reflections of  public characters that you love to loathe.  </P> <P> If the humor must be justified, one can point out that Orton's target is  hypocrisy -- a commodity that has not diminished since Orton wrote the play a  quarter century ago.  </P> <P> "We must keep up appearances" is the key phrase in the play.  </P> <P> And there's piety, too. But this piety is like the "piety" we hear today from  adulterous evangelists or sanctimonious politicians most interested in  fattening their own wallets. It is only word deep.  </P> <P> In "Loot," the Bible-quoting nurse, Fay -- exquisitely played by perky and  perfectly coiffed Diana Castle -- is a patient-killer out for her 8th husband  in 10 years. The blonde Castle has the wholesome look of Doris Day, but Fay is,  if anything, Doris Day's evil twin. As soon as Hal's mother is in her coffin,  she has her eyes on Hal's father, a new widower.  </P> <P> The widower, played by Maury Cooper with a straight and narrow vigor that makes  him the center of the storm that surrounds him, is the only one in the play to  respect authority and religion. But even this high-minded gentleman is  eminently blackmailable. He is so threatened by the nurse's supposed claim to  his wife's money that he promises to propose to the nurse on the way to the  cemetery just to get it back.  </P> <P> Jon Matthews masterfully finds a way to lend shades of feeling to the unfeeling  Hal. He exudes a delicious attitude just in the way he listens -- you know by  the look on his face when someone is giving him a line. And as Dennis, Hal's  doleful partner in crime, master pratfaller Bruce McKenzie doesn't disappoint.  </P> <P> But the yummiest part belongs to Truscott, the detective masquerading as a  water board inspector because, as a water board inspector, he doesn't need the  search warrant no one will give him to pursue these crimes.  </P> <P> Tom Oleniacz has a great time with Orton's parody of a detective, out-Holmesing  Sherlock and out-Columboing Columbo. How does Truscott guess that Fay killed  one of her previous husbands in a seaside resort hotel? When he shook her hand  and felt the salty erosion on one of her rings . . . well, you'll just have to  hear the clever exposition for yourself.  </P> <P> A witty technical team supports this excellent cast. Thomas Buderwitz wisely  built an elegant, tastefully furnished set that fills just half of the Rep's  stage and creates an intimate feel. Emelle Holmes did the eye-catching,  stylishly bright costumes, Diane Boomer the fine lighting, Lawrence Czoka the  parody of a sanctimonious sound design.  </P> <P> If a subtle sadness radiates beneath the humor here, it comes because Orton  knew something of the violence that can lurk beneath good manners. And, sadly,  the price of his own fame was to be murdered by his longtime mentor, companion  and lover, Kenneth Halliwell, at age 34 in 1967, soon after writing "What the  Butler Saw" and just two years after writing "Loot."  </P> <P> Halliwell, who at one time co-wrote novels with Orton, was evidently jealous of  Orton's fame and killed himself right after the murder.  </P> <P> Love and hate, fame and jealousy, lies and truth: Orton knew these things were  inextricably intertwined in this most imperfect of worlds. In "Loot," a  masterly contrast between good manners and bad deeds, he allows us to look and  laugh at how life's contradictions intertwine. But, slyly, this master of farce  doesn't allow us to forget the sometimes deadly consequences of the mix.  </P> <P> "LOOT"  </P> <P> By Joe Orton. Director is Walter Schoen. Set by Thomas Buderwitz. Costumes by  Emelle Holmes. Lighting by Diane Boomer. Sound by Lawrence Czoka. Stage manager  is Julie A. Moore. With Maury Cooper, Diana Castle, Jon Matthews, Bruce  McKenzie, Tom Oleniacz, Paul James Kruse and Suzanne Schefke.  </P></p>

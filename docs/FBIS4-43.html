			<p>The      following summaries highlight information on the security  situation from articles that appeared in the Algiers and Paris  French-language press.      'Afghan' Smugglers from Maghnia Group on Trial      According to EL WATAN of 13 February and LE SOIR D'ALGERIE of 14  February, the July 1993 arrest of Oumansour Lakhdar has now led to  the arrest of Bouzi Boumediene and to the dismanteling of the  Maghnia Group, which operated along the Moroccan- Algerian border,  in the Sidi Bel-Abbes Wilaya.  In addition to smuggling weapons, the  group helped 'Afghan' Algerians re-enter the country clandestinely  and then trained them in subversion and urban guerilla warfare.  The  newspapers reported that 55 members of the group were charged with  the formation of an armed terrorist group, possession and sale of  military weapons and explosives, and attacks on state security.  Of  those charged, 21 are in custody, 22 are still at large, and 12 are  out on bail.      According to ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 15 February, Maghnia Group  member Boumediene Bouzi has been sentenced to eight years in prison  and the forfeiture of his civil rights for five years.  Bouzi was  charged with assisting the clandestine return of 'Afghan' Algerians  and using his motorcycle to smuggle weapons, some of which were  discovered in the Boukanoun mosque along the Algerian-Moroccan  border near the Moroccan village of Ahfir.  According to LE SOIR,  investigators found 45 kg of potassium chlorate, 20 sticks of  gelignite (explosives), and 180 meters of detonator wire in the  mosque and in a cache near Oued-Kiss.  Lakhdar's arrest also  reportedly led police to another arms cache near Oued-Kiss  consisting of two Uzi submachine guns, a Scorpio submachine gun  (made in Israel) equipped with a silencer, a 6-mm pistol, a  transmitter, and binoculars.  The ALGER REPUBLICAIN article further  stated that Mustapha Lahsani, Bachir Laalaj, and Mohamed Lakbir Dadi  were sentenced to three years in prison, Salah Kheireddine to 18  months' imprisonment, and Abdelkader Fadal to one year in jail.  (Fadal had been sentenced to death in an earlier trial in absentia.)  Ten others were condemned to three years prison without possibility  of parole, while 18 individuals were acquitted.      Security Situation in Blida      EL WATAN and LIBERTE of 21 March reported that the "tense"  situation in Blida was beginning to subside following an "energetic"  operation by security forces in the region.  According to the  LIBERTE article, armed Islamists had fostered a climate of fear  among the town's residents, imposing their own rules of conduct,  such as mandatory wearing of the hijab and a ban on smoking.  Some  citizens downplayed these reports, stating that "rumors have been  blown out of proportion.  Initially people panicked, but today women  are becoming more confident.  My women colleagues continue to dress  normally."      Both LIBERTE and EL WATAN reported that on 19 March the People's  National Army moved into Blida.  According to the LIBERTE article,  "it seemed as though security services in the absence of the  government had taken things into their own hands."  EL WATAN  described Blida as completely controlled by police and army: all  intersections were monitored by the army and all stores were  officially ordered to close.  According to the EL WATAN article, the  fact that newspapers have reappeared is an indication that the  situation has normalized.      On 6 April, Paris daily LE MONDE reported the comments of several  eyewitnesses to events in Blida around 20 March.  According to the  LE MONDE report, Islamists began imposing orders in December, for  example, ordering transport companies to separate men and women or  have their vehicles burned.  One witness recounted that the military  threatened people over loudspeakers to "denounce Islamists who had  painted slogans on the walls."  A few nights later, military units,  nicknamed "the parachutists" arrived in force from bases in Laghouat  and Biskra.  Another witness added that these soldiers broke down  doors of those "too afraid to open them."  She added that six young  people taken from her building by force were found dead the  following day, some "riddled with bullets," others tortured.  According to the LE MONDE article, this "major military blow" could  have been to revenge the death of six officers killed 18 March, or  to "prepare" for the visit of Interior Minister Selim Saadi to Blida  on 22 March.  According to a doctor quoted in LE MONDE, "if you call  people living in Blida they will say nothing.  Citizens think their  phone lines are tapped.  Officially nothing happened."  (For  additional reporting, see 94AFO145D "Life in Blida; Citizens Held  Hostage," in the JPRS Near East/South Asia Report.)      New Type of Street Killers      EL WATAN of 9 March reported that a new type of "young killer"  has emerged.  Security services recently arrested high school  students who are reportedly implicated in "terrorist" acts and who  belong to armed groups operating in the outskirts of Algiers.  The  "new breed" of killers are described as "inconspicuous,"  approximately 16 to 22 years old, and generally fashionably dressed.  In several cases under investigation, the age of the killers is  rather young.  Asselah Ahmed, head of the fine arts school, and his  son were killed by two "terrorists' between 15 and 18, according to  witnesses.  After the killing, the 'terrorists' could not be  distinguished from other students and were able to enter the school  and disappear.  In another case, security services arrested high  school students in Kharchela who had planted a bomb in their own  schoolyard.  An assassination victim, Vincent Grau, was also  reportedly killed by a 15 to 18 year old boy.

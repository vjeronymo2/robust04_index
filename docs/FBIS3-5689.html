			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a bid to look at the present state and future of  the business community that is under pressure to "change" itself  following the decision by Keidanren [Japan Federation of  Economic Organizations] to arrange corporate contributions, the  MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a written poll in mid-February of 50  key businessmen and compiled results of the poll on 5 March.  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN has received answers from 34 of the  businessmen polled, and 60 percent of the respondents clearly  indicated a preference in the direction of banning corporate  contributions. More than 90 percent of the leading businessmen  surveyed supported the Keidanren's decision to stop arranging  corporate contributions. Asked to which political parties they  wanted to contribute, a majority of the businessmen surveyed  chose a plurality of parties from among the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Japan New  Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger]. In general, the leading  businessmen surveyed supported the four political parties. The  results of the poll revealed the position of the business  community, which has no choice but to deal with the realities of  funding requirements, while acknowledging the need for a change  in the relationship between politics and money.    Asked to comment on Keidanren's decision to halt the  arrangement of corporate contributions, a majority of 31 leading  businessmen "supported" it while two leading businessmen,  including an executive of Keidanren, "did not support" it.    In the poll, 25 key businessmen said that the "cause of  corporate contributions to safeguard freedom and a market  economy," which the business community has advocated, "is still  valid, but has lost significance." Five business leaders said  the "cause has disappeared completely." In this way, nearly 90  percent of the key businessmen said "the cause has either  disappeared or lost significance."    Asked whether corporate contributions should be abolished or  continued, a total of 21 key businessmen, or 60 percent of the  leading businessmen polled, said that "corporate contributions  should be abolished immediately," or "they should be abolished  after a certain period of time has elapsed." But eight leading  businessmen said the "business community should make a certain  amount of corporate contributions." The rest said they wanted  to reserve comment.    Asked how political funds should be raised in the future, 21  leading businessmen said they should be raised through a  combination of public fund raising and individual contributions,  whereas 13 key businessmen said they should be raised by "a  combination of public fund raising, individual contributions,  and corporate contributions."    Asked which political parties they supported, about 70  percent of the leading businessmen polled said they supported a  plurality of parties from among the LDP, Shinseito, the Japan  New Party, and Sakigake, but only two leading businessmen  supported the LDP, with eight businessmen declining to answer  the question. Thus, the results of the poll showed that with  the emergence of new conservative parties, it has become  difficult for the businessmen to support one specific political  party. Twenty-five key businessmen, or more than 70 percent of  them, expressed their support for the Hosokawa cabinet.    Asked to which political parties they would contribute for  the time being, 10 businessmen said they would contribute to the  LDP and Shinseito, whereas eight businessmen said they would  contribute to the Japan New Party and Sakigake, while seven  businessmen showed their eagerness to contribute to the  Democratic Socialist Party. Almost no businessmen expressed an  intention to contribute to a plurality of political parties; 17  businessmen "declined to answer the question."    Asked what they thought of the future of corporate  contributions, a majority of 30 businessmen believed they would  decrease. Asked about the transparency of corporate  contributions, four leading businessmen were pessimistic, saying  "their transparency will remain unchanged."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Aspiration Party [NAP] leader Chawalit  Yongchaiyut, admitting yesterday the current political situation  is unstable, said it may be time for a political change.    The Interior Minister said his NAP was expected to meet  today  to assess the situation and renew its role in the coalition.    The NAP has always supported the coalition, he said, but the  situation is fluid and so the NAP will discuss if the situation  poses an obstacle to the party's continued participation in the  coalition.</p>

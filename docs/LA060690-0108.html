			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gulfstream Developing Jet Noise Reducer: Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. is  developing an engine noise reduction device that will make older jet aircraft  quieter and more fuel-efficient, company Chairman Allen Paulson said.  </P> <P> The device, which will be attached to the rear of the aircraft, reduces engine  noise by slowing velocity from the tailpipe. Paulson said he has applied for a  patent on the device, and production could begin in 1 1/2 to two years. The  device is being designed not only for Gulfstream's older G-II and G-III  corporate jet aircraft but also for commercial jets.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Fashion: Haute couture - the editors have their say - Are designer clothes worth the expense? As the spring shows are unveiled, Avril Groom seeks the commentators' views on the industry The press has been writing off couture for the past decade, declaring its style and prices irrelevant to modern life. Last week this gilded-salon industry had a chance to prove it still has a role when it unveiled its spring shows. For their views on the role and future of haute couture, I asked the fashion professionals, the top international editors whose job it is to look, assess and and write about the designers and their offerings? Here a small group of editors is interviewed on the role and future of couture. They were asked which designers and ideas are important, and which are their personal favourites. Most, as you can see from the sketches below, prefer to wear black clothes, at least during the day. And they all agree that the benefits of dressing well more than justify the cost. Janie Samet, fashion editor, Le Figaro: Couture is about research and imagination, not commercial trends. If it looks like ready-to-wear it is against the spirit. Couture should be good for the morale. Jacques Lang, the French minister of culture, wants to protect couture as a unique craft metier. Designers: Chanel's clothes for modern women, Ungaro's fabrics and Lacroix's fantasy. Ideas: pastels, white and the move away from grunge. Choice: St Laurent's and Balmain's tailoring and I am fascinated by Ungaro. Jackie Modlinger, fashion director, Daily Express: Couture represents the past and a dying lifestyle. Trends come from ready-to-wear but media demand for the fantasy created by couture shows is insatiable and the houses need the publicity. Accessory ideas from shows often take off. Designers: Lacroix, Versace, Chanel. Idea: Directoire dresses, short skirts, high heels, lacy or silver tights. Choice: a St Laurent 'smoking', a Lacroix black lace dress and a Dior frockcoat. Alexandra Shulman, editor, British Vogue: Designers develop technically and without restraint in couture which is where ideas germinate. But it is having to change and there is now a blurring with top ready-to-wear. Versace's couture can be ordered through some of his shops. Designers: Versace's modernity, Valentino's influential wearability. Ideas: softer tailoring, layers, short skirts, metallics. Choice: a very simple day-suit from one of a number of designers. Suzy Menkes, fashion editor, International Herald Tribune: For a great designer couture is not just a private fantasy but expresses the artistic soul in a way impossible for ready-to-wear because of the tremendous craftsmanship involved. Most exciting fabric innovations start in couture. Designers: Lacroix - very strong, the intricate work almost magical. Chanel - Lagerfeld goes back to suits and clever cocktail frocks that clients love. Valentino - wonderful lightness of hand. Ideas: a wave of prettiness. Choice: I do not view fashion personally. Franca Sozzani, editor, Italian Vogue: Couture gives a designer the freedom to use his imagination, to reveal his dream in the form of a show. Designers: Lacroix is witty and unexpected, Lagerfeld is a huge influence and Versace is making couture modern. Ideas: pastels and pleats. Choice: the new romantic femininity but an individual mix from different designers. Anna Wintour, editor, American Vogue: Couture means the luxury to experiment. Wearability is not the point but certain ideas filter through. The monastic, avant-garde look of ready-to-wear was needed as an antidote to 1980s style but couture has brought us this soft, sexy femininity which is exactly where fashion should be now. Designers: Lagerfeld, Versace, Lacroix. Ideas: long jackets, short soft skirts, higher heels, metallic fabrics under sheers. Choice: the above ideas, from various designers. Bernardine Morris, chief fashion critic, New York Times. Cardin's solution to the future is to show once a year as business is so global he has to cover two seasons at once. That would cut the costs but also the publicity, and ideas from designers such as Versace end up in the high street very fast. For others, such as Ungaro, couture is for fabric research. Designers: Versace - impressive and modern, Chanel - wearable suits for real life, Lacroix - marvellous craftsmanship. Choice: Wear any of it - no] Andrea Manet von Scheidlin, Paris editor, Textil-Wirtschaft: Paris is a sorcerer's kettle for fabric research. Shows and publicity are essential to help designers sign lucrative licensing deals. Advertising would cost far more. Designers: Lagerfeld, for innovative fabrics and ideas, St Laurent for real clothes. Ideas: pastels and metallics, asymmetric transparency, the lingerie look. Choice: I am neither slim nor young, so Givenchy - wearable and perfectly cut.</p>

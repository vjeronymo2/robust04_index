			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Vitro shares fall on disappointing results VITRO, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, posted net profits for 1991 of 573,000m pesos (Dollars 185m), a 19.3 per cent fall in real terms on 1990's figures. The results were worse than expected and Vitro's shares, traded on both the Mexican bolsa and the New York Stock Exchange, fell on the news, bringing other Mexican stocks down with it. The company said 1991's results were hurt by a one-off cost of refinancing the debt held by its US subsidiary Anchor Glass and a 52 per cent increase in income tax. Operating income, which excludes these factors, climbed to 1,295bn pesos, 0.2 per cent more in real terms than in 1990. Vitro said operating income had increased thanks to reduction in costs and increased productivity. The sales at Vitro rose to 9,281bn pesos, 0.5 per cent more in real terms than 1990. The increase in the volume of sales was greater, but peso revenues were hurt by the real appreciation of the peso against the dollar during 1991, and because Vitro's domestic prices did not rise as fast as the Mexican inflation rate. Vitro's revenues from exports reached Dollars 352m, a 15.7 increase over 1990. Vitro is a monopoly producer of flat glass in Mexico and through its subsidiary Anchor Glass has 28 per cent of the US glass container market. The disappointing results suggest the US recession and Mexico's strong exchange rate policy is beginning to take its toll on the country's large conglomerates.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / People: The colonial comes home - The challenge facing Nigel Rich at Trafalgar House When Nigel Rich arrives at his desk as chief executive of Trafalgar House this morning he will be facing the greatest challenge of his career. It is not the most obvious promotion to move from the helm of Jardine Matheson, the Hong-Kong conglomerate with a market capitalisation of Pounds 3.92bn a year, to run Trafalgar House, an ailing British group with a market value of Pounds 1.5bn. Jardine Matheson enjoyed five years of profits growth under his leadership. But running Jardine is a very different task from turning Trafalgar round. Jardine's main difficulties during his reign centred on the uncertainty created by the transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The group's own politics are dictated by the London-based Keswick family, which exerts a control over the group belied by its stake of less than 10 per cent. Jardine controls a myriad of South East Asian businesses, but the Keswicks have long been concerned about the political risks inherent in the 1997 hand-over of Hong Kong. In 1984 they took the highly controversial step of moving Jardine's domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda, and ten years later the company decided to move its stock market listing to London. The purchase of an initial 15 per cent stake in Trafalgar in October 1992 was another step in the group's perceived move away from the colony. Hongkong Land, the Jardine property arm, now owns 29.6 per cent of Trafalgar, and has invested more than Pounds 300m to buy the stake. Trafalgar was intended as a route by which Hong Kong profits could be channelled into a troubled conglomerate which it was intended would recover with the turn in the British economic cycle. Early hopes have not been fulfilled. Trafalgar's problems have been far worse than the Keswicks expected and Rich is being asked not only to restore the group's profitability but also the family's reputation. For Rich, thus far, has been very much the Keswicks' man. The switch will be a culture shock for him. He is leaving the cosy club atmosphere of Hong Kong's business community, where he sat at the helm of two of the colony's three most powerful institutions - Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank, where he was a director, and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, where he served on the board of stewards. He will also have to give up the Hong Kong races, a central feature of the colony's corporate life. Together with Paul Selway-Swift, a friend and director of Hongkong Bank, he owns a horse called Rock'n'Reel and has ambitions to own more. But in fulfilling a long-standing desire to return to the UK he is set to become a member of an even more exclusive club, the Jardine group's UK-based strategic core. This comprises brothers Simon and Henry Keswick, who alternate as Jardine Chairman, and Rodney Leach, a long time adviser and fellow director who is a former Rothschild's banker. Born in Somerset, but a self-avowed Scotsman, Rich, now 49, went to Sedbergh School and New College, Oxford, before training as an accountant. He joined Jardine in 1974, aged 29. Armed with his Scottish background - Scottish culture is a strong feature of corporate Hong Kong - he spent 20 years as the archetypal colonial corporate man, operating from the various outposts of Jardine's Asian empire. He ran the group's businesses in the Philippines, the majority of which were acquired in the early 1970s through the takeover of Theo H. Davies, the sugar and trading group previously owned by the family of his wife Cynthia. He first rose to prominence within Jardine in 1983 when he became finance director of Hongkong Land, the colony's leading property investment and development company, which was then teetering on the brink of collapse. There he cemented his relationship with Simon Keswick, for whom he had already worked as an assistant. Keswick had been rushed back to Hong Kong as a hands-on non-executive chairman to protect the family interests in Hongkong Land which had massively over-extended itself with HKDollars 13.5bn of debt by the end of 1983 when property prices plummeted. Rich's relationship with Simon flourished with the recovery of Hongkong Land, which involved substantial lay-offs, asset disposals and refinancing, masterminded by Rich and David Davies, the managing director. Rich's reward was the post of chief executive three years later. In 1989 he rose to the pin-nacle of the Jardine Matheson group as 'taipan' where he became immersed in the political controversy which has dogged the group since it decided to move to Bermuda. Since it had been the first trading house formed in Hong Kong, the change of domicile by the so-called 'princely hong' drew harsh criticism from almost every quarter in the colony. During Rich's reign, the criticism escalated with Jardine's campaign to move its primary listing to London, which culminated in the decision earlier this year to quit the Hong Kong exchange altogether. All this and the Keswick family's support of Governor Chris Patten's political reform plans, led to Chinese accusations that Jardine was undermining the stability of the colony. Rich endeavoured to keep out of politics, and was seen as a strong business manager, well respected by the senior management team in Jardine's broad spread of businesses. At Trafalgar, he will at least be able to focus entirely on business, but he is certainly arriving at a time of crisis. In May last year, Hongkong Land completed a boardroom purge with the removal of Trafalgar's remaining old guard: Sir Nigel Broackes, the group's founder and chairman, and Sir Eric Parker, the chief executive. Insiders say it has lacked a sense of direction since. The company stated that it wanted to focus on engineering and construction - businesses where it is a world leader - but it failed to get acceptable prices for the hotel and cruise line businesses it had wanted to sell. A stated aim of winding down the group's property development and investment businesses has also diminished. The recruitment of one of the city's leading property men, Alan Winter, suggests that property will remain a focus. Meanwhile, the economic recovery is yet to feed through to Trafalgar's engineering arm, which made a further Pounds 15m of provisions last month, in addition to the Pounds 397.3m exceptional losses taken by the group late last year. Rich will be expected to develop and communicate a new strategy and focus to the somewhat demoralised employees. Already, analysts are increasingly confident that profit margins in its construction and engineering division have bottomed out following substantial cost-cutting and job losses. However, the share price has scarcely risen above the 85p level at which Hongkong Land launched its 'dawn raid' back in October 1992. There must be those within the Jardine camp who would question the wisdom of this investment. Rich has been brought in by the Keswicks to prove them wrong. He is not one to shirk a challenge. Last year he took part in one of Hong Kong's more bizarre rituals, the annual MacLehose Trial, which involves walking 100km of mountainous trails. The trail ahead with Trafalgar will be equally arduous.</p>

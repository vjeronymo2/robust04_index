			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Li Yin (2621 0692): "At an NPC Session </F> Panel Forum, Deputy Zhang Zhen Speaks About `Three  Modernizations' Army Construction and the Comprehensive  Enhancement of the Troops' Combat Capability"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Zhang Zhen, Army  deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC], today stressed  during a panel discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work  report that, under the new situation of reform and opening up,  the People's Liberation Army [PLA] has an important duty in the  areas of safeguarding the country's security and maintaining  social stability. He called for strengthening our Army's  revolutionized, modernized, and regularized construction; for  the overall improvement of the Army's combat ability; and for  the provision of a strong and forceful security guarantee for  reform, opening up, and modernization.    In his speech, Zhang Zhen first reflected on the  world-renowned great achievements in reform, opening up, and  modernization in our country since the Third Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee. With vivid and meticulous facts  and figures, he detailed the positive situation and vitality in  which our country enjoys political stability, economic  development, ethnic unity, and social progress. He thought  that, regarding the great achievements in reform and opening up  over the past 15 years, education and propaganda must be carried  out properly, to further unify thinking, arouse fighting spirit,  and enhance soldiers' morale.    NPC deputy Zhang Zhen said that the most basic reason  enabling our country to make the great achievements is because  we have upheld the party's basic line and have followed the road  of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Practice has proven  that this is the correct road. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  integrated the basic principle of Marxism with China's actual  conditions, has established the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and has led us to realize the  second historical leap. Zhang Zhen also said: There will still  be various difficulties on the road ahead, but I believe that,  under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and under the strong and  forceful leadership of the CPC Central Committee which has  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and with the strength and  experience that we have acquired in the course of reform and  opening up for more than a decade, and by the common effort of  the people throughout the country, we are fully confident that  we can win a new victory in reform and construction.    In discussing army building, NPC deputy Zhang Zhen happily  said that, under the new situation of reform and opening up, the  entire Army has vigorously strengthened ideological and  political work, and the Army's party spirit building, clean  government building, and spiritual civilization construction  have scored good results. A great enthusiasm for military  drilling has emerged throughout the Army, which has drilled hard  for the ability to fight, and military exercises have witnessed  a good situation which has rarely been seen in the past. In the  area of logistics, comrades throughout the Army have developed  the good tradition of building the Army diligently and  economically; the logistics departments of various levels have  worked hard to increase efficiency in the use of funds; and  soldiers have enthusiastically engaged in agricultural and  sideline productions, making new progress. The building of the  national defense reserve strength has also scored marked  results, and militia and reserve units have played an important  role in building the economy and safeguarding social stability.  After reflecting on the achievements in army building over the  past year, Zhang Zhen said that this has fully indicated that  our Army is firm politically, is resolute in listening to the  party's words, and is completely trustworthy to the party and  the people.    Zhang Zhen stressed that strengthening national defense,  resisting aggression, protecting the motherland, and  safeguarding the peaceful environment in which people work is  the sacred duty entrusted to our Army by the constitution.  Under the new situation of reform and opening up, the PLA has  an important duty in the areas of safeguarding the country's  security and maintaining social stability. Only by building a  strong Army which is under the absolute leadership of the party  and is loyal to the country and people can we maintain our  country's security and stability and ensure a smooth process in  reform, opening up, and modernization.    Zhang Zhen pointed out that, in order to properly build the  Army, we must first seriously learn from Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and must use Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, as well as his idea of army building in the new  period, to arm the minds of the officers and men throughout the  Army. Only by so doing can we further enhance  self-consciousness for implementing the party's basic line and  maintain our Army's high degree of stability, centralism, and  unity. Zhang Zhen also mentioned the need to expedite the  process of forumulating national defense legislation and use  legal means to strengthen national defense and army building.  In this area, we must abide by the laws and regulations  promulgated by the NPC and the government and must implement  them resolutely.    Finally, Zhang Zhen also discussed with the deputies the  problems of vigorously enhancing the sense of national defense  among the whole people, actively supporting economic development  in the frontier regions inhabited by minority nationalities, and  giving play to the role of the militia and reserve units in  maintaining law and order and social stability.</p>

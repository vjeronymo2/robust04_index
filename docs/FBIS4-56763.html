			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent Maria Elena Gil: "Robaina Believes </F> Cuban Assistance to Small Islands a Commitment of Honor"]    [Text] Bridgetown, 5 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Cuban  representatives have come to Barbados to reaffirm a commitment  of unity, show support for small island states, and point out  the lack of understanding others have shown for the problems  experienced by the small countries.    He said: "We are not the ones experiencing the greatest  difficulties. Cuba is not only interested in resolving its own  problems, but it is also interested in devising common  strategies for cooperation among all the members of AOSIS  [Alliance of Small Insular States], which includes the small  islands of the Caribbean, the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans,  the Mediterranean, and Oceania.    The Cuban foreign minister is one of the participants in the  high-level sessions of the First World Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which is being  held in Bridgetown.    Robaina believes the presence here of a high-level Cuban  delegation headed by President Fidel Castro and also including  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban parliament, and Minister  Rosa Elena Simeon, represents a continuation of the policy Cuba  maintains toward the Caribbean and the rest of the island states.    He added: "Cuba has the commitment of honor of joining  efforts with small island states threatened by natural  catastrophes as well as by a hostile economic environment. Our  place is at [words indistinct] depend on many resources or a  large amount of land, and we have to use our creativeness to  ensure the wellbeing of our people."    Cuba has significantly contributed to the various seminars  of  the governmental meeting and to the parallel meetings held by  the Nongovernment Organizations [NGO].    At these meetings, Cuban delegates will speak about measures  to combat natural disasters, technology for sugar-industry  byproducts, the maintenance of agricultural production, and  environmental protection and biodiversity.    At the conclusion of yesterday's NGO session, the  representatives recommended to the chiefs of state in charge of  ratifying the Barbados Declaration that they include in it a  call to the United States to obey the UN resolution that demands  the lifting of the economic blockade on Cuba.    Eight chiefs of state and government will speak at today's  morning session, including Cuban President Fidel Castro, and 12  environment and development ministers, in addition to Assistant  Secretary of State Timothy Wirth, who at the last minute  replaced U.S. Vice President Al Gore, whose participation in the  event had been announced.</p>

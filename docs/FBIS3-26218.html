			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Article" by special XINHUA commentator: "Enforce the Law </F> Strictly To Win the People's Confidence"]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- Under the close  attention of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, two  representative cases involving bribery and abuse of powers in  railroad departments have finally been brought to justice the  other day, thereby reaffirming, in the eyes of the people, the  party's and government's resolve to fight corruption and  boosting the good image of the state's judicial organs enforcing  the law strictly and impartially.    The whole proceedings of the two uncomplicated cases  involving petty payoffs -- from being indicted to being  pronounced innocent, from a pronouncement of not guilty to  conviction -- may be described as a process of rigorous law  enforcement whereby the sanctity of the law was safeguarded. In  addition to throwing a sidelight on the difficulty and  complexity involved in law enforcement, the two cases also  reflect a problem in regard to law enforcement that must never  be overlooked; that is, laws are still being implemented  sluggishly.    Both cases -- the first involving the court reversing its  erroneous ruling following an appeal filed by the procuratorate;  the second involving the procuratorate amending a mistake of its  own -- reflect the spirit of strict law enforcement. Being  faithful to the law, to the facts, and to the people is a  principle to be adhered to by all judicial organs and personnel.  This principle is manifested only through scrupulous  enforcement of the law; only when this is done can they win the  people's confidence and be worthy of the honorable title of the  people's judicial organs.    Strict enforcement of law requires administering fitting  punishment in strict accordance with the criminal law and the  supplementary provisions adopted by the National People's  Congress; it also requires that criminal proceedings be carried  out correctly in strict accordance with the Criminal Procedure  Law. Neither of the two is dispensable. Handling cases in  strict accordance with provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law  is a legal principle to be closely observed by judicial organs.  If cases are not handled in accordance with the Criminal  Procedure Law or punishment is not administered in accordance  with the criminal law, then we will not be able to assert the  sanctity of law enforcement and we are liable to render unjust  verdicts. In both cases, the defendants were pronounced not  guilty on the grounds that they both refused to admit guilt, in  obvious violation of Article 35 of the Criminal Procedure Law,  which stipulates that emphasis should be placed on reliable  evidence of the facts of a crime. Such erroneous judgments must  be reversed according to law. What is thought-provoking about  the cases is that while the facts of the crimes remained  unchanged, Wei Guofan (defendant in one of the cases) was  pronounced not guilty in disregard of the procedures prescribed  in the Criminal Procedure Law; in the second case, a decision  that placed the interests of a locality or a department above  state laws was made, whereby Yan Changchun -- the defendant --  was absolved of any guilt and the case was publicized in the  press. It is indeed worrisome and puzzling.    As China's legal system is being amplified and refined day  by  day, law-breakers should not entertain the idea that they can  get away with their crimes. The only way out for them is to  admit guilt, submit themselves to the law, sincerely amend their  ways, and turn over a new leaf.    To strictly enforce the law, we must correctly understand  the scientific implications of "conducive to three causes."  When looked upon from the partial interests of a locality or  department, some of the cases are not harmful at all; they are  rather beneficial. An offense, if it is not judged by state  laws but rather judged from the viewpoint of local or  departmental protectionism, would not be viewed as an offense  but a merit. When looked upon from the viewpoint of national  interests and from the efforts to improve party workstyle and  build honest government, we can see that such conduct hurts the  interests of other regions or sectors, corrupts the ranks of  cadres, and severely tarnishes the image of the party and  government. When viewed from the angle of facilitating the  development of the national economy and consolidating the  government of the people's democratic dictatorship in China, it  would become clear that the true meaning of "conducive to three  causes" lies in strict enforcement of state laws and scrupulous  prosecution of such cases.    In the ongoing anticorruption struggle, judicial organs are  dutybound to strictly enforce the law and relentlessly prosecute  crimes. The people's procuratorates must give full rein to  their role in supervising law enforcement, while the people's  courts must pay more attention to supervising its administration  of justice -- this is the only way to ensure correct law  enforcement and safeguard the authority and sanctity of the law.  In particular, we must uphold the principle that every wrong  should be righted. Amendment should be made either when an  innocent person is wrongly convicted or a guilty party is  mistakenly acquitted. This would directly reflect the CPC  Central Committee's resolve to crack down on corruption and have  a direct impact in terms of the people's confidence in the  anticorruption struggle. Whatever the cases, the judicial  organs must take facts as the basis and law as the criterion,  administer justice fairly and impartially, right every wrong  that is made, and see to it that every case they have handled  can stand the test of history. When this is done, they will be  able to win the people's confidence, arouse the people's fervor  for fighting corruption, and fully implement the CPC Central  Committee's anticorruption plans.</p>

Weiss stated the SDL, a member of the new five party  coalition government, had always supported a second wave of  coupon privatization. "It is not just the only chance for people  who otherwise wouldn't have enough money to take part in the  privatization process, but it's also a form of investment in the  future," Weiss said at the Trencin-Fashion City Trade Fair.    Weiss said he believed privatization should be a continuous  process and thus it would be wrong to ask the government to  shelve the process for six months.    Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic told CTK that he  doubted the government would manage to prepare the second wave  in time for the elections, scheduled for September 30 and  October 1. Property worth 100 billion Slovak crowns ($3.1  billion) is to be privatized in the second wave.</p>

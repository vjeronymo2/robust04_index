			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (10): Getting the right message across - Technology / A common language The Holy Grail of the custody industry is a universal language that will enable operators to talk to each other across the globe unhindered. Armies of people representing custodians, fund managers, and a host of other groups have been meeting in Europe and the US in an attempt to establish common messaging standards in the way trades are confirmed and settled. They want a language to carry the billions of pieces of information, or messages, about transactions daily between custodians and their clients. Most people in the industry agree that the need to speed processing through a universal language is urgent, particularly as settlement periods become shorter. 'When 30 per cent of your messages are on free format (unrecognised universally), and you're having to interpret them and then rekey them, that is what the urgency is about,' says John Gubert, senior manager of group securities services at HSBC Holdings. 'A universal language allows you to receive messages and read them without human intervention. It takes out the time needed to manually load messages, and it removes an element of error when messages are being rekeyed. It speeds processes at a time of faster and faster settlement.' Mr Gubert predicts that by the end of the decade, 50-60 per cent of trades will be settled on the day of trade, and the rest within three days. Lee Adams, a vice-president at Citibank responsible for product development, echoes Mr Gubert's view: 'A fund manager told me recently that they dealt with 40 different custodians - unless those 40 custodians agree to use the same format, the poor fund manager is going to be receiving messages possibly in 40 different languages.' Mr Adams also believes a universal language will save money, increase efficiency, and reduce risk. It will 'close the loop' in the industry's automation. The main industry body working on standards is the Industry Standardisation for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC), an independent forum of representatives in the US and Europe. The ISITC works closely with Swift, the dominant message network provider, in looking at building on Swift messages, extending their use across the industry and creating new standards. A primary role is to develop formats for messages that can be used across a range of networks throughout the global industry. The ISITC is making progress, according to one analyst, 'but it is a bit like watching a swan on water - it is serene on the surface, but its feet are working away underneath'. The ISITC's work, and that carried out by other groups, is co-ordinated by the Securities Standards Advisory Board, which was set up two years ago to bring together the various strands of work already under way. Mr Gubert fears that attempts to create a universal messaging system are being hampered by the perceived need for consensus. He believes the industry needs to find a fast-track route, which means 'in some ways being dictatorial'. 'The trouble with consensus is that if custodian A wants to use eight characters as an ID code and B wants to use 12, there is no possibility of a consensus, so you need an arbiter/dictator,' he says. 'Inevitably that will be the big boys, and people will squeal like mad, but they are the ones handling the bulk of messages. You have to do it with a small group of operators to get standards on networks which are then used. That's effectively what the ISITC is doing to a great extent.' Many in the industry acknowledge there is much co-operation between the various bodies involved in creating messaging standards, but some also fear the process is bureaucratic and slow moving, and that work on standards is being fragmented and duplicated. Rivalry between different standards groups has created a 'bugger's muddle', according to one custodian. Simon Pilkington, chairman of the ISITC in Europe, says he believes some of the criticism stems from 'misunderstandings and confusion' about the position of the various groups in the process and with each other. The ISITC agreed an equity and fixed income standard in September last year, and its working groups are now looking at the other main areas: reconciliation and corporate actions, derivatives and foreign exchange. Lee Adams, at Citibank, sits on the ISITC's corporate actions working group. He says a draft standard for a type of mandatory corporate action should be agreed by the end of this year, before going to the implementation stage. Mr Gubert believes any one of three outcomes is likely by the end of the decade: the status quo; a technical solution that is too technical for the users; or a fast-track solution dominated by the largest operators. 'World number one is the one in which there is total confusion - as there is at the moment - as to what a precise standard is.' Different custodians communicating in their own, proprietorial, language is costing the industry 'millions of dollars', says Mr Gubert. Each message has to be translated, by computer or manually. For small operators, the big costs could come on the capital side as new standards are implemented and systems have to be upgraded or replaced. 'The second world is where we see the emergence of a massive data dictionary  -a bible - which people find very difficult to understand and to implement. So we will have a technical solution but the solution will be too complex.' Mr Gubert's third, and favoured option, is the emergence of a fast-track of a limited number of operators that already handles most of the business. 'It has to be a very prescriptive mechanism to implement standards that will cover the vast bulk of our message requirements.' He acknowledges this could create culture and status problems: 'People don't like being left off the list.' But he believes it is the only realistic approach and the one most likely to satisfy the needs of the largest portion of the business. Yet others argue that consensus, while hard to achieve, is the only way the industry as a whole can embrace new standards and make them work. 'To make this work we need to get as wide an agreement and as wide a participation as possible,' says Mr Adams. 'Everyone's got everything to gain. If we don't do this, we will be just right back where we started, so we tend towards the 80-20 rule: If you try to automate everything you're going to fail, and fail big-time. You've got to concentrate on what is really important.'</p>

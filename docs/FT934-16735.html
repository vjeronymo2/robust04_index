			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Pop concert Nick Cave has been loitering with intent in rock music's seamier neighbourhoods for the best part of a decade and a half. Throughout his career - first as the lead singer of the glum Australian post-punk band The Birthday Party and then with his backing band the Bad Seeds - his attempts to squeeze a depressing art from dirt has commanded a sizeable cult following. At no time has he ever been in danger of becoming a pop star. This is not entirely his fault: he cannot help looking and sounding like a member of the Addams family, but it is his choice to use the same tailor and barber and to make the more literate horror story a model for so many of his songs which pick obsessively at humanity's weaknesses and capacity for evil. Cave is careful to lace his music with an appropriate degree of self-mockery - it is only rock 'n' roll after all, but he undoubtedly takes it seriously. He wrote music for Wim Wenders' films Faraway So Close and Wings of Desire, and appeared in the latter and also in Johnny Suede. He has written a novel And the Ass Saw the Angel. Clearly Cave is a highly creative type. But rock remains the most natural medium for his Gothic, melodramatic personality. At the Brixton Academy his voice, deep, rich doom-laden, lacking range but perfectly suited to his material, fills the hall - with the help, of course, of powerful amplification. He stands at the front of the stage waving an admonitory cigarette at the black-clad crowd as he sings. In response a few sway to the music, most simply stare like an army of undead. It is not until Cave leaves the stage that they show signs of animation with a rapturous and sustained demand for an encore. The repertoire is hard work. Dirge is the dominant style, death the chief subject. He can occasionally vary the pace. 'Papa Won't Leave You Henry' is a grim tale delivered with a rolling, good-natured bluster, 'Deanna' a good old-fashioned rocker - about murder. Yet there are moments when Cave manages to be more than a grim joker. With 'The Ship Song' and 'The Weeping Song', memorable tunes played in an almost stately fashion by the Bad Seeds, he achieves a shabby grandeur and suggests a little hope, both musical and lyrical.</p>

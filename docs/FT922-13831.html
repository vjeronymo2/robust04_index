			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Opinion proves resilient FROM SHADOW Budgets to soapboxes, the leading parties have tried everything, David Owen writes. But opinion polls, for the most part, have been stubbornly unmoved. Prior to yesterday's polls, Labour had consolidated and arguably widened the narrow lead it held when Mr John Major named the day. But neither of the leading parties has sustained anything resembling a decisive breakthrough. If there has been a pronounced trend, it has favoured the Liberal Democrats, whose support has climbed to a 19-20 per cent plateau. Though the Tories have not regained the 39 per cent support level around which they oscillated for the first two weeks of the campaign, Labour support has appeared to seep away to the Liberal Democrats in almost equal measure, leaving the gap between the two leading parties little changed prior to yesterday's abrupt narrowing.</p>

Having received notice of Muracciole's conviction for violating the EAA, and following consultations with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Muracciole permission to apply for or use any export license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations, for a period of 10 years from the date of his conviction. The 10-year period ends on April 27, 2000.

Alleged Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG)  members scattered fliers in the city's outskirts calling on the  people to reject the reforms.    Several streets were littered during the predawn hours with  other fliers in favor of the reforms.    Campaigning in favor or against the 43 constitutional  reforms  was prohibited by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) since  noon 28 January.    TSE Magistrate Mario Guerra Roldan has said to carry out any  campaigning either for the "yes" or "no" vote, which includes  moving ahead the date of the legislative elections, is against  the electoral process.    Meanwhile, abstention marks the first hour of voting, and  according to radio reports, the number of people who have gone  to polling stations installed in various schools in Guatemala  City averaged between three to seven.</p>

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, argued  there could be no figure (for such a target) that Japan could  attain and satisfy the United States at the same time. His  remarks were in response to a comment made in the business  community to propose to the U.S. as an "objective criteria" a  target of setting a ratio of Japan's current-account surplus to  its gross domestic product (GDP).    "Even if there should be target figures which can satisfy  the  U.S. Administration, (setting such targets) would only serve as  a stopgap measure. In a couple of years, (U.S.-Japan relations)  would get worse," he said.</p>

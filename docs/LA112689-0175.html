			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> MCENROE SERIOUS ABOUT INTENTION TO BECOME COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> The man who would be king, or at least chief executive officer?  </P> <P> The men's professional tennis tour, the ATP Tour, has as its CEO Hamilton  Jordan, the former Carter White House chief of staff, but last week someone who  wants Jordan's job threw his racket into the ring.  </P> <P> Would you believe, John McEnroe?  </P> <P> "I can't think of anyone better than me," McEnroe said.  </P> <P> McEnroe revealed his desire to test the murky waters of tennis politics last  week after playing an exhibition match against Jimmy Connors at the Forum. No  one is sure whether McEnroe's politics are leftist, only that he swings the  racket that way.  </P> <P> But McEnroe the reigning authority figure of men's tennis? Better figure that  the fines for verbal abuse go way, way down.  </P> <P> Actually, maybe Mac's a pretty good idea. After spending his career treading  water in the shark-infested political pool of men's tennis, McEnroe is  obviously fairly adept at this fuzzball business.  </P> <P> "Commissioner of tennis, that would be nice," McEnroe said. "My vision of  tennis is far more interesting than the people who care about money, money,  money. I don't know who would be better than me.  </P> <P> "Hamilton Jordan is a politician. He doesn't know anything about tennis. He's  done a great job, but now it's time for someone with vision to carry it into  the 21st century."  </P> <P> Off the top of his head, McEnroe came up with two planks for his platform. He  favors a program to establish and support a children's tennis movement. He also  stands for moving in the service line an inch or two.  </P> <P> "This sport needs some positive change, otherwise it'll be the same old boring  thing it is now," he said.  </P> <P> Jordan recently had his contract extended as the top management officer of the  ATP for three more years, so the position McEnroe covets is already taken. But  there could still be room for him in the future, an ATP official said.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you one thing, John McEnroe is a very bright guy and has a lot of  good ideas," said Jay Beck, communications director of the ATP. "I don't know  what kind of management experience he might have, but I don't think he's saying  anything out of line when he looks down the road at his future."  </P> <P> McEnroe, 30, isn't exactly running for office, but he would have to gain the  support of the players' group, which selects its leaders through various  committee votes. McEnroe would be a slate of one as a candidate, but he's  already considering his options if he needed a running mate.  </P> <P> "Maybe I'll get Jimmy," McEnroe said, referring to Connors.  </P> <P> Mac attack: As a member in good standing of the ATP, McEnroe has long been a  vocal critic of the organization of his peers, just as he has spoken out  against most every other institution of man. The 1990 ATP Tour may not be a  shining example of what the players are capable of producing, McEnroe said.  </P> <P> "I don't see the players taking as much a voice as I hoped," he said. "I'm not  optimistic. Basically, all they have is Hamilton Jordan and his cronies with  more power. The special interests have more power. We could do a lot better,  but at least it's a step in the right direction."  </P> <P> McEnroe said that the top players were not consulted enough during planning  sessions for the 1990 ATP Tour, that players must play too many tournaments and  the off-season is not long enough.  </P> <P> McEnroe also criticized the U.S. Open for putting together a difficult playing  schedule because television wants two men's semifinals on Saturday and the  men's final on Sunday.  </P> <P> "It's a joke," he said. "The next thing is, we'll be playing at 2 in the  morning because somebody can get more money from it. We're still pieces of meat  when it comes down to it."  </P> <P> He's 38 in September: Connors, 37, is scaling back his 1990 tournament  appearances to about 12 and neither the Newsweek Champions Cup at Indian Wells  nor the Volvo/Los Angeles events are on his schedule.  </P> <P> Last March at Indian Wells, Connors said he planned to play until he is 40, but  now he is reconsidering.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I'll make it until I'm 40," he said. "I'll look at it at the  end of the year and see. I'll probably play until I'm 39, like Ken Rosewall  did, when I played him at the Open and he was 39. That would be an appropriate  ending, I think."  </P> <P> Connors was 22 when he defeated 39-year-old Ken Rosewall in the 1974 U.S. Open  final, the first of Connors' five U.S. Open titles. Rosewall, who had also lost  to Connors in the 1974 Wimbledon final, never made it to another Grand Slam  final.  </P> <P> "I just hope to play one more year on this level," Connors said. "I still have  a chance to do something down the line -- somewhere, sometime -- I just don't  know the place or the time. Wish I did."  </P> <P> Davis Cup update: U.S. Captain Tom Gorman said that by Jan. 1 he will name the  U.S. team that will play its first-round match against Mexico that begins Jan.  29 at La Costa. One player certain not to be named is McEnroe, who has already  made himself unavailable.  </P> <P> But will he be available after that?  </P> <P> "We'll discuss it after that (Mexico match)," McEnroe said. "I will say that  I'd like to be part of a team that wins the Davis Cup, but . . . it's sad. The  Davis Cup doesn't seem right right now. It's just not as big as it was, not as  important as it was."  </P> <P> McEnroe said much the same thing when he skipped a first-round match with  Paraguay, but he played against France and would have played against West  Germany if he had not injured his shoulder.  </P> <P> Gorman will consider a number of potential singles players, including Michael  Chang, Andre Agassi, Jay Berger and Aaron Krickstein.  </P> <P> In doubles, it appears probable that the team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh will  make their Davis Cup debut. If so, they would replace Ken Flach and Robert  Seguso, who lost their first Davis Cup match ever in this year's semifinals  against West Germany at Munich.  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> Ken Flach, who injured his ankle while playing doubles with partner Robert  Seguso at the Wembley Indoors, may not be ready in time for the Nabisco Masters  Doubles in December at London's Royal Albert Hall.  </P> <P> College-bound tennis players who want to learn how to qualify for scholarships  might be interested in attending the college and university scholarship  meetings sponsored by the Southern California Tennis Assn.'s junior development  program. The meetings will be held at 7 p.m. Dec. 5 at Morley Field Clubhouse  at Balboa Park in San Diego and at 2 p.m. Dec. 17 at the Los Angeles Tennis  Center at UCLA. For details, call Mark Winters of the SCTA at (213) 208-3838.  </P> <P> The seventh Senior Grand Prix Masters tennis championships will be played Dec.  6-10 at Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego. Some of the top players in their age  groups are Bill McQuaid of Tustin and Mike Tunstall of Irvine in the men's 30;  Leland Housman of San Diego in the men's 45 and Bob Duesler of Newport Beach in  the men's 50. Bob Perry of San Diego, national men's hardcourt champion, will  play in the men's 55 singles and team with last year's age-group runner-up John  Sahratian of La Jolla in doubles. Dodo Cheney of Santa Monica, who has won 190  national age-group championships, will play in the women's 60 singles and will  team with Corky Murdock of Los Angeles in the women's 65 doubles.  </P> <P> Barbara Mueller of Tempe is top seeded in the National Hardcourt women's  40-and-over singles championship Monday through Sunday at the La Jolla Beach  and Tennis Club.  </P></p>

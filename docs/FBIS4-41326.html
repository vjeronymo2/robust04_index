			<p>BFN     [Text] Anatoliy Adamishin, Russia's first deputy Foreign  Minister, told Interfax he does not rule out the possibility of  the involvement of the Tajik opposition in the terrorist acts  against Russian servicemen and ethnic Russians in Tajikistan.    He said, "there are many indications testifying to the  opposition's involvement in these acts, although we lack  conclusive proof."    "Using various channels, Russia has warned the leaders of  the  Tajik armed opposition about the threat of these methods. If we  discover that the opposition is involved in these acts, our  answer will be very severe," Adamishin said.    He stressed the fact that "Russia undertakes certain  measures  to bar the wave of terror. Combat patrolling has been  introduced in places densely populated by ethnic Russians, and  armed guard has been reinforced."    Adamishin does not rule out that the crimes committed in  Tajikistan can affect the course of the inter-Tajik dialogue  underway in Tajikistan. "Those who plan and accomplish these  actions strive not only to provoke trouble inside Tajikistan but  to attack the negotiation process between the government and the  opposition," he said.    Adamishin expressed satisfaction with the fact that despite  numerous difficulties inter-Tajik dialogue had been resumed.  Russia, he said, had made a significant contribution to this  process. "The major task of the Teheran round is to develop the  results achieved at the negotiations in Moscow, namely to adopt  the agreement on a cease-fire and hostilities along with several  political measures inside Tajikistan as the opposition insists,"  he said.    Referring to the data presented by the Russian  representatives at the negotiations in Teheran, Adamishin also  said that the work on this agreement had been begun. "It is  being carried out on the basis of the draft proposed by the U.N.  envoy Ramiro Piriz-Ballon. The work is proceeding slowly, but  there are some improvements. I'd like to hope that both Tajik  parties would finally reach an agreement," he said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.K.: "The Solution Today"; first paragraph is </F> LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] After more than a week, a strike by dock  warehouse personnel still has activity at the port paralyzed.  The parties to the dispute are meeting today.    Because of the absence of a minimum amount of service,  several ships carrying semolina, flour, rice, and other food  products have been waiting for days in hope of being unloaded,  while other freighters are simply switching ports (and going to  Mostaganem or Oran). The situation is causing the loss of an  estimated 60 million centimes per day.    The dockworkers are expressing their dissatisfaction with  implementation of a traffic plan established by the port  authority and stipulating where the various categories of  personnel will enter the port. In accordance with that plan, it  was decided on 9 October 1993 that dockworkers and day workers  would not be allowed to enter through the main gate. Gate 17 was  fitted out especially for them. When contacted by us, the port's  general director, Boumessila, said that "the dockworkers have  launched an illegal and unexpected strike without submitting a  list of demands or undertaking negotiations with the management."    For his part, Abdellah Redjadj, a member of the local union,  said in the columns of ALGER REPUBLICAIN that the dockworkers  were not on strike: "We come here every day to work, but they  deny us access." He was referring to the main gate, where  "everybody except us goes in." Consequently, they are refusing  to go through Gate 17, which they say is dangerous: "That is  where the trucks and the train enter." Redjadj also mentioned  their chief demands, namely the opening of the main gate, pay  for the days on strike, and a halt to the threats and acts of  intimidation to which the dockworkers have been subjected. The  meeting scheduled for today between the Labor Inspectorate, the  local union, and the port authority should result in a quick  solution to this problem, which has brought one of Algeria's  biggest port enterprises to a standstill.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Clinton nominee defends judiciary PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's nominee for the vacant seat on the US Supreme Court has defended the judiciary against charges of being too activist and usurping the role of elected politicians in setting public policy. In written answers to a questionnaire before her Senate confirmation hearings begin on July 20, judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, described judicial activism as 'a label too often pressed into service by critics of court results rather than the legitimacy of court decisions.' The courts would not have to take such an active role, she suggested, if legislators had made 'the hard, somewhat controversial decisions necessary to equip judges with clearer policy directions ..' Mrs Ginsburg, whose ideological stance is not readily definable, appears already to have won enough backing from key senators to ensure Senate confirmation. Judicial activism has been an important issue in conservative criticism of the Supreme Court, since it began to take a more aggressive approach to social issues in the 1930s, and particularly under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and 1960s. With the arrival of new justices appointed by former Presidents Reagan and Bush the balance has swung to the right. In earlier writings Judge Ginsburg suggested the Supreme Court could endanger its credibility by moving too far ahead of the political process, or lagging too far behind. 'Without taking giant strides and thereby risking a backlash too forceful to contain, the Court through constitutional adjudication, can reinforce or signal a green light for social change,' she said in New York. The 1954 Brown vs Board of Education decision that barred school segregation followed a carefully prepared path in the campaign against racial injustice, she argued. On the other hand, Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision outlawing most anti-abortion statutes, may have reversed a tide that was already underway in the political arena and triggered 20 years of bitter controversy.</p>

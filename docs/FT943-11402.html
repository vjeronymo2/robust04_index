			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Tory whips aim to stem tide of defeats in Lords Government business managers plan a thorough overhaul of consultation and information-gathering in the House of Lords in an effort to curb embarrassing defeats. By keeping its ear close to the ground, the energetic - and surprisingly youthful - new government whips team in the upper house hopes to make sure that potential flashpoints are defused early. The initiative follows a session during which peers savaged the criminal justice bill and other measures. Last week's ministerial reshuffle included sweeping changes in the upper house. Lord Cranborne, 47, replaced the 62-year-old Lord Wakeham as Lords leader and five of the seven posts in the government whips' office changed hands. Lord Strathclyde, 34, the new chief whip, has served in four government departments. The Earl of Arran, 56, the new deputy chief whip, is also an experienced minister. An early signal that Lord Cranborne is likely to devote more time than his predecessor to hands-on management of the upper house came last week when Downing Street announced that Mr David Hunt, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, would become chairman of many of the cabinet committees previously led by Lord Wakeham. Among possible plans is the introduction of a more structured way for backbench peers to get access to the leader of the house and the chief whip over specific grievances. By adopting a more rigorous approach than has been needed in the past, business managers hope to ensure that Tory peers think long and hard before voting against the government. Some experienced Lords observers expect the authority of the new team to be enhanced by the fact that both the house leader and the chief whip are hereditary peers. They say some peers were resentful that so many recent Lords leaders have been relatively recent arrivals from the House of Commons. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the MP for Hove for more than 20 years, is to leave the Commons at the next election. Mr Sainsbury had a majority of 12,268 over Labour at the last election. He resigned as industry minister in the reshuffle last week. Weekend FT, Page I</p>

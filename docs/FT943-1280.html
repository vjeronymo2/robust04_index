			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: A label for success - Jazz Manfred Eicher, founder/proprietor of the Munich record label ECM, is not the sort of person to celebrate a 25th anniversary with boxed set compilations or retrospectives. Never one to respond to the commercial mores which preoccupy others in the music business, Eicher even claims not to pay any real attention to how well his recordings sell. An autocratic and idiosyncratic individual who controls every aspect of each recording, he says that to him, 'popularity and appreciation is a side benefit, almost'. Started by Eicher as a jazz label in 1969, Editions of Contemporary Music has become home to hugely successful artists as well as harder-to-classify fringe intrumentalists. Helped in large part by the runaway success of American pianist Keith Jarrett's 1975 live recording, The Koln Concert which has sold two and a half million copies, more than any other solo piano work, Eicher can afford to record with less commercial artists. In between refined jazz masters such as John Abercrombie, Dave Holland and Paul Motian, the ECM catalogue lists the diverse sounds of cellist David Darling, violinist Shankar and the African drums of the Moire Orchestra among others. This mix of reliable sellers and 'outside' improvisation is constantly renewed. The immensely popular Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek records for Eicher as does the successful 'new' classical composer, Estonian Arvo Part. But so does Heiner Goebbels, whose latest CD has the citizens of Boston reciting Edgar Allen Poe's Landscape with Argonauts on the sidewalk. In Twilight Fields Stephen Micus alternates between flower pots, a Bavarian zither and something called a 'nay'. Eicher has produced virtually every one of the company's 550 recordings and, though he dismisses the idea, it shows. A wilfully solitary person outside the studio, Eicher cites film makers Godard, Tarkovsky and Bergman as his influences inside it. He is attracted by the bleak beauty of northern Europe and always records in the same Oslo studio. This aesthetic taste is carried through to the mixing desk. If there is such a thing as the ECM sound, it is characterised by judicious use of reverb and the stark clarity of each instrument's voicings. Detractors say it is old; someone once described it as the most beautiful sound next to silence. Explaining his studio technique, Eicher, who is himself a conservatory trained violinist, says bluntly: 'I seek only austerity and discipline. I do not impose a 'sound': the direction comes from the music itself.' In the ECM New Series, which concentrates on composers from Thomas Tallis to Steve Reich, Eicher says he has tried to bring some of the spontaneity and dialectic of jazz to written work. Part's compositions, which Eicher describes as 'the music of slowly beating wings,' (Miserere in 1991 and Tabula Rasa in 1984) have continued to sell especially well. Now Eicher seems set for another success, this time with an unlikely experiment in early music. Eicher's latest offering, Officium (ECM New Series 1525 445 369-2), sets Garbarek's distinctive yearning saxophone sound across the hymnal early music of a vocal quartet, the Hilliard Ensemble. Compositions on the album are from the 13th to 15th centuries and explore chants, early polyphony and Renaissance motets. After some initial confusion over its proper category, Officium has entered the classic FM chart at number two and now promises to be as big a hit with the people who bought into monks chanting as it is with confirmed ECM aficionados.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aldo Diaz Lacayo] </F>   [Excerpts] Nicaragua's political physiognomy has radically  changed in the past six months. Five different but ultimately  interrelated events that occurred in this period have  exacerbated and, at the same time, clarified the profound  political crisis in Nicaragua: the Esteli massacre; the dual  Quilali-Managua kidnapping; the presidential announcement of the  removal of General Humberto Ortega Saavedra from the Army  leadership; the transport workers' strike; and the dispute  between the National Assembly, through the Sandinist bench, and  Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, secretary general of the FSLN  [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. The direct consequences  of each of these events are undeniable and obvious: the Army's  loss of prestige; the consolidation of UNO [National Opposition  Union] as a valid participant in resolving the political crisis;  the new dispute between the executive and the EPS [Sandinist  People's Army]; the evidence that the government's economic  problem is limited to controlling inflation and reducing the  fiscal deficit; and the great importance to the public of the  Sandinist leadership's internal crisis. On the margins of all  this, the overall consequences of the intensification of the  crisis possess a terminal seriousness; they necessarily imply a  qualitative change.    To start with, for the first time since she became  president--over three years ago--the president is generally  perceived as directly responsible for three of the five events  listed above; this means that also for the first time the people  identify her as in charge of the government. In other words, the  intensification of the crisis has apparently obliterated the  president's image as chief of state, changing it from  that of a naive but manipulated governor, outside the loop of  administrative blunders and widespread official corruption, to  that of a person who shares responsibility for this  mismanagement. This change in image has many political  implications. In the first place, the political establishment  will direct its batteries against her, more and more ignoring  Antonio Lacayo; the same thing is going to happen--or perhaps is  already happening--in the government-Washington relationship.  Secondly, in these conditions, the only option the president has  is a national accord to complete her government with the seal of  its only moderately successful policy: reconciliation and  peace. If she is not able to do this, she will be forced to  seek alliances with forces on the far right, to the detriment of  the precarious political stability achieved so far, and also to  the detriment--in the third place--of her alliance with the  Sandinist leadership. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Crisis in the Sandinist Top Leadership </H5>   Moreover, the impact of this intensification of the crisis  on  the Sandinist leadership has also been brutal, so much so that  it can be said that the Sandinist leadership has been the  hardest hit of all. In this regard, the first thing this  analysis reveals is that the Sandinist Front's national  leadership has been forced to recognize as full participants not  only UNO--which in the past it ignored--but also several of the  small groups that make it up, some of them as leadership groups.  Consequently, the Sandinist leadership has not been able to  elude--much less neutralize--the UNO tactic of creating several  fronts for fighting the Sandinist Front, no matter whether some  of these fronts are presented as quasi-allied and others as open  enemies. In negotiating with the government, the Sandinist Front  has been weakened. The greatest expression of this weakness is  the complexity that the mechanics of the national dialogue has  taken on: interminable bilateral discussions prior to a  constantly more remote general dialogue among all the parties.    This weakening of the Sandinist Front, though, is not the  result of a sudden strengthening of UNO or the government; it is  the result of the internal crisis of Sandinism itself that has  reached its highest level, first in the public confrontation  with the president on the occasion of the announcement, also  public, that she made at the anniversary celebration of the EPS,  and later in the open clash between the secretary general of the  Sandinist Front and the head of the Sandinist bench in the  National Assembly (parliament). The first demonstrated  Sandinism's lack of real weight in its relations with the  government, so painstakingly and at such great cost worked out  by the national leadership, using the argument--denied by  reality--of preserving to the utmost the gains of the  revolution; and the second is the new balance of power inside  the Sandinist leadership, which also stems from its own  weakness. Comandante Daniel Ortega has in essence lost the  activist support of the FNT [National Workers Front], as it has  virtually ceased to exist as a consequence of privatization and  more specifically of the newly created APT [Workers' Ownership  Sector]; that is, as a consequence of the party  leader-worker/businessman dispute; nor has Dr. [Sergio] Ramirez  managed to develop partisan support through the centrist trend  that has faded away.  <H5>  The High Price of the Head of Rene Vivas </H5>   In addition, if the Sandinist leadership had placed any  hopes  on the Army, it is clear that those expectations are about to  become or have already become another chimera: with its own  internal crisis, the Army cannot now realistically help the  Sandinist Front. Nor can anything be said about the police. It  is as if the police did not even exist, so great was the price  of the head of Comandante Rene Vivas, a concession made more in  the context of the Sandinist Front's internal struggles than as  a strategic decision. The concession of the police to these  imperial demands, as some well-known members with a long history  in the party had pointed out earlier, anticipated the new  situation of the EPS, but those who are deaf and blind refuse to  hear and to see.    As a result, the Sandinist leadership will no longer be able  to ignore the demands of the party's grass roots for the accord  that without any doubt will have to be reached in the first  Extraordinary Congress: that no member of the national  leadership may run as a presidential candidate in the 1996  general elections, and that the party must immediately begin to  promote a number of other party members for that purpose. This  gives new importance to the Extraordinary Congress and a new  reason for the Sandinist grassroots to fight for a precise  statement of their objectives. The national leadership  apparently got itself into trouble without any hope of escape  when it gave up the Sandinist Front's political program, which  has never lost its force, in a vain search for an alternative to  neoliberalism. In addition to being the best alternative, that  political program is the best weapon to combat the neoliberal  project; so much so that a great price was paid to convince the  world that the Sandinist political program was strategic and not  tactical in nature.  <H5>  FSLN Leadership Weak, Grass Roots Huge </H5>   Of course, in terms of leadership the Sandinist Front is a  very weakened party, but at its grass-roots level it remains a  huge, strong, combative...and disorganized party. It is weakened  because of the daily struggle for survival amid unemployment and  discrimination--even of the Sandinist brothers  themselves--because of the organic dispersion brought about by  the real split in the leadership and because of the lack of  clear objectives and of a consistent organic structure. So, once  again bringing together the party's grass roots is a problem of  consequence between partisan objectives and political action,  between principles and discourse, between theory and practice.  That is why it is useless to talk about organic reorganization  without attacking the in-depth problem, the problem of the  party's true nature. That is something that only the  Extraordinary Congress can resolve, so long as it acts in  accordance with the demands of the grass roots; this is another  argument in favor of the Sandinist Front's First Extraordinary  Congress.  <H5>  Government More Isolated Than Ever </H5>   The government is obviously not in very good shape. On the  contrary, it is now more isolated than ever, with the entire  national political spectrum arrayed against it, and it has only  a promise of aid, with strings attached, from Washington. The  government is so isolated that the national consensus is that it  should end its term whenever it can. The advantage of this is  that it requires a greater consensus concerning a minimum  national accord enabling all the participants to prepare for the  1996 general elections in a climate of reasonable political  stability. The struggle, then, is taking place around the  national dialogue, where political stability is more a means  than an end, a means for the great electoral contest of 1996.  The disadvantage is that this struggle may once again alter the  national political physiognomy, both because of the balance of  power that may result from the national dialogue and because of  the definitive frustration arising from this dialogue that could  reach the groups on the far right. Although in terms of numbers  these groups are minuscule, they have a great reproductive  capacity through the media, including the Sandinist media.    In reality, during the past six months, Nicaragua has become  another country.</p>

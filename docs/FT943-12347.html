			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Army enlists first Challenger 2 tank The army got a new tank yesterday. The first Challenger 2 was presented to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, by Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, at a ceremony at the company's Barnbow works in Leeds. Vickers is building 386 Challenger 2 tanks for the British army in a Pounds 1.3bn deal which will ensure employment for 4,000 workers into the next century. The government signed a Pounds 1.1bn contract for a further 259 tanks earlier this month to complete the order. Adding to the ceremony were the pipes and drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, which will be the first regiment equipped with the tank. Mr Rifkind paid tribute to Vickers' designers and workforce. He said the tank would enable the army to respond to the 'unpredictable challenges' of the future. Extensive trials have shown the new tank to be twice as potent a fighting machine as its much-maligned predecessor, Challenger 1. As a result the number of tanks in each of the eight armoured regiments is to be cut from 52 to 38 without affecting their overall fighting capability. Senior officers originally made it plain they did not want another British tank because of Challenger 1's poor reliability record. But the tank was thought to redeem itself in the Gulf war. Vickers also has an order for 14 tanks for the army of Oman.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Security groups to outnumber police The growing private security industry employs about as many personnel as all the police forces in England, Wales and Scotland, a research study has shown. The number employed by the industry has grown from 115,000 in 1985 to 162,000 today - a rise of about 45 per cent in seven years. The statistics were produced by the Policy Studies Institute as part of a wider study into aspects of crime by the Economic and Social Research Council. The PSI study, based on data from British Telecommunication's Business Database and the government's Labour Force Survey, is believed to be the first comprehensive look at the size and shape of the private security industry. The study includes a variety of security businesses such as security equipment specialists, private detectives and credit investigation services. It estimates that there are at least 7,842 such establishments employing more than 162,000 people. Researchers, however, believe this is likely to underestimate the true figure. The figure of 162,000 compares with 142,000 trained police officers employed by forces in England, Scotland and Wales. This increases to 191,000 if civilian staff attached to police forces are included. The PSI study will continue for a further year, concentrating on greater sectoral analysis of the industry and its relationship with public-sector policing. Researchers believe its initial conclusions demonstrate the growth in the industry and the need for statutory regulation. At present the industry is regulated by trade associations and professional bodies which, the PSI says, cover only a fraction of the companies operating. Mr Tim Newburn of the PSI said: 'There has been a growth in the number of police officers, a growth in the private security sector, a growth in the crime rate, and a growth in the public's desire for protection, all at the same time. 'It would appear that these trends will fuel a continued expansion in private security. But, although the industry is already as big as the police force and is set to get bigger and have a significant impact on our everyday lives, there is no regulation over its activities.' Mr Newburn added: 'Few other industries of this size and impact go unregulated.'</p>

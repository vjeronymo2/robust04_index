			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Israel's biggest company seeks Dollars 180m financial aid ISRAEL Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest company and flagship of the important state-owned defence sector, has announced that it is seeking Dollars 180m in emergency financial aid from the government following a collapse in sales over the past six months, officials said yesterday. The surprise move is an alarming sign for the government of the extent to which Israel's military-based industries continue to be hit by falling worldwide demand. Until recently, IAI appeared to be secure, sustaining annual overseas sales of Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 822m) - 17 per cent of Israel's industrial exports. Now IAI says it needs a Dollars 180m injection of loans and capital from the government to stay afloat. The company plans to cut its 17,000 workforce by 1,500 and wants to cut wages by 10 per cent. This follows demands from Israel Military Industries, another state-owned arms-maker which makes the Uzi machine gun, for a Dollars 350m rescue package. It plans a cut in its workforce by 40 per cent to 4,500. IAI has suffered this year from falling orders from the Israeli defence forces. But, ironically, its latest troubles are largely due to a slump in civilian contracts, which it had built up to 20 per cent of export sales to offset stagnating military demand. A deal to make parts for the MD-12, a new McDonnell Douglas civilian airliner, has been put on hold along with the aircraft itself. A contract with Electra Aviation of the UK to convert 10 Boeing 747 passenger aircraft to cargo carriers has been cancelled, with IAI forced to buy out the first aircraft on which it had already begun work. Another contract with Dornier of Germany has been delayed. Mr Doron Susslick, IAI's communications director, said the company lost Dollars 18m in the first half of this year. In 1991, IAI had net profits of Dollars 22m on sales of Dollars 1.6bn. Workers at Bezeq, Israel's state-owned telecoms monopoly, have ended a week-long strike called to protest at plans to allow private competition in portable and international telephone services without any apparent concession by the government.</p>

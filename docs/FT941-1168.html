			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Bidder for Swans may face redundancy bill The French company negotiating to buy shipbuilder Swan Hunter may have to meet the cost of another round of redundancies and then re-employ the staff, it emerged yesterday. Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie could face a redundancy bill of about Pounds 1.5m. This consideration is likely to influence the price CMN offers for the Tyneside yard. Receivers Price Waterhouse this week warned unions that 490 jobs will be at risk when Swan Hunter hands over the Type 23 frigate Northumberland on May 12, leaving insufficient work for the present 1,038 employees. CMN is hoping to reach agreement within three weeks on the purchase of Swan Hunter, conditional on the yard winning from the Ministry of Defence the refit of the Sir Bedivere landing ship - a decision not due to be announced until July 20. However, because CMN is now in negotiation with the receivers, it could face the Pounds 1.5m redundancy bill if the gap in workload forces the 490 redundancies prior to its takeover of the yard. 'We are facing the possibility of having to pay for these redundancy costs, then re-employ these people,' said Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, yesterday. 'It's something we have to take into account in our bid,' he added. The liability CMN faces should it eventually buy the yard, is enshrined in the transfer-of-undertakings legislation set out in the 1978 Employment Protection Act, and subsequent amendments. A purchaser would also have to make redundancy payments in line with Swan Hunter's own scheme. The 1,450 employees already made redundant since receivership last May received the state minimum. The receivers said yesterday that the cost of paying the 490 people for two months while waiting for the refit decision would be at least Pounds 1.25m. They said they were studying options including job sharing, lay-offs and the possibility of finding other work to avert the redundancies. Following confusion on Thursday over whether the 490 job losses were definite, the receivers and unions yesterday discussed the issue. 'There's no longer the confusion,' said Price Waterhouse afterwards. The receivers have asked the Ministry of Defence to bring forward a decision on which of five tenders is to win the Sir Bedivere refit.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Brussels 'green' charges rejected THE GOVERNMENT yesterday accused Brussels of acting with insensitivity as it dismissed claims that the UK will be taken to the European Court of Justice for three breaches of environmental laws on wild birds and emissions of nitrous oxide. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, was called to defend the government's 'green' record at yesterday's relaunch of a campaign to persuade householders to save energy and help to prevent global warming. He said: 'We have received no communication whatsoever from the European Commission on these issues since before the general election in April.' He thought the disputes had been 'amicably resolved'. Brussels has sent reasoned opinions to the government - the last step before court action - for allowing farmers to shoot wild 'pest species' such as crows, starlings and magpies, and for alleged failure to provide enough 'special protection areas' for wild birds. A third dispute over the 'failure' to monitor levels of nitrous oxide is less advanced. Mr Howard said he did not expect any of the arguments to end in court.</p>

Simon, whose "The Rhythm of the  Saints" was released last month and is number 4 on the Billboard charts, will  perform at the Forum in Inglewood on Jan. 23 and 24 and at the San Diego Sports  Arena on Jan. 20. The tour will feature a 17-piece backing band, and a quartet  of percussionists will play such "instruments" as the jawbone of a mule, clay  pots and a pair of beach thongs fashioned from plumbing pipe.

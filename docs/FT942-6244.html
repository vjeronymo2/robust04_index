			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: More unemployed in France French unemployment rose to a new record in April, increasing by 4,900 to 3,325,800 or 12.3 per cent of the labour force, according to labour ministry statistics announced yesterday. However, the rising trend in unemployment has slowed markedly from last year, raising hopes for a stabilisation in joblessness. In the first four months of this year, unemployment increased by 23,500, compared with a rise of about four times that amount in the same period in 1993. Yesterday's announcement coincided with more optimistic official economic growth forecasts. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, told Le Figaro newspaper that gross domestic product this year was likely to exceed the government's 1.4 per cent forecast. Growth could reach the 1.6 per cent level forecast by the European Commission. John Ridding, Paris Industrial sales in the Netherlands rose 3.5 per cent in March from a year earlier and were up 1.3 per cent in the first quarter on a year-to-year basis, the government reported yesterday. Italy's foreign debt has fallen to L150,000bn (Pounds 63bn( from L175,000bn at the end of 1992, and a further reduction can be expected in 1994, according to Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio. Denmark's current account surplus slipped in February to DKr2.3bn (Pounds 237m) from DKr3.3bn the month before, but was unchanged from a year earlier, according to figures from the national statistics agency.</p>

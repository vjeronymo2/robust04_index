			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 28 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow  newspapers concentrate on a response to the murder of Andrey  Aizderdzis, member of the Russian parliament's lower chamber,  and on the signing of a treaty on social accord which will take  place in the Kremlin on Thursday.    No matter what were the reasons for the murder, the  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI newspaper notes, "its very fact committed a  day before the signing of a memorandum on civic accord and five  days before mass May demonstrations, can provoke a political  crisis".    Referring to the opinion of most Russian legislators, the  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper states that "it is chaos in the  country and Interior Ministry organs cannot do anything with it.  The underworld executes its sentences every day. Nothing can  stop it even the legislator's mandate".    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDa newspaper reports the murder under  the headline "Russian legislators have not been killed since  1917". Quoting statements by "some militia officers", the  newspaper concludes: "Aizderdzis was evidently killed, because  the WHO IS WHO newspaper, which he patronised, printed the list  of major criminals. It is out of question that he was killed for  political reasons".    The TRUD newspaper devotes several materials to this event  under the general headline "a shot at legislator also hit  minister (eds: Interior Minister Viktor Yerin)".    The newspaper reminds that the lower chamber demanded that  President Boris Yeltsin release the minister of his duties and  "use to the full his constitutional powers to establish law and  order immediately". TRUD quotes a statement by the Russian  leader that assassins will be found.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper singles out information  about this tragedy, noting that the assassination of the  lawmaker infuriated the lower house so much that it "almost  forbade its speaker (eds: Ivan Rybkin) to sign a treaty on civil  accord".    At the same time, it expresses doubts that Aizderdzis was  killed because of the above-mentioned publication in the WHO IS  WHO newspaper.    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper runs an article devoted to  Aizderdzis, noting: "Every of his speeches before audiences  resembled vigorous attacks". The newspaper claims that  Aizderdzis exposed families of those who gave orders to shoot at  innocent people during the tragic October days. "He said  everywhere that he was a participant in the parliament building  defence, a communist."    ROSSIISKIYE VESTI examines another leading theme of the  press  -- the signing of a treaty on social accord -- from a position  of "will the Russian nation obtain a creative perspective?".  Under the above headline, the newspaper prints several  materials devoted to this event.    "Russia is ready to obtain, at long last, a document of  nation- wide importance, without a precedent in national  history," says one of the articles. It is high time to  understand that the Russian nation, all its parties, movements  and segments of population, all its generations badly need  peaceful continuity.    "Sure, recent antagonists cannot agree with each other in  everything. But this is exactly the case when there cannot and  should not be victors and vanquished."    The PRAVDA newspaper believes that the treaty will be signed  by representatives of the so-called new bourgeoisie. "Nearly all  left-wing parties" will be against. The newspaper claims that  "there are grounds to believe that the signing of `the  agreement' will eventually turn either into a farce or a  tragedy."    TRUD publishes with some abbreviations a chapter from the  book "The President's Journal" by Boris Yeltsin. It is named "a  bleak streak". Describing the tragic events in moscow on  October 3-4, 1993, the author notes that "that was struggle  against the president, struggle for power... That was struggle  for changing the state foundations".    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper features an interview with  Viktor Samoilov, managing director of Rosvooruzhenie firm, a  state company on export and import of arms and combat materiel.    He writes that the company does not intend to surrender its  position in competition struggle. At the same time, it will be  guided, in future too, by the following motto: "Cooperation in  Trust". "We Are Open for Partnership".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (AFP) -- France and Saudi Arabia have  reached three arms agreements worth about nine billion francs  (1.5 billion dollars), the French Defence Ministry announced on  Tuesday [1 February].    The agreements, under discussion for the past four years,  are  for modernisation of warships and maintenance of missiles and  radar systems, and should provide about 9 million hours of work  for French industry and shipyards over the next six years, the  ministry said.    The ministry said the three contracts had required a final  go-ahead from the Saudis, and that go-ahead had been confirmed  by Second Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz Al Sa'ud  to French Defence Minister Francois Leotard.    The French announcement said that the confirmation was "the  first concrete act resulting from the two countries' desire to  strengthen their cooperation" after the visit to Riyadh by  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last January 8-9.    "The work and services needed for maintenance and  modernization of the frigates and of anti-aircraft defence  equipment will be undertaken as of this year, after payment of  the first down- payment", it said.    An authoritative source said that to win the contracts,  France agreed in its financial proposals in early January -- for  the first time -- that the contracts did not need to be paid for  at once, in the light of Saudi Arabia's cash position. The rate  at which the jobs will be carried out reflects the "schedule of  Saudi payments," which will be spread out over time, the source  said.    The three Franco-Saudi contracts are:    1) The ROH contract, worth 3.5 billion francs, calling for  modernization of four 2,000-tonne frigates and of two  10,000-tonne tanker resupply ships sold in 1980 (Sawari 1  contract). The renovation will be done in Toulon, on the  southern French coast, by Direction des Constructions Navales  (DCN).    The crews will remain on the six ships during the work,  during which some equipment and on-board arms systems will also  be modernized.    2) The SLBS maintenance contract, worth 3.4 billion francs,  a follow-up on the 'Al-Thaked contract of 1984 for supply of  short-range Crotale-Shahine ground-to-air missiles and of 30-mm  bitubes. French manufacturers will supply spare parts and  technical assistance.    3) The Shola maintenance contract, about 2 billion francs,  for pyrotechnic kits (firing systems) intended for the  short-range ground-to-air missiles already acquired by the  Saudis. The program will make it possible to replace several  hundred pyrotechnical propulsion lots relating to already  delivered missiles, and includes technical assistance.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Thames TV back in black with Pounds 15.2m THAMES TELEVISION's last year as an ITV contractor is proving to be a bumper one. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 15.2m, compared with losses last time of Pounds 4.04m. Lord Brabourne, chairman of Thames, at present the largest ITV company, said the results showed the progress made in achieving two main objectives: maximising shareholder value from the last year of the London weekday franchise and transforming the group's activities for the years ahead. 'I have every confidence in the future of Thames as a major force in television.' The group increased its share of ITV adverting revenue from 15.45 per cent to 15.73 per cent, a total of Pounds 121.6m. Earnings per share emerged at 17.5p compared with losses of 8.6p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.5p. Apart from the rise in advertising revenue and cost cutting, reductions in Exchequer Levy also helped the group's position. Reeves, the US production subsidiary, continued to incur an operating loss but positive signs included Covington Cross, a 13-part drama series commissioned for ABC.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Self-assessed tax plan is launched ALL INDIVIDUALS not taxed at source will be able to assess for themselves the amount of tax they should pay under radical proposals launched yesterday by the Inland Revenue. The self-assessment system, described in a consultation document issued yesterday, considerably broadens the scope of the system from proposals last year which simply mooted the system for the self-employed. Under the new version all other personal taxpayers receiving extra income - such as freelance payments, interest on investments, casual work or rent on a room - would be able to assess their own liability for tax. Income would be taxed for the current year. Those whose entire income is taxed at source through pay-as-you-earn schemes would not be affected by the changes. Taxpayers could still ask the Revenue to calculate their tax liability if they wished. For those using self-assessment, the Revenue would merely audit a small number of tax submissions, while accepting payments on liabilities which taxpayers had calculated themselves. The current tax system requires taxpayers to submit details of their income and assets, which is then assessed by the Revenue which calculates the tax to be paid. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in a foreword to the document: 'The proposals would make the personal tax system simpler and fairer. But they would involve considerable changes for taxpayers, tax advisers and the Inland Revenue.' The proposals would not be introduced until the 1995-96 tax year at the earliest, and then in a transitional form - with full introduction planned for 1996-97. The Revenue said the consultative document issued last year on self-assessment for the self-employed - those with schedule D tax returns - had been widely welcomed and there had been strong support to extend the system to other taxpayers. It has asked for submissions in response to the proposals by January 31. A Simpler System for Assessing Personal Tax.

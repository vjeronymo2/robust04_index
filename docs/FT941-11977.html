			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Net profit rises 22% for Kuwait bank National Bank of Kuwait (NBK), Kuwait's biggest commercial bank, has reported a 22.3 per cent rise in net profits for 1993 to KD52m (Dollars 175m) from KD42.5m in 1992. The bank ascribed its strong performance in an otherwise flat banking sector to expanded portfolio management services and good returns from its international activities. NBK retains the biggestinternational presence of any of Kuwait's six commercial banks. Total assets grew by 28.4 per cent to KD3.3bn, while customers' deposits increased by 13.6 per cent to KD1.95bn. NBK already holds more than 40 per cent of Kuwait's total bank deposits. An NBK statement said shareholders' funds increased toKD326m. The board approved a 23 per cent cash and 10 per cent stock dividend. The bank maintained a capital to risk ratio of more that 20 per cent and has consolidated its position as Kuwait's most soundly based bank, according to analysts. NBK was the sole Kuwaiti commercial bank to avoid serious damage from the collapse in 1982 of the unofficial Souq al-Manakh stock market. It managed to continue operations during the Gulf war through its London office. A new and complex law aimed at resolving the legacy of debt left by that crash, along with new debts created by the country's occupation by Iraq, overhang Kuwait's banking sector. The sector has also been subdued by the flat non-oil economy since the end of the Gulf war. NBK is to expand further its international network with a representative office in Vietnam, for which the bank won approval in September. Meanwhile, Dubai-based Mashreq Bank, the sole commercial bank free of government control, announced a 21 per cent rise in net profits for 1993 to Dh250.5m (Dollars 68.6m) from Dh207m in 1992. Operating income increased last year by 6.1 per cent to Dh624.8m. Pre-tax profit after provisions was up 17.5 per cent to Dh27.51m (Dollars 72.4m). Total assets increased 8 per cent to Dh11bn, while customer deposits were up 13 per cent to Dh7.4bn.</p>

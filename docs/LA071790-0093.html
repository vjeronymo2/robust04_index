			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAXICARE'S REORGANIZATION PLAN APPROVED  </P> <P> The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana on Monday approved Maxicare Health  Plan's reorganization proposal to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  </P> <P> The confirmation clears the last major hurdle for the Los Angeles-based health  maintenance organization to be released from court supervision, but a Maxicare  spokesman said additional technical requirements must be met for the plan to  become effective.  </P> <P> That is currently expected to happen in early October, ending a process that  began on March 16, 1989, when Maxicare filed for protection under pressure from  its bank lenders, other creditors and state regulators.  </P> <P> The reorganization plan requires that Maxicare meet certain cash requirements  in different categories before the plan becomes effective. "We have a  significant amount of cash on hand, but we still have to generate more. But we  don't anticipate that will be a problem," Maxicare spokesman Ed Coughlan said.  </P> <P> The company earlier received the necessary creditor and shareholder approval of  the plan.  </P> <P> It calls for the distribution of $129.3 million in cash, $67 million in notes  and new common stock and warrants to satisfy claims. Doctors and hospitals who  continue to provide services to Maxicare members will own 49% of the new  company. The new stock is expected to be issued shortly after the plan becomes  effective.  </P> <P> "We're thrilled with the significant progress we've made to date," Maxicare  Chairman and Chief Executive Peter J. Ratican said in a statement. "By  continuing to concentrate on providing good service along with access to  quality managed care at a reasonable cost, we will increase our membership and  our profitability," he said.  </P> <P> In confirming the plan, the court continued an injunction that prevents doctors  and hospitals from billing Maxicare members for debts owed by the company.  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Unions and farmers in rate protest Trade unionists, farmers and consumer groups yesterday protested over rising interest rates in a rally at the steps of the Federal Reserve building in Washington. A rate rise for the sixth time this year to counter the threat of inflation would 'clobber job prospects, squeeze wages, and raise mortgages and other loan payments for millions of Americans,' according to a rally leaflet. Popular concern about rising interest rates is shared by some business groups and economists. They believe the Fed and the bond market have grown 'paranoid' over inflation and have failed to take account of the the competitive conditions in the global economy which curb inflation. At a briefing last week sponsored by two Washington think-tanks - the Economic Strategy Institute and the Economic Policy Institute - a panel of economists and businessmen attacked what has been the fastest tightening of interest rates since the second world war. Mr Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said a majority of chief executive officers in NAM opposed further interest rate rises. 'There is no evidence the US economy is about to overheat, and any further rise in interest rates will simply stifle a steadily growing economy,' said Mr Jasinowski. The US can now produce more with less inflation, he said. 'While productivity growth was highest in the manufacturing sector from 1983 to 1993, price increases in manufacturing were the lowest.' Mr James Medoff, a Harvard economics professor, said businesses, already burdened by high levels of corporate debt, have been forced to cut employment and make use of temporary workers and overtime. 'Large wage increases are a last resort by firms seeking additional labour.' The Fed's concern about inflation may have inflamed the fears of foreign investors and currency traders, causing them to sell dollars, increasing the possibility of inflation, said Mr Medoff. 'The difficulties for the dollar began just when the interest rate increase began, and the sequence of events in the markets in February suggests that the Fed's action was the cause of the dollar's decline rather than a response to the dollar's decline,' he said. Mr Preston Martin, former Fed vice chairman, warned that continued rises next year 'portends too great a recession risk.'</p>

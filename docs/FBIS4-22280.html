Importers of  food products suffered the most, since up until recently a large  part of these goods had been imported duty-free. Now the amount  of import duties on a number of goods in this group will  comprise an average of 10-15 percent of the customs value.  Specifically, meat and meat products, fish, butter and vegetable  oil, milk and dairy products, fresh fruits and vegetables, white  sugar, grain and products made from it have been placed in the  category of food products which are subject to payment of duty.  Despite the fact that for individual types of food products,  sausage goods for example, the amount of duty has been increased  to 20 percent, in the opinion of the primary suppliers of these  types of goods to the Russian market, it is unlikely that there  will be a significant change in the level of their wholesale  prices in the near future. First of all, everyone was ready for  the introduction of the new import tariff, and therefore the  products were brought in ahead of time. Secondly, for now the  regimen of preferences is being retained, as is the possibility  of re-orienting our activity for delivery of a greater portion  of products from countries which enjoy these preferences, i.e.,  from the developing countries and the least developed countries.    The rates of import duty on the long-suffering alcoholic  beverages have been subject to significant changes. Added to the  recently increased excise tax rates were also increased import  duty rates. As for the rates themselves, evidently heeding the  repeatedly expressed wishes of domestic producers, the rate of  tariff on the import of alcohol will be fixed to the "literage."  For example, while on hard liquor (TN VED code 2208) the duty  will now comprise 2 EKYu for 1 liter, on ethyl alcohol  (220710000)--although the rate of tariff is set in percent of  the customs value--after final computation of the amount of  payment it should be correlated with the established 2 EKYu for  1 liter.    Undoubtedly, tariff determined in this manner excludes the  possibility of excessive underestimation of the contract value  (the favorite and easiest method of minimizing customs  payments). However, we must note that the representatives of the  domestic alcohol industry did not count on the setting of such  high duties for analogous import products. According to their  computations, the optimal duty rate for the import of alcoholic  beverages is approximately $1.5 for 1 liter. If this amount is  exceeded, the importers will be tempted to re-orient themselves  toward contraband import. However, prior to the arrival of the  designated time, direct importers of alcoholic beverages, just  as the importers of food products, had prepared a unique buffer  in order to smoothe the inevitable leap in wholesale and retail  prices: Today there are enough goods stored up in the warehouses  to ensure a "smooth price increase."    From the standpoint of the principle of defending the  interests of domestic producers, perhaps the most effective have  proven to be the innovations relating to the import of  automobiles. The recent increase in excise taxes on the import  of foreign makes has already yielded a "positive effect." With  the increased cost of foreign models, not only did their import  begin to decline, but consumers began to exhibit increased  interest in domestic-made automobiles. This sets new tasks for  their dealers. As for the owners of automobile dealerships, in  their opinion, under the new conditions the main part of the  income will now come from servicing the rather large pool of  foreign made cars which already exists in Russia and selling  spare parts for them.</p>

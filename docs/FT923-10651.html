			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Jobs: The virtue of a maligned 523-year-old - When it comes to running organisations, Machiavelli's rulings have stood the test of time AS this is the Jobs column's last appearance before a month's summer holiday, may it be permitted to take up the cudgels on behalf of a much maligned person? His name was Niccolo Machiavelli. Such an intervention in his case is scarcely premature. The late Florentine political adviser has been getting the bad mouth for over half a millennium. Or so we're informed, at least, by Shakespeare who had him described as 'murderous' by the treacherous Duke of Gloucester, then still in the early stages of plotting to take over as Richard III, some time before King Henry VI was finally done away with in 1471. How unjust a slur that is can be gauged from the fact that Machiavelli was at most two years old at the time, having been born in 1469. But my leap to his defence is needled by more recent events. The goad is that a large, though sadly unrecorded number of people have been accusing me of damaging the cause of good management by inciting career-minded executives to adopt 'Machiavellian tactics'. The reason why I haven't kept a tally of the said accusations is that the first few of them were delivered nearly a year ago. They arrived soon after my return from last summer's holiday in the September when I reported having stumbled across a re-freshingly frank book about management, called The Bosses in Britain and The Managers in America, first published in 1958. For instance, one thing pointed out by its authors - Professor Rosemary Stewart and Roy Lewis - is that economists and such are indulging in theoretical fancies when they assume that executives uniformly put their companies' interests before their own. Real-life management is 'a system of power, a hierarchy of positions', in which top bosses' personal ambitions often clash with the interests of the outfits they run. That report provoked a goodly handful of objections, all right, and not only from economists either. Further flurries followed my later reports on 1990s books by two other professors of management - The Organisation of Hypocrisy by Sweden's Nils Brunsson, and Managing with Power by Jeffrey Pfeffer of the US - which argue on similar lines. But the latest spate of nearly two dozen written and telephoned protests was occasioned by the Jobs column of just four weeks ago about a study by psychologist Rob Irving, of the Whitehead Mann consultancy in London, of 300 successful senior executives. He found that the traits which singled them out from people ranked lower in management were not the sort of abilities that win top marks in master's degree courses at business schools. Indeed, on verbal and numerical reasoning tests, the scores of the 300 were only around the average for managerial staff as a whole. Their differences from the general run were in their personalities. They shared a voracious need to have power over other people, for instance. They were also marked by a lust for personal achievement, being fiercely competitive in pursuing the extremely high aims they had set for themselves to the extent of being ruthless with anyone seen as standing in their way. Even so, what has provoked the latest grumbles is not doubt that Dr Irving's findings are right. All the 22 people who have made protests say that they themselves have worked under bosses of the type he describes. The point of the objections is not the fact that power-hungry and intellectually undistin-guished characters do tend to take the topmost jobs, in big companies particularly. The point is the moral claim that they shouldn't do so, because it is clearly not in organisations' best interests that they should be run by what no fewer than eight of the protesters refer to in terms such as 'the sort of people championed by Machiavelli'. Now, although holding no brief for the types identified by Rob Irving, I am far from sure that it is right to condemn either them or Machiavelli on such moral high ground. Theorising about the sort of people who ought to run organisations is far easier than actually running them. And that is a job in which all the evidence suggests power-politicking plays a large and indispensable role. What's more, it's a job in which the advice handed down by Machiavelli has stood the test of time. Take for instance his warning to aspiring change-agents: ' . . .there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. The reason is that the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who only may do well in the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans; whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.' I can imagine at least one person who might ruefully reflect on those words right at this moment. He is Sir Peter Kemp who last week was pushed into early retirement from his top civil service post. On the Monday he was being publicly praised by his political boss, Citizen's Charter minister William Waldegrave, for his 'outstanding success' in driving through the biggest changes to Britain's central bureaucracy for nigh 150 years. A couple of days later, he was out of a job. True, there is a drawback to that particular Machiavellian ruling. Its nub is that executives who want to stay at the top of their organisation do best to avoid responsibility for making radical reforms, however much they may be needed. The smart thing is to saddle someone else with the responsibility instead. But if it is true - as it seems to be - that there is usually a heavy risk in pushing through sweeping changes, then it is surely morally better for the fact to be brought out into the open so executives at all levels may be forewarned. And that is where Machiavelli's great service to posterity lies. Fortunately it is a virtue which, despite Shakespeare's slur on him, was known to one of the bard's contemporaries - Sir Francis Bacon, who wrote: 'We are much beholden to Machiavel and others, that they write what men do, and not what they ought to do.' Moreover, if the Jobs column ever came to be counted among the associated 'others', it would be proud. FINALLY before the holiday to another topic of readers' complaints: the recent absence of any puzzles centred on decoding letters into figures of the sort printed here last year. By way of atonement, here's a division sum. E CSDAOS DMC L E RSL A DMM R L E R D A O S O D TOSO D TOS I'll hope to meet you again in five weeks' time.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dutch bank launches Ecu note programme DE NATIONALE Investeringsbank, the Dutch banking group with strong links to the government, has set up an Ecu500m Euro-medium-term note programme, in a move to expand and diversify its funding base. The programme will be used to 'tap the international capital markets on a more systematic basis' than in the past, said Mr Peter van der Lugt, a member of the DNIB board of managing directors. The bank's borrowing programme is set to increase from Fl 2.5bn (Dollars 1.57bn) this year to more than Fl 3bn in 1993, as its balance sheet grows. In addition, demand from the bank's corporate clients for loans denominated in dollars has increased its need for foreign currency borrowing. In future, about half of the bank's funding will be sought in the international capital markets, through the MTN programme and Eurobond offerings. The programme, arranged by Morgan Stanley, has been rated AA plus by Standard &amp; Poor's and Aa3 by Moody's. Last year, prior to seeking a debt rating, the bulk of the bank's Fl 2bn funding was in the domestic private placement and bond markets, and in the Japanese and Swiss private placement markets.</p>

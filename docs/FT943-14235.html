			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity The regulator's decision not to liberalise the wholesale electricity market will be regarded as a climb-down by large energy users. Big industrial companies had been pressing for the right to buy electricity outside the pool and for changes to the bidding process by which pool prices are set. Offer has given them neither. Yet the regulator's overall conclusion that the costs and risks of tinkering with the present arrangements outweigh the likely benefits has merit. Changing the system of marginal pricing - whereby all generators receive the highest bid required to meet demand - would not necessarily lead to cheaper electricity. At present small generators which have signed long-term gas supply contracts put in artificially low bids to be sure of constant business. Bidding practice would change if generators were held to their individual bids. These smaller generators would have to guess where to pitch their bids to be sure of winning business. National Power and PowerGen, which have more flexible plant and are almost always the marginal bidder, would find such a system easier to play. Their market power might actually increase. The decision not to allow large users to buy outside the pool is, on the surface, harder to defend. But Offer is right to worry about maintaining volume and transparency in the pool. Since the two large players have the advantage of a range of fully-depreciated generating capacity, they might anyway have picked up the best of the outside contracts.</p>

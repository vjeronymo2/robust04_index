			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Wholesalers lead distribution recovery A STRONG and better-than-expected increase in sales among UK wholesalers in September made up for a patchy performance among British retailers and helped the UK distributive trades as a whole to their best year-on-year growth in sales since May 1989. While the Confederation of British Industry expects rising sales in the retail, wholesale and motor trades this month, its latest survey of all three distributive trades shows concern at the uneven growth of sales volumes in Britain's high streets. The survey, completed by 512 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between September 9 and October 6, suggests the three sectors as a whole should this month have their biggest year-on-year increase in volume sales for five years. But the experiences of differing sectors vary widely. Among the 318 retailers polled, grocers, footwear and leather retailers and chemists reported strong growth in sales volumes in the year to September and expect further strong increases this month. Specialist food stores said sales declined in the year to September, as did retailers of durable household goods. Confectionery sales were unchanged. Clothing retailers reported only a small increase in sales in the year to September. This was expressed as a balance of plus 14 percentage points, representing the difference between the percentage of outlets reporting an increase in sales over the 12 months and the percentage disclosing a decline.  This is the method used by the CBI to express sentiment. Only two classes of retailer reported a year-on-year decline in sales. But overall, retailers were far less satisfied with last month's volume of sales than is normal for the time of year. Grocers and merchants dealing in footwear and leather were the only retailers to say their sales were better than average last month. Even among chemists, where the balance of companies reporting sales growth increased to plus 61 percentage points in September from 37 in August, the number of companies saying business was poor for the time of year exceeded those that said it was good by 14 points. The September survey showed a further strengthening of market power among the larger retailing chains. The number reporting increased sales volumes last month exceeded those saying that sales declined by 31 percentage points. This compared with an average of plus 25 points for the retail sector as a whole. Single outlet retailers reported an overall drop in sales compared with last September, with a balance of minus 10 points. By contrast, the mood among wholesalers shifted from gloom in August to optimism last month. The balance of companies reporting an increase in sales jumped to plus 49 points last month from plus 11 points in August. Motor traders reported 'reasonable' sales growth last month after August's strong increase, with sales of parts and accessories growing faster than vehicle sales.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                ANNUAL GROWTH IN SALES VOLUMES (reported)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Sept   Oct   Nov   Dec  Jan   Feb  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail sales total             +4    -4    -9    -4  +11   +19 Grocers                        +1   +19    +2   +34  +44   +30 Specialist food               -50   -28   -24   -67  -11   -13 Off licences                 -100   -56   -47   -40  -49   -11 Clothing                      +42    -8   -18    +2  +19   +10 Footwear and leather          +39   -49   +11   -11  +28   +74 Durable household goods       -11    -1   -10   -18   -4    +5 Furniture and carpets         +48   -12   +15    -3  -35   +48 Hardware, china &amp; DIY         -52   +11   -38   -33   +6    +6 Confectionery                 +37    +4     0   +21  -31   +12 Booksellers &amp; stationers       -1   -39   -53   -39  -18   -12 Chemists                      -28   +58   +79    +6  +66   +48 Other retail                   +5   -23   -44   +20   +5    +4 Motor trades                  -33   -30   -31    +3  +20   +30  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail sales total              +25   +17   +18   +30   +32   +31   +25 Grocers                         +42   +24   +21   +43   +38   +37   +59 Specialist food                  -3   -31   +49   +18   +13    +5   -14 Off licences                    -24   -26   -35   -35   -23    -3   +23 Clothing                        +27   +24    -1   +40   +55   +59   +14 Footwear and leather            +37   +43   -55   +43   +55   +37   +84 Durable household goods          +1   +23   +37   +10   +12    +3   -16 Furniture and carpets           +40   +27   +34   +54   +31   +53   +17 Hardware, china &amp; DIY           +46   +29    +3    -5   +10   +14   +23 Confectionery                   +36   +10   +20    +3   +13   +30     0 Booksellers &amp; stationers         +4   +47   +46   +37   +49   +22   +20 Chemists                        -12   +44   +27   +44   +44   +37   +61 Other retail                    +30    -6   +11    +8   +14    -3   +14 Motor trades                    +29    +2    -2    -6    +8   +27   +15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance = % reporting an increase minus the % reporting a decrease in sales compared with a year before  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> VIGILANTES STRING UP THE MARLBORO MAN;  </P> <P> TWO ANTI-CIGARETTE DECISIONS MAKE A MOCKERY OF FAIR PLAY.  </P> <P> Last month, the New Jersey Supreme Court joined California lawmakers in cutting  its legal conscience to fit contemporary anti-cigarette fashions. In Dewey vs.  Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co., New Jersey's highest tribunal held that  cigarette companies could be answerable in damages under state law based on  health warnings that satisfied federal law and on the defective design of  cigarettes. In 1989, California inaugurated a broadcast crusade against tobacco  manufacturers portraying their executives and smokers as morally akin to Saddam  Hussein. Both demarches illustrate mob justice and undermine the arch of  civilized government.  </P> <P> The Dewey case displayed judicial prejudice at its worst. Wilfred Dewey smoked  cigarettes for four decades before his 1980 death stemming from lung cancer.  His smoking continued after legions of federal trumpeters had sounded clarion  calls of warning.  </P> <P> In 1964, the U.S. surgeon general issued a much ballyhooed report finding  correlations between smoking and lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, emphysema,  cardiovascular disease and cancer of the larynx. The following year, Congress  enacted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act.  </P> <P> It required cigarette packages to warn that: "The Surgeon General Has  Determined That Cigarette Smoking May Be Dangerous To Your Health." In 1970,  the warning was made more definitive. The Federal Trade Commission issued  companion rules regulating cigarette advertising.  </P> <P> Despite these unambiguous and omnipresent health warnings, Dewey chose to smoke  in lieu of a more puritanical existence. He never protested that the pleasures  he derived from cigarettes were not worth their health risks, and thus lacked  any legitimate cause for complaint.  </P> <P> His widow, nevertheless, sued tobacco companies for damages on behalf of  herself and her husband's estate. Resting on state tort law, the complaint  charged the defendants with negligence in failing to adequately warn smokers of  health hazards, and with strict liability for defectively designing cigarettes.  </P> <P> Addressing the first claim, the New Jersey Supreme Court parted company with  contrary holdings by five federal appellate courts and its sister state court  in Minnesota. This galaxy of wisdom had concluded that the federal Cigarette  Act preempted state law damage claims based on inadequate warnings.  </P> <P> The express purposes of the federal law fortify these holdings: adequate  cigarette health warnings and preservation of national cigarette markets. The  first postulates that compliance with federal warning rules are adequate to  inform the public. It is at war with any state rule authorizing damages by  second-guessing of warning adequacy.  </P> <P> Further, it ignores commercial reality to insist that the second purpose would  be undisturbed by acrophobic state liability risks based on inadequate  labeling. They would compel tobacco manufacturers to atomize and tailor sales  and promotions to fit disparate state tort laws.  </P> <P> The New Jersey Supreme Court, nevertheless, held that cigarette companies could  be liable for damages by failing to volunteer more warnings than federal law  stipulated. It also concluded that state law would make cigarette companies  liable for injuries caused by smoking if a jury determines that a different  cigarette design might have reduced health risks without impairing consumer  utility.  </P> <P> But a design defect claim is a euphemism for vigilante justice. How do tobacco  companies prove the utility of smoking? Do they call smokers to testify to the  sensual, psychological or emotional benefits derived from cigarettes? How does  a jury assign them a dollar value? Is the average utility to smokers the  pertinent calculation, or the utility to deceased smokers whose deaths  precipitated the lawsuits? How do manufacturers prove that altering the  ingredients of cigarettes to reduce health risks would reduce consumer  pleasures? Must they conduct expensive marketing experiments and user surveys?  Must they prove that different ingredients would cause a substantial profit  loss?  </P> <P> These questions corroborate that the Dewey ruling empowers juries to hold  manufacturers liable for defective cigarette design by whim or enmity.  </P> <P> In 1989, California levied a 25-cent cigarette tax to fund a frenzied broadcast  campaign against tobacco companies. The state-subsidized polemics mock  elemental fairness and First Amendment principles because U.S. law prohibits  cigarette companies from responding on the airwaves.  </P> <P> Genuine justice requires evenhanded protection of both the honorable and the  hated. Anti-cigarette laws in New Jersey and California flunk the test.  </P></p>

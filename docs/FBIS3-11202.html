			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994.    Ruben Blades, Papa Egoro Party presidential candidate, met  with Colon Free Zone businessmen and merchants to exchange ideas  and hear suggestions on the future of that free zone. Blades  proposed holding a referendum in October for a Constituent  Assembly to reform the current Constitution which he said is not  fitting for the nation's future and much less for the 21st  century. (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish  1730 GMT 11 Mar 94)    Blades, during a debate organized by the Panamanian  Ecumenical Committee on 14 March, proposed "a moratorium on the  payment of the foreign debt in order to give a solution to the  serious social problems that the vast majority are  experiencing." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 16  Mar p 1)    Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" ticket presidential  candidate  and former comptroller general, said during a debate organized  by the Panamanian Ecumenical Committee on 14 March that he "had  nothing to do with the foreign debt" payment to international  financial institutions. Carles' remarks that the U.S. operation  in Panama had not been an "invasion," rather a "liberation," was  rejected by other party members and sympathizers while he called  the audience present at the debate "ignorant" on these two  issues: the foreign debt and the U.S. invasion. (Panama City LA  ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1)    Carles on 14 March visited San Miguelito District where he  heard expressions of general discontent from the residents.  Carles has stepped up his political campaign not only in the  capital but also in the countryside. On his visit last week to  Veraguas Province, he said: "I had the opportunity to reiterate  what I had said was a fundamental matter in that sector: a  reforestation program as well as the development of a tourist  site on Montijo Gulf." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94)    Carles reiterated on 15 March in San Miguelito District that  he will solve the public services problems in 100 days. "I have  been able to confirm that the basic problem of these urban and  suburban areas is the lack of jobs -- which we will generate --  and the deficiency in public services. In the first 100 days of  my administration these will be improved," Carles noted. (Panama  City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 15 Mar 94)    Samuel Lewis Galindo, National Consensus Alliance  presidential candidate, called for nonviolence in the campaign.  "The presidential candidates and the party leaders favor that  the political campaign be conducted within certain levels and  certain bounds so violent passions are not unleashed. I am  certain that this is the position of the seven presidential  candidates. It goes without saying that there are small groups  that commit censurable actions, however there is still time to  halt them," Lewis Galindo noted. (Panama City Telemetro  Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 11 Mar 94)    Lewis Galindo went on the campaign trail to diverse towns in  Cocle Province, taking the message of change to the residents.  He also visited some residential areas of El Cristo where he  was warmly received. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94)    Lewis Galindo said Panama currently has a foreign debt  larger  than the one it had on 20 December 1989. Lewis Galindo added  that the current negotiators of that debt do not want to  recognize their responsibilities and the errors they made and  that there is no such Economic Plan. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE  PANAMA in Spanish 16 Mar p 1)    Lewis Galindo, while visiting residents in the poor Boca La  Caja neighborhood, promised to make an all-out effort during his  administration to generate jobs and improve living conditions.  "In these poor neighborhoods we want to create an emergency  plan that will give jobs to 50,000 Panamanians, to improve -- in  these same neighborhoods -- the social conditions of so many  people," Lewis Galindo said. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 10 Mar 94)    Mireya Gruber, Arnulfist Party, PA, presidential candidate,  said she was not able yesterday to attend the renewal of the  electoral ethical commitment because she was on the campaign  trail. "I arrived at home at 2300, and this is why I did not  attend. However, our candidates did," Mireya Gruber noted. "We  will respect our commitment." (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 10 Mar 94)    PA party members held a Democratic Alliance dinner in favor  of the 8 May elections and in honor of candidate Mireya Gruber.  PA and Liberal Party personalities attended the dinner led by  Mireya Gruber. During her speech Gruber made reference to  diverse points of her government platform; among these  employment, sports, and housing. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Mar 94)    Gruber over the weekend participated in a three-day tour of  Chiriqui Province, reaffirming her promise to keep in touch with  the people. Our government will be for all Panamanians, said  Mireya Gruber, indicating that health, education, employment,  and housing problems will have top priority in her  administration. Gruber also urged the younger generation to  stay away from drugs. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 14 Mar 94)    Gruber said she will file formal charges against the PRD  with  the Justice and Peace Commission for attacking her in Chiriqui.  The PRD publicly rejected the attack by one of its party  members. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300  GMT 15 Mar 94)    Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary Party,  PRD, presidential candidate, announced yesterday during a Rotary  Club meeting possible changes to the Labor Code, should he win  the coming elections. He urged the United States to make clear  whether it has any intention of keeping a military presence in  Panama after the year 2000. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in  Spanish 16 Mar p 1)    Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party, PDC,  presidential candidate, said during a debate organized by the  Panamanian Ecumenical Committee on 14 March that one of his  government program's top priorities is "to postpone payment of  the foreign debt."

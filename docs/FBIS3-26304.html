On  the Hong Kong issue, however, Sino-British talks were terminated  unilaterally by the British side, which deliberately raised  obstacles, although both sides had carried out 17 rounds of  talks for more than seven months. This is an unfavorable factor  to Hong Kong's steady transition, but not a decisive factor.  Hong Kong's economic situation is good. Some 12 percent of  Hong Kong people who have settled down abroad over the past 10  years or so have returned. Many Hong Kong citizens say that they  have full confidence in Hong Kong's future.    The breakdown of talks is something we do not wish to see.  This has been proved by the unremitting efforts the Chinese  side has made from the beginning to the end of the talks.  However, what has now happened is also not unexpected. As  early as 1982 when meeting with former British Prime Minister  Mrs. Thatcher, Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave the following  prediction: "What I am concerned about is how to ensure a  smooth transition in the next 15 years. I am afraid that great  disorders may appear during this period. But they will all be  manmade disorders, disorders made not only by foreigners, but  also Chinese, but mainly the British." The old-line British  colonialists have occupied the territory of Hong Kong, their  last colony, for more than 100 years. They will certainly be  unhappy about quiting immediately, although they also often  spout high-sounding words of democracy. The current problem is  how we should look at the situation we are facing.    Some Hong Kong citizens with foresight said: "We must rely  on our own efforts to ensure a smooth transition in Hong Kong."    In the past, because of the weak and corrupted royal court  of  the Qing Dynasty and the force of the British imperialists,  three unequal treaties were signed. As a result, Britain has  occupied this Chinese territory for more than 100 years.    On 19 December 1984, the heads of the Chinese and British  Governments signed in Beijing a joint declaration on the Hong  Kong issue after two years of talks. On 27 May 1985, the two  governments put the Sino-British Joint Declaration into effect  by exchanging instruments of ratification in Beijing. The  long-cherished wishes of the Chinese people finally came true.  This could never have been done either by the Qing Court or in  old China. The dream of the Chinese people can be turned into  reality only today, when China has become powerful. In his  speech delivered at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central  Advisory Commission, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Why could  talks on the Hong Kong issue be held successfully? It was not  because the participants on our side had special skills. The  main reason was that our country had developed in the past few  years and become a prosperous country, a powerful country, and a  trustworthy country. We keep our word and mean what we say."  Hong Kong's prosperity and return and Macao's return have all  benefited from this, and so will the reunification of the  motherland in the future. This is where our confidence lies.    Under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic  line and with the intensification of reform and expansion of the  opening up drive, our country will become more powerful. The  party and state are fully confident on this point. By adhering  to the policy of "one country, two systems," further  intensifying reform, and opening wider to the outside world, the  Basic Law will go deeper into the hearts of the people....Our  future is certainly bright.    The new year is approaching. Let us look at the brighter  future with full confidence!</p>

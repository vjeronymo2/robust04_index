			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mu'tazz al-Hadidi report] </F>   [Text] official sources in the Manpower and Employment  Ministry have disclosed that approximately 500,000 Egyptian  workers have returned from Libya because of the negative effects  of the economic embargo imposed on the Libyan Jamahiriyah after  the Lockerbie crisis. These sources pointed out that the  Egyptian workers in Libya are faced with two options: Either to  accept transforming their work contracts to local contracts and  thus lose housing and transportation allowances or to return to  Egypt. The Foreign Ministry has formed a committee of all  concerned agencies to request the Security Council to speed up  efforts to pay compensation to the countries that are harmed by  the continuing embargo imposed on the Libyan Jamahiriyah.</p>

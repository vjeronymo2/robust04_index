			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Desert island discs Britain's commercial television viewers may be surprised to see a 30-second advertisement promoting the services of Andersen Consulting sandwiched between promotions for instant coffee and cars. In the advertisement, a man stranded on a desert island finds a wooden crate containing a desktop computer. The castaway ingeniously constructs a raft from the crate and paddles off towards the horizon - using the computer keyboard as an oar. The message - echoed in newsprint and poster adverts featuring the slogan 'metamorphosis in a world of change' - is that Andersen Consulting can help its clients profit from change. The campaign is evidence of increasing competition among management consultants, particularly in technology, which is attracting not just the big management consultants, but also computer hardware and systems companies. Although similar marketing campaigns by service companies are familiar in the US, they are only just catching on in Europe. However, most of Andersen's competitors are dubious about the value of television advertising, which they argue can be useful to promote knowledge of a firm's name, but is ineffective in generating new business. Keith Burgess, Andersen's UK managing partner, says the Pounds 1m-plus mass-media campaign is aimed at raising general awareness of Andersen Consulting. 'We want people to know we are not just another (consultancy) arm of an accounting firm,' he says. Because the firm's consultancy work in the public and private sectors directly affects thousands of workers, Burgess also hopes the campaign will convey 'our personality' to a wide audience. One of Andersen's press advertisement juxtaposes the artist Jackson Pollock's style of 'abstract expressionism' with the 'realism' of Roy Lichtenstein in order to show how the complex abstract can be transformed into the tangible. Burgess is delighted with the 'metamorphosis theme' which he says 'gets across what we are trying to do with our clients'.</p>

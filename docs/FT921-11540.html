			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Secretive sale of BTG THE FINAL crumbs of the government's privatisation meal are proving hard to digest. The recent debacle of the privatisation of the trust ports has garnered much bad publicity. But similar potential problems surround the British Technology Group sell-off. In both cases the unusual nature of the organisations has led to an elaborate and ambiguous bidding procedure, in which unspecified weight is attached to considerations other than price. To make matters still more opaque, the government and Price Waterhouse, its financial adviser on the sales of the ports and BTG, appear to be imposing an information black-out on both. As the successor to the National Research Development Corporation, set up by the post-war Labour government, BTG still plays an important role in commercialising publicly-funded research in UK universities and controls an impressive portfolio of British intellectual property. At the same time, it is expanding internationally under the banner of 'the world's largest technology transfer organisation'. The public interest in BTG's fate is greater than the estimated proceeds of the sale - Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m - might indicate. Last year the government gave parliament assurances that it would protect the independence of BTG and prevent any asset-stripping. For example, bids would be accepted only from consortia in which no shareholder had a stake of more than 15 per cent, and trade buyers would be excluded. Strong involvement with UK universities and existing BTG staff and management would also be encouraged. No disclosures The bidding process is now well under way. The deadline for preliminary proposals was four weeks ago and shortlisted consortia have to submit final bids by February 19. But Price Waterhouse and the Department of Trade and Industry have disclosed nothing about the submissions, not even the number being considered in the final round. And, according to current plans, no information will be released about the losing bids even when the winner is announced - probably just before the general election. So far, two consortia have identified themselves as second-round bidders. One, led by BTG management and staff, offers the prospect of continued international expansion from an independent UK base. The other, headed by Research Corporation Technologies, BTG's leading competitor in the US, would provide an instant Anglo-American alliance and could develop more quickly into a global technology transfer organisation. They offer different visions of the future that both are keen to debate in public. Yet they have been warned to disclose no details of their investors and only the bare bones of their business plans. Competitive pressure According to Price Waterhouse, the secrecy is intended to keep up the competitive pressure on the participants, on the ground that they are likely to make higher offers if they are not sure against whom they are bidding. In the case of BTG, however, getting the best price is not the only important consideration. Indeed if the government were really concerned about maximising its return from the sale it would not have set up such an elaborate privatisation process, in which the fees are estimated already to have consumed more than 10 per cent of the likely revenues. The best way of ensuring that the qualitative 'public interest' issues are properly balanced against price is to make the bidding as open as possible. The government should not only name the second round bidders, but also specify clearly the weights attached to the various non-financial criteria in evaluating their submissions. The most important criterion should be a long-term commitment to BTG's core business, the profitable exploitation of technology. When the government announces the winner, it should also publish all the shortlisted bids, at least in outline. As with the trust ports privatisation, the BTG sale has no chance of commanding public support unless it is seen to have been conducted fairly.</p>

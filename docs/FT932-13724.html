			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A taste for expansion - Two nationally based companies have successfully crossed European frontiers Ever since enthusiasm for the single market gripped the European food industry in the late 1980s, its efforts to expand across frontiers have been ruled by two articles of faith. One is that smaller fry stand little chance in a sector increasingly dominated by multinational manufacturers and powerful retailers. The other is that acquiring local businesses and brands, rather than building sales from scratch, is the quickest way to break into foreign markets. However, Molkerei Alois Muller, a privately-owned Bavarian dairy company, has defied this conventional wisdom by seizing leadership of the UK yoghurt market from under the noses of long-established competitors, including some of Europe's biggest multinationals. Until six years ago, the Muller name was unknown outside Germany, where it has grown in the past two decades from a village dairy with four employees into a business with sales last year of Pounds 250m and 11 per cent of the domestic dairy products market. By last year Muller had become Britain's 26th largest grocery brand, out-selling old favourites such as Birds Eye frozen foods, Mars bars and Heinz tomato ketchup. Today it commands more than a fifth of the Pounds 450m-a-year yoghurt market. That puts it well ahead of Ski, made by Express, part of Northern Foods, and Unigate's St Ivel Shape, which together dominated the business a decade ago: today their share has dwindled to less than 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the world's two biggest yoghurt brands - Danone, made by France's BSN, and Chambourcy, made by Nestle of Switzerland - hold barely 2 per cent of the UK market. Muller owes its UK growth largely to one product, its 'twin-pot' Fruit Corner, which still provides more than 80 per cent of its UK sales. Though hardly embodying a technical revolution, even competitors admit its mild flavour, creamy consistency and separate compartments for yoghurt and fruit were new to British consumers. 'Previously, yoghurts sold in Britain were samey, boring and of low quality, verging on commodities,' says Ken Wood, managing director of Muller's UK subsidiary. 'There was lots of marketing but no real product innovation.' Furthermore, yoghurt consumption, at 5.35kg per head annually, is a quarter the level in Germany, where it is eaten by 80 per cent of the population, compared with 50 per cent in the UK. These conditions made Britain a natural choice for Muller's first cross-border foray. Wood was hired to lead the attack in early 1986 from Express's Eden Vale unit, then owned by Grand Metropolitan, where he was marketing director. For several months he banged at supermarket doors, to be told that Muller's products were faddish, too expensive or otherwise unsuitable. Then, in March 1987, Tesco agreed to test them in 170 stores, where they sold well. Wood's next step was to buy commercials on Border Television and arrange for selected outlets in the region to stock Muller yoghurts on a trial basis. The positive results helped convince previously sceptical retailers to take Muller seriously. Today, its products are stocked by outlets handling 95 per cent of UK grocery sales and backed by a Pounds 5m annual television advertising budget. Wood says he also won over supermarkets by promising that Muller would soon make its yoghurts in Britain. A year ago it opened an ultra-modern Pounds 30m plant near Market Drayton, Shropshire, which is currently producing about 500m pots of yoghurt a year. Today, Muller employs 250 people in the UK and is already expanding the plant. Wood attributes much of the company's success to the dogged perseverance and entrepreneurial attitude of its owner, Theo Muller. But even Wood is bemused by the speed of growth in the UK. 'It seems you can gain critical mass for a brand which, for no apparent reason, then achieves its own momentum,' he says. Some competitors, however, think the company risks over-reaching itself. They point out that its sales are still based heavily on one product line which has yet to prove long-term staying power and has recently attracted hordes of imitators. Wood insists the UK yoghurt market, which is growing by 10 per cent annually, still offers plenty of potential. He is widening its yoghurt range and may start selling other products, such as flavoured milk drinks, which have proved popular in Germany. The Shropshire plant may also supply markets in France, Belgium and Scandinavia. Perhaps the strongest reason for Wood's confidence is his belief that Muller has little to fear from a cosy club of traditional UK dairy producers, which have been lulled into complacency by 60 years of milk supply monopoly and little international competition. 'The fact that there are now 15 Fruit Corner look-alikes shows they still haven't learned the lesson,' says Wood. 'It is so much easier to copy than to innovate. That's what they've always done in the past.'</p>

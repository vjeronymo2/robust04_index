At a news conference in Kiev Monday, he  pointed out that candidates of Rukh and the democratic bloc had  been either elected or passed on to the second round of the  elections in most constituencies of the Republic.    "There is hope that the new Supreme Soviet will be better  and  it will be possible to structure it by creating factions and  blocs," Chernovil said. He pointed out that these elections  were more free and democratic than before. However, numerous  violations which influenced the electors' choice in favor of the  ruling party had been revealed, according to Chernovil.    "Rukh will react calmly to any change in the timing of  Ukrainian presidential elections," Chernovil was quoted as  saying. He added that it was ridiculous to elect the head of  the state without defining his legislative powers beforehand.  However, Rukh insists that the election day must be set exactly  so that either the old, or the new parliament could pass the  necessary laws. At the same time, Chernovil spoke against  granting the Ukrainian president extra powers.    The Rukh leader believes that the results of the opinion  polls in the Donets Basin and the Crimea will have no legal  force. "If the leaders of the state hold firm and stick to the  law, everything will take its course as it should in a  democratic country," he said.</p>

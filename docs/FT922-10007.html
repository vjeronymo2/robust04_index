			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Australian interest rates set to decline AUSTRALIA'S official short-term interest rates are expected to fall by one percentage point to 6.5 per cent today, in spite of indications that recovery from 18 months of recession is already under way. Economists said strong growth in building approvals and a higher than expected current account deficit in March were unlikely to dissuade the Reserve Bank from announcing the cut at its monthly meeting. Most thought the bank had little option in the face of pressure from the federal Labor government and its allies in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said last week that the publication of figures showing 1.7 per cent inflation in the year to March had removed any obstacles which stood in the way of a reduction. The unexpectedly low inflation outcome added to pressure for a cut of one percentage point rather than the half point cut previously under consideration. Mr Bill Kelty, ACTU secretary and a member of the Reserve Bank board, argued strongly in an interview published yesterday that the larger cut was needed to ensure that the recovery gathered strength. The authorities showed no concern about the March balance of payments figures, which showed a seasonally adjusted deficit of ADollars 938m (Pounds 399m), compared to a revised ADollars 625m in February. Mr Dawkins said the figures showed the full year deficit was likely to undershoot the government's budget forecast of ADollars 14bn, compared to ADollars 15.7bn last year. He also pointed to a 2 per cent increase in exports as evidence of the improved competitiveness of Australian manufacturers. However, merchandise imports rose by 3 per cent, reducing the merchandise trade surplus by ADollars 46m to ADollars 428m. The government also announced yesterday that building approvals had risen by 6.9 per cent in March, the third increase in four months. The number of approvals in force is now 24 per cent higher than in March 1991.</p>

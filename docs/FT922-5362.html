			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Japan to push through law on peace force JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party is this week planning to force through the Diet controversial legislation which would allow Japanese troops to serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions abroad. After nearly 18 months of debate the LDP last week secured support for the bills from two centrist parties. Despite prolonged negotiations, the ruling party failed to reach a compromise with the main socialist opposition party, the Social Democrats, and is braced for some rowdy scenes in the Diet. The socialists have threatened to disrupt proceedings. The government is likely to triumph but it has had to dilute its original proposals. In particular, the Diet will have a right of veto over each proposed mission, including planned Japanese participation in United Nations action in Cambodia. The bills were conceived by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the height of the Gulf crisis, in response to international criticism of Japan's failure to send personnel to the US-led allied force. The ministry's proposals sparked a wide-ranging debate about Japan's role in the world, with the country dividing between those wanting the nation to have more influence in international affairs and those claiming Japan's pacifist constitution prohibited troops going overseas, even on UN missions. With the Gulf crisis raging, public doubts about the risks of sending Japanese servicemen into a war zone forced the government to abandon its original plans. But once fighting ended, support grew for Japan to increase its physical, and monetary, contribution to international affairs. The dispatch of a squadron of minesweepers to the Gulf last summer prompted little criticism, either domestically or from the governments of China and other Asian countries which had been quick to condemn Japan in the past for anything smacking of military action. Drafting legislation involved tortuous inter-party discussions as the LDP controls the lower house in the Diet but lacks a majority in the upper house. LDP leaders also wanted to win support from as many parties as possible - so that all could share the blame if the sensitive legislation turned into a political millstone. Last December the centrist Komei and Democratic Socialist parties agreed to come on board. With their support the LDP forced legislation through the lower house amid angry scenes. The LDP's energies were then absorbed for some time in annual budgetary talks and various financial scandals. Even though Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, pledged to support the bills he seemed too weak to secure the necessary agreements. Some party leaders wanted action to be postponed - at least until after elections to the Diet's upper house, to be held in July. But a recent surge in pro-LDP sentiment in opinion polls appears to have emboldened the party. The final draft of the legislation also contains many concessions to the cautious. Not more than 2,000 Japanese troops will serve in any peace-keeping force; they will be limited to support roles, such as transport, and will not be permitted to serve in frontline units; and they will be allowed to use arms only in self-defence. Furthermore, each time the government decides to join a peace-keeping operation it must seek Diet approval.</p>

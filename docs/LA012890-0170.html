			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SYRACUSE ENDS GEORGETOWN HOME STREAK IN BIG WAY  </P> <P> Syracuse left the Capital Centre a winner for the first time Saturday.  </P> <P> The 11th-ranked Orangemen used 36 points from sophomore Billy Owens and a 43-37  rebounding edge to register a 95-76 victory over No. 3 Georgetown, their first  in nine games at the Hoyas' Big East home court in Landover, Md.  </P> <P> "Not very many people win here so it was nice for us," Syracuse Coach Jim  Boeheim said. "They won 27 in a row here and 111 of 122. We've come close a  couple of times and today we played well throughout for 40 minutes."  </P> <P> Owens made 11 for 17 shots and also grabbed 10 rebounds as he bettered his  previous career high by three points.  </P> <P> Georgetown still leads the series between the schools, 19-9, and is the only  conference team with a better than .500 record against the Orangemen.  </P> <P> Syracuse (14-3, 5-3 in the Big East), came into the game having lost two of  three games, but this was its second game with guard Michael Edwards in the  starting lineup, both victories. Derrick Coleman had 24 points and 13 rebounds.  </P> <P> "We won it playing defense," Coleman said. "Sending everybody to the boards,  even the guards, was a key."  </P> <P> Alonzo Mourning had 22 points for Georgetown (15-2, 5-2), which started the  season 14-0 but has lost two of three.  </P> <P> "You are concerned about everything after a loss, but we are 15-2," Georgetown  Coach John Thompson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS  </P> <P> No. 1 Missouri 104, Colorado 89 -- Anthony Peeler scored 26 points and Nathan  Buntin added 25 for the top-ranked Tigers at Boulder, Colo.  </P> <P> Missouri (19-1, 5-0) helped itself by making 25 of 34 foul shots. The Tigers  held the Buffaloes (9-9, 1-4) without a field goal for 6:35 and limited them to  33% shooting in the first half.  </P> <P> No. 2 Kansas 85, Kansas St. 57 -- Terry Brown scored 21 points and Rick  Calloway added 16 in the Big Eight game at Manhattan, Kan., as the Jayhawks  became the first Division I team to win 20 games this season.  </P> <P> Kansas (20-1, 3-1) took a 41-29 halftime lead and then made a 23-4 spurt in the  second half as Kansas State (12-8, 2-2) sustained its worst home loss ever to  its archrival.  </P> <P> DePaul 66, No. 4 Louisville 62 -- David Booth, a 6-7 sophomore, scored 37  points to lead the Blue Demons to an upset victory at the Rosemont (Ill.)  Horizon.  </P> <P> Louisville (14-3) had its five-game winning streak broken. DePaul (11-9) has  won eight of its last 10 games.  </P> <P> No. 6 Arkansas 109, Alabama Birmingham 95 -- Todd Day scored 25 points and Lee  Mayberry added 23 as the Razorbacks took charge late in the game at Birmingham,  Ala.  </P> <P> Alabama Birmingham (14-6) had the lead five times in the second half before Ron  Huery hit a layup to tie the score, 77-77, with 8:51 remaining. Mayberry hit a  three-point shot to break the tie with 7:37 left, and the Razorbacks (17-2)  never trailed thereafter.  </P> <P> No. 7 Michigan 65, Michigan State 63 -- Rumeal Robinson showed again in Ann  Arbor, Mich., why he's considered one of the best clutch players in college  basketball.  </P> <P> His overtime free throws against Seton Hall in Seattle won the NCAA  championship for Michigan last spring. This time, Robinson's basket at the  buzzer lifted the Wolverines to a Big Ten win over the Spartans, stretching  their home winning streak to 10 games.  </P> <P> The win pulled Michigan (15-3, 5-2) into a second-place tie with Michigan State  (16-4, 5-2) in the Big Ten standings.  </P> <P> No. 9 Oklahoma 109, Oklahoma State 92 -- The Cowboys were within 48-46 after  scoring the first four points of the second half, but the Sooners (14-2, 3-1)  scored 37 points in the next 11 minutes and rolled to a Big Eight victory at  Norman, Okla.  </P> <P> William Davis had 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Skeeter Henry added 22 points  as Oklahoma won its 40th in a row at home.

But the Buckeyes (8-9,  3-5) did not score again until Mark Baker made two foul shots after 8:45 of the  second half.  </P> <P> Andy Kaufmann's two free throws began Illinois' rally. Gill scored eight points  and Stephen Bardo added five as the Illini (15-3, 5-3) made it 61-45.  </P> <P> No. 13 Purdue 80, Iowa 59 -- The Boilermakers shot almost 75% for the game and  the Hawkeyes missed 11 of their first 12 shots in the second half at Lafayette,  Ind. The Boilermakers are off to their best start in the Big Ten since 1936.  </P> <P> Woody Austin made four three-point baskets and had 14 points to lead Purdue,  which pulled away as Iowa went the first 6:23 of the second half without a  field goal and managed just one in over 11 minutes.  </P> <P> The Boilermakers (15-2, 7-0), leading the Big Ten in shooting, made 17 of 21  shots in the second half. Iowa (9-8, 1-6) made just five of 27 shots in the  second half and shot 34.5% for the game.  </P> <P> No. 20 Connecticut 72, No. 15 St. John's 58 -- Reserves Dan Cyrulik and John  Gwynn combined for 24 second-half points to spark the Huskies to a Big East  victory in the first game ever at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Conn., before a  sellout crowd of 8,241.  </P> <P> Connecticut's seventh consecutive win left the Huskies (17-3, 6-2) and the  Redmen (17-3, 6-2) tied for first in the Big East.

Florida (6-9, 2-6) was playing  without star center Dwayne Schintzius, who quit the team last week.  </P> <P> No. 18 La Salle 98, Fordham 72 -- Lionel Simmons scored 16 of his 30 points in  a 34-8 run to start the second half in New York as the Explorers crushed  Fordham in a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game for their seventh  consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Randy Woods added 19 points for the Explorers (15-1, 6-0). Fordam is 12-6 and  6-3.  </P> <P> No. 24 Alabama 78, Auburn 59 -- Melvin Cheatum scored 23 points and David  Benoit added 17 as the Crimson Tide won at Tuscaloosa, Ala.  </P> <P> Alabama (14-5, 5-3) earned a share of first place in the SEC, while Auburn  dropped to 6-12, 3-5.

Derek Strong scored 15 points and led a  23-5 surge in the final 10 minutes of the first half that carried them to a  Midwestern Collegiate Conference victory.  </P> <P> Xavier (15-2, 5-1) used a tight man-to-man defense to hold Butler (3-15, 0-6)  without a field goal in the final nine minutes of the first half.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER GAMES  </P> <P> EAST  </P> <P> Seton Hall 66, Villanova 61 -- Michael Cooper scored 25 points and grabbed 12  rebounds, and Anthony Avent hit a three-point shot with a minute to go in East  Rutherford, N.J., to lift the Pirates to a Big East Conference victory.  </P> <P> It was the second win in a row for the Pirates (10-7, 3-4).

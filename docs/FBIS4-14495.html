			<p>BFN     [Text] We are moving toward democracy in an evolutionary  process; this opinion was voiced by Ukrainian Deputies Serhiy  Holovatyy and Volodymyr Lanovyy at a press conference in Kiev  today. Serhiy Holovatyy believes that the scenario envisioning a  vacuum has failed to materialize in spite of the flawed  electoral law; and it was the people, who actively participated  in the election, that headed off this scenario. In his opinion,  after the second-round elections, the new parliament will be  able to get down to work. However, it must be reform-minded in  nature to operate successfully. You cannot overcome the crisis  with an antiquated background, he stressed. Continuing on the  topic of economic reform, Volodymyr Lanovyy emphasized: I stand  for uniting all economic concepts that would help transform  Ukraine into a wealthy state. We have nothing to fight for  right now. We must unite. At the same time, Volodymyr Lanovyy  said he was concerned about the political standoff that came to  a head in the country, as well as the too-politicized election  process. He thinks that the electorate cast its ballots either  for far-right or far-left candidates. Only those who will work  and not just talk should be elected to parliament, he stressed.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Japan's talented technocrat rides his luck: Tsutomu Hata's route to the top For a man who claims to have no ambitions, Mr Tsutomu Hata, 58, has had an astonishing run of luck over the past 12 months. Last April he was asked by Japan's former Liberal Democratic party government, of which he was a member, if he would like to be foreign minister. The offer came on the understanding that he would, one day, become the party's leader. After consulting his political mentor, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the offer was turned down. Mr Hata suggested he wanted instead to concentrate on leading a political reform movement. The decision seemed quixotic to LDP leaders at the time, as political reform movements had led nowhere in Japan. Little did they realise that a few months later Mr Hata, along with Mr Ozawa, would bring an end to 38 years of LDP government by leading a defection from the party and that, ultimately, he would take both the jobs they offered, foreign minister and prime minister. As an experienced technocrat and winner of friends, few politicians in Tokyo can better Mr Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal party which is at the core of the unstable coalition. Yet many people who have worked with him doubt whether he has the intellectual drive to set his own political agenda. Bureaucrats who have laboured under Mr Hata in his previous incarnations as agriculture minister, finance minister and, latterly, at foreign affairs, adore him. They say he is professional, smooth and easy-going in contrast with the pompous, often arrogant, LDP elders of recent times. He has a good record. Mr Hata was the chief negotiator behind the opening of Japan's beef and orange markets in the early 1980s, he opened the rice market as foreign minister last year, and was Japan's negotiator in the Gatt deal. He should therefore have the experience to run a more stable regime than did Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, who had never held a cabinet post before becoming prime minister eight months ago. But will the 'nice' Mr Hata be able to bully the divided coalition into making decisions on divisive matters such as tax reform, Japan's position on possible UN sanctions against North Korea, and the US trade dispute? On balance, those who know him fear the answer is No. 'He is not good at political bargaining, not good in a power struggle,' says his wife, Yasuko. And Mr Minoru Morita, the political commentator, adds: 'Mr Hata may not have the strength and forcible personality to decide things by coercion.' One senior civil servant compliments Mr Hata as a talented technocrat, but fears that 'at the top of the tower this may not be enough'. He lacks the sense of mission that earned Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister for five years to 1987, the highest international regard of any Japanese leader in recent decades, says the official. US officials share these reservations. They hope Mr Hata will allow himself to be influenced by Mr Ozawa, the deputy leader of the JRP whose skills as a backroom strategist have earned respect in Washington. The prospective new leader will soon have a fight on his hands, as the coalition will have to decide on a cut in income tax and a rise in sales tax  -opposed by the Social Democratic party, its largest member  - before the Group of Seven summit in July. It is the toughest issue facing the government but an unavoidable one, because of US demands for evidence that Tokyo is prepared to deliver on promises to stimulate demand for imports. However, Mr Hata could prove more durable than Mr Hosokawa, despite the battles ahead. Even Mr Hata's enemies in the LDP suspect he will be hard to hurt with the suggestions of financial impropriety that the opposition employed to finish off his predecessor just over two weeks ago. There is one possible financial taint. As a former member of the LDP's kingmaking Takeshita faction, Mr Hata was close to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the faction's chairman who is now on trial for tax evasion. But with typical candour, Mr Hata has never denied having been part of 'sloppy political power play'. 'All politicians are guilty because of the system. . . so it's up to us to change the system,' he explained. Another of Mr Hata's assets is that his style and credentials allow him to appeal to left and right, traditionalists and reformers. As one who has climbed the ladder from ticket puncher to manager in a Tokyo bus company, Mr Hata can claim to be the plain man's man, reflected in his 61 per cent popularity score in an opinion poll last week. But he also has roots in old conservative politics, as member of parliament for 25 years for a farming constituency in the mountainous central region of Nagano. In his LDP days he was a member of both the agricultural and telecommunications zoku, or sector lobbies, an unusual combination of old and new politics. 'He is unique in Japanese politics  - an average man with common sense,' says Mr Morita.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Inky veterans who met a French challenge - Keith Wheatley meets two 75-year-olds who came out of retirement to launch a newspaper EDWARD and Laura Rapp are unusual people. Original thinkers. When they wanted to compile a list of Britons and Americans resident in France they bought the departement phone books and methodically scanned the columns for Anglo- Saxon names. 'It was actually a fascinating job and you got so that you could spot a Digby-Jones at 50 paces,' said Laura. The Rapps needed the list to mail out promotional copies of their English-language newspaper The Recorder. It speaks volumes for the quality of the product that an initial mail-shot of only 1,500 names has produced over 500 subscribers paying FFr100 a year for the monthly publication. Most of the remaining 8,000 circulation goes out via NMPP, the Paris-based state newspaper distribution agency. Under French law any legally registered title has a right to distribution. Ideally the Rapps would like to point NMPP at areas where 'Anglo' communities are densest: Provence, Normandy and the Dordogne. However, French bureaucracy is not to be directed. 'The paperwork you get from NMPP is wild. They have an accounting system that is just a mystery to us. You don't get data on July's circulation until October and you can't even begin to guess at what size cheque you'll get,' said Edward. These are not the grumbles of tyro publishers, baffled by the newspaper game. The Rapps - both 75 - retired to the town of Duras, 60km east of Bordeaux three years ago. They had twice started and sold successful small-town newspapers in their native Connecticut. Ed and Laura are the kind of quirky, charming resourceful Americans depicted by James Thurber. And, like Thurber himself, they know a dollar when they see one. The Kent Good Times Dispatch started its career as a Boy Scout paper until turned around by Ed using the lifetime's knowledge he had acquired working for Reader's Digest selling advertising in central America. 'We sold it for a good price and signed an agreement not to compete for two years. Neither Laura or I intended to work again but we got bored and 24 months to the day from the sale we brought out The Kent Weathervane,' recalled Ed, as he worked on front-page layouts for the next issue of The Recorder. The owner of the Good Times Dispatch bought the second title and killed it off. Boredom was the genesis of the The Recorder. The Rapps had planned to run their large house in the sleepy town of Duras as a hotel but plans to involve other members of the family unravelled. Hearing that the only other English language paper in southern France was in the hands of the court, following receivership, the Rapps put in a bid. But the bureaucracy was so wearing they decided, with pioneer-spirit, to build their own buggy. 'We'd put together out first issue by the time the court came to a decision. We were having fun, so we decided to keep going,' said Laura. They sit at opposite ends of the 'newsroom' facing over the midi calm of the Place de la Resistance in Duras. Undoubtedly there is a market for The Recorder. The prefectures in 27 of France's 95 departments sent the Rapps figures on the number of registered English, Dutch and Americans. These show 29,200 British, 8,000 Dutch and 17,600 Americans in just those areas and do not include unregistered part-time residents and and second home owners. The numbers are rising. 'It's a big population to address but it's not joined together,' said Ed. 'In Connecticut we could do our entire distribution from the back of a van in one afternoon. Here it's rather different. 'I went into a newsagents in Perigord the other day and found our paper stuffed up on the top shelf with the porno magazines. Another man said he found the layout so old-fashioned that he'd assumed it was a religious tract.' The appearance of The Recorder owes rather more to the staid visual traditions of the New York Times than the racy British tabloids or the colourful French regional newspapers. However, the content is entertaining and often stylishly written. A high proportion of correspondents are professional journalists. 'We spend a lot of money, relatively speaking, on the editorial content but the people that write for us are good. Paying our correspondents is one of our big costs but we think it's essential,' said Ed as the fax machine disgorged a commentary on Maastricht from the Brussels stringer. 'We ran a readership survey in July and we have a good fix on what people want to read and on the demographics of our audience. People clearly like letters and informative articles about life in France, the problems and the pleasures. they like humour and personal experiences. Most of the audience is over 40, half is over 60.' Advertising is the problem. The Recorder has some, but not enough. Neither of the Rapps speaks sufficient French to sell space in the domestic market. They are pondering whether to acquire an agent in London, a local rep in Bordeaux, or both. 'Of course, the recession is bound to hit new titles even worse than it hurts established ones,' said Ed. 'Who wants to take a chance on something they've never heard of when they're cutting budgets.' The Rapps are cautiously looking for an investor/partner who will buy into what the Rapps have established and contribute missing skills and - dare one say it - energy. The Rapps admit to a loss of about FFr100,000 but point out that few new publications go into profit in their first year. They go multi-regional rather than simply national and to produce the paper weekly. 'Regional editions would give the anglophones news they simply can't get elsewhere and open up local advertising,' said Laura. 'The numbers of people in the audience justifies both moves if we can figure out the details of how to do it.' They're optimistic but cautious about their future. 'We're 75 and in great health but after 70 we figure you're on borrowed time,' said Ed. The Recorder, Place de la Resistance, 47120 Duras, France. Tel 010-33-53-83-81-02 Fax 010-33-53-83-76-82</p>

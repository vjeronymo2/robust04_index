			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher today warned Bosnian Serb forces that  they needed to do more to avoid the risk of NATO air attacks.    After brief talks at the Foreign Office in London, the two  men underlined the need for total compliance with a NATO  ultimatum, which demands that Serbs have until 0001 GMT tomorrow  to withdraw heavy weaponry at least 12 miles (20 kms) from the  ravaged Bosnian Muslim enclave or face air strikes.    As the clock ticked towards the deadline, Mr Christopher  told  reporters: "The information I have this morning is that the  Serbs have moved a number of heavy weapons outside the 20 km  zone, but there are a number still there. It is clear that  today will be an important day to see if they really will comply  with requirements."    Mr Christopher said: "There's been some movement but not  enough yet."    Foreign Secretary Mr Hurd said it was a "critical period,"  and reiterated his hope that there would be no need for air  strikes.    "There should be no difficulty in working out in the course  of tomorrow whether there is a need for air strikes or not. I  hope there won't be. I hope the Serbs will comply with the  requirements of NATO and the Security Council. If they don't,  then they know there will be air strikes against them."    Mr Hurd and Mr Christopher met as a new international effort  was launched in London to promote peace in Bosnia.    Officials from Russia, the United States and the EU  [European  Union] were meeting together for the first time as part of a new  "contact" group with the aim of developing a co-ordinated  approach to the former Yugoslavia.    Their aim is to seek a four-month "cessation of hostilities"  -- an expression which will be increasingly heard in relation to  Bosnia rather than "ceasefire" -- while work begins in shaping a  new map of Bosnia.    During that period, the group would work with the Serbs and  Bosnian Muslims on the map, the key to an overall settlement.    Implicit in this is that the map -- if it is agreed by the  Serbs, the Muslims and the Croats -- will involve a "roll-back"  by the Serbs from some of the positions they have occupied as a  result of the hostilities.    Also during this period, the commander of UN forces in  Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, would decide  whether he wants to put troops in between the warring parties.    An official said: "It is virtually impossible to negotiate  on  the map and towards a peace settlement while people are killing  each other."    Lord Owen will be represented on the contact group by three  Europeans, British, French and German. The British  representative is David Manning, head of the Foreign Office  Eastern Department.    Today's meeting follows yesterday's high level discussions  at  Downing Street with ministers from Russia, the United States and  France, where it was regarded that the bringing together of key  players in the diplomatic arena would provide an additional  "political punch" to the quest for peace.    The aim is to find a unified diplomatic position which will  satisfy and influence the warring parties.</p>

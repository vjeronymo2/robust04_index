			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Purchasing managers upbeat about economy Continuing expansion in manufacturing activity is confirmed by one of the year's first economic indicators from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply today. The institute's purchasing managers' index - which measures items including output, new orders and delivery times - showed an increase in the rate of manufacturing expansion for the third successive month. It stood at 54.6 last month, compared with 54.2 in November and 53.6 in October. The institute's new orders index rose from 55.8 to 57.8 between November and December reflecting, it says, sharp improvement in demand. The south-east and East Anglia, which the analysis suggests suffered poor growth between July and October, recorded the highest increase in new orders last month. Upward pressure on price levels remained relatively subdued in December, according to the institute, which says its prices index rose to 51.5 in November from 50.2, largely because of higher steel prices. Employment levels were broadly unchanged, with equal numbers of companies recruiting and shedding staff. Two other reports published today predict relatively strong growth for the economy this year. James Capel, the finance house, forecasts in its UK Economics report that a modest acceleration in activity this year will produce a 3 per cent increase in gross domestic product - the fastest growth rate since 1988 - and similar growth next year. Inflation is likely to remain very subdued in spite of the strengthening recovery this year, the report suggests. It expects underlying inflation to hover around 2.25 per cent for most of the year. It also predicts that base rates will be cut to 4.5 per cent by the end of the first quarter. Ernst &amp; Young's Item Club, in its forecast based on the Treasury model, expects the economy to expand by an annual 2.5 per cent this year and next. It warns that there is a risk of greater caution by consumers. It also warns that a prolonged period of stagnation in continental Europe could reduce the strength of recovery in the UK.</p>

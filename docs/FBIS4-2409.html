			<p>BFN     [Text] At a provincial symposium on the utilization of  foreign capital, which ended yesterday afternoon, Governor Zhu  Senlin urged participants to seize opportunities, meet  challenges, set a clear aim, and uplift the province's  utilization of foreign capital to a new level. The governor  pointed out: In utilizing foreign capital, our province should  work hard to attain three goals this year: 1. We should  actually utilize $10 billion in foreign capital and accelerate  the transformation of old enterprises and the upgrading of  products by using foreign capital. 2. We should continue to  focus the utilization of foreign capital on infrastructure, such  as the energy industry, communications, and telecommunications;  on basic industries, such as the petroleum, chemical, iron and  steel, electronic, and auto industries; on the development of  agriculture which earns foreign exchange; and on the  construction of poverty-stricken mountain areas. 3. Through  various kinds of investment-attracting activities, we should  attract more internationally well- known big enterprises and  financial groups to invest in Guangdong, while continuing to do  a good job in cooperating with medium-sized and small overseas  enterprises.</p>

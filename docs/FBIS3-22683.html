			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report under the rubric "According to Rumors </F> and From Authoritative Sources": "AIDS in Army Colors"]    [Text] In an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Viktor  Kolkov, chief physician of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense, denied a report carried in certain newspapers that 13  Russian Armed Forces officers have been diagnosed with AIDS and  are under examination by Army medics. In his words, as of today  there are no AIDS sufferers in the Russian Army and Navy.  However, since 1989 15 carriers of this illness, that is to  say, HIV-positive persons, have been detected by military  medics. Five are continuing service in the troops, under  constant medical supervision. Ten have been discharged to the  reserves and transferred to the supervision of the civilian  health organs. The virus was detected in officers up to 40  years of age, and the majority were infected while on leave or  tours of duty.    Viktor Kolkov said that work on diagnosing AIDS in the  Russian Armed Forces began back in 1987, and in 1989  laboratories for research into infection and immunization were  set up. (According to information not confirmed by the chief  physician, these laboratories exist today in dozens of  hospitals, and a special department for the treatment of  HIV-positive patients operates in Podolsk Military Hospital.)  Kolkov also said that servicemen giving blood, foreigners  studying in military academies, Russian servicemen returning  from foreign tours of duty, and persons infected with venereal  diseases and also certain other clinical illnesses are subject  to compulsory testing for HIV.    Induction commissions, according to Kolkov, are not yet  charged with testing draftees for AIDS, except in cases where  commission doctors have reasons for suspicion. "We have  already tested more than 1.5 million persons; we are simply  unable to test all draftees and personnel," Kolkov said. At the  same time Viktor Kolkov rejected forecasts that the number of  AIDS and HIV sufferers in the Army will increase dramatically in  the near future. In his words, there are no grounds for panic,  and conditions in this respect are incomparably better in the  Russian Armed Forces than in the U.S. and other Western  countries' armies.</p>

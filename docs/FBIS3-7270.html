			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Warren Fernandez and Brendan Pereira] </F>   [Text] The Attorney-General [A-G] yesterday challenged  Tharman Shanmugaratnam's account of a meeting with private  sector analysts, saying he could not remember the details when  questioned by Internal Security Department (ISD) officers two  years ago.    As such, his recollection in court of the events of June 19,  1992 was based on a hypothetical situation, said Mr Chan Sek  Keong.    He said that Shanmugaratnam's testimony on how he acted or  handled official documents during the meeting was "given mostly  in terms of what he would have done instead of what he had  already done."    The A-G made these points while continuing his submissions  against the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) director of  the economics department.    The accused's statements to the ISD showed that he could not  remember whether he had taken a draft report containing the  flash estimate into the meeting with Crosby Securities  economists Manu Bhaskaran and Raymond Foo. He also could not  recall if the document was covered during the meeting at the MAS  building.    The A-G said that much of Shanmugaratnam's memory of that  meeting was recalled for him by his MAS colleague Chan Chia Lin,  a prosecution witness.    He said that when the incident arose, Shanmugaratnam had no  clear idea of what happened. Two years later, he came to court  and gave his version of what he said he recalled.    This testimony, said the A-G, was based on a "would have  been" situation.    He read out a few excerpts of the accused's testimony in  court yesterday to illustrate his point.    For example, when saying how he handled the draft report  during the meeting, Shanmugaratnam said. "From the moment I  placed the report down, it would have been covered. I would  only have to remove the paper after I lifted it from the table  to refer to it."    The A-G said that except for one answer, all the others were  on the basis of what "he would have done."    "The accounts are expressed in terms of a customary or usual  behaviour" and cannot refute Shanmugaratnam's admission in a  statement that Bhaskaran could have seen the figure of 4.6 per  cent from the draft report.</p>

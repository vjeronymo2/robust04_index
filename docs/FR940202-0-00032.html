Documents that support the principal documentation may include the documents listed in &sect;1.6038A&hyph;3(c) that are not otherwise described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Every document listed in those regulations may not be relevant to pricing determinations under the taxpayer's specific facts and circumstances and, therefore, each of those documents need not be maintained in all circumstances. Moreover, other documents not listed in those regulations may be necessary to establish that the taxpayer's method was selected and applied in the way that provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule in &sect;1.482&hyph;1T(b)(2)(iii). Background documents need not be provided to the Internal Revenue Service in response to a request for principal documents. If the Internal Revenue Service subsequently requests background documents, a taxpayer must provide that documentation to the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of the request. However, the district director may, in his discretion, extend the period for producing the background documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of an unspecified method <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An adjustment is excluded from the calculation of a net section 482 adjustment if the taxpayer establishes that both the unspecified method and documentation requirements of this paragraph (d)(3) are met with respect to that amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unspecified method requirement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a method other than a specified method was applied, the unspecified method requirement is met if the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) (B) or (C), as appropriate, are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Specified method potentially applicable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the transaction is of a type for which methods are specified in the regulations under section 482, then a taxpayer will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if the taxpayer reasonably concludes that, given the available data, none of the specified methods was likely to provide an accurate measure of an arm's length result, and that it selected and applied an unspecified method in a way that would likely provide an accurate measure of an arm's length result, given the available data. This conclusion must be based on all the facts and circumstances. The factors relevant to this conclusion include those set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No specified method applicable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the transaction is of a type for which no methods are specified in the regulations under section 482, then a taxpayer will be considered to have met the unspecified method requirement if it selected and applied an unspecified method in a reasonable manner. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C), a taxpayer's selection and application is reasonable if the taxpayer reasonably concludes that the method (and its application of that method) provided the most accurate measure of an arm's length result under the principles of the best method rule in &sect;1.482&hyph;1T(b)(2)(iii). This conclusion must be based on all the facts and circumstances. The factors relevant to this conclusion include those set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documentation requirement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The documentation requirement of this paragraph (d)(3) is met if the taxpayer maintains sufficient documentation to establish that the unspecified method requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section is met and provides that documentation to the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of a request for it. That documentation must be in existence when the return is filed. The district director may, in his discretion, excuse a minor or inadvertent failure to provide required documents, but only if the taxpayer has made a good faith effort to comply, and the taxpayer promptly remedies the failure when it becomes known. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Principal and background documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See paragraphs (d)(2)(iii) (B) and (C) of this section for rules regarding these two categories of required documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certain foreign to foreign transactions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of calculating a net section 482 adjustment, any increase in taxable income resulting from an allocation under section 482 that is attributable to any controlled transaction solely between foreign corporations will be excluded unless the treatment of that transaction affects the determination of either corporation's income from sources within the United States or taxable income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the regular tax (as defined in section 55(c)) imposed on the taxpayer is determined by reference to an amount other than taxable income, that amount shall be treated as the taxable income of the taxpayer for purposes of section 6662(e)(3). Accordingly, for taxpayers whose regular tax is determined by reference to an amount other than taxable income, the increase in that amount resulting from section 482 allocations is the taxpayer's net section 482 adjustment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) The Internal Revenue Service makes the following section 482 adjustments for the taxable year: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

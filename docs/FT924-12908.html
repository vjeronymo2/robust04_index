			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Procedure for Italian bank sale due shortly A PROCEDURE for the privatisation of Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth biggest bank, controlled by the IRI state holding company, should be agreed early next month. IRI will hold a shareholders' meeting early in November to decide on the sale, amid indications that the company plans to place its entire 67 per cent stake through a competitive tender. Merrill Lynch is advising on sald procedures. The stake will not necessarily go to the highest bidder. Any purchase would have to be approved by the Bank of Italy, which is reportedly opposed to a foreign bank takeover.</p>

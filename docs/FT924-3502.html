			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / European Economic Area to go ahead, say EC ministers EC foreign ministers brushed off Switzerland's rejection of closer ties with the European Community, saying the European Economic Area would go ahead as planned, writes Lionel Barber. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, UK Foreign Office minister, said: 'Membership of the Community is not compulsory. The EEA encompasses the EC and countries of the European Free Trade Association (Efta). Swiss rejection, though not unexpected, is likely to delay the EEA's entry into force. The EC plans talks with Norway, which holds the Efta presidency, to prepare a conference. One snag is that the EEA involves a pledge by Efta countries to contribute to an Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.6bn) fund for the poorer EC countries led by Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. Switzerland was due to contribute 28 per cent. Spanish and Irish officials said they expected the fund to remain unchanged.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Petoe, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats, SZDSZ, by Eva Hortobagyi at SZDSZ headquarters in  Budapest on 29 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Hortobagyi] Here is Ivan Petoe, chairman of the  SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], whom I have managed to  hijack for a few words before the session of the executive body  of party. [passage omitted] According to forecasts your party  has 23 mandates in the individual constituencies. [passage  omitted] What are your first impressions? [passage omitted]    [Petoe] We had two aims. [passage omitted] One of these was  to repeat our 1990 result, in that we should come a strong  second. [passage omitted] Our second aim was--we formulated this  between the two rounds of the election--to prevent if possible  the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] from gaining an absolute  majority because we thought that it would be more advantageous  if better conditions for a coalition government developed. It  seems that the electorate did not adopt this advice of ours. It  appears that the MSZP's absolute majority is certain--about 55  percent, if I understand the forecast correctly. The electorate  decided in favor of a one-party government.    This does not mean, naturally, that we will not negotiate  with the MSZP. Our convention [kueldoett gyueles] will have the  final word. [passage omitted] The convention will decide on the  coalition question. We have already indicated between the two  rounds of the election that the coalition conditions will be  very different if the MSZP were to have an absolute majority  from conditions if it were not to. [passage omitted]    [Hortobagyi] Is there any big winner or big loser in the  SZDSZ?    [Petoe] [passage omitted] I do not think there was a big  loser in the SZDSZ, taking everything as a whole, because the  SZDSZ has delivered a good result as a team. We are satisfied  with our achievement. [passage omitted]    According to forecasts, Gabor Fodor and Gabor Kuncze will  win  in their constituencies. My position appears to be the reverse.  I am a loser, shall we say. If you like, I am a big loser.  [passage omitted]</p>

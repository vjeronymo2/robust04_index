			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (20): The hangover begins to clear - While finance remains tight, Lord Weir sees plenty of potential in international project business in developing countries / Guest column Apart from general background conditions, the prospects for international project business in developing countries are largely affected by three factors. First is the availability of credit and finance. The second factor affecting individual supplier countries is their competitiveness relative to others. Third, is the existence of demand from credit-worthy buyers. Finance remains tighter than in the past. The international debt crisis has not gone away. Banks and export credit agencies still suffer from the hangover left by that ill-judged lending binge, but time is a great healer of hangovers. Banks have made progress rebuilding assets, and the self-inflicted wounds to their lending psychology will recover. Equally, as the world economy recovers, the strain on governments' budgets reduces thus encouraging official support for projects. The UK should continue to be competitive. The benefits of the devaluation when the UK left the EU have not yet been eroded by unfavourable inflation differentials. I suspect, however, some of our relative advantage has disappeared, as European competitors reduce export prices to maintain workload while recession affects their domestic markets. In considering the effects of devaluation, the apparent gross amount of devaluation had to absorb several negative factors, before leaving any net gain in competitiveness. These included a rise in import costs, and the competitive gap and adverse effect on margins, caused by over-valuation. Adding the effect of action by competitors, referred to above, the net benefit of devaluation has been more modest than appeared. Nevertheless, exchange rate considerations provide no real excuse for exporters. On export credit terms, exporters will always want improvements. There has been a significant reduction in premiums and, more important, there is now a welcome recognition within the DTI, of the importance of continuing in this direction. Competitors in the international project business move up and down the league table of relative advantage. The weakness of the dollar causes problems of its own, but is hardly unfavourable for US contractors. The French continue to enjoy enviable government support somewhat offsetting the probable over-valuation of their currency. Italy will become less competitive as privatisation starts to produce long overdue financial discipline to an engineering sector, much of which is state-owned. For a mixture of reasons, German costs are high. The strength and resilience of German management suggests, however, that this may be temporary. Japan suffers from a high exchange rate. However, their contractors can offset this by purchasing equipment overseas and they are doing just this. Such a league table is complicated. It is easy enough to suggest positive or negative factors affecting each country, but to set out exactly where each competing country stands is neither easy nor, perhaps, possible. The third main factor affecting this business is the existence of demand from creditworthy buyers. Here, it is naturally easier to identify the demand than to find the creditworthy buyer, when the finances of many developing countries have been devastated by the international debt crisis. In South America the demand is there. The existence of creditworthy buyers is a reflection of the competence of financial and economic management in individual countries. There is some way to go, but there are encouraging developments: Chile has made significant sustained progress. Argentina - for years in the economic hospital - has largely tamed inflation and made a positive start to structural economic reform. Its progress provides an example to other countries of the benefits of promoting economic reform. The prospects for Colombia are good, supported by major natural resources. Venezuela needs greater stability for its potential to be developed. Brazil is as big a question as ever. Its potential for project business remains enormous, but is unfortunately counter-balanced by economic problems of an equal magnitude. The possibilities in South America are certainly better than they have been for years, but require a much more positive view from British contractors. The developing countries in Africa remain sad cases. Most discouraging is Nigeria whose natural resources are such that in the period since independence, with effective government, it should have almost ceased to be a developing country at all. Across much of central Africa, mis-government has impoverished populations and damaged public finances to a degree that project business is rarely supportable except through pure aid. There are exceptions, and in spite of considerable economic difficulties, Zimbabwe, Ghana, the Maghreb countries, and Egypt remain areas where international project business is possible, even if well below their needs. By far the best prospects remain in Asia. The possibilities in China are vast and so well-known that it is hardly necessary to describe them. The speed with which they can be realised mainly depends on the amount of finance that can be made available. Sources of finance will continue to improve as China's exports increase, as companies in China have more direct access to western capital markets, as well-rooted economic growth encourages lenders to support projects and increasing economic self-confidence makes the country more willing to borrow internationally. India also represents great potential with vast demand. The country has benefited enormously from economic reform. Liberalisation is breaking down the bureaucratic structure and the negative elements of protectionism and socialist ideology which inhibited industry for so long. The consequent growth in the economy and exports will support project business, as will the developing stock market now providing an outlet for domestic savings The point of no return has almost certainly passed, as far as liberalisation is concerned, and further benefit will come from a favourable perception of India by the international financial markets. In the rest of Asia, prospects are favourable as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand cross the borderline dividing developing countries from the developed. Behind them, the Philippines and Vietnam will offer increasing opportunities. To sum up, therefore, the message must be that although there remain areas of difficulty, overall prospects for project business in developing countries are good and provided outside factors do not limit the availability of finance, will remain so for a good time to come.

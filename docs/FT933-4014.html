			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tax credit helps lift Enterprise to Pounds 80.1m ENTERPRISE Oil, one of Britain's leading independent oil exploration and production companies, yesterday announced a jump in interim net profits from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 80.1m, thanks to a large tax credit, increased production and sterling's depreciation. Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, warned, however, that a majority of Enterprise's 1993 profits had accrued in the first half because of special factors and weaker second half oil prices. A credit of Pounds 27m resulted from the abolition in last March's budget of Petroleum Revenue Tax on past exploration and appraisal expenditure. The rise in production to 157,430 barrels a day of oil equivalent (135,500 b/d) was above market expectations. An interim cash dividend of 9.5p (6.5p) was declared - the same level as last year's final. The policy of reversing the relative sizes of the dividends would apply for this year only, according to the company. Earnings per share were 15.8p (7.9p), after tax of Pounds 0.5m (Pounds 16.3m). Enterprise joined the raft of companies offering enhanced scrip dividends to reduce their surplus advanced corporation tax. Shareholders are entitled to a dividend in new shares worth 14.25p per share. SG Warburg is offering to buy the shares at a minimum of 13.965p per share. Mr Andrew Shilston, the newly appointed group finance director, estimated the company would save Pounds 13.2m in cash if all shareholders took the scrip alternative. However, the company expects higher production rates to continue. The Scott field began producing ahead of schedule last week, with output due to reach 175,000 b/d later this month. Production from the Nelson field should begin in the first quarter of 1994. Total Enterprise output should rise to 250,000 b/d by 1995. Exploration and appraisal expenditure fell to Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 44.4m) in the first half to June 30. Mr Shilston said test results of the Monte Alpi-3 in Italy were encouraging. The lower spending helped to boost operating profits to Pounds 65.9m (Pounds 42.3m). Turnover was up 22 per cent to Pounds 292.7m (Pounds 239.5m).</p>

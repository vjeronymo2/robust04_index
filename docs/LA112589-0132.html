			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> CLERK AMASSES ABCS OF OFFICIAL LINGO  </P> <P> City business is becoming more user-friendly, now that the city clerk's office  has compiled a list of guidelines and definitions to help the public decipher  complicated government lingo.  </P> <P> Starting this week, the list will be attached to every City Council agenda,  said City Clerk Mary Ann Hanover.  </P> <P> The guidelines cover two sides of a single page. One side offers advice on how  and when the public may speak during a council meeting. The other side  deciphers an alphabet soup of initials associated with planning documents.  </P> <P> It also gives the reader government-oriented definitions that sometimes alter  the common meaning of words.  </P> <P> For example, the guide sheet tells the reader that "resolution" is not  something you promise yourself on New Year's Day, but rather a formal  expression of council opinion. A "motion" is not a physical movement; it is a  proposal for a vote.  </P> <P> "We want to try to make things understandable to the public," Hanover said.  "It's only fair.  </P> <P> "Who really knows what a closed session is?" she added, noting the long list of  obscure words spoken by bureaucrats. "We could talk for a month and nobody  would know what we were saying." WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALCOLM FORBES' BIRTHDAY BASH  </P> <P> The Malcolm Forbes article (Aug. 20) points up the area of taxation most in  need of reform -- corporate taxes.  </P> <P> Virtually every doctor, every lawyer, everyone who can, incorporates. Why?  Because it is infinitely more advantageous than being taxed as an individual.  </P> <P> Time for Congress to start considering stepping on some corporate toes. A  system that (would allow) Forbes to deduct his party expenses but doesn't allow  an individual deduction for an IRA (let alone party expenses) is nowhere near  being equitable.  </P> <P> MICHAEL LAURENCE  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

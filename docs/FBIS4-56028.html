			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Miklos Csurgay, commander of </F> the Hungarian Air Force, by Antal Andrassy; place and date not  given: "Poor Air Defense"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Csurgay] The technical  equipment of our air defense, and the reconnaissance and  interception tasks connected to this, undoubtedly cannot be said  to be good, so in this sense, we indeed have nothing to  celebrate. For many years there has been no money at all to  modernize reconnaissance, interception, or armament. I cannot  even remember when I last signed an invoice that would have  given an opportunity for the tiniest modernization.    [Andrassy] And probably no one else can.    [Csurgay] This is true. We have seen some progress recently  because we equipped six aircraft with friend-and-foe recognition  systems that we developed, and we will also equip the MiG-29's  with this. These MiG-29's that we received in exchange for the  Russian debt were our only chance to significantly modernize our  aircraft stock. At the same time, we have received 20 Albatross  jet-propelled training airplanes, so we have managed to speed up  our domestic training of pilots, which was started in 1993. We  are planning to deploy the MiG-29 fleet from the autumn. In my  view, this type of aircraft will more or less satisfy our needs  until 2010. Especially if, again in exchange for the Russian  state debt, we also received SZ-300 air defense missiles, which  is a weapon equivalent to the famous Patriots. [passage omitted]    [Andrassy] We left the Warsaw Pact, so we "do not belong  anywhere" just now. Has this impaired the effectiveness of our  air defense? We are not receiving anything from anywhere; at  most, we can get weapons that are sold by weight.    [Csurgay] We do not even get the ones sold by weight.  Hungary is unable to buy any kind of new weaponry at the  moment. At most we may receive something in exchange for the  aforementioned debts. This is fortunate! As for belonging  anywhere, my view is that, in spite of all the disadvantages, it  is better if we prepare ourselves for a defense that is as  efficient as possible, relying on our own resources.    [Andrassy] Can this create an opportunity for us to join the  developed western world? So that we know, for example, what  actually happened on the AWACS planes that are in service in our  airspace due to the southern crisis?    [Csurgay] We are aware of the fact that they are here, we  have constant contact with them. We certainly do not have the  technical equipment to find out what happens on board and  whether they participate in combat guidance. We have to make do  with the information received from them.

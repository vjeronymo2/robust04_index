			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Harlequin sells novel romance to TV group SOAP operas, move over. Mills &amp; Boon and Harlequin romances are coming to television. Harlequin Enterprises of Toronto, the romance-fiction publisher, has sold the international TV and video rights to its 16,000 titles to Alliance Communications, one of Canada's largest film and television production and distribution houses. Alliance will initially adapt a package of six Harlequin titles for television at a cost of CDollars 18m (USDollars 14.2m). They will be available by summer 1994. The plan is eventually to offer licensees a package of 26 films. CBS, the US television network, has bought broadcast rights in the US, and has made an undisclosed financial contribution towards the screenplay adaptations. Alliance officials will be at an international TV convention in Cannes next week in the hope of signing up broadcasters in other parts of the world. Harlequin will market the films in home-video form through the extensive direct-mail network it uses to sell many of its books. Several earlier attempts to adapt Harlequin books to the screen have foundered. But Mr Robert Lantos, Alliance chairman, said that the latest venture targeted 'a huge untapped audience with an unbeatable brand-name product'. Harlequin sells more than 200m books a year in 26 languages, with 62 new titles appearing each month. Its fastest growing markets include Japan - where 14m books were sold last year - and parts of eastern Europe. The company is owned by Torstar, which publishes the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest daily newspaper. Torstar's book division, consisting mainly of Harlequin, posted record profits of CDollars 61.8m in 1992 on sales of CDollars 418m.</p>

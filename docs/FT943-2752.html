			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Midland Independent doubles after listing Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail, yesterday published its first results since listing on the London Stock exchange, with pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 4.8m for the six months to the end of June. Pro-forma profits, stripping out the effects of interest on debt left over from a management buy-out, saw a rise of 28 per cent to Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 6m). Mr Chris Oakley, chief executive of MIN, which also publishes specialist magazines, said: 'Prospects for regional newspapers are good and we have identified opportunities for expansion by a number of newspaper launches.' Talks are under way about possible acquisitions. He emphasised that the group was successfully countering the national newspaper price-cutting war and that the circulations of the Birmingham Post, the Coventry Evening Telegraph and the Sunday Mercury had actually increased. There had been extra costs owing to 'unprecedented levels of sales promotion'. Mr Oakley said the fact that the Birmingham Post had increased circulation demonstrated 'the strength of regional newspapers'. The results came the day after MIN announced that it had teamed up with Mirror Group to develop cable television programming. Mirror plans a 24-hour cable channel and MIN will produce local programmes for the Birmingham area. Mr Oakley believes the local Birmingham segments could begin at two to three hours a day and increase to five to six hours a day. The company's free newspapers in Birmingham, which have been loss-makers in the first half of 1993, have now come into profit. The profit margin on the group's newspaper publishing operations is slightly down at 20.3 per cent, reflecting the impact of a full half year's contribution from lower margin free weeklies in the East Midlands. Following the March public offer, which raised Pounds 96m net of expenses at the end of June, MIN's net borrowings stood at Pounds 37.8m, down from Pounds 134.8m at the end of December. Operating profits were up 15 per cent to Pounds 9m (Pounds 7.8m) on turnover that rose from Pounds 37.7m to Pounds 45m. Earnings per share were up at 3.81p (2.59p) - pro forma an increase of 22 per cent to 5.14p (4.21p). The interim dividend is 1.1p. Sir Norman Fowler, chairman, said although total advertising revenue grew there were wide variations across categories. Recruitment advertising showed strong growth while cars and property had yet to show significant improvement. Pre-tax profits for the full year are expected to be Pounds 15m to Pounds 16m. The share price closed 14p down at 140p.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Computer-run tool investment rises THE NUMBER of computer-run numerically-controlled machine tools (CNC tools)in the UK engineering industry may be much smaller than thought, according to a survey by Benchmark Research for Machinery magazine, which publishes its results today. The survey found, however, that recent investment in CNC machines is higher than assumed. Investment in machine tools which combine modern computer control technology with traditional machining disciplines is a measure of productive capability and competitiveness. The survey identified 400,000 metal-cutting and 115,000 metal-forming machine tools at 18,600 engineering sites, representing 86 per cent of all machine tools installed in the UK. This excludes those used in process industries. At the engineering sites 47,066 CNC machine tools were counted at 5,312 sites employing more than 20 people. Along with an estimated 5,770 CNC machines used by smaller companies, the installed CNC machine tool base in the UK engineering sector is 52,836. The figure is low, given that CNC machine tools have taken an increasing share of the market in the past decade. Numerically-controlled machines accounted for 39 per cent of the market in 1990, against 11 per cent in 1978. A more encouraging picture is produced if sites using only manual machine tools are excluded. The 47,066 CNC machines at larger engineering companies represent 23 per cent of the 202,000 machine tools used. Benchmark Research, 8 White Oak Square, Swanley, Kent. BR8 7AG.</p>

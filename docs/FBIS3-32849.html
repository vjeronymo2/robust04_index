Congress president Vinicio Villar Anleu said De Leon  failed to ask Congress to authorize the program. Villar said any  possible penalties will be handled by the Attorney General's  Office. "It is up to the Attorney General's Office to determine  whether the U.S. military personnel in Guatemala are active or  reservists, and whether or not De Leon should be penalized for  failing to request permission from Congress," Villar Anleu said.    In "Fuertes Caminos," U.S. National Guard Reserve members  participate in building highways, repairing schools and health  centers, drilling wells, and providing dental services in the  country's interior. The program was started last week and is  slated to last until next June.    The U.S. Embassy explained that 300 men will be rotated  every  15 days and that the number of U.S. military at any one time in  Guatemala will never exceed 500.    Villar Anleu admitted that he attended the inauguration of  "Fuertes Caminos," but he only saw engineers, medics, mechanics,  and carpenters, but no soldiers.    The Constitution stipulates that Congress must approve the  deployment of foreign troops in Guatemala or the transfer of  foreign forces. National jurists suggested that De Leon may have  violated the Constitution by not consulting with Congress or  allowing legislators to ratify the execution of "Fuertes  Caminos."    Legislative sources said "Fuertes Caminos" is the result of  an agreement between President de Leon and the U.S. Government,  therefore it is up to the president to disclose the details of  the program.    This week, former Guatemalan President Francisco Villagran  Kramer (1982-86) suggested to President De Leon that to avoid  speculations, he disclose the contents of the "Fuertes Caminos"  agreements.</p>

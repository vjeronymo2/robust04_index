			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Spending curbs on BBC criticised MR JOHN TUSA, outgoing managing director of the BBC World Service, attacked the government yesterday for planning to cut the organisation's budget by Pounds 5m a year from 1994. The prospect of a reduced budget comes as the World Service, which has a regular audience of 120m worldwide, celebrates its 60th anniversary. Last week Prince Charles argued that the BBC World Service should continue to expand services. Mr Tusa said his argument was not with the Foreign Office, which funds the World Service through grants, but the Treasury, which was threatening the cut. Mr Tusa said: 'If this cut goes ahead, it will go straight to programmes. It will be very, very damaging.' A Pounds 5m-a-year reduction from next year's Pounds 172m budget would mean the loss of about seven hours of foreign-language broadcasting a week. The BBC opens negotiations with the Foreign Office next year for its next three-year funding period, which runs from April 1994. Mr Tusa said: 'It seems to me we cannot start with the assumption that, whatever happens in the negotiations, we get Pounds 5m less.' He also argued that there should be more practical co-operation between the government-funded World Service radio and World Service Television, which is funded through the commercial arm of the BBC.</p>

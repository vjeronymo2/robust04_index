At present, it is being explored in the preliminary  development stage. We should firmly uphold positive and reliable  policies and the principle of supporting the wishes of the  masses. To ensure the stable and healthy development of this new  endeavor, we must not engage in rigid uniformity. We must better  handle relationships among the state, collectives and  individuals; among rights and interests and risk; and between  agriculture and nonagricultural industries. Published in this  issue is Comrade Wan Baorui's investigative report (draft) on  the cooperative shareholding system in Shandong rural  enterprises. We hope it will enlighten readers at large. [end  editor's note]  <H5>  Practice and Development </H5>   Development of the cooperative shareholding system in  Shandong's rural enterprises generally can be divided into three  stages. First was the embryonic stage (1979-1983). The main form  was joint household-run enterprises: Under the premise of  voluntary participation, several families or households each  invested certain funds, elected a leader, and cooperated in  partnership to run an enterprise. They jointly engaged in  production and operations, and split profits according to the  ratio of invested funds. This organizational format contained  the basic elements of the cooperative shareholding system even  though it had neither perfectly scientific regulations nor  normal management systems. It was the rudimentary form of  cooperative shareholding. Second was the preliminary development  stage (1984-1991). Shareholding cooperatives gradually expanded  to village- and township-run enterprises, composed of multiple  collective, mass organization and individual shareholding rights  which not only commonly practiced the principles of "evenly  divided shares, equal shareholder rights, profits divided  according to shares, common stocks and interests, risk jointly  borne, and benefits jointly enjoyed," but also established  relatively standard enterprise regulations, organizational  formats and management systems. Third was the tiered development  stage (1992 and thereafter). After Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  southern tour speech was published, various levels of the party  and government put promotion of cooperative shareholding on the  agenda. The ardor of rural enterprises and their workers to  develop shareholding cooperatives increased. There was a  relatively large leap in shareholding cooperatives, whether in  terms of quantity, scale or normalization. Through April 1993,  9,919 Shandong rural collective enterprises implemented such  systems; this accounts for 6 percent of all rural collective  enterprises in Shandong. Bought shares totalled approximately  3.5 billion yuan.    According to organizational form, rural enterprise  cooperative shareholding systems are divisible into five basic  formats:    1) Agricultural household joint stock format. Generally,  with  a capable person as leader, all shareholders are peasant  households. It is characterized by joint labor and capital among  peasant households, a cooperative venture format, profits  divided according to shares, and to each according to his labor.    2) Enterprise worker stock format. Enterprises of this  format  generally have tripartite stock: originally rural collective  investments are taken as collective stock; the enterprise's  accumulation is taken as enterprise stock; shares are issued to  the enterprise's own workers, constituting individual worker  stock. The relationship between an enterprise's operations and  workers' personal interests are more closely tied in that the  enterprise workers are given to each according to his labor with  profits divided according to share.    3) Social participation shareholding system. This is  characterized by shares held by enterprise workers along with  legal persons outside the enterprise, and shares tendered to a  certain extent to the masses in society to form a  multi-constituent, multi-format, multi-channel shareholding  company limited. At present there are relatively few of this  rather normal form of shareholding enterprise. It requires state  approval by relevant sectors.    4) Legal entity (social group) jointly run shareholding  system. Composed of two, or more than two, enterprise legal  entities (or social groups) which mutually invest in shares, and  have joint management and operations. Profits are divided  according to investment shares. This format is only restricted  to mutual stock among legal persons. It does not involve the  matter of individual workers as shareholders.    5) Foreign businessmen stock format. This format both  tallies  with the basic characteristic of joint ventures without  excluding the coexistence of shareholding by rural collectives,  workers themselves, or individuals in society.  <H5>  Results and Issues </H5>   Preliminary results have been obtained by nearly 10,000  Shandong rural enterprises implementing shareholding cooperative  systems.    One result is the establishment of the independent legal  position of enterprises, realization of a division between  government and enterprise and a reduction of administrative  interference. Implementing shareholding cooperatives clarifies  enterprise title relationships. Enterprises truly become  independent legal bodies with greater potential for autonomous  operations, responsibility for profit and loss, autonomous  accumulation and autonomous development. The government changes  from its former role with overall responsibility for everything  into a common shareholder participating in enterprise management.    A second result is diversification of investors and superior  allocation of funds. Implementing shareholding cooperatives on  the one hand turns some indidvidual consumption funds into  production funds, promoting higher productivity, and on the  other hand spurring on circulation of the factors of production.  This creates diversification of investors, realizing superior  allocation of funds to a certain extent under the role of the  principle of the greatest benefits.    A third result is an enhanced sense of worker as master and  enterprise cohesion. Worker shareholders are both producers and  owners, which clarifies the formerly murky awareness of worker  as master and greatly strengthens cadre and worker  responsibility and enterprise cohesion. The Nanguan Xinghua  Clothing Factory in Gaomi County has had a trial shareholding  system for more than four years. Workers on the average propose  more than 100 rationalization suggestions per year, increasing  benefits by nearly 100,000 yuan. Examples from two brick  factories in the county illustrate the matter even better:  workers in a village household cooperative factory braved a  downpour to cover brick piles while workers from a collective  factory ran inside to escape the rain.    A fourth result is stronger encouragement and restraint  mechanisms and stronger enterprise reserve strength. In  enterprises implementing shareholding cooperatives, stocks are  like a link forging tighter the interests of investors,  operators and laborers, forming an inherent encouragement  mechanism. The board of directors, supervisory committee, and  shareholding representatives undertake their own decisionmaking  and supervisory functions according to regulations. Such unified  internal-external management supervision clearly strengthens an  enterprise's restraint mechanism. In this way they overcome  short-term behavior, responsibility for profits but not losses  and other abuses which are difficult to overcome in the  contract responsibility system. According to the analysis of a  continuous three-year monitoring report of the entire Zibo  village area, the accumulation of shareholding cooperative  enterprises was higher by 19 percentage points than that of  average levels of the entire region, and every one was in the  black.    Although Shandong rural enterprises have obtained notable  results in implementing shareholding cooperatives, some problems  still remain: one is ideological resistance. Summed up, there  are three fears: Rural (township) leaders fear restraints,  enterprise heads fear loss of authority and the masses fear  risk, of which, the greatest resistance is by rural and  village-level leadership. A second problem is the lack of  complementary industrial and commercial management and taxation  system reforms. In some areas, industrial and commercial  administrative management sectors do not acknowledge civil  elections, are not appointed to represent enterprise legal  bodies or even do not issue operating permits. Taxation  departments, based on the reasoning that an increase in value of  stock assets will lead to an increase in depreciation which will  influence income taxes, do not recognize the stock assets value  increase portion of the tax estimate. A third problem is  muddled collective stockholder title representation. Title to  rural collective shares should be owned by the people of the  entire village (town) but at present the government still is  representive. This is the manifestation of incomplete  reformation of shareholding cooperatives which should gradually  become stocks of collective economic organizations. A fourth  problem is that in dividing post-tax profits some enterprises  have too low collective accumulation proportions. A fifth  problem is the severe sluggishness of rural financial and bond  market establishment, making it difficult to bring into full  play the positive role of shareholding cooperatives.  <H5>  Thoughts and Suggestions </H5>   I have the following understanding of Shandong's  shareholding  cooperative issues based on this investigation:    The direction of rural enterprise reform and development is  toward shareholding cooperatives. The shareholding cooperative  system unites the shareholding system and cooperative system. It  is another mighty creation following the broad masses of peasant  households joined in the contract responsibility system. In  terms of practical significance, the shareholding cooperative  system is beneficial to delimiting and clarifying production  relationships, promoting the separation of government and  enterprises, implementing enterprise self-autonomy, and really  turning enterprises into self-operating, self-restraining,  self-developing production managers and main competitive  entities in the market responsible for their own profits and  losses. It is beneficial to enhancing the enterprise workers'  consciousness of being masters and at the same time motivating  the enthusiasm of producers, managers and owners in many  respects. It is beneficial to fully utilizing idle social funds,  attracting consumption funds to the production area and turning  potential, scattered factors of production into real  productivity. It is beneficial to breaking down barriers between  higher and lower levels and between different departments and  regions and to promoting the appropriate circulation and  superior combination of funds, technology and talent resources.  It is beneficial to attracting foreign investment, developing an  externally oriented economy and approaching the international  market. In sum, the shareholding cooperative system accords with  the basic principles and needs of developing a socialist market  economy.    We should firmly uphold positive and safe policies in  developing the shareholding cooperative system. Considered from  a nation al perspective, at present the shareholding cooperative  system is under exploration at the preliminary development  stage. Thus, we must firmly uphold both positive and safe  policies. On the one hand, we must enhance leadership work over  the system and motivate its continuous development via  ideological arousal, policy guidance, information exchange,  models and examples and consulting services. On the other hand,  we must pay attention to avoid and overcome profiteering, blind  pandering and lopsided searches for quantity. In particular, we  must from first to last firmly uphold the principles of the  wishes of the masses. To ensure the stable and healthy  development of the shareholding cooperative system, we  definitely must not ignore objective factors and the wishes of  the masses, engaging in "rigid uniformity."    To develop the cooperative shareholding system we must  handle  well the three following relationships: 1) The relationship  among the state, collectives, and individuals. In implementing  the system, we must both guarantee the proper rights and  interests of internal and external shareholders as well as  prevent harming national and collective interests by giving  "full dividends with nothing left." In practice, stressing the  first and neglecting the second is relatively common. Therefore,  regarding profit distribution, accumulation and retained ratios  must be clarified. 2) The relationship between agriculture and  nonagricultural industries. An especially noteworthy matter at  present and in the future is to extend the cooperative  shareholding system from industry toward the planting and  growing and service industries according to funding priorities  and market demands. We must guide shareholding cooperative  enterprises toward developing synthesized agricultural,  industrial, and commercial operations with unified production,  supply and consumption to motivate coordinated development of  various rural industries. 3) The relationship between rights,  interests, and risk. Stocks unite rights, interests, and risk.  Mutually enjoyed rights, interests, and risk commonly borne is a  basic principle of the shareholding system. At the present  stage, peasant awareness of risk is generally rather weak. In  some places where peasants split profits and are allowed to  rescind stock, this augments to a large degree their psychology  of obtaining benefit without bearing risk. This is detrimental  to developing the shareholding cooperative system. To resolve  this issue, we must firmly uphold the nonreedemable nature of  stock. The cash stocks that enterprises also issue cannot be  rescinded.    Rural enterprises practicing a shareholding cooperative  system require the support of society and complementary reforms.  Implementing such a system is a major change in the title  relationships, organizational structure and allocation system of  rural enterprises. It involves many things, is of a strong  policy nature and requires the support of the entire society  with complementary reforms to improve the environment external  to enterprises. At the present stage we must stress resolution  of the following issues: One, further improve knowledge at each  sector and level of leading comrades, especially rural (town)  leadership, and remove ideologial and work obstacles. Two,  accelerate the transformation of government functioning and the  reform of related industrial, commercial, taxation, and fiscal  systems. Three, emphasize formulation of laws, regulations and  operating methods suited to the development needs of the  shareholding cooperative system, putting the system's  development onto the legal track. Four, accelerate  establishment of bond markets and rural financial institution  reform.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: BOC The fear that the equity market might be rattled by company profits lagging behind talk of recovery may be coming true. BOC has particular problems in its healthcare business now that its staple anaesthetic Forane has come off patent, and its loss of market share is responsible for the bulk of this year's likely profits fall. However, it now seems that BOC's medical equipment business is also feeling the chill of cuts in healthcare spending ahead of Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton's reforms. While it is hardly startling that medical businesses are under pressure, the company's downbeat comments about industrial gases are more worrying. Profits are flat despite sales increases in local currency terms, implying a fall in margins. In part that may be because some long-term contracts with large users are up for renegotiation at lower prices. These take-or-pay contracts with industrial users - such as chemical and steel companies - also mean that BOC is not heavily geared to an upturn in gas usage. At the other end of the scale there is little sign of increased activity by the construction or engineering businesses which are users of compressed cylinder gas. If anything they are still economising by using fewer cylinders to save on rental charges. Perhaps most disturbing is the fact that the pattern is similar throughout BOC's main markets. UK construction and engineering shares have been driven up to very fancy ratings in the sure and certain expectation of recovery. A little disappointment seems in order.</p>

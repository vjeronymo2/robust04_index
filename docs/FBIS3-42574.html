			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korotkova and Leonid Zavarskiy: "The </F> State Regulates Private Imports: A Customs Committee  Instruction"]    [Text] The much-discussed Government Decree No. 1322  of 23 December, which establishes the rules for import and  export of goods by private parties, has been taken one step  further. The Russian State Customs Committee [GTK] issued an  Instruction No. 553 "On Temporary Urgent Measures Regarding  Implementation of the Government Decree." And although a  concrete mechanism of its implementation is still under  development, according to this customs document, new rules for  moving goods and means of transportation by individuals, in the  part of value quotas and amount of duties, were introduced on 1  January. As we were told in the Customs Committee, the new rules  so far do not extend to those who left for abroad before 31  December. Nevertheless, it is expected that the new rules will  begin to apply to their full extent in February, and therefore  we believe that it would be useful to learn about its basic  provisions and to prepare for possible consequences of the  upcoming innovations.    First of all, while reducing the value quota of duty-free  importation of goods by private parties from $5,000 to $2,000,  the government set a single rate of custom duties for  individuals in an amount equal to 60 percent of the customs  value of imported goods. Duties at this rate will be applied  only to amounts exceeding $2,000. This measure undoubtedly is  aimed first and foremost against "shuttle" business and is quite  justified from the standpoint of replenishing the state budget,  since the main flow of goods comes into the Russian market  precisely through these uncontrolled private imports.  Nevertheless, people who have nothing to do with commercial  imports may fall under this "shuttle" category, while customs  officials get another source of income. The point is that a  customs official is a person vested with the power to determine  for what purpose an item is being brought in and to agree with  the declared customs value--which, as is known, in a number of  instances may differ considerably from base prices used by the  customs (catalog prices of leading Western companies).    The greatest troubles are in store for foreign car lovers.  In  order to bring in a new car duty-free, one now has to have spent  at least six months abroad. However, if the engine displacement  volume is greater than 1,800 cubic centimeters, there is a  mandatory duty of 5 ECU per 1 cubic centimeter of engine  displacement value. Also, an automobile is considered new if it  is less than one year old or has a mileage of less than 20,000  km. As Vladimir Chuvayev, chief of the GTK's nontrade turnover  customs control department, explained to KOMMERSANT, when cars  with lesser displacement value are brought in, the terms of  import depend only on the length of the individual's  uninterrupted stay abroad. According to the GTK's official  version, the new customs barrier will facilitate combating  illegal and semilegal import of foreign cars, since in the past  "gray" importers paid a considerably smaller customs duty than  official dealers of foreign companies. Now this difference will  disappear. KOMMERSANT experts believe, however, that new duties  are a strictly fiscal measure. As to foreign car dealerships'  retail prices, in their opinion, for automobiles with more than  a 2-liter engine alone it will almost double. Another blow will  be dealt to sales of foreign cars.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA EAST REGIONAL AT GREENSBORO, N.C.;  </P> <P> MINNESOTA GUNS DOWN KANSAS ST.  </P> <P> Willie Burton stayed up late the night before, cutting down to size the mask  that protects his broken nose. Then he cut up Kansas State with his shooting.  </P> <P> Burton scored 18 of his 29 points in the first half Thursday, and Minnesota  downed the Wildcats, 86-75, in the first round of the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. East Regional at Greensboro, N.C.  </P> <P> "The first mask I wore (in practice), I couldn't see at all," Burton said.  "This one wasn't much better. That's why I had to work on it. I filed away some  of the plastic so I could see better and I cut out some of the padding so it  would fit closer to my face."  </P> <P> Burton hit eight of 15 shots, made 11 free throws without a miss and grabbed 13  rebounds.  </P> <P> Minnesota (18-11), which made only 77 three-point shots in 28 regular-season  games, came out firing. The Gophers sank six of nine three-pointers in the  first half, including four straight to take a 28-14 lead in the first 11:18.  </P> <P> "Minnesota shot the ball very well in the first half, especially from  three-point range," Kansas State Coach Lon Kruger said. "It was critical that  they got on top of us early."  </P> <P> The Gophers made eight of 12 three-pointers in the game, the last one by Melvin  Newbern with 3:50 left after the Wildcats (19-11) used a full-court press to  make a 14-4 run and slice the lead to 67-62. Newbern added two free throws to  restore Minnesota's lead to 72-62.  </P> <P> Just before Newbern's basket, Minnesota got a critical break after it appeared  Kansas State's pressure had forced the Gophers into another turnover. However,  the officials conferred and gave the ball back to Minnesota.  </P> <P> "That was a tough stretch," Kansas State Coach Lon Kruger said. "You think  you've got possession, five (points) down with four (minutes) to go. Now it's  our possession and we're eight down."  </P> <P> Kevin Lynch scored 18 points and Newbern added 12 for Minnesota. Steve Henson  scored 24 points and LaKeith Humphrey added 16 for Kansas State.  </P> <P> This was the second time Minnesota had beaten Kansas State this season. The  Gophers won, 72-67, on Jan. 7 at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Duke 90, South Carolina State 69 -- Phil Henderson scored a career-high 22  points, and Danny Ferry added 18 as the ninth-ranked Blue Devils overpowered  the Bulldogs.  </P> <P> Scoring 12 of its 20 first-half baskets on layups or dunks, Duke (25-4) led,  49-34, by halftime.  </P> <P> Arthur Caldwell scored 20 points for South Carolina State (25-5), which was in  the game at 25-22 when the Blue Devils blew away with 10 straight points.  </P> <P> Duke had a 55-37 lead when the Bulldogs, in their first NCAA appearance, scored  11 straight points and closed to 55-46.  </P> <P> South Carolina State closed to 58-50 on Steven Mazyck's three-pointer, but Duke  ran off a 15-2 spurt for a 73-52 lead on Ferry's three-pointer with 8:52 left.  </P> <P> West Virginia 84, Tennessee 68 -- Herbie Brooks scored 22 points, and Ray  Forster added 19 as the No. 17 Mountaineers overwhelmed the Volunteers.  </P> <P> Dyron Nix vainly tried to keep Tennessee (19-11) in it, scoring 15 of his 22  points in the first half, when West Virginia (26-4) built a 35-23 lead. Nix  made seven of 14 shots in the half, but the rest of the Volunteers were two for  17.  </P> <P> West Virginia scored the first six points of the second half to push the lead  to 47-27 on Steve Berger's jumper with 16:53 remaining. The closest Tennessee  got the rest of the way was 57-45 on Doug Roth's three-pointer with 10:28 left.  </P></p>

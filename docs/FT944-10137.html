			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Gonzalez backed on favouritism allegations Mr Felipe Gonzalez's minority government yesterday won the support of its Catalonian and Basque political allies against allegations that the Spanish prime minister had favoured the business dealings of his brother-in-law. Leaders of the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties, whose votes keep the ruling Socialist party in power, endorsed the prime minister and accused the opposition conservative Partido Popular of seeking to make political capital out of false corruption allegations. In an unprecedented cross-fire of accusations and denials, the Madrid newspaper El Mundo has been printing front page stories connecting Mr Francisco Palomino, a Seville businessman married to Mr Gonzalez's sister, to government contracts, and on a daily basis the prime minister's spokesman has issued lengthy rebuttals of El Mundo's allegations. The newspaper alleges that Mr Palomino sold a bankrupt boilermaking business owned by his family at a considerable profit to a company that subsequently hired him as a non-executive director and was engaged by the government to install electronic systems in a nuclear-proof bunker built alongside Mr Gonzalez's official residence. The allegations have been attacked as 'falsehoods' in a succession of statements issued by the prime minister's office and they have been called a 'pack of lies' by Mr Gonzalez. 'I have never shown favouritism, nor do I intend to, nor have I ever been asked to,' said the prime minister. Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan nationalist leader, pledged to continue supporting the Socialist party because it had won the 1993 elections and in order to ensure the 'governability' of the nation. Mr Pujol, whose executive in Catalonia also faces a series of corruption scandals, some of which are linked to jailed Barcelona financier Mr Javier de la Rosa, said he opposed the PP because the conservatives were unsympathetic to Catalan authonomy and lacked alternative policies to those of the government. Mr Inaki Anasagasti, the parliamentary spokesman of the Basque nationalists, accused the conservative opposition of 'bully boy tactics' for backing El Mundo's allegations and said he stood by the 'honesty of Felipe Gonzalez'. The endorsements by the government's political allies suggest that the PP, who scored an outright victory over the Socialist party in June's European elections and maintain a 10-point lead in opinion polls, are no nearer unseating Mr Gonzalez. But the jury is out on whether the prime minister, who last night was due to address the nation in a TV 'fireside' chat, has won the propaganda battle with the public over his credibility.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 29, IRNA -- Lebanese prominent  religious scholar Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in his Friday prayer  address today in south Lebanon attacked the hostile policy of  the US towards the Islamic Republic of Iran. He termed the  recent accusations levelled against Iran by US Secretary of  State Warren Christopher as baseless and false.    "Yes, Iran supports freedom fighters and Muslims in Lebanon,  Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and if those who struggle for  freedom and for liberation of their lands are terrorist in the  U.S. view, then Americans are also terrorits because they fought  the British colonizers," Fadlallah argued. He said Iran does  not support terrorism, but it has supported the liberation  movements. Under the pretext that Iran has taken a negative  stand towards the peace process, the U.S. has always called to  ostracize and impose sanctions on Iran, but Iran's view is to  create peace among the oppressed nations.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ISRAEL BIGGEST THREAT, IRAN TOLD  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of Iranians converged on Tehran University today  shouting, "Death to Israel, death to America!" President Ayatollah Hashemi  Rafsanjani told them that fighting Israel is a Muslim's highest duty.  </P> <P> The rally, combined with Friday prayers, marked "Qods (Jerusalem) Day," the  last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which Iran's late supreme  leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, dedicated to the support of the  Palestinian cause.  </P> <P> The crowd included women clad in black chadors, or Islamic head-to-toe  coverings, and children. The annual turnout is widely seen as a barometer of  the public support Iran's clerical leaders can muster.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani criticized Arab countries like Egypt which he said understand the  danger from Israel but did nothing about it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH FALLS APART AT LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach fell apart in the second half Saturday, losing its fourth  consecutive game, 43-21, to Nevada Las Vegas in the Silver Bowl at Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Overcoming a 14-7 halftime deficit, the Rebels scored 36 points in the second  half, more than they had scored in a single game this season.  </P> <P> Las Vegas, 4-4 overall and 3-2 in the Big West, intercepted two passes by  quarterback Paul Oates in the third quarter and turned each into eventual  touchdowns. The Rebels then poured it on, aided by an ineffective 49er defense.  </P> <P> Long Beach fell to 3-7 and 1-4 and has given up 40 or more points five times.  </P> <P> Oates had a poor game, completing only 12 of 36 passes.

Stott completed 18 of 23 passes  for 326 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Keenan McCardell caught seven of Stott's passes for 139 yards and one  touchdown.  </P> <P> In the Rebels' 19-point third quarter, Stott hit Rickie Wills on a 51-yard  scoring pass play to close to 14-13.  </P> <P> Then Stott drove the Rebels 63 yards in six plays to put them ahead for good,  19-14, with 4:35 left in the quarter.

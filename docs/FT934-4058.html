			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / The heat is on for UK power: Economic viability will be the big question in the government's nuclear review Any company which earns nearly half a billion pounds in six months is keen to trumpet the fact. But when Nuclear Electric unveiled interim profits of Pounds 497m last week, it was also sending a clear message to its owner, the British government: 'Privatise us.' The next few months will tell whether that message got through. Any day now the government will launch a much-awaited review of the UK nuclear power industry. Although the terms of reference have still to be announced, the outcome is bound to determine whether nuclear power faces a future of growth or whether it will be condemned to decline and ultimately extinction. Nuclear Electric, the largest component of the industry with 11 nuclear stations in England and Wales, is eager to prove that nuclear power is not only necessary to the country's energy supply but able to stand on its own commercial feet. It will be no easy task. The industry's troubled history, its unfulfilled promises of boundless cheap electricity, its appetite for state support and costly technologies, its unfavourable public image, will all have to be overcome if the review is to have a positive outcome. Doubts about nuclear power exist not only in the mind of the general public, but also among the City of London financial community which forced the government to drop nuclear power from its electricity privatisation programme only four years ago. The risks, bankers and investors thought, were too great for the private sector to bear. This scepticism is not unique to Britain. Since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 only two big industrialised countries have stuck to a policy of expanding nuclear capacity: Japan and France. Many others, including the US, Italy and Sweden, have moratoria or outright bans on new nuclear plants. Although disappointments with nuclear power have instilled wariness in the UK government, it does not, like other countries, have any outright objections to it. However, ministers have made clear that any development must be capable of being funded by the private sector. 'It cannot be assumed that the government will provide the finance for new (nuclear) capacity in the future,' said Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, in a recent speech to trade unionists. 'In the context of an extremely tough spending round, why should the taxpayer be willing to fund new nuclear stations costing several billions, when this money could fund hospitals, schools or policemen on the beat?' The industry knows that economic viability will be the central question in the review, and it has already taken steps to deal with it. Since the aborted privatisation, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, its cousin north of the border with two power stations, have undertaken a vigorous campaign to reduce costs and cut staff. Nuclear Electric has managed to raise its share of the electricity market in England and Wales over that period from 16 per cent to almost 25 per cent. This sharp improvement has been largely due to its success in overcoming technical difficulties with its five advanced gas-cooled reactor stations that were built in the 1970s. Scottish Nuclear has achieved a 20 per cent increase in output while cutting the cost of its product by 10 per cent through improved efficiency. Nuclear Electric has also brought in private sector blood, including Dr Robert Hawley, its chief executive who last year moved over from Northern Engineering Industries, part of Rolls-Royce, and is keen to escape from the governmental leash. Nuclear Electric's confidence that it can be sold to the private sector rests on its assertion that, as Mr John Collier, the chairman, said in announcing last week's results, 'we are every bit as commercial as the privatised generators'. The main indication of this is the company's claim that it would be able to produce electricity from a newly built nuclear station at less than 3p a unit. This is within reach of prices in the wholesale market in England and Wales known as the electricity pool where power this year has traded at an average of about 2.6p a unit. However, the 3p claim has been greeted with some scepticism in the markets. One reason is that it assumes a capital financing cost of 8 per cent - the figure used by the government in all its big projects. However, this is well below the level that the financial market is likely to demand. 'The private sector will insist on at least 12 per cent,' says Mr Gordon MacKerron of Sussex University's science policy and research unit. 'Eight per cent is for very unrisky businesses. Nuclear is subjected to any number of risks - regulatory, political, insurance and accident.' The risk element has further implications. Much of the expected cost of nuclear power is the so-called back-end element needed to pay for disposing of radioactive waste and decommissioning radioactive plant. The nuclear companies set money aside for this each year, but less than will actually be needed because they assume the money will accrue interest over the decommissioning period after a plant is closed down, 50 years in the case of a new station. Mr Clive Bates, of Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, sees a problem with this. 'They (the nuclear companies) say their estimates are conservative but the problems come when you vary the decommissioning period. Where would the money come from, for example, if environmental circumstances forced them to decommission after 20 years?' Nuclear Electric's efforts to project itself as a financially viable, stand-alone concern have also been bedevilled by the so-called nuclear levy: Pounds 1.3bn which is added to electricity consumers' bills every year to help build up the provisions for decommissioning. Although the levy will shrink over the coming years and is scheduled to disappear altogether in 1998, it has been held up by nuclear's critics as proof of its inability to survive as a fully commercial concern. The accusation is misdirected, says Nuclear Electric, because the levy proceeds are intended not to create new provisions but to replace provisions which were created by the former Central Electricity Generating Board but not transferred to Nuclear Electric when it was incorporated in 1990. At the moment, the levy transforms Nuclear Electric's bottom line from a loss into a profit. Without it the latest result would have been Pounds 118m in the red. But Nuclear Electric has set itself the target of making a profit before levy proceeds by 1995. Scottish Nuclear, which does not benefit from the levy, makes a profit - Pounds 65.8m last year - with the help of some premium-priced supply contracts with Scottish Power and Hydro-Elecric. Unfortunately for Nuclear Electric's public relations offensive, however, Scottish Nuclear has recently lost its earlier enthusiasm for privatisation. Mr James Hann, its chairman, has expressed concern that some people in government think their main task is to get state-owned energy concerns 'off their hands and in the quickest time possible'. He thinks the nuclear power industry should concentrate on becoming more commercial before entertaining ideas of entering the private sector. His view tends to find a strong echo in the City where industry analysts and bankers still see too much uncertainty in nuclear power for investors' comfort. 'Potential investors will need a lot of convincing before they even begin to look at the industry seriously,' says one observer. 'There have been too many problems in the past.' However, the criterion for privatisation is not simply whether Nuclear Electric is commercial. Equally important is whether it can look forward to a future of growth, and a rising stream of dividends to attract investors. This raises the more publicly controversial question of whether Britain should build new nuclear power stations. At the moment, only one station is being built: Sizewell B in Suffolk which is due to start up next year. But over the next decade the six remaining first-generation Magnox reactors will have to be replaced if nuclear capacity is to retain its present level, and more will have to be built if the industry is to expand. Nuclear Electric has already lodged an application to build Sizewell C, the third station on the Sizewell site, to the annoyance of the government which saw this as jumping the review gun. However, the company has also made clear that building only one station would not be enough. If nuclear is to achieve the full economies of scale and compete with other fuels, it will need the go-ahead for several more. 'Sizewell C could not stand on its own. It would have to be part of a series,' says Nuclear Electric's Dr Hawley who believes that nuclear needs a sustained 20-30 per cent share of the electricity market to realise its full potential. Thus, privatisation could imply a huge commitment to nuclear power, probably on a scale that ministers would have difficulty accepting, and public opinion might not tolerate. Anticipating such opposition, the industry has been pressing the government to extend the review beyond questions of financial viability to include wider benefits which it argues nuclear can bring. Chief among these is the environment. The fact that nuclear power produces no gas emissions could help the government achieve its international commitments to clean Britain's atmosphere. Another is the need for a diversified energy supply to check the growing dependence on fossil fuels, particularly finite reserves of North Sea gas. A third is the substantial employment that nuclear energy creates, particularly during the construction phase. A fourth is the preservation of the skills and technology that Britain has acquired through its nuclear programme. And the fifth is a much improved safety record. Whether ministers will be moved by any of these arguments remains to be seen. The environmental case has a hefty counterweight in the risks of radioactive contamination and the large amount of irradiated equipment which has to be dealt with when a nuclear station closes. The problem of nuclear waste management has already given the government a headache with the decision on whether to proceed with the Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria. Fuel diversity is scarcely an issue at a time when Britain enjoys the widest choice of energy in its industrial history (coal, oil, gas and nuclear) though the long lead times needed to build nuclear stations might strengthen the case for preserving a nuclear programme in anticipation of possible fuel shortages next century. At the moment, UK generating capacity vastly exceeds demand. The technological case for maintaining a nuclear industry would need to be treated with caution. Although the UK led the world in developing civil nuclear power, it failed to capitalise on the achievement, and the most widespread technologies used elsewhere in the world are now non-British. This suggests that a privatised Nuclear Electric, freed of any obligation to 'buy British', might even opt for a US or a Japanese model. In the mind of the general public, safety is a key issue in any decision to expand nuclear power. In spite of Chernobyl, the UK industry is keen to see the issue debated because it believes that it now has a good story to tell. Mr Collier, the Nuclear Electric chairman, says: 'The industry is one of the safest industries in the UK. There has never been an emergency putting the public at risk during 30 years of civil nuclear power operations.' Mr Hawley says the average Briton gets a larger dose of radiation from eating a chocolate Brazil nut than from an average annual exposure to nuclear power. There are no simple answers for the government in the forthcoming review, and ministers will have to follow a complex line of arguments. Does Britain need more nuclear power? If the answer is yes but the government declines to pay for it, the job would have to go to the private sector. But would the City be prepared to finance the industry, and would the public be prepared to accept the expansion of nuclear capacity that would be necessary to make it viable? There must be strong doubts about all these questions. However the government might decide that the national interest warranted special action of some kind. Ministers could, for example, take the Magnox stations off Nuclear Electric's hands and free it to enter the private sector unburdened by past liabilities. Or if they attached value to nuclear's environmental case, they could help by treating some of its decommissioning expenses as a social cost to be charged to the taxpayer. In other words the government could underwrite the liabilities. But Mr John Baker, who argued the case for Sizewell B when at the Central Electricity Generating Board and is now chief executive of the National Power generating company, says such an outcome would need a significant change of attitude by ministers. 'The government has always had rules which say that if you carry the liabilities you take the assets as well. Privatisation is for the birds unless the government changes the rules.'

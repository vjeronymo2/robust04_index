			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Israel may float 51% of El Al The Israeli government is expected to announce plans for a stock market flotation of about 51 per cent of El Al, the state-owned airline, following a cabinet meeting next week. Israel's finance ministry has appointed two consortia of advisers to conduct a valuation of the airline. One of them includes Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank. An official at Israel's privatisation office said no participant in the valuation consortia would be allowed to act as underwriter when shares were finally offered to the public, apparently ruling BZW out of a wider role. Israel's privatisation rules require the government to seek a second opinion on the value of a publicly-owned company and both valuations would play a part in setting the price for shares.</p>

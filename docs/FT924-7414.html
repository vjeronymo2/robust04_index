			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Keeping a lid on Cumbria's nuclear dustbin: David Lascelles on the debate over authorisation of the reprocessing facility THE FUTURE of British Nuclear Fuel's new reprocessing plant at Sellafield should, technically, be decided by the authorisation process which was set in motion yesterday by the Pollution Inspectorate. The real question, however, is whether political feelings over this controversial project now run so high that ministers from several government departments will feel obliged to intervene. The inspectorate's proposals are unlikely to allay widespread public concern about the health risks posed by the plant, and its role as what environmental lobbyists describe as a 'nuclear dustbin'. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, has powers to call for a public hearing, and he will be watching the coming debate closely. Not that the pollution inspectorate intends to give Sellafield's Thorp plant an easy ride. The 2in-thick draft authorisation issued for public discussion yesterday sets much tougher limits for radioactive emissions than British Nuclear Fuels asked for. The inspectorate will continue to tighten these up to reduce Sellafield's radiological impact still further, and officials stress that their policy is to 'screw down' standards. But the inspectorate's brief is narrow. Its main task is to ensure that British Nuclear Fuels, like other polluting industries, uses the best available technology to clean up its act within the bounds of reasonable cost. Although this addresses the environmental issue, the 'green' lobby has already taken the argument over Sellafield far beyond that issue and is now questioning its very existence. The coming debate will raise many issues. One is whether Thorp is even commercially viable, as British Nuclear Fuels claims it is. Built at a cost of Pounds 1.85bn over eight years, it is designed to handle spent fuel from the new generation of pressurised-water reactors. One of only two in the world - the other is near Cherbourg in France - its order books are full for the first 10 years, and 40 per cent full for the following decade. British Nuclear Fuels claims that this Pounds 9bn of business will generate Pounds 500m of profits in the first 10 years. But critics claim that its assumptions are too optimistic. What is clear is that the high costs of reprocessing are already driving potential customers away, and the cheaper alternative of storing spent fuel is becoming more attractive. Although existing customers will have to compensate British Nuclear Fuels if they break their contracts, there is a danger that the plant could become redundant. This is a matter for the Department of Trade and Industry, which is keen to see British Nuclear Fuels succeed because of its advanced technology and contribution to exports. But it will also be a matter for the Treasury, which will have to balance Sellafield's earning power against its wider financial and other costs. Another issue has already been sparked by the row over the recent shipment of a tonne of processed plutonium by the French plant back to Japan. British Nuclear Fuel's contracts oblige its customers to take back their processed waste, but the possibility of some kind of ban on international shipments of dangerous materials could lead to it having to nurse other countries' nuclear rubbish. As it is, the company will be left with the residue and its own irradiated equipment. There is also a conflict between the UK's desire to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons and its encouragement of an industry that ships around the world large amounts of material that could have military applications. Although it may be a year or two before Sellafield has to start shipping processed plutonium of its own, there are clearly issues here for the Foreign Office. A factor might be the change of administration in the US where Mr Bill Clinton, the president-elect, is expected to take a much tougher line against nuclear waste. Although this period of consultation was always foreseen and does not, as many of the company's critics claim, mark a last-minute effort by ministers to halt Thorp, it comes at a sensitive time. What should have been a routine final step in Thorp's authorisation threatens to become an important investigation into its future. Mr Howard will have to weigh a complex set of considerations as he decides whether to step in. The picture could be further complicated by judicial challenges to the inspectorate and the Department of the Environment by activist lobby groups. One observer remarked: 'It's one of those cases where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't'</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / US bond market rallies on producer price fall FRESH EVIDENCE that faster economic growth is putting little upward pressure on prices helped to restore confidence in the US bond market yesterday after heavy selling of bonds and shares last week. The US Labour Department reported yesterday that the producer price index fell 0.2 per cent last month and rose only a marginal 0.2 per cent in the year to October. The figures were much better than generally expected. Most analysts were looking for an increase in producer prices of about 0.2 per cent. Bond prices rose sharply, partly reversing sharp recent declines. In late New York trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 21/32 at 101 7/16 , yielding 6.139 per cent. Wall Street share prices ended the day down, reversing an earlier rally in blue-chip issues. The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 3,640.07, down 7.83. Analysts, however, were keenly awaiting today's consumer price figures, which are not expected to be as favourable as the wholesale price data. The consensus forecast is that consumer prices will rise about 0.3 per cent, although about a third of that increase will reflect a 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase in petrol taxes, which took effect last month. The year-on-year increase is expected to be less than 3 per cent. The 'core' producer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, fell 0.5 per cent last month and was up only 0.1 per cent in the year to October. However, that largely reflected a 3.9 per cent drop in seasonally adjusted car prices, a one-off decline associated with the introduction of new 1994 models. Excluding cars, core producer prices were roughly flat last month. Mr Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, the New York securities firm, said: 'In a productivity-led recovery, faster growth does not have to lead to higher inflation.' He noted that wholesale prices had fallen at an annual rate of 3 per cent in the past six months, reversing an apparent rise in inflation early this year. The bond market had been wrong to panic last week at signs of more rapid US growth, he said. Other analysts were more reserved about inflation trends. Mr Jim O'Sullivan, economist at JP Morgan, the New York bank, said: 'This was probably the last of the great news on inflation.' He said several special factors had artificially reduced wholesale prices in recent months. See Lex</p>

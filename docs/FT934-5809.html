			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: The What? The Iron Man - Alastair Macaulay writes to his teenage niece Dear Kate, Well, if I'd known long in advance that Pete Townshend had written his new rock opera for children 'as a Dad', I'd have asked you to join me for the first night. He adapted it from the original story by Ted Hughes - who wrote it for his children. Whoever expected a tale by the Poet Laureate to be turned into a rock musical? Well, if Andrew Lloyd Webber did it to TS Eliot (Cats) . . . Since it's a rock musical, you will think it would suit you a whole lot better than it does me - you know how we disagree about Les Mis. and Joseph  -but in this case I'm not sure it would. Hughes wrote the story to help his children learn to confront fear. All that side of it would interest you. But I wonder whether the music or the words would get under your skin. To me, the show's most wonderful feature is Anthony Barclay, who plays Hogarth, the central role, the boy who makes friends with the huge metal-devouring iron man, conquers his fear, and wins round everyone else. Barclay has been in several very different musicals in recent years - Assassins, The Fantasticks, Children of Eden - and he always makes a good impression. Hogarth is not the big demanding role he deserves at this point in his career, but he plays it with such simple integrity that he sweeps you up. He never does any of that bright-eyed musical-comedy cutie-pie stuff I hate so much; he has the kind of bones and dark eyes that are perfect for an idealistic young hero; and when the shows really lets him sing (not often enough), he can. (One of the show's mistakes is that, in trying to make Hogarth sound boyish, it sets his music high; and Barclay is asked to croon most of it in a pale half-tenor. It's not much of a musical that stops its leading role from having a really good sing, is it?) Almost everything else about the show is less than wonderful, but a lot better than dreadful. It doesn't always tell its story clearly - which could make a young audience restless. I have a hunch you haven't read Hughes's tale, but it's probably better (if you go) if the story takes you by surprise. The words are surprisingly intelligent - not surprising when Townshend drew them from a story by the Poet Laureate, but surprising when you think of most recent musicals. Nothing smart-alec about them, and not too much heavy rhyming; but nothing corny or soupy either. Not quite enough of the music is really rock. (Do admit you never expected to hear me say that.) Too much of it is tuneless and beatless - like ponderous recitative - trying desperately to be expressive, but without impulse. Parts are discordant (daring in a musical); other parts are almost like the things children chant in playgrounds. But suddenly there are songs that loom out and catch everyone up. A Star Spirit sings 'Don't be afraid of the night' twice in Act One, a beautiful rising melody. In Act Two, she returns as a man-eating Space Dragon and sings 'I want fast food fast', kind of dirty. David Thacker, who helped Townshend to adapt the story, is also the director. As you know, rock musicals usually depend on scenery and special effects. This one has a huge 20-foot-high iron man who takes a few lumbering steps to and fro; the she-Dragon goes high in a trapeze; there is any amount of scrap metal onstage (the woman next to me said 'I'd like to have a good rummage'). In the big fight it's not clear at first whether the Iron man is wielding fire on her or has been set on fire by her. But special effects aren't really the point (a plus in my book, but maybe not in yours). The Iron Man is really about psychology - about learning to handle fear and aggression - and it ends optimistically. I'm glad you all loved seeing Les Mis. over half-term. No, I haven't changed my mind about it, I'm afraid. Let's talk about it at Christmastime. Love from your wicked uncle in the big city. PS What I'd actually like to know most is whether you've heard of Pete Townshend. (My taxi driver, who was born in 1962, hadn't) When I was your age and younger, he was a big name with The Who. See if your father still has LPs of their music; I used to borrow them from him in the 1960s. To my mind, the stuff he was writing then still has more edge today. It still sounds as if he needed to write it, whereas The Iron Man sounds like a task he had set himself. The Iron Man continues at the Young Vic until February 12.

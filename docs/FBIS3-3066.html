More than 600 overseas businessmen from Japan, Hong Kong,  the  United States, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Italy,  Singapore and Taiwan attended the ceremony.    It is estimated that more than 3,000 overseas businessmen  will attend the fair.    Shandong, one of the leading economic powers in China, held  the first Qingdao Foreign Trade Fair in 1982. This year the  local government advanced the date of the fair and cut short its  duration from the usual 10 days to seven days.    A delegation from northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region is attending the fair.</p>

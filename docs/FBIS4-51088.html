			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] After successfully completing various agendas with  joint efforts of all its deputies, the Second Session of the  Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress ended  victoriously on the afternoon of 24 May.    The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional  People's Congress held its fourth meeting at the People's Hall  of Tibet. Comrade Raidi, executive chairman of the session and  chairman of the session's presidium standing committee, chaired  the meeting.    Seated at the rostrum's front row were chairmen of the  session's presidium standing committee Puqung, Zheng Ying,  Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, Pudoje, Namgyai, Samding Doje Pamo,  (Deqing Quzhen), Gong Daxi, Tian Fujun, Baima Duoji, (Yongzhong  Dawa), and (Cui Jiguo).    Also seated at the rostrum were Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, vice  chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee;  and leaders of the autonomous regional party committee and  government Chen Kuiyuan, Gyaincain Norbu, Basang, Hu Yongzhu, Zi  Cheng, Lieque, Buqiong, and (Lu Huimin).    Other than members of the session's presidium, those sitting  at the rostrum also included leaders of the autonomous regional  government, the regional Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference committee, the Tibet Military District, the regional  people's armed police corps, the regional higher people's court,  and the regional people's procuratorate.    The number of deputies who were supposed to attend the  meeting was 448; 36 requested a leave of absence due to sickness  or other reasons. The number of attending deputies was 362,  enough to qualify for a quorum.    Attending the meeting as observers were the secretary  general  of the autonomous regional people's government; deputy  secretaries general of the autonomous regional people's congress  standing committee; comrades in charge of various autonomous  regional departments, bureaus, commissions, institutions of  higher learning, Tibet-based offices from other inland provinces  and municipalities, and units under the party Central Committee;  and comrades in charge of various prefectures, cities, and  counties.    Voting with a show of hands at the meeting, the deputies  adopted a resolution on the government work report. After  careful deliberation, the meeting held: With joint efforts of  governments at various levels, Tibet remarkably accelerated its  pace of reform and opening up in 1993. Tibet has further  developed its economy, has further enhanced its political  stability, has further fostered unity among nationalities, and  has accomplished new achievements in various construction  projects.    The meeting urged: Governments at various levels should  earnestly study socialist market economic theories, liberate the  mind, change their functions, improve workstyles,  comprehensively perform practical work, immerse themselves among  the masses, industriously and practically administer their work,  and handle and carry out concrete tasks. They should  conscientiously implement and enforce laws and regulations;  administer their work according to law; and continually improve  their capability and competence to lead the drive for reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization.    The meeting urged: Rallying around the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, Tibet's people  of various nationalities should closely unite. Under the  leadership of the regional party committee, we should be of one  heart and one mind; be united and forge ahead; greet the  autonomous regional 30th founding anniversary with outstanding  accomplishments; work hard; and wage arduous struggles to  facilitate a healthy, rapid, and sustained development [jian  kang kuai su chi xu fa zhan] of Tibet's economy and bring about  all-round social progress.    The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution on the  implementation of Tibet's economic and social development plans  in 1993 and on the plans of Tibet's economic and social  development in 1994; adopted a resolution on Tibet's final  financial accounts in 1993 and on Tibet's budget in 1994;  adopted a resolution on a Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Congress Standing Committee work report; adopted a resolution on  an autonomous regional higher people's court work report; and  adopted a resolution on an autonomous regional people's  procuratorate work report.    Raidi, executive chairman of the session and chairman of  the autonomous regional people's congress, delivered an  important speech at the meeting.    He said: The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous  Regional People's Congress has strictly stressed the central  topics regarding stability, reform, and development; has paid  close attention to the overall situation of seizing  opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside  world, enhancing development, and maintaining stability; and has  fully promoted the spirit of democracy, unity, motivational  atmosphere, and realism [min zhu tuan jie gu jin qiu shi]. All  the deputies have liberated their minds, sought truth from  facts, freely expressed their views, pooled the masses' wisdom,  and earnestly deliberated and adopted a government work report  delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu and various other items of  the session's agenda. The meeting has further specified the  guiding ideologies, basic guiding principles, and major missions  for us to perform Tibet's work in 1994.    Comrade Raidi pointed out: The key to implementing the  session's guidelines is to correctly handle relations among  stability, reform, and development. While maintaining  stability, we should strive to enhance reform and development;  and should, in turn, promote social stability with enhanced  reform and development. Stability is the prerequisite, reform  is the driving force, and development is the foundation. All  three are supplementary and complimentary to one another. We  definitely cannot pay more attention to one while neglecting the  others.    He said: The year 1994 is crucial for Tibet to conduct  comprehensive reform, to advance forward in an all-around  manner, to make major breakthroughs in certain aspects, and to  accelerate its pace of establishing a socialist market economy.  We should unwaveringly uphold the basic line of one central  task and two basic points, earnestly implement various session  resolutions, seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform,  accelerate development, and maintain stability.    At present, Tibet has political stability, stable popular  support, social stability, unity among nationalities, and a  solid border defense. However, many unstable factors still  exist. Particularly, domestic and foreign splittist elements  have ganged up with international hostile forces. They are  intensifying, in every possible way, their splittist and  sabotaging activities. We must thoroughly launch antisplittist  struggles; must sternly crack down on various splittist  activities; and must make vigorous efforts to safeguard the  motherland's unification, to strengthen unity among  nationalities, to protect Tibet's political stability, and to  ensure smooth progress in Tibet's economic construction, reform,  and opening up.    Raidi pointed out: At present, the principal tasks for  people's congresses at various levels in Tibet are to earnestly  implement the session's guidelines, to take into account Tibet's  realities while continually keeping close contacts with the  realities of life and conducting investigations and studies, to  rally efforts to establish a socialist market economy, to  develop Tibet's economy, to launch antisplittist struggles, to  maintain political stability, to strengthen legislative work, to  publicize general legal knowledge, to upgrade law-enforcement,  to further improve the system of people's congress, and to fully  protect the democratic rights of people who are masters of their  own affairs and destiny. Leading cadres at various levels must  further improve their understanding, change their workstyles,  and perform realistic tasks.    Comrade Raidi eventually expressed his hope: After returning  to their respective posts, all the deputies should continually  publicize the session's guidelines; implement the session's  resolutions; and accomplish new results in enhancing reform,  opening up, economic construction, social stability, democracy,  and the legal system in Tibet.    At 1640 [0840 GMT], the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet  Autonomous Regional People's Congress closed victoriously amidst  the rousing national anthem.</p>

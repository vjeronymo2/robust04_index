			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Burma demands more discipline BURMA'S military junta has ordered university and college teachers to take courses in enforcing discipline after renewed student protests last year, Reuter reports from Bangkok. Major General Khin Nyunt, the military intelligence chief, said the courses were to teach patriotism, support for the junta's policies and how to maintain good behaviour among students. Rangoon students demonstrated last month, calling for democracy and release of Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. The junta then closed colleges and universities throughout the country.</p>

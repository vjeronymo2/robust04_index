			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Arts: A love for the coast - William Packer considers Boudin a petit matre par excellence Horrible it may have been in other ways, but this has been at least a very good year for the painting of the 19th century. There was a delightful show at Brighton in the summer centred upon the French and British artists, Walter Sickert prominent among them, who worked in and around Dieppe; and now we have the full Sickert retrospective at the Royal Academy. An exhibition of the work of the Barbizon group, Daubigny, Rousseau et alios, has lately come on at Agnew's; and there was the Sisley show in early autumn, again at the Academy. None of these artists conspicuously altered the course of the history of western art. None bestrode his world like a Courbet, a Cezanne, a Picasso or a Matisse. Yet each, in offering a lesser example, produced work of no less particular excellence, to be admired and enjoyed for what it is. To be a petit matre is to be matre none the less. Now, with Boudin at Trouville, we have another artist of this category and quality, and an exhibition as exquisite as any them. Eugene Boudin died in 1898 at the age of 74. Though late in coming to his vocation - he did not complete his formal studies until he was 30 - he was remarkably prolific, producing something over 4000 paintings, with many thousands of drawings and water-colours besides. He was a landscape painter, with Normandy very much his home territory; but he made regular visits to Brussels and Antwerp, travelled on into Holland on occasion, and made several visits to Venice in his old age. Yet the consistency of his work is manifest in its ostensible variety, for Boudin's love was for the coast, and for the rich choice of subjects it gave him, the beach and the harbour, the sea and the sky. And if he could find such interest as well in Venice or Dordrecht, he could find it just as well along the familiar coast of his native Normandy. Most of all he could, and did, find it on his doorstep at the fashionable resort of Trouville, or on the other bank of the estuary of the Touques, at Deauville, where he made his home. The paradox is that by doing just that, he is now too easily dismissed as an artist of merely limited and local interest. The premise of this exhibition, fully justified in the event, is to offer a view of the work that Boudin produced in and around Trouville across the full span of his career, and to take it as representing the whole. The results are at once salutary and surprising, for if Boudin is misrepresented, it is indeed as simply the artist of the fashionable Parisian world of the Second Empire, taking the sea air along the beaches and promenades of Trouville, gossiping and flirting among the bathing-huts, watching the sun go down over the sea, hooped skirts swinging, bonnet-ribbons flying in the breeze. Those familiar images are presented here, of course, and in strength, as they should be, but at last they appear in their proper context along with the harbours and the jetties, the shipping standing out to sea, the washer-women along the river-bank, and the wider landscapes across the bay or up the valley behind the town. What we discover by this is an artist not limited at all, but developing rapidly and surely, in both his technique and his attitude towards his subject-matter. It is indeed true that the earlier work, of the early 1860s, is genre painting of a sort, whether it is the Empress Eugenie breezing along the front with her retinue, or a horse and cart coming down the hill on the Trouville road. The limitation is simply a preoccupation with the subject in documentary terms, with even a hint at social comment. Boudin was worried at times that he might be, for his day, a little politically incorrect. 'When you have just spent a month among people doomed to the hard labour of the fields', he wrote to a friend in 1867, '. . . and find yourself confronted with this troop of golden parasites . . . it inspires a little pity . . . and a certain shame at painting lazy idleness.' A year later he had rationalised such qualms away: 'Between you and me they are often seeking rest after working hard in their offices.' What is apparent from the work, however, is that within these few years even the most overtly fashionable of his beach scenes had become much less specific in its personal characterisation, though no less full of life and character as an image. The crowd itself takes on the active character that before was invested in a single figure, even a recognisable type. Boudin will always use a figure or group to animate a landscape, beach or jetty, and will establish the image with an extraordinary suggestive and effective economy, but gone for ever is the particular dramatis personae, the drooping whiskers and bowler hats, panniers and petticoats of the regulars to be found at Trouville, year after year throughout the 1960s. So technically as with the imagery, as Boudin absorbs the growing, contemporary example of impressionism, so he develops his own answers to the ever-changing problems of light, mood and atmosphere that confront the painter working directly from nature in the open air, sur le motif. His paintings are never large, even by the standards of the impressionists, but the physical space they conjure for us beyond the surface of the picture is as large and wide to the imagination as any landscape allows. By the 1880s, in simple, unprepossessing views across the water-meadows of the Touques, or along the Deauville road beneath a lowering grey sky, he is producing work quite as grand in its own terms as anything by his more celebrated peers, Monet or Manet, Pissarro or Sisley. This is not a large exhibition, but then, like the works themselves, it hardly needs to be. Boudin at Trouville: The Burrell Collection, Pollok Country Park, Glasgow, until February 28; then to the Courtauld Institute Galleries, Somerset House, London WC2: sponsored by the Whyte &amp; Mackay Group.</p>

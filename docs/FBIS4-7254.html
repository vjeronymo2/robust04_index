			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The Constitutional Court  ruled Thursday that the Government Organization Law, which  places the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) under the  direct control of the president, is allowed under the  Constitution.    A panel of all the Constitutional Court judges, headed by  Judge Hwang To-yon, handed down the ruling in an appeal filed by  Rep. Pak Chan-chong of the new Political Reform Party and others.    Pak and his colleagues argued that the Government  Organization Law violates the Constitution by putting the  intelligence agency under the president, not the prime minister.    "The NSP could not be included in administrative ministries  and offices' as specified in the 86th provision of the  Constitution," the ruling said.    "It is a matter of course, therefore, that the NSP could not  come under the control of the prime minister," it added.    Rep. Pak and 56 lawyers including practicing attorney Chang  Ki-uk filed the appeal in May 1989 when Song Chong-tae, an aide  to Rep. Yi Chol, was arrested by the NSP on charges of violating  the Military Secret Protection Law.    They claimed that the NSP, which the government had no  constitutional ground to establish, violated the Constitution  when it arrested Song.</p>

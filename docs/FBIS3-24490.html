Zhmako; UDC  621.373.826]    [Abstract] Nonlinear-optical properties of glasses with  microcrystals of a semiconductor compound  CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] (belonging to the  A[.sup]1[/]B[.sup]3[/]C[.sup]6[/][.sup]2[/] type),  whose edge of the fundamental absorption band lies in the near  infrared spectral region (1-1.4m), were experimentally  examined in this paper. The relationships of energy transmission  as a function of peak intensity of the incident ultrashort  pulses (USP), and the kinetics of changes in absorption of the  exploring USP at different intensities of the excitation  radiation and the width of the prohibited zone were also  studied. Single USP of the fundamental and second harmonics of  YAlO[.sup]3[/]:Nd laser with a passive synchronization of the  modes were used as the excitation source and for probing. The  USP duration was about 15 ps.  CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/] microcrystals, dispersed  in a silicate glass, with 1.06, 1.14,, 1.17, and 1.22 eV width  of the prohibited zone were examined and the results are shown  in a graph. The experiments demonstrated that in glasses  containing semiconductor microcrystals  CuInS[.sup]2x[/]Se[.sub]2(1-x)[/], the character and time  parameters of the kinetics of the absorption changes, induced by  picosecond light pulses, depend on the excitation level, and  also on the photon energy of the excitation and probing pulses.

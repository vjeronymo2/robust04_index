			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 12, 1994 (59 FR 41413) concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. No opposing comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that for the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995, the following provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In &sect;1004.7(a), the words ``40 percent in the months of September through February, and'' and ``in the months of March through August''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In &sect;1004.7(e), the word ``immediately'' and the words ``for each of the following months of March through August,''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In the introductory text of &sect;1004.12(d), the words ``in accordance with the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. In &sect;1004.12, paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This suspension reduces the total Class I disposition standard for pool distributing plants, provides automatic pool plant status for supply plants and reserve processing plants that were pool plants during each of the preceding months of September through February, and suspends the limit on the amount of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants by cooperative associations and pool plant operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first provision suspended reduces the percentage of a distributing plant's receipts that have to be disposed of as Class I milk to meet the order's pooling standards. With the suspension, a pool distributing plant will have to use at least 30 percent, rather than 40 percent, of its monthly milk receipts as Class I milk during September 1994 through February 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second provision suspended permits supply plants and reserve processing plants that have met the order's pooling standards during the months of September 1993 through February 1994 to retain pool status for the months of September 1994 through August 1995. The shipping requirements that normally would have applied to such plants during the months of September 1994 through February 1995 are eliminated under the suspension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third provision included in the suspension removes the limit on the percentage of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants by a cooperative association or a pool plant operator for the period of September 1994 through February 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suspension was requested by Pennmarva Dairymen's Federation, Inc., Atlantic Processing, Inc., Dairylea, Eastern Milk Producers Cooperative, and Lehigh Valley Dairies. Together these organizations market over 90 percent of the market's producer milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the proponents contended, producer receipts between 1991 and 1993 on Order 4 increased while the percentage of the market's producer milk used for Class I purposes consistently decreased. A comparison of monthly Class I percentages for the months of September through February of 1991, 1992, and 1993 show the continuing decline. For example, the Class I use percentage for September 1991 was 56.2, while in September 1993 it was 51.4 percent. The reduction in Class I use results in an increase in diversions to nonpool plants, making it increasingly difficult for cooperatives and pool plant operators to maintain the pool status of the milk of producers who have historically been associated with the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the decline in Class I use, two large Order 4 distributing plants with which large volumes of Order 4 diverted milk had been associated became regulated under the New York-New Jersey order, another Order 4 distributing plant closed, and two additional Order 4 distributing plants have changed their product mix, causing a reduction of pool plant deliveries for the cooperatives supplying milk to these plants. These changes have caused cooperatives and pool plants under the order to experience difficulty in associating all of their diverted producer milk with the remaining distributing plants now regulated under the Middle Atlantic order because the additional diverted milk is reducing the Class I use percentage of the plants from which it is diverted, thereby jeopardizing their status as pool plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suspension is found to be necessary to reduce uneconomic movements of milk solely for the purpose of meeting pool qualifications, and will reflect current marketing conditions without causing the milk of producers long associated with the Middle Atlantic marketing area to become depooled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: Congress gears up for vote THE WIDESPREAD assumption is that if the North American Free Trade Agreement is defeated in the House of Representatives tonight the cause of liberalised world trade is in deep trouble. There is little doubt, for example, that an even bigger cloud will promptly gather over the head of the Uruguay Round, itself due to be completed by the congressionally mandated deadline of December 15. Yet there is one element in this equation which may not stand up to scrutiny  -that a defeat for Nafta denotes such a depth of protectionism in Congress that even if the Round is concluded it, too, would face certain rejection on Capitol Hill. The pro-Nafta forces, led with exceptional intensity as the vote approaches by President Bill Clinton, understandably prefer to confine public connections between the two to warnings of the fearful consequences for the wider agreement and for the damage a Nafta defeat would inflict on US leadership as it pursues a more open global trading regime. In private, however, Nafta's supporters, and even some of its opponents, will even go so far as to argue that a cathartic rejection of the hemispheric pact would, if anything, reinforce prospects of the Uruguay Round getting through. But to admit this openly would, for the administration, have the effect of lowering the stakes and thus raising chances of Nafta's rejection. Everything, of course, initially depends on there being a Gatt agreement at all, the hopes for which will certainly not be improved if Nafta goes down. But US diplomats are quite encouraged by signals from Europe that French resistance to agricultural concessions may be softening and that it will not use a defeat for Nafta as a cover for its own refusal to reach agreement in the Uruguay Round. Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, is understood to have been particularly impressed by last week's OECD report which concluded that a Gatt agreement could enrich the world by as much as Dollars 270bn by 2002, the highest independent estimate yet of the potential accrued benefits. But the key to the more optimistic US private scenario is the sense that it will be hard to duplicate in Congress the sort of opposition to the Uruguay Round that, win or lose, has characterised the Nafta debate. Some elements of the anti-Nafta coalition, which includes the far right and the progressive left, will remain dead set against the Uruguay Round. Mr Ralph Nader's populist consumer movement, for example, sees it as yet another plot by multinational corporations to extend their hegemony over the international economy. The 'America First' lobby, associated with Mr Pat Buchanan, the conservative ideologue-politician, is inherently suspicious of international entanglements. Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate, is also making threatening noises against the Round. But the clout of the populists in Congress still does not even remotely approximate that of organised labour. And the trade union movement, which has made Nafta into such an immediate life-or-death jobs issue that it has entered into unholy alliances with the populists of the right, has no record of entrenched opposition to global trading accords as a matter of first principle. Indeed, since President Kennedy secured passage in 1962 of his Trade Expansion Act, no global bill has faced a tough fight in Congress. This is essentially because congressmen, including those on the left of the Democratic Party, do not like being labelled protectionist. Vice president Al Gore knows this full well from his years in Congress. Gatt agreements, often imperfectly understood on Capitol Hill, rarely can be construed to pose particular threats to the constituencies of individual members. As one lobbyist observed this week, 'It is hard to get people in Evanston, Illinois, excited about competition from Malaysia.' Nafta, on the other hand, deals with two neighbours, Canada and Mexico, the second of whom is demonstrably different from the US politically, socially, and in its economic development. It is a very particular US policy initiative, with no exact antecedents. Any consolation that believers in free trade may take from the above argument does not reduce the importance of tonight's vote. Even allowing for the hyperboles being thrown by both sides, the US political bottom line is that the authority of the president is at stake, as may be the political future of this incumbent, Bill Clinton. This, in turn, has imponderable international ramifications on issues way beyond free trade.</p>

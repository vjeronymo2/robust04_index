			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-QADISIYAH in Arabic carries  in its 10 March issue on page 3 an approximately 4,000-word  article by Sami Mahdi under the headline "The Middle East Market  Between Solid Facts and Flimsy Justifications" in which the  writer explains why Israel has an interest in establishing a  Middle East market, how the Arabs would lose from such an  economic entity, and why the Egyptian regime promotes it through  its press and officials.    Speaking about Egypt's role, the writer says: "It has become  clear that the Egyptian regime is the one which champions such a  call among the Arabs for opportunistic and selfish reasons" and  because the Egyptian regime "seeks a role for Egypt other than  the natural one it assumes within its Arab environment and  because it wants to take quick steps toward normalization with  the Zionist enemy after it used to be afraid or to hesitate in  taking such steps."    Continuing to speak about Egypt's role in this respect, the  article says: "It would be politically naive to deal with a  historic enemy of the Arab nation which has established its  parasitic entity by usurping its lands, plundering its rights,  and flouting its dignity." The article wonders about the blind  Egyptian confidence in an enemy "which has not given up, as yet,  its designs to swallow more Arab land and targets Arab resources  such as water and oil?"    Explaining why such a market is impossible to establish, the  writer says: "The enmity between the Arabs and the Zionists is  not a transient one, originating from temporary differences  between two countries and which can be settled during  negotiations and later forgotten. It is a historical enmity  between a usurper which not only does not want to give up what  it had usurped but seeks to usurp more, and the victim which is  asked to give up its rights by force under the canopy of unequal  circumtances."    The article says that under the plan for a Middle East  Market, Israel would gain everything such as new markets, the  possibility to exploit oil sources, and many investment  opportunities while "the Arab nation is asked to give up its  unity, sacrifice its cultural identity, forget its usurped  rights, and submit to a fait accompli." The article contnues:  "It would be better for those who champion the establishment of  economic blocs and those who search for benefits to be gleaned  from such blocs to join their voices, if they are sincere, to  those advocating Arab economic unity, or at least to those who  call for an Arab common market that will fulfill the aspired  objectives." The writer further says: "The establishment of an  economic unity, or common market among countries which belong to  the same nation is the most logical, scientific, objective, and  concrete action which is in harmony with historical and  geogrqaphic considerations and with the masses' present and  future aspirations." The writer adds: "As for the Middle East  market, it will be a market of material gains in which the Arab  nation's enemies, the usurpers of its land and those who covet  its resources will have their say and the lion's share."    Concluding, the writer says "The Middle East market is  needed  for specific reasons that serve the Zionist entity alone,  legalize its usurpation, provides it with stability and  security, solve its economic bottlenecks, realize the Zionist  scheme, and enable it to systematically plunder Arab resources."  The article ends by asking "what forces Arabs to give up their  pan-Arab project and rush down the road to a Middle East market?"</p>

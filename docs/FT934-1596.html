			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Competition comes to eastern German energy - The sale of brown coal fields to an Anglo-American consortium The Treuhand privatisation agency could not have hoped for a better Christmas present than it secured last week by formally completing the sale of the Mibrag brown coal fields to an Anglo-American energy consortium led by PowerGen of the UK, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho. By signing the deal the Treuhand, backed by the federal finance ministry, achieved three things: It saved jobs in the Mibrag fields, which straddle the eastern German states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony; It set about introducing competition into eastern Germany's highly regulated energy sector; And, as Mr Klaus Schucht, the Treuhand's board member who is determined to prise open the region's energy industry, said, 'the sale of Mibrag is a signal for the future of the Laubag mines'. Laubag, three times the size of Mibrag, is being privatised by the Treuhand, which is negotiating the sale to a western German consortium led by Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE, the country's largest utility. It also includes the PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk utility companies. The consortium had originally intended to merge Laubag with Mibrag, with the aim of running down the latter. At the same time, the consortium and west Germany's five other main utility companies are the majority shareholders in Veag, eastern Germany's largest electricity company, as well as in the east's 15 regional utilities. This ownership structure stems from the electricity contract, or stromvertrag, signed in August 1990 between the then East German government and West Germany's utilities. On one level, the contract represents the federal government's commitment to brown coal in eastern Germany. On another, it has given the western German utilities a monopoly over eastern Germany's electricity network on the understanding that they will modernise the sector. In return - and in spite of the subsequent misgivings of the European Union concerning this monopoly structure - eastern Germany's regional utilities are obliged to buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag over the next 20 years in order to underwrite investments totalling DM46bn (Pounds 18bn). 'If the Rheinbraun consortium buys Laubag, the west German utilities will enjoy a dual monopoly role in eastern Germany: as a monopoly supplier of brown coal to Veag, which is totally dependent on Laubag's coal, and as a monopoly customer for Veag,' explained an energy expert from the consortium. He added: 'Is the Treuhand really in a position to weaken such a dual monopoly given that it is selling both companies to the same buyers?' In selling the Veag electricity company, the Treuhand has to agree with Rheinbraun on the price Veag will pay for the consortium's brown coal. 'The definitive value of Veag is dependent on the definitive coal price of Laubag. Both are dependent on each other,' said a consortium official. He added that the consortium wanted to set a low price for Laubag's coal so as to boost Veag's earnings, as it would be paying a low price for Laubag's coal deliveries. As a result, however, Laubag would be left with a considerable cost disadvantage in paying its miners. 'This is one of the main issues in the negotiations,' said a consortium official. 'The government - and the Treuhand - wants the income earned from Laubag's brown coal sales to finance the workers. If the consortium thinks the government will finance/subsidise the difference in order to save those jobs, they are mistaken. Veag and Laubag will have to find an acceptable price to pay for coal which will finance the employment of the miners.' Rheinbraun officials admit that the price of coal is the most contentious issues. 'The consortium is being asked by the Treuhand to pay a price for Laubag on the basis of expected income generated from brown coal sales,' said a PreussenElektra official. 'This is difficult because we don't know by how much energy consumption in eastern Germany will increase or decline over the next decade.' Consumption, already down by over 40 per cent since 1990 because of the collapse of the region's industry, may grow by 1 per cent a year after 1994. But energy experts point out that demand for brown coal may decline further as Laubag and Veag face increasing competition from gas. Whatever the outlook, the Treuhand is determined not to privatise eastern Germany's electricity sector until it has found a solution for coal. 'Just because we are dealing with the same two monopolies does not mean we cannot get a good price for coal and electricity,' said a Treuhand energy adviser. 'If the negotiations do not make progress, the Treuhand - as the Anglo-American deal showed - would be free to go seek alternative solutions, and go outside Germany,' he added.</p>

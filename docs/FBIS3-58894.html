The Foreign Office also agreed yesterday  that it knew of the project.    THE INDEPENDENT has learnt that a group of British and  Turkish businessmen are negotiating with the Azeri authorities  for the supply of arms and a large number of mercenaries, mainly  from Britain. The Foreign Office confirmed that there is a  British arms embargo against Azerbaijan, which is fighting a  vicious war with the neighbouring former Soviet republic of  Armenia over disputed territories. It is illegal for a Briton  to be a mercenary soldier.    Lord Erskine of Rerrick confirmed last week that  negotiations  had taken place between the Azeri authorities and a consortium  for which he is acting as a consultant. The existence of the  negotiations has been confirmed by a senior Turkish politician  and by a British arms trader, who has extensive experience of  dealing with the Caucasus region.    Lord Erskine said a British registered company, Summit  (Consortium) Limited, is arranging the deal. The company, he  said, was involved in trade with Azerbaijan and with negotiating  the provision of military support. Lord Erskine said his role  was to provide introductions as a consultant to senior Azeri  government ministers.    Two men identified as directors are based in Turkish Cyprus,  where it is not illegal to trade in arms to Azerbaijan. Lord  Erskine named one of them, Mustafa Mutlu, as the man helping to  coordinate the negotiations with Azerbaijan. He could not be  traced last week.    Most of the negotiations are being conducted by a British  businessman whom Lord Erskine declined to identify. In the past  three months this man has made three trips to Azerbaijan to talk  to the local authorities.    Lord Erskine said he is to be paid a consultancy fee for his  work for Summit and that the deal runs into millions of pounds.  Other sources -- one of whom is a Turk close to the Azeri  authorities -- said that they were aware of the negotiations,  and that the proposal is for the provision of soldiers and arms.  The Azeris are said to be prepared to pay an annual fee of as  much as 150 million pounds.    It is understood that the negotiations are still not  complete, but privately chartered Russian aircraft have been put  on standby to fly mercenaries into the area. The first phase of  the scheme is to provide British military trainers.    The Azeris would pay the bills mainly in the form of oil. An  American oil company is reported to have provided training for  Azeri soldiers by former members of the U.S. armed forces in  breach of American embargoes. The U.S. State Department is  investigating the allegations, which were made by foreign  diplomats based in Baku, the Azeri capital.    Lord Erskine was named last year by Michael Mates, when  Northern Ireland minister responsible for security affairs, as a  "member of the security services." The Government has denied  that Lord Erskine has ever been a member of the security  services but he said last week that he provided information, for  which he was unpaid, to the Foreign Office. He told them last  year, he said, of the plans to supply men and weapons to  Azerbaijan during a meeting with a senior official at the  Foreign Office.    Lord Erskine, 68, lives in Turkish northern Cyprus but is to  return to the UK within a month.    His Foreign Office contact, whose identity is known to THE  INDEPENDENT, is listed in the Diplomatic List as a first  secretary. He confirmed last week that he spoke to Lord Erskine  "at least once a year" and had been told of the plan to supply  mercenaries to the Caucasus. He denied that he had been told  that British companies were involved.</p>

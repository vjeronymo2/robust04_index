			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MARKET REFORM WILL BE PUT TO VOTERS  </P> <P> The Soviet government, seeking a popular mandate to transform the country's  socialist economy into one based on market forces, announced plans Wednesday  for an unprecedented national referendum on sweeping reforms that it  acknowledges will double or triple many consumer prices and could put tens of  millions of people out of work.  </P> <P> Yuri D. Maslyukov, the first deputy prime minister, said that the government  feels it cannot proceed with such major changes in the economic system without  firm national support because of the fierce criticism the leaders have already  encountered for breaking with socialism and for the harsh impact on most Soviet  workers.  </P> <P> "A transition as steep as this one is impossible without a national accord,"  Maslyukov told a press conference, arguing that the government sees no way  other than a market economy to bring the country out of its deepening crisis.  "If the government's plan is not accepted, then the government should resign."  </P> <P> Voter approval of the program is far from certain, and the referendum, the  first in Soviet history, is probably the boldest political gamble that  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has taken in his five years as the country's  leader. Some of Gorbachev's most fundamental reforms of the Soviet system will  be at stake in the vote, and if the proposal is defeated, his authority will be  badly impaired.  </P> <P> Yet, so controversial has the program become that Gorbachev, who has never  faced the nation's electorate, clearly wants the mandate to proceed with the  reforms despite opposition from Communist Party conservatives and the  misgivings of ordinary workers.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, speaking to members of the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia,  described the reform program as "a major turn . . . equal to the October  Revolution" which brought the Bolsheviks to power in 1917.  </P> <P> If the present government fails to win a clear mandate, Maslyukov speculated  that, as in Poland last year, there could be "the convocation of a round-table  conference of various political forces," including the emerging opposition  parties, to work out a strategy that could command popular support.  </P> <P> Radical reformers have been pressing for such talks to discuss not only present  policies but new structures for making political and economic decisions.  </P> <P> But Gennady Yanayev, the chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions,  expressed strong doubts about how effective a referendum on a transition to a  market economy would be.  </P> <P> "People discuss the market without even knowing what it is," Yanayev said. "We  know more about space research than we do about market research. A lot of  explanation is needed."  </P> <P> Leonid I. Abalkin, the vice prime minister in charge of economic reform,  contended that without a national consensus, as demonstrated by a victory in  the planned referendum, the reforms could not proceed, the economic crisis  would worsen and perestroika, Gorbachev's overall reform program, would fail.  </P> <P> "We should not wait for a social explosion -- we should ensure that no  explosion takes place . . ., " Abalkin said at the government's press  conference. "If we had done this two or three years ago, it would have been far  simpler. If we wait longer, we will have to pay a greater price. . . . Either  we take this difficult choice or we load it onto the shoulders of our  children."  </P> <P> Nikolai Y. Petrakov, Gorbachev's top economic adviser, told a Soviet-American  trade conference Wednesday that he thinks it is a blunder to defer the start of  the plan, including the major price increases, for seven months until Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Petrakov said that announcing price increases so far in advance could cause  consumers to buy everything now and prompt businesses to hold back as much as  possible.  </P> <P> "This will create a panic, an economic panic," he said. "I think that we should  not lose these seven months."  </P> <P> The government plans, in fact, to raise some food prices July 1, starting with  a threefold increase in bread prices, and to undertake many of the other  changes, some of them by decree, before the referendum.  </P> <P> "We can't wait," Maslyukov explained, noting that much time had already been  lost in debating the reforms.  </P> <P> Although no date has been set for the referendum and there is no existing law  on holding a national referendum, it could come soon after the Communist Party  congress in July or in early autumn after the vacation season. New laws will  also be needed to put the economic reform program into effect, and the Supreme  Soviet, the national legislature, is scheduled to reconvene in September to  enact the measures.  </P> <P> The government's program, approved Tuesday by the Presidential Council, the  country's top policy-making body, is to be outlined in full today by Prime  Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov as virtually the last chance to save the failing  economy short of truly drastic measures.  </P> <P> At its core, the program calls for the transformation of the centrally planned  Soviet economy, based on state ownership, to a "regulated market economy"  governed by supply and demand, increasingly but not totally privatized, more  and more managed by entrepreneurs but overseen and regulated by the government.  </P> <P> Among the elements outlined by Maslyukov were the dismemberment of the Soviet  Union's vast infrastructure of industrial ministries, an immediate end to the  monopolies enjoyed by many Soviet enterprises, freeing of the State Bank from  governmental control and step-by-step measures to make Soviet currency, the  ruble, convertible.  </P> <P> Central planning would no longer focus on production quotas, Maslyukov said,  but become mostly indirect and indicate general goals in the way that West  Germany does in its planning.  </P> <P> The first two years of the reforms, 1991 and 1992, will be the most difficult,  he continued, with living standards likely to drop 5% to 6% a year because of  the higher prices and likely increase in unemployment.  </P> <P> The program envisions price increases of varying amounts throughout the Soviet  economy -- energy prices would rise an average of 82%, food prices about 200%,  consumer goods 43% -- in order to cover actual production costs and to reduce  or eliminate the extensive subsidies. Many of the prices have remained  unchanged for decades -- food, for example, since 1954.  </P> <P> The plan calls for increased pay to compensate for the higher food prices, but  it is still uncertain whether the compensation will be full or partial and  whether it will come with the increases or lag behind. Eventually wages are  expected to rise in accord with a consumer price index.  </P> <P> The program also calls for the sale of some state enterprises to individuals  and cooperatives, the leasing of other enterprises to their managers or workers  to run on a profit-or-loss basis and the sale of shares in 220,000 industrial  enterprises, about 70% of the country's total, as the first step toward  privatizing them. An equities market would be set up to handle the buying and  selling of shares.  </P> <P> Massive unemployment could result from the changes, Soviet officials  acknowledge, as unprofitable firms are closed -- about 30% of Soviet  enterprises lose money and a similar number are marginal -- and unneeded  workers are laid off at firms that are privatized.  </P> <P> As many as 40 million people, about a quarter of the Soviet labor force, might  have to find new jobs, Abalkin said, as the economy is restructured. Actual  unemployment, which now is estimated at 2 million, could increase to 6 million  or 8 million.  </P> <P> Yanayev said that trade unions had demanded, as a condition for their support  of the reforms, a government pledge to honor the constitutional guarantee of  work for all by offering a job to anyone able and willing to work. They have  also insisted on full compensation for any increase in the prices of food and  consumer goods, he said, and salaries will be adjusted for the initial  increases and then linked to a consumer price index.  </P> <P> The program calls for the creation of a social security system to protect the  low-paid, including pensioners, single-parent families, teachers, physicians  and government employees.  </P></p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (14): Shorter courses, more graduates - Education, a shake-up is under way INDUSTRIALISTS HAVE complained for years about the inadequate supply of graduates in science and technology provided by the Italian system. But only very recently has the idea that education really matters filtered through to politicians. The idea that productivity depends on the quality of the human effort behind it was being promoted in 1987 by Professor Romano Prodi, then president of IRI. Together with Mr Giancarlo Lombardi, the Confindustria counsellor for schools, he initiated Project 'Iter' to encourage schools to aim not just for mass education but 'mass quality'  - raising everyone'sights and improving the general level of culture. The experiment involved a mix of traditional grammar school teaching (licei classici e scientifici) and that provided by technical colleges, trying to break down the conventional barrier between the humanities and science. It took place in the Medici del Vascello school in Rome, and proved enormously successful, despite a deeply suspicious attitude on the teachers' part in the early stages. At a conference in March this year to evaluate this and other experimental syllabuses in schools in the north, the experiment appears to have given the teachers more of a shake-up than any retraining could have done; the students are more alert, interested and self-aware, and the close relationship with industry has been fruitful. 'Now all we need is a political decision, that of giving more autonomy to individual schools,' he says. But as Mr Giancarlo Lombardi points out in the joint report, School and Industry (written with representatives from the Ministry of Education and the university), the schools cannot do it alone: the close relationship with industry must be maintained. The outgoing government contained two ministries responsible for education, a larger one for schools, and a smaller, more stream-lined one dealing with research and the universities. The school system is almost entirely state-run, with the exception of religious schools (mainly Jesuit and Salesian) and a handful of private institutions. It works surprisingly well in extremely scruffy conditions - entirely due to the dedication of a hard core of skilled and devoted teachers. This is particularly true of the upper schools, licei, which are next in line for a much-needed modernisation of the syllabus. The minister's main headache is how to resolve the huge surplus of highly unionised teachers. There are 950,000 teachers for approximately 10m students - one of the lowest student-to-teacher ratios in Europe. The ministry can do little about improving school buildings as 98 per cent of its annual L45,000bn budget goes on salaries. But the proportion of all children who actually go to school in Italy is only 79.2 per cent (only Portugal and Luxembourg do worse than this in the EC). Things are worse in the poorer south, where the back-up from social services is non-existent. In Sicily, 50 per cent either avoid school altogether, or by age 10 or 11 have been seduced by the more exciting and remunerative life offered by petty crime. The official school-leaving age is still an astonishingly low 14. It is expected that a law raising it to 16 will be passed this year, bringing Italy into line with the rest of Europe. This was something first mooted by Mr Riccardo Misasi, the outgoing education minister, when he held the same post 21 years ago. Another matter of major concern continues to be the tiny percentage of GDP devoted to research and development. Italy spends only 1.45 per cent of its income on research (the European average is 2.5 per cent), thus putting itself No 17 among industrialised nations. Last month, Prof Antonio Ruberti, then minister for research and the universities, sounded the alarm in the first-ever ministerial report on the state of research in Italy. He announced a three-year plan, providing for the government to increase annual investment from the present L15,000bn to L18,400bn - essential merely to maintain the present Italian supremacy in certain sectors (such as particle physics). He reckons, however that it will take 10 years for Italy to gain the position it deserves in research and industrial technology. The relatively low number of patents registered each year is also cause for concern. Big changes are also due in the universities from November, with the introduction of a series of mini-degrees (courses lasting two or three years). Ten or so will start this year, some in existing university centres and some in new sites, in subjects ranging from law, economics and civil engineering to natural sciences and literature. This is not before time, according to Mr Antonio Polimene of Ifap/IRI, the outfit which provides management training for recruits to the state holding, as the shortage of science graduates is acute, and they are forced to take graduates from the Third World. He points out, though, that it will be the university which decides the contents of the new shorter degree courses, and there is still some reluctance to take advice from industry. He also complains that the universities tend not to take account of the numbers of graduates required in each discipline; nor is there any career advice given to students when starting their courses. Prof Ruberti announced last year that he would do something about the congestion in Italy's state universities. The country's only private universities are business-oriented: the Boccone in Milan (economics), and the Luiss in Rome, which offers economics, law and political sciences. The universities in Milan, Naples and Rome have nearly four times as many students as they should, while the provincial universities function efficiently and peacefully. Rome University has 180,000 students, only 30 per cent of whom actually get a degree. The university is free (apart from yearly taxes equivalent to Pounds 400) - a school diploma (the equivalent of 'A' level) is all that is required. In spite of severe overcrowding and the extremely shabby state of many of the buildings, Prof Giorgio Tecce, recently elected for a second four-year period as Rector of Rome University, is still against placing any limit on enrolment. 'Every country has its own students,' he says, 'ours are particularly lively, vociferous and belligerent.' They have to be; anyone fighting his way through one of the more popular faculties has to be very good indeed. He also fears that selection boards would be subjected to intolerable pressures in a country not noted for fair selection procedures. The flood of new graduates in medicine meant they had to limit the numbers enrolling there two years ago, but that should be an exception, he feels. Students do get weeded out by natural selection, many not being able to take the strain of working their way through the university (there are no scholarships) and many joining the large band of students who are fuori corso - who instead of taking their 16 or so exams within the prescribed four years, are allowed to take as much as 20 years to cover the same course; providing they do not allow more than seven years to pass without taking an exam. Prof Tecce does, however, agree with Umberto Eco, the writer and university professor at Bologna, that a strict selection procedure should take place at the end of the second year. Students would thus be forced to keep within the correct exam time-table for the first two years; those who did not would have to leave. This would allow even those who have not shone at school to blossom later. There should also, he feels, be generous and plentiful scholarships for deserving cases - and taxes should be doubled. Each successful student costs the state L100m, and the numbers holding degrees are well below the EC average. Out of 1,000 youngsters aged between 22 and 24 years, only 72 in Italy have degrees, compared with 158 in France and 148 in the UK. Prof Tecce agrees with Prof Eco's strictures, claiming also that there is a need to free the university from political interference in the choice of candidates for university chairs. He is proud of his record in bowing to no-one. The venerable University of Bologna (Italy's oldest) has, he said, 'sold its soul' in handing out laurea honoris causae to politicians and industrialists. 'We have only ever awarded one, and that was to Andrei Sakharov, the dissident Russian scientist.'</p>

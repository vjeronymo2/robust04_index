			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / As They Say in Europe: When in Rome, do as the Muscovites Russia and Italy can get muddled up. Doesn't Berlusconi remind you just a bit of Yeltsin? 'If irreconcilable positions of the two sides prevail and the legislature does not find a common language with the government on the 1995 budget, such a situation may well again raise the question of a no-confidence vote in the government.' Not La Stampa, but a comment in the Moscow paper, Rossiiskie Vesti. It is, perhaps, the result of reporting on a society where tumult rules and change often seems revolutionary. It also provides journalistic novelties. Nezavisimaya Gazeta, one of the better Moscow dailies, ran a page of photos, without comment, entitled 'Russian woman in an era of reform'. Beggars, harlots, business-women and the super-rich - the pictures all authentically Muscovite. Today, Russia comes alive in the press - it never did in the old days. New newspapers spring up; some, like Sevodnya, are very good. It's not only the news that is exciting. There are tempting advertisements for share offers of the kind killjoy governments have eliminated in richer lands. 'Tomorrow will be better', one is headed. The Russian Food Bank is offering Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.2m) in shares 'of the highest category of reliability'. These will provide the investor with a 'stable foreign exchange income'. The whole is illustrated with a nice picture of the Kremlin: one is transported back to those days when investing was fun, unencumbered by dreary regulations, and able to proclaim guaranteed high incomes from totally safe projects. The freewheeling financial services sector overlaps with another sign of the times. 'Crime has spread to just about all the branches of the national economy and the budget. It accompanies all the directions of economic reform,' said an interior ministry official, Viktor Salganov, in the daily, Trud. Salganov is head of a department that struggles against economic crime. He concludes by arguing, presumably in the face of a sceptical readership: 'The crime wave can be stopped only with the help of the law.' It is curious that his remark was made as the UN conference on organised international crime in Naples got under way nearly two weeks ago. It was there that the Russian interior minister, Viktor Yerin, said a 'cold war' style scare over the Russian mafia was being whipped up to isolate the country and harm its economy. But that cuts little ice back home. How can it, when one reads among the trivia of everyday life of the discovery of 'a secret arms dump' in Moscow? The papers reported how a railway bridge in Moscow was blown up a few days ago. An anonymous caller told the police of a 'mobile ammunition dump'. The caller said: 'You will find it in Spartak Street, near the fence with a sign that reads 'Alice Trailers'. A Zil-131 truck is there and the key is under the left wheel.' A random, pointless tale of daily life in Moscow. When Russian newspapers are not dealing with the harsh realities of everyday existence, everything changes. They have always been good on what might be called culture. Artistic life is important because the present period of gigantic change has made reclaiming the nation's heritage one of the most explosive issues in an already highly charged society. If it is captured by the nationalist right we could all be in trouble. There is a battle going on for control of the country's media, particularly television. Parliament wants less government control, and the allocation of subsidies to be made the responsibility of a non-government body. President Yeltsin disagrees and wants to increase his influence over television by merging the two main channels. With news like this it is not surprising that Italy comes to mind. For sure, the Russian and the Italian crises are more than a little different but you would not know it if your knowledge came only from the newspapers of the countries concerned. Compare Berlusconi with Yeltsin; the impasse over the budget and who should control the broadcast media; the ubiquity of organised crime and the vibrancy of the nation's culture. But Italy is rich (for the time being at least) and Russia is more than poor. It is mired in poverty and struggling with unimaginable problems as whole sectors of the economy, and indeed of the country, seem to face terminal collapse. New countries have suddenly raised themselves to levels of wealth and development that leave Russia far behind. But nobody could spend more than five minutes reading the newspapers of most of those dynamic lands. The concept of the all-conquering emerging market is one before which the whole developed world routinely genuflects today. But one forgets how desperately boring those places can be. Highly developed poverty may not be worth aiming for, but it makes one think. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

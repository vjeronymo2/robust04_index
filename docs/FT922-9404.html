			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics plans sale of missiles operation GENERAL Dynamics, the second largest Pentagon contractor, aims to sell off businesses which contribute about one-quarter of its revenues - including its large missiles operation - in a radical plan to cope with the shrinking defence market. It is in the final phase of negotiating the sale of the missiles business, and could announce a deal soon, Mr William Anders, the chairman, said yesterday. Mr Anders, who has been sharply reducing the size of the company since he took over as chairman in 1991, told the annual meeting General Dynamics would adapt to the 'new realities' of the defence market by concentrating on four core areas: tactical aircraft, nuclear submarines, armoured vehicles and space launch systems. It recently sold its Cessna business aircraft subsidiary to Textron, and has adopted a 'plan of contraction' which involves selling other non-core businesses accounting for some Dollars 2.3bn of the group's Dollars 8.7bn of annual revenues. The list is headed by the missiles operation, which had sales last year of Dollars 1.3bn and consists of two parts: an air defence systems division, which makes tactical products such as the Stinger and Standard missiles; and a section of the group's Convair subsidiary, which makes the Tomahawk sea-launched cruise missiles used during the Gulf war. Mr Anders said the missiles business had been seriously considered as a potential core business. However, it could not become the leader in a field which included nearly a dozen firms in the US alone. During talks with numerous other companies, 'we found more interest in the purchase of our operations than the sale of their own'. Other parts of the group up for sale include the remainder of Convair, which makes fuselages for the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 commercial aircraft; the electronics division, which is a leading producer of avionics test equipment; and a materials division which produces aggregates, concrete, lime and coal. Mr Anders' strategy is radically different from that of most defence contractors, which have reacted to the shrinking Pentagon budget by trying to diversify into non-defence areas. He said yesterday the benefits of diversification were 'largely illusory'. The restructuring of the group has helped increase the company's cash and marketable securities to Dollars 1.2bn at the end of March. Mr Anders said the company was generating cash 'well in excess' of that needed to meet investment and debt reduction needs. He continued to favour some distribution to shareholders. The company's shares closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 64 7/8 .</p>

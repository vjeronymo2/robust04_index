			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (2): The Liberals' good fortune - Bernard Simon considers the government's economic policies The Chretien government has tried to steer a middle course in its economic policies, balancing financial markets' demand for fiscal and monetary discipline with the Liberals' campaign pledge to create jobs. The result is that while the new government has not made any serious mistakes during its first half-year in office, it cannot yet boast of any dramatic achievements. However, the Liberals have had the good fortune to take office at the best possible time. They have escaped blame for the pain of high interest rates and the initial shock of the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement, which helped drive the Canadian economy into a deep recession from 1990 to 1992. Now the benefits of these policies have started to become apparent. Interest rates fell to their lowest levels in three decades before the US Federal Reserve started tightening monetary policy last February. The banks' prime lending rate had tumbled to 5.5 per cent from a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990, and the gap between US and Canadian interest rates was at its narrowest since the late 1970s. Inflation is virtually non-existent. Thanks partly to a cut in cigarette taxes earlier this year, the consumer price index crept up by only 0.2 per cent in the year to April. Recession and free trade have also sharpened the competitive edge of many Canadian companies. Workers now consider themselves lucky to get a 2-3 per cent pay increase and productivity has improved markedly in recent years. But the price has been stubbornly high unem- ployment, which stood at 11 per cent in April. The upturn has so far centred on the export sector which has been helped by strong demand from the US and the slide in the Canadian dollar (from a peak of 89 US cents in late 1991 to 73 US cents in late May). These gains are gradually filtering through to the rest of the economy. With luck, they will be reinforced by a further rise in prices for such key exports as pulp and paper, metals, wheat and natural gas. ScotiaMcLeod, the securities firm, forecasts that real GDP growth will accelerate to 3.4 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 1995, from 2.6 per cent in 1993. However, the outlook varies markedly across the country. British Columbia, which has already benefited from record lumber prices, is expected to be pushed further ahead by a recovery in other forest product and metal markets, and by a continuing influx of immigrants from south-east Asia and other Canadian provinces. At the other end of the country (and the growth spectrum), Newfoundland's economy has been devastated by the virtual disappearance of North Atlantic cod stocks. Some 20,000 jobs have been lost in the east coast fishery, putting one in five Newfoundlanders out of work. Despite the forces working in their favour, the Liberals have not had an entirely smooth ride. In particular, financial markets have been unsettled by uncertainty over Quebec's future and the new government's priorities. The Liberals initially sent a number of signals that their economic policies would be kinder and gentler than the Tories, with job creation as important a short-term goal as low inflation or deficit reduction. The message was reinforced by the replacement of Mr John Crow as governor of the Bank of Canada by his deputy, Mr Gordon Thiessen. Mr Crow carved out a reputation as one of the industrial world's most ardent inflation fighters during his seven years in office. One of Mr Thiessen's first acts was to spell out slightly more flexible inflation targets than those set by his predecessor. The present aim is to hold inflation in a 1-3 per cent a year range until at least 1998. The new finance minister and central bank governor threw financial markets off balance again with a hesitant response to the US Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy last February. Not only did the Canadian dollar slide by three US cents between February and April, but interest rates ended up rising far more steeply than in the US. The banks' prime lending rate jumped back to 6.75 per cent by the end of April. The consensus, however, is that interest rates are likely to stay flat or decline a little in coming months, and that the economic recovery will remain on track. On fiscal policy, the Liberals pledged during the election campaign to bring the federal deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP within three years, from a projected 5.4 per cent in the fiscal year to March 31 1995. The previous Conservative government badly underestimated the impact of the recession on government revenues. Within two months of taking office, Mr Paul Martin, the finance minister, revised the 1993-94 budget estimate upwards from the Tories' rosy projection of CDollars 32.7bn to a record CDollars 45bn. Mr Martin's first budget, tabled last February, aims to cut the deficit to CDollars 39.7bn in 1994-95 and CDollars 32.7bn the following year. He announced the closure of a string of politically sensitive military installations and renewed a freeze on civil servants' wages. The biggest contribution to deficit reduction could come from a planned overhaul of the once-sacrosanct social security net. These programmes, some of which are administered by the provinces with financial support from Ottawa, are by far the biggest single spending item in the federal budget. The Liberals aim to spell out their reform proposals in next year's budget. Financial markets have yet to be convinced, however, of the new government's steadfastness. Analysts are encouraged that Mr Martin's economic assumptions are more realistic than those of his Conservative predecessors. But they worry that much of the drop in this year's deficit will be thanks to measures announced by the previous government or accounting changes, rather than brave new Liberal spending cuts. The minister is sticking to his guns. 'There is no doubt that we are not going to be able to solve our deficit problems by growth alone,' Mr Martin said in late April. 'And what that means is a complete restructuring of government. It is going to mean major, major cuts which will affect every segment of our society.' Despite the recent increase in borrowing costs, he remains confident of meeting his deficit targets. Mr Martin has also pledged that his 1996 budget will spell out a game plan to eliminate the deficit entirely. International investors however, are likely to judge him by actions rather than words.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            Economic forecasts              (percentage change unless otherwise indicated)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            Annual averages    4th-to-4th quarters                          1993   1994   1995    1993   1994   1995  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP                  2.4    3.5    4.3     3.0    3.9    4.3 Unemployment rate (%)    11.2   10.9   10.2    11.1   10.7   10.0 Consumer price index      1.8    0.9    1.8     1.8    0.9    1.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Royal Bank economics department, spring 1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

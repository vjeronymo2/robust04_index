			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (2): Pitfalls for foreign investors - Ian Hamilton Fazey on problems, and the agencies that solve them Some parts of the British government have made it as easy as they can for foreign companies to move into the UK - even to the extent of being ready to argue with those parts of the government which sometimes make it difficult. The clash is of cultures: the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Employment want inward investment to improve the overseas trade balance, to create jobs and broaden Britain's economic and, particularly, manufacturing base. The Home Office, on the other hand, is rightly charged with enforcing tight immigration controls to prevent foreigners from taking jobs that could be done by European nationals. Difficulties can therefore arise when an inward investor from, say, the US or south-east Asia wants to bring in more key workers than immigration officials think may be strictly necessary. About 18 months ago, growing tensions forced all parties to agree procedures to try to smooth problems. The rules, however, are unpublished because each case is judged on its merits. However, they are pragmatic and decisions are at least now made quickly, where previously people and companies were sometimes kept waiting for months, much to the frustration of inward investment agencies and promoters. Basically, criteria for the start-up phase of an inward investment - when a high proportion of the workforce may need to be brought in from abroad to get the operation going and train their locally-recruited successors - are relaxed. Short-term training or liaison posts also get sympathetic treatment, even if there is long-term rotation of foreign personnel in them. However, the proportion of jobs to be held eventually by foreign nationals on a permanent basis is likely to involve more negotiation, just as it would be, say, for European companies operating in the US. The rest of the process of inward investment is straightforward - and designed to make it as easy as possible for medium-sized or smaller companies which do not have the in-house expertise, or ready access to consultancy services, of bigger companies. The Foreign Office and Department of Trade and Industry operate a global network of commercial staff attached to British embassies or, in the US or Japan, in specially set-up trade advice offices. Some bodies, such as the Welsh Development Agency or some of the English regional development bodies, also have promotional offices of their own in prime target markets such as North America and south-east Asia. In addition, they - and the economic development units of individual counties, cities and towns - often take stands at big fairs and exhibitions. However, any company wanting to know where to begin a systematic review of UK inward investment options is best advised to start with the commercial section of the British embassy, especially if language is a problem. This will usually trigger a follow-up visit by a UK consular officer familiar with the processes and options. He or she will prepare a brief for the Invest in Britain Bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry. From there, the inquiry will be fed into the UK's internal network of regional agencies, development corporations and local authority economic development officers. Britain has attracted a lot of inward investment in the last 10 years and those involved have become good at providing the right sort of advice. They are also salespeople, so all claims should be treated with due caution. But because there is also competition between the agencies, astute inward investors can exploit this to their advantage. Regional agencies, such as Inward, the Northern Development Company in north-east England and Cumbria, and the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association will gracefully give best to each other in the end, but only after fighting fiercely to win an inward investment project for their own region. Each English region has such an agency, partly funded by the Invest in Britain Bureau and partly by local authorities and private sector supporters. This spread of support means there will also often be competition within a region, with local authorities or training and enterprise councils throwing in discretionary grants, rental holidays or help with training. In some areas with declining industries such as coal or steelmaking, or with endemic problems of economic structure, such as Merseyside, there is government or EU assistance. Grants will vary according to the numbers of jobs created, but the inward investor can again exploit competition between areas in Britain, and, indeed, elsewhere in the EU. In the UK, every area outside the south-east can rightly offer good quality of life, access to good infrastructure, and - in most cases - a pool of adaptable labour. All have glossy brochures to sell their wares, some of them more objective than others, but all of them reasonably fair in what they claim. The warmth of welcome may also make a difference. Three years ago, Crewe Business Park won Sokkia International - a surveying instrument business - because the mayor entertained the Japanese company's executives handsomely, while a rival local authority in Greater Manchester offered a barely hospitable reception. Agencies such as Inward, the NDC or YHDA will arrange a programme of visits to view sites and meet key people. They will also provide critical data, such as the availability of suitable or adaptable labour, or the ease of access to a network of component suppliers, or transport links with the rest of the UK or with the European mainland. Inward, in north-west England, was the most successful of the regional agencies in 1993-94, setting a record for the fourth successive year, despite a drop in general levels of inquiries worldwide because of recession. Nearly 3,000 jobs were created by 36 inward investment projects that brought in Pounds 107m of new capital. This included the MBNA America Bank, which opted for Chester rather than Harrogate in North Yorkshire. This credit card marketing operation will eventually create 800 jobs over five years. A third of the projects were expansions by some of 1,200 foreign companies already in the region. All the regional agencies operate 'aftercare' services for inward investors, which are an increasingly important component of inward investment. There is also an array of private sector help available at normal professional prices. These are usually cheaper - though just as good - in regional financial centres such as Birmingham, Manchester or Leeds because of lower overheads outside London. Since property and tax advice - both individual and corporate - are principal areas where professional help is imperative, many firms of estate agents and lawyers have full-time specialists in the field. Small or medium-sized companies may often do better with a comparably-sized professional firm, rather than the more obvious giants. Campbell Hooper, a London firm with only 70 staff, has published many articles and booklets on the subject - the sort of clue to look for. Phoning a few firms in the nearest financial centre and asking for their promotional literature is a good start to finding suitable advisers. Many inward investors also have their own networks and associations of expatriates. They are also a source for recommending experienced professionals and explaining the pitfalls of relocating to the UK. Relocation has been done hundreds of times already in the last decade alone: it makes sense to learn from others' experiences.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Senior Lieutenant General Tran Van Quang in </F> Paris on 29 October 1993 by N.S.]    [Excerpt] At the end of October 1993, Senior Lt. Gen. Tran  Van Quang headed a delegation of the Vietnam Veterans  Association that had come to Paris to attend the congress of the  French ARAC Veterans Association. On the afternoon of 29  October, Senior Lt. Gen. Tran Van Quang visited the Association  of Vietnamese in France and met with more than 50 Vietnamese  veterans of the Second World War at the association's  headquarters at 16 Petit Musc, Quarter 4, Paris. On this  occasion, Senior Lt. Gen. graciously granted an interview to  DOAN KET. [passage omitted]    [DOAN KET] In the past period, every time the head of the  American administration has reviewed the embargo against  Vietnam, "secret files" on "American MIAs" have always came to  light. Some people have even said that you were the author of  one of those "files."    [Quang] As you know, in recent years, each time the American  government has raised the issue of ending the embargo against  Vietnam, damaging stories about American MIAs have appeared. The  so-called "secret files" are part of this. In 1992, people  published a photograph and claimed that the picture showed an  American still alive in Vietnam. They also claimed that the  Vietnamese government had sent a number of prisoners of war to  the former Soviet Union. In fact, American officials have  admitted that those stories are all fabrications. As for the  "secret file" supposedly written by me, after meeting with me  and investigating the matter thoroughly, General Vessey, the  special envoy of the American president, and Senator J. Kerry  admitted that "the materials are not believable." The reason is  that the data are inaccurate. The number of prisoners of war  mentioned in the materials are even greater than the number  disclosed by the American government. What is interesting is  that people have said that I reported those data to the  Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party in September 1972.  But at that time, I was in command on the Tri Thien-Hue front.    What is the reason for these fabrications? It's because a  number of Americans remain stubborn and want to poison  Vietnamese-American relations. But as people know, continuing  the embargo against Vietnam is immoral and contrary to the trend  toward cooperation and friendship between nations, and this is  making it difficult for us to rebuild our country. And in  addition, this is harming American businessmen. I think that  with an independent foreign line that desires to be friends with  all countries that are striving for peace and stability and the  development of our country and with the struggle of the  wholesome forces in the world, including those in the United  States, the effectiveness of the American embargo will gradually  decline.    [DOAN KET] Vietnamese in France in general and readers of  DOAN KET in particular would like to know more about the Vietnam  Veterans Association, of which you are the president. In  particular, people would like to know more about the spirit and  contents of the association's activities.    [Quang] The Vietnam Veterans Association is a mass  organization whose task is to foster solidarity among all  discharged cadres and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army and  guerrillas who fought in the wars to liberate and defend the  fatherland. We want to help each other to maintain a spirit of  patriotism and the tradition of "Uncle Ho troops," help each  other became a part of ordinary life, and look after the  material and spiritual lives of each other. Other tasks of the  association are to contribute to maintaining political security  and defending the fatherland, disseminate experiences to the  young generation, participate in the socioeconomic programs, and  contribute to foreign affairs activities, particularly with  veterans in other countries. With a tradition of patriotism and  love for socialism, the Vietnam Veterans Association is doing  its utmost to hit the above targets, and initial results have  been achieved. Thus, the party and state and the people have  confidence in the association, and they have given us  encouragement and help.    [DOAN KET] What are your views on those Vietnamese who  fought  in the Saigon army and who are now living abroad?    [Quang] As for Vietnamese who found in the Saigon army, we  feel that except for a small number who are still reactionaries,  the great majority of these people, both officers and enlisted  men, are patriotic people. Today, our country is independent,  democratic, free, and united. National construction and national  valor are stimulating all people to abandon the old hatreds and  look to the future. We believe that those people will gradually  awaken. With the great solidarity policy of the state, many of  those who once worked for the Saigon regime are now making an  effort to become integrated into the life of the people. They  are seeking profits and and happiness in the movement to restore  the country, and they are proud of the very important  achievements scored by the fatherland. As for our veterans, we  hope that those people will forget the past, look to the future,  and quickly become integrated in the free and independent life  of the country. Our forefathers said that "one drop of blood is  more precious than a pond of water." The peoples of the world  and many governments in the world are encouraging and supporting  our renovation movement and so how can those people, who are  Vietnamese, stand outside this tide?    On this occasion, on behalf of all Vietnamese veterans,  through DOAN KET I would like to wish all Vietnamese now living  in France happiness and good health. We hope that they will  return to their beloved fatherland and contribute to building  the country so that it can catch up with the other civilized  countries in the world and have a brilliant future.</p>

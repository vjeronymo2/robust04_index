			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China appears to be taking a more "relaxed"  approach to Hong Kong's proposed political reforms but is still  refusing to enter into meaningful dialogue on its own human  rights record, Australian Foreign Minister Senator Gareth Evans  said after talks with Chinese leaders yesterday. Unlike  previous meetings, Premier Li Peng did not attack Governor Chris  Patten's proposals for political reform but instead emphasised  the need to maintain Hong Kong's capitalist economy after 1997.    Mr Li added Beijing was not against political change in Hong  Kong as long as it was consistent with the Basic Law and the  Joint Declaration. "The attitude does seem very much more  relaxed than it was until comparatively recently," Mr Evans  said. "The (Hong Kong) issue was treated in a much lower key way  than has been the case in the past." Mr Evans said China's more  relaxed attitude probably reflected a desire, following last  year's disputes, to get on with business as usual and let events  take their natural course.    On human rights, however, China showed no sign of backing  down from its hard line of recent months. Mr Evans raised  several specific concerns, including the detention on Friday of  dissident Wei Jingsheng, the reported sentencing of Ming Pao  journalist Xi Yang and the detention in Shenzhen of Australian  businessman James Peng. But he got no response.    Both Mr Li and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen were  unaware of the specific cases and suggested they were not an  appropriate subject of discussion for visiting government  officials. "The premier's reaction was not forthcoming on the  subject of Wei Jingsheng. It is not a subject Chinese  government authorities care to talk about (not in very polite  terms anyway)," Mr Evans said. "The view was that it was a  matter better left un-raised by me or anyone else, and that it  was an internal affair of China."    Mr Evans received an equally blunt response to his request  for China to send a human rights delegation to Australia to  maintain a human rights dialogue between the two countries. He  was told the "conditions" for such a visit were"not appropriate"  following the establishment of the Tibet Information Office (the  Dalai Lama's unofficial embassy) in Australia, and recent  statements on China's human rights record by Australian  officials at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in  Geneva.    Despite the rebuff, Mr Evans vowed to continue raising the  issue of human rights with China, stating human rights were  "everybody's business" and that China could not avoid  international dialogue on the issue. He stressed, however,  Australia would not engage in "grandstanding or drum beating" on  the issue but would engage China in a persistent, comprehensive  and systematic manner. Taking a more aggressive approach  towards human rights as the United States has done could  "generate a negative response", he said, arguing a quieter, less  confrontational approach could lead to better results.    On North Korea, one of the main topics of discussion during  his two days of talks in Beijing, Mr Evans said he was confident  China was playing an active role in defusing the tension over  North Korea's nuclear programme. He also said he personally  thought China would not necessarily oppose sanctions if dialogue  on the issue broke down completely. Officially, the Chinese  position remained that they had only a limited role in the  dispute, he added.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Bonn plays host to eastern Europe's avant-garde - Besides 20th century art, the main theatrical event at the Kuntshalle is an experimental opera about the life of Gorbachev No-one ever went to Bonn for culture. But by the end of the century, when the most important government ministries have transferred to Berlin, culture may be all Bonn has to remind itself of those heady days as a European capital. The city's image as a cultural backwater has been transformed over the past two years by the Kunsthalle, a large modern gallery with a growing international reputation. Its latest exhibition is typically ambitious - a panoramic survey of 20th century avant-garde art in eastern Europe. Like several other artificially-created capitals, Bonn has struggled to build a cultural life commensurate with its political status. In the 1980s, the federal government began pumping money into the Bonn Opera, but there has been little of permanent value to show for it. Attempts to exploit the Beethoven connection (he was born in Bonn) have also had mixed success. The Kunsthalle is different. Built with DM130m (Pounds 50m) of federal funds, it opened with exquisite timing, just as the decision was taken to deprive Bonn of its capital status. Situated next to two other new museums in Bonn's government area, it has been a success from the start. The building itself, a creamy limestone rectangle designed by the Viennese architect Gustav Peichl, makes no great statement - unless you count the 16 rusty steel columns along the front, representing the 16 German Lander. But you cannot mistake the three roof-cones, standing amid a landscaped sculpture garden. Inside, the cones feed natural light onto circular display areas, like neo-classical porticos - the perfect home for a Brancusi polished bronze bird in the current exhibition. In addition to two floors of flexible exhibition space, there are archive and video facilities, and a 500-seat theatre. The idea is to encourage inter-disciplinary activities - exploring the east European theme, for example, with a film season and experimental opera. Entitled Europa, Europa, The Century of the Avant-Garde in Central and Eastern Europe, the exhibition aims to highlight the contribution made by east European artists to international artistic trends, and to show that art behind the Iron Curtain was not necessarily subordinate. Starting with symbolist and abstract art, we are swept through Cubism, Constructivism, Jewish culture, Socialist Realism, postwar technical developments and current trends. Putting this together cost DM10m - more than many museums' annual budget. Given the breadth of the subject, it is hardly surprising that the overall impression is sketchy. Some of the work in the Cubist and Constructivist sections lacks a distinctive quality. Chagall is poorly represented, and the exhibition's vitality diminishes as it proceeds. Nevertheless, there are plenty of discoveries - particularly in the opening section, which includes a visionary 'Sunset' by the Lithuanian artist Mikalojus Ciurlionis (1875-1911) and loans from Polish, Moravian, Slovenian and Transylvanian collections, long hidden from western eyes. One admires the simple strength of Popova's constructivist pictures, the fairy-tale surrealism of Josef Sima's 'Fall of Icarus' (1936) and the sheer artistry of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's light-space modulator (1930), a sophisticated forerunner of Tinguely's mechanical contraptions. A room of Russian theatre designs includes a Gogolesque Mikado from Moscow in 1927. Dominating the postwar section is Magdalena Abakonowicz's lifesize sculpture 'Human Crowd IV' (1989), a grim posse of headless figures. The exhibition and film season run till October 16. The main theatrical event so far has been the world premiere of Gorbachev, an operatic sketch by Franz Hummel with a text by Thomas Korner. Lasting less than 50 minutes, it consists of a rehearsal of a fictitious 'grand heroic opera' about the former Soviet leader. Gorbachev himself is a tenor, and the other two parts  -the stage director and repetiteur - are spoken. A five-act structure is glimpsed, embracing a Glasnost speech to the Communist Party congress, a state visit to the West, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the coup attempt and humiliation by Yeltsin in parliament. Like Nixon in China and the Patty Hearst opera premiered at this year's Munich Biennale, Gorbachev deals with a contemporary subject bursting with natural theatre. Unlike them, it makes no attempt to fictionalise its subject. Instead, it places Gorbachev in ironic parentheses, as the protagonists question whether such a figure can be adequately represented on stage while he is still alive. The message seems to be that only when time lends its interpretative gloss, when history offers its perspective, can a clear distinction be made between real-life figure and theatrical archetype. Gorbachev asks more questions than it answers: why would a Fuhrer consciously lay the ground for his own downfall? What is Gorbachev's historical significance? Is he a messianic or tragic figure? Would he make a suitable subject for an opera? The music is harmless - chattering piano accompaniments, taped orchestral perorations, declamatory arioso and lyrical canzonetta. The stage director pontificates, the repetiteur makes tea. Flimsy material perhaps, but Hansgunther Heyme's production, with Wolf Munzer's pyramid-staircase set, transformed it into a worthwhile piece of theatre. Walter Raffeiner was the authentic Gorbachev impersonator, assisted by Adolf Dresen's stage director and Irina Rumina's repetiteur.</p>

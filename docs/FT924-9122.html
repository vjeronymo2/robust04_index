			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: Japanese fear they may be next on hit list FEARS that Japan will be the next to feel US trade wrath have inspired the agriculture ministry to request that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) tone down a statement supporting the US action against the EC. Miti has 'sympathy' for frustrated US trade negotiators on the troublesome issue of oil seeds, while the agriculture ministry worries that Washington will use similarly tough tactics to force Japan to open its rice market to imports. But officials at both ministries share a concern that the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) will be unable to react coherently to the trade issue, as the party is stricken by a brawl within its largest faction and by a fresh batch of allegations about its leaders' dealings with gangsters. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, had a telephone conversation yesterday with US President-elect Bill Clinton, and later told the Japanese parliament that he hoped his administration will be no more protectionist than the Bush administration. Mr Miyazawa and the Japanese government have tried to take a low profile during the dispute between the US and EC, as no Japanese politician wants to be remembered for presiding over the opening of the country's rice market. The reluctance to get involved in the agriculture debate has frustrated officials at Miti, which would like Japan to make an early offer on rice, but the delaying of rice negotiations has delighted the agriculture ministry, which is responsible for protecting the interests of politically influential farmers' groups. Officials at the two ministries said yesterday that a full-fledged trade war would serve nobody's interests, though the agriculture ministry senses that it will be under extreme pressure if the US and EC resolve their differences, and attention turns to Japan. 'We are very neutral. We are not on the EC side or the US side, but we are concerned by the tactics used by the US and we are worried they will try the same thing against us. You can really see the powerful influence of US farmers' groups,' a senior official at the ministry said. Miti officials generally support the US action, though a public statement from the ministry was altered after the Agriculture Ministry telephoned to express its concern. Instead of open support for Washington, Miti said Japan 'can understand and see the point of the US position'. Privately, Miti officials are confident the EC-US dispute will be fairly quickly resolved and it will not deteriorate into a total trade war. 'You could be either pessimistic or optimistic, but I am optimistic. I think there is now more pressure on the EC to make a concession and something may happen fairly quickly,' a Miti negotiator said. Another senior official said the Japanese government was confused by the influence of French domestic political issues on the agriculture trade debate.</p>

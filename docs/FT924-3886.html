			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow claws back early loss on recovery hopes Wall Street ALTHOUGH blue-chip stocks continued to slip on profit-taking, the rest of the US stock markets either held their ground or posted new gains on growing confidence in the economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.72 at 3,276.53, although off its lows of the day when it had been down 16 points. In contrast, the broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.04 firmer at 429.93, while the Amex composite put on 1.12 at 393.68 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 3.44 to 656.35, a new high for the index. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 239m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 909 to 867. Analysts regard the selling of recent days as a temporary correction in prices following the recent period of strength. The fundamentals of the market, meanwhile, remained positive, with investors encouraged by recent signs that the economic recovery is picking up. However, there were some concerns about the possible revival in inflation. The day's news was mostly positive. Jobless claims fell 12,000 in the third week of November, October factory orders increased 7 per cent, third quarter non-farm productivity rose 3.0 per cent, and the latest car sales figures showed strength. Today the November employment report is due to be released. Woolworth initially fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 31 1/4 in early trading after the retailer reported that November domestic same-store sales fell by 1.1 per cent, and that total sales fell by 6.9 per cent in the month. Although the figures disappointed some investors who had hoped for a post-election bounce in consumer spending, optimism about a strong Christmas period helped Woolworth's shares recover to end Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 32 1/2 . Advanced Micro plunged Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 16 1/8 in turnover of 3.5m shares after a judge ruled that the company had no right to copy certain Intel software in versions of the 486 personal computer microprocessor. The ruling means that the introduction of a 486 chip to compete with the Intel 486 will be delayed, allowing Intel to enjoy a longer period without competition. Intel, which is traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 77 1/4 in turnover of 5.9m shares Also on Nasdaq, Pomeroy Computer climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 5 3/8 after the Cincinnati-based technology company announced it had signed three agreements that would generate more than Dollars 31m in sales and service revenue over the next 12 months. Canada TORONTO stocks finished virtually flat with the merchandising sector gaining strength from a rise in heavyweight Hudson's Bay Co. The merchandising index gained 32.55, or 0.9 per cent, to 3660.62 while Hudson's Bay rose CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 26 3/4 after reporting an improvement in third quarter profits excluding extraordinaries. The TSE-300 edged down 0.3 to 3264.9 on volume of 42.8m shares valued at CDollars 354.3m</p>

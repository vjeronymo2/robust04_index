			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Flexibility is key to restoration of EMS Sir, Barry Eichengreen and Charles Wyplosz are surely right to argue (Personal View, September 17) that the ERM has now become so permissive as to cast doubt on the feasibility of completing the single market. But their diagnosis of the flaws is unconvincing. In 1992-93 the European authorities stubbornly defended exchange rates that had become seriously misaligned to a point where credibility was totally undermined once the defences were overwhelmed, and refused to acknowledge that German unification meant that the rest of Europe needed markedly lower interest rates than Germany. Do Eichengreen and Wyplosz really believe that the ERM could have survived had it been exposed to such pressures prior to the abolition of capital controls? Are they really claiming that the imposition of deposit requirements for institutions with open foreign exchange positions would permit the parities of exchange rates pegged at levels that impose such strains to survive? The key to restoring the EMS is not to play at restoring capital controls, but to resolve once and for all that rates will be pegged at levels that make sense in the light of the fundamentals and that are promptly changed to reflect changes in the fundamentals. For the moment that means keeping the wide band for the D-Mark, because of the need to allow Germany to keep relatively high interest rates, but there is no reason to delay restoring relatively narrow bands among all the other currencies (including the pound and the lira). If that would mean that for the time being the D-Mark would no longer be at the centre of the ERM, so be it.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Defense: Expected </F> Personnel Changes in Armed Forces High Command"]    [Text] On a proposal from the defense minister, the Council  of Ministers has decided to keep Admiral Alain Coatanea in his  position as Navy chief of staff until 30 June, although he  reached on 27 March the age limit for his rank. Also to remain  in place until 30 June as commander of the Rennes [Brittany]  military defense district is Lieutenant General Jean Pons, who  reached the age limit for his rank on 22 April.    The extensions have been decided in the run-up to a  comprehensive change of personnel in the military high command.  This change will mostly affect the Navy and the Air Force, as  well as part of the Army.    The departure of Admiral Coatanea will entail changes in the  Navy staff. The next chief of staff will likely be Vice Admiral  Jean-Charles Lefebvre, who currently commands the Naval  Intervention Force in the Mediterranean Sea. However, in view  of what military men call his "potential" -- that is, the  balance of the active period he has to complete before being  promoted to the second section (May 1999) -- the government may  chose to fill the position on an "interim" basis with a man who  would remain in place until after the presidential election.  But should the armed forces be subject to a political timetable  or, conversely, should they ensure defense continuity? Should  Admiral Lefebvre not be appointed chief of staff this year, the  position might go to Admiral Deramond, who currently heads the  Brest [Brittany] Navy district.    The Council of Ministers appointed Vice Admiral Jean-Noel  Turcat as general army inspector to replace Admiral Calmon. He  will be replaced as major general by Vice Admiral Bernard Moysan.    As for the Air Force, the change of personnel will stem from  the departure of General Vincent Lanata, who in June 1993 had  been confirmed in his position as chief of staff for an  additional year. He should be replaced by Lieutenant General  Jean-Philippe Douin, who is currently Army major general. This  position could be given to Lieutenant General Jean Rannou, who  now heads the Defense Ministry's Military Bureau. The latter  could himself be replaced with a "landsman," General Jean  Heinrich, the current military intelligence chief; with General  Raymond Germanos, the deputy head of the FAR [Rapid Intervention  Force]; or, most likely, General Philippe Mercier, operations  deputy chief at the Armed Forces Staff Headquarters.    Such are the rumors currently making the rounds. They are  not unfounded. However, no decision has reportedly been made  yet. This is the very reason why the announcement of the whole  process -- which was supposed to take effect soon -- was delayed  and why Admiral Coatanea remains in place as Navy chief of staff  for the time being. It must be added that the Armed Forces are  currently completing their proposed Military Planning Bill and  that by way of consequence this was probably not the best time  for implementing substantial personnel changes within the  military high command.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall as dollar hits low against yen US Treasury bonds tumbled yesterday morning as the dollar briefly hit a record low against the yen, but prices improved in the afternoon in spite of a lacklustre auction. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 11/32 at 85 5/16 . The yield was hovering at 7.49 per cent, after breaking through the important psychological barrier of 7.50 per cent earlier in the day and then receding. At the short end, the two-year note was off  5/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 5.976 per cent. With the dollar giving up more ground against the yen and D-Mark, the travails of the US currency provided a gloomy guide for bonds. At noon, it dipped below Y100 for the first time and bonds plunged. Later, it inched back over and bonds improved. The pattern was repeated a few times during the afternoon. The fear is that the Federal Reserve will soon be forced to support the currency by lifting short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year. Traders are now concerned that a move could come in early July. Such speculation brought selling pressure to the entire maturity range, but activity intensified at the short end as traders adjusted their positions ahead of the Treasury's sale of Dollars 17bn in two-year notes. In the event, the auction was mildly disappointing, but the market was able to hold steady. Meanwhile, traders were on high alert for more inflationary signals from the commodity markets. Fortunately there was a softer tone in prices for the second day in a row, easing one source of pressure on bonds. With concerns over the dollar, supply and commodities piling up, the day's economic news passed largely unnoticed. The Commerce Department said the trade deficit had widened in April to Dollars 8.4bn, from a revised March deficit of Dollars 6.87bn. Economists were expecting last month's figure to be about Dollars 7.68bn. After Monday's sharp declines, European government bonds ended yesterday's calmer session unchanged to slightly weaker. Early on, bonds clawed back some of the previous day's losses, helped partly by lower-than-expected German M3 money supply data. However, as investors continued their buyers' strike, markets drifted sideways until weaker US Treasuries dragged them lower in the afternoon. Europe is likely to continue to track the US in coming days. 'Until Treasuries stabilise, volatility and bearishness in Europe will continue,' said a trader in London. 'Our markets are very fragile and there's no cash activity to speak of - if US yields lurch higher again, we're in for another rough ride,' he added. In Germany, news that M3 money supply had grown at an annualised 13.7 per cent rate in the five months to May gave bunds a brief lift. Although the rate is well above the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target range, it was below market expectations of around 14.5 per cent. However, it was not enough to lend solid support to the market. 'People will need some convincing that it's really heading back towards the official target range,' said a German dealer. Preliminary June inflation data, expected to be released this week, are also unlikely to give the market a sustainable boost. Even if the year-on-year number falls below the psychologically important 3 per cent level, 'it probably won't prompt more than a brief uptick in the futures,' said the dealer. 'Fundamentals aren't driving the markets these days.' At today's repo allocation by the Bundesbank, German money market traders surveyed by MMS International expect the minimum repo rate to fall by five basis points to 5 per cent. UK gilts ended slightly weaker, dragged down by other markets. Traders reported scant cash activity, with prices led mainly by the futures market. The Bank of England announced that it would auction Pounds 2bn of gilts on June 29. It said the auction would be of a further tranche of Floating-Rate Treasury stock due 1999, fungible with the existing issue. The stock will be fully paid. Today, traders will study the release of the minutes of the May 4 meeting between Bank of England governor Eddie George and chancellor Kenneth Clarke for any hints on the direction of UK interest rates. Italian bonds derived some cheer from favourable inflation data, but continuing worries over the budget deficit and weakness in other markets dragged them lower towards the close. The 10-year bond contract on the Italian futures exchange closed at 101.73, down 0.11 points and off its 102.66 high.</p>

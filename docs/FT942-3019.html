			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: BCE to form directories link with HK Telecom BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group, is expanding its international directories business by forming a joint venture with Hongkong Telecom. The new unit, whose revenues are expected to total USDollars 1bn over the next decade, will publish telephone directories, including Yellow Pages, for Hong Kong. BCE will provide management and technical services. Mr Thomas Bourke, president of Tele-Direct, a BCE subsidiary, said that the Hong Kong directories market was one of the fastest-growing in the world, and that the link with Hongkong Telecom would open doors elsewhere in south-east Asia and China. Hongkong Telecom is 58 per cent owned by Cable and Wireless, which last year brought in BCE as a 20 per cent shareholder in Mercury Communications, the UK telephone company controlled by C&amp;W. BCE is already active in the directories market in North America, the Middle East, Australia and India.</p>

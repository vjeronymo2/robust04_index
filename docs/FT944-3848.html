			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Cantab Cantab Pharmaceuticals could be the great overlooked stock of the sector. Its work on modifying the immune system is driven by Alan Munro, who gave up the job of head of immunology at Cambridge to try to commercialise his ideas. The lead product is aimed at making kidneys less likely to be rejected after transplants. The scientific principles seem solid, there is a good economic story (transplants are expensive) and clinical trials should be quick. Phase 3 trials begin next year, but the company is likely to need more cash before making a profit.</p>

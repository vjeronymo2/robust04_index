			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN CRISIS COME HOPES FOR A NEW, NEW DEAL;  </P> <P> PERESTROIKA: JUST AS F.D.R.'S NEW DEAL TRANSFORMED AMERICA, REFORMS CAN BRING  THE SOVIET UNION OUT OF THE ECONOMIC WILDERNESS. BUT DELAYS, DEVIATIONS AND  SABOTAGE LOOM.  </P> <P> The word crisis has become part of our political vocabulary. We knew that this  was true as far as capitalism was concerned. Today we find ourselves  experiencing the same ailment, which makes it possible to draw certain  analogies.  </P> <P> Capitalism was in a state of very grave crisis in the late 1920s and the early  '30s. The attempts of some countries to extricate themselves from a capitalist  system by resorting to totalitarian dictatorships, war and imperial chauvinism  led to complete catastrophe for which, unfortunately, the rest of the world  also had to pay a high price.  </P> <P> A different approach prevailed in the United States. That country's leaders  realized that they could get out of the crisis through radical reforms and  democratization -- the same things we call perestroika nowadays. President  Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal also came up against numerous difficulties.  </P> <P> Still, the New Deal triumphed and saved capitalism. But it was a capitalism  different from that described by Marx and Engels in the 19th Century and by  Lenin at the beginning of the 20th Century.  </P> <P> Today many Soviet economic executives and some of our scientists try to  persuade us that in the course of economic reforms, our citizens will have to  make more sacrifices and that the situation "will grow worse before it gets any  better." I don't see how it can get much worse than now. It is illogical to  contend that the efforts to restore elementary economic order in a generally  rich country, which has all the necessary conditions for normal life but has  been led to the brink by economic inefficiency, could lead to even further  deterioration.  </P> <P> We are told that this is inevitable because a radical economic reform will take  a long time. This may be so, especially if we continue to put up with delays in  carrying through the reform, deviations from its course and even sabotage.  </P> <P> I can't accept any explanation other than complete loss of control over the  economy and lack of personal responsibility for such failures. The same is true  of the outrageous situation in distribution, in which a great many of our  products disappear without a trace, like in the twilight zone.  </P> <P> I think that we don't give enough importance to a condition that exists from  top to bottom throughout the Soviet Union today -- the lack of efficiency,  professionalism, elementary managerial skills and the ability to solve  problems.  </P> <P> Some economic reform proposals call for shifting the burden of hardship onto  the population, whose living conditions are already far from easy, by calling  for money confiscation in one form or another. Does a state, in particular one  with the ambition to become based on the rule of law, have any right at all to  take away money belonging to its citizens? Such a measure should only be used  in the event of war or revolution or other emergencies. It cannot be used to  solve problems that are the result of mismanagement and the mistakes,  ineptitude and inefficiency of economic leaders.  </P> <P> More realistic and long-term measures have been suggested, including the  reduction of state expenditures. The Soviet Union remains a rather extravagant  spender, throwing away hundreds of billions of rubles on unnecessary capital  construction, the production of unnecessary commodities, the military and the  maintenance of a huge apparatus. It is bad when the finance ministry strives to  make up for this bacchanalia of extravagance with excessive taxes and all sorts  of extortions that may ruin the country.  </P> <P> Comparing the experience of our countries might help those who cannot  understand that many people in the United States and Western Europe regard the  success of perestroika as being in their interests. During the Great  Depression, was it in the interests of the Soviet Union for the United States  to follow the same route of several European countries into fascism and  militarism, or see the New Deal prevail, even though its aim was to save  capitalism? World War II showed the benefit of the second alternative. And  today, when many nuclear power stations are scattered across the globe and when  huge arsenals of deadly weapons have been accumulated in the world, who stands  to gain from outbreaks of uncontrollable violence and anarchy in any country?  </P> <P> There are ways out of the present difficulties. Let us not frighten either  ourselves or others, for this could only demoralize the people and destabilize  the situation. Besides, the inflation of pessimism and the exaggeration of  difficulties are just a suitable and handy way to cover up the tracks of bad  economic leaders and inefficient workers and justify the slow pace of reforms  designed to change the economy and the style and methods of economic  management.  </P></p>

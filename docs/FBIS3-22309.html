Mr. Yanyong yesterday led an eight-member committee in  charge  of examining the encroachment of forest reserves to check the  Tha Song Yang Forest Reserve.    The committee included representatives of the National  Environment Board, Kasetsat University, Third Army Region,  Forest Industry Organisation (FIO) and Forestry Department.    The trees were cut around their trunks and left to die over  ten years ago by Karen tribesmen who fled fighting inside Burma  across the Moei River to Thailand, Mr. Yanyong said.    He added that the committee had agreed to propose that the  FIO be assigned to fell the dead trees. Mr. Yanyong added that  the FIO must carry out the assignment by itself, and that  granting a private firm a sub-contract would be prohibited.    After the dead trees were taken away, new trees would be  planted in the area to revive the watershed.    If nothing was done to the dead trees they would soon decay  or burn down, he said.    Forestry Department sources said that several thousand rai  of  forest area in Mae Ramat National Forest Reserve in Tak Province  had been encroached upon similarly.    Encroachers hired Karen tribesmen to chop around tree  trunks,  make a bonfire at the tree bases and build fences around land  plots to claim ownership after the forest was declared  deteriorated, the sources said.    Government officials were believed to have been involved in  the encroachment.    Tha Song Yang district police chief inspector Pol Lt-Col  Anan  Saengthong said the encroachment was still being investigated.</p>

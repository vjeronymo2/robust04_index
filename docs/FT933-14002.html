			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bosnian peace plan 'misconceived' IMPOSING a peace plan on Bosnia from the outside is impractical, the Commons foreign affairs committee concluded yesterday in a report on the expanding role of the United Nations. The 11-member committee said calls for military deployment to enforce a disputed peace plan had been misconceived - adding that UN troops equipped for humanitarian or peace-keeping purposes could not be transformed into a fighting force to protect safe havens by passing a new resolution at the Security Council. 'We fear that attempting to impose a plan could make things worse, not better for the civilian population, as well as having serious consequences for for the safety of UN personnel,' the report stated. Looking more broadly at the UN's involvement in the world's trouble spots, particularly Bosnia, Cambodia and Somalia, the committee recommended that any requests for political or military intervention should be examined far more rigorously. It said it had to be accepted that not all proposals for a peace-keeping operation could be successfully put into effect, because they were impractical or because the human and financial resources were not available. The committee complained that some UN decisions to intervene militarily had not been taken according to a clear set of guiding principles, but in response to sudden emergencies. The UN, for example, had moved into Somalia but had not become involved in other comparable humanitarian disasters, such as in Sudan. It stressed that there had always to be a distinction between peace-keeping and enforcement, and warned of grave difficulties in trying to combine the two functions in a single location. The approach to the imposition of UN sanctions also needed to be changed, the committee said. Limited sanctions had not proved effective. In order to make sanctions a much more effective weapon they had to be accompanied from the outset by a land, sea and air blockade, together with a sophisticated range of controls over commercial, financial and trading mechanisms. The report also urged the UN to increase its capacity to identify possible crisis areas, to rely more on 'preventive diplomacy'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Raps Kim Yong-sam Group's Flunkeyist </F> Treacheries" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The acute and strained  situation of the Korean peninsula is a product of outside  forces' policy of aggression and the flunkeyist and treacherous  policy of the Kim Yong-sam regime, which is prolonging its days  by clinging to their coattails, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined  article today.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam, who swore an oath to serve the  United States, is zealously toeing the master's policy of  aggression and war and working for the latter's interests, the  article says, and continues:    Depending on the American master for its survival, the Kim  Yong- sam group is entreating him for "protection" and for the  permanent presence of U.S. Forces in South Korea. The puppets  have never let a chance pass by without describing the U.S.  Forces in South Korea as "a deterrent to war" and "apostle of  peace." They are making no bones about donating billions of  dollars every year for keeping the U.S. troops in South Korea.    Not contented with this, they have left South Korea as a  test  ground of "the new military strategy" of the U.S. Forces and a  military intelligence base against the North.    The Kim Yong-sam regime is, indeed, a group of traitors  trying to slay the fellow countrymen in the North with the sword  of outside forces. The puppets are trying to stifle the North,  serving as a shock brigade in the nuclear clamour of the  imperialist reactionaries.    There have been no small number of traitors in South Korea.  But there has never been such a fellow as the traitor Kim  Yong-sam who is running about so desperately to slay fellow  countrymen with the help of outside forces. The Kim Yong-sam's  is really a group of traitors outstripping their predecessors,  traitors without an equal.</p>

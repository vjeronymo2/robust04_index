			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED REVIEWS FOR STANLEY CROUCH  </P> <P> What a refreshing experience to read the article on black essayist Stanley  Crouch. Occasionally, the voice of sanity pops up like a cork out of "an abyss  of intellectual and moral cowardice."  </P> <P> How disappointing is the contemporary crop of black American leaders, who, as  Crouch says, are "selfish opportunists, suffering from critical bankruptcy in  the face of fashion and ideology."  </P> <P> As a white retired school teacher, who devoted the main part of my career to  teaching in a black ghetto, I yearn for intellectuals like Crouch to come forth  and tell it like it is.  </P> <P> Crouch describes the indoctrinations of Nation of Islam minister Louis  Farrakhan as "consistently incoherent." Unfortunately, his duped followers do  not appear to possess the rational capacity to see through him, and have made  him a power figure that has discarded white support. Many agree that  Farrakhan's anti-Semitic and separatist thinking helped to undermine the whole  civil rights movement.  </P> <P> Crouch characterizes the "rap group Public Enemy and those of their ilk who  have engaged in the baiting of Jewish people, Afro-fascists." If only more  black leaders could remind their people that the Jews were, and are, in the  forefront of the black civil rights movement. What an insult and disappointment  to those Jews whose blood has intermingled with theirs in the struggle.  </P> <P> Let's hope that more black Americans will listen to Crouch's teachings and turn  more to what America has to offer, and refute the haters, separatists and  seekers of personal power at the expense of their people and the nation.  </P> <P> IRVING E.

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / OECD delays picking chief Ambassadors to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development removed the question of who should become the new head of the institution from the agenda of a council meeting yesterday, delaying a decision until September. The OECD's 25 members have been divided for months over which of four candidates should become secretary-general when the second five-year mandate of Mr Jean-Claude Paye expires in September. Mr Donald Johnston - former head of Canada's Liberal party who has the backing of the US, Japan and, according to his supporters, at least 10 other countries - is believed to be the leading candidate. Mr Paye, who is seeking a third term, is said to be the second favourite, with Lord Lawson, former British chancellor of the exchequer, behind him. Diplomats said the fourth candidate, Germany's top trade negotiator Mr Lorenz Schomerus, appears to be out of the running.</p>

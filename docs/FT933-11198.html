Pre-tax profits, however, improved from Pounds 24m to Pounds 25.6m. The drop in net assets followed a 9 per cent decline in the previous year. LMS said the market value of its listed investments, notably First Leisure, and trading property was more than Pounds 50m higher than the book value.

Net rental income from investment properties reached Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 28.9m). Other income, mainly bank interest on the cash deposits partly created by the sale of shares in First Leisure in the previous period, amounted to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 6.1m). Interest payable was Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 14.8m). Total debt stood at Pounds 188m (Pounds 160m), but with cash of Pounds 124m (Pounds 103m) net gearing was 24 per cent. The proposed final dividend of 3.2p (3p) makes a total of 4p (3.8p) from earnings of 6.39p (6.54p).</p>

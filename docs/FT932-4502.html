			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Two-week extension for Swan Hunter frigate work SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, has won a further two weeks' outfitting work on the three Type 23 frigates which are its main workload, Price Waterhouse, the yard's receivers, confirmed yesterday. The agreement between the receivers and the Ministry of Defence is the third temporary extension to work on the frigates since Swans went into receivership in mid-May, after failing to win a crucial helicopter carrier order. Price Waterhouse said the extension until June 28 meant there would be no redundancies in the coming fortnight among the remaining 2,000 employees. Union leaders expressed concern at the effect of the agreement on morale. Mr John Macciocchi, fitters' shop steward, said: 'We hope the MoD make a final decision that Swans can finish these ships, then we can get down to business and boost morale a little bit.' Negotiations on whether Swans can complete the frigates, providing some work until late 1994, are continuing. The Ministry of Defence said it was a very complicated issue, adding: 'They must be completed within the time-frame and the financial constraints.' Completing the frigates would give Swans a chance of securing further orders and being sold as a going concern. The company's strongest hope for new work, a Pounds 40m patrol boats order from the Royal Navy of Oman, hinges on satisfying the navy that its Pounds 8m advance payment would not be at risk. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday it was still studying whether it could underwrite the Pounds 8m as part of a total Pounds 20m package of performance guarantees. The department said the proposal, from local authorities and the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, raised technical and ideological questions. The European Commission is still considering a government request to look again at the exemption of UK warship yards, including Swans, from Shipbuilding Intervention Fund eligibility. The GMB general union, holding its annual congress in Portsmouth yesterday, unanimously backed an emergency motion pledging full support for the Swans workforce in its fight to complete the frigates.</p>

In the first place, Armenia seeks a ceasefire in the conflict  area. However, this has become impossible without the presence  of separating forces there.    Speaking at a news conference in Yerevan today, Liparitian  pointed to the need for the entire world community to combine  its efforts for the successful resolution of the issue.    "Russia and the CSCE must submit a united plan to the  warring  sides," Liparitian pointed out. He said Eliasson had agreed  with this when he stayed in the Armenian capital.    The Armenian diplomat said armed formations must be  withdrawn  from certain territories after the establishment of a ceasefire  in accordance with documents developed by Russia and the CSCE.  Liparitian pointed out that both the Russian plan and the CSCE  program envisioned a pull-out of Armenian forces from all  territories they occupy, except for Lachin, while Azerbaijanis  will have to leave Mardakert. The status of the Shaumian  (Geranboi) district will remain as subject to further  negotiations.    After this, vital communications should be unblockaded and  the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh should be submitted for  consideration by the CSCE Minsk Group, according to Armenia.</p>

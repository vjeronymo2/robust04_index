			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GATEKEEPING IN THE PROMISED LAND;  </P> <P> STRANGERS FROM A DIFFERENT SHORE: A HISTORY OF ASIAN AMERICANS BY RONALD TAKAKI  (LITTLE, BROWN: $22.95; 512 PP.; 0-316-83109-3)  </P> <P> On a February morning in 1988, in a large, dingy chamber of the federal  District Court House in Manhattan, a clerk handed me my Certificate of  Naturalization listing my height, weight, color of eyes ("brown"), hair  ("black") and complexion ("medium"), then a judge led me and more than 150  other petitioners (most of whom seemed to be of "medium" or "dark" complexion)  through the pledge of allegiance and pronounced us legitimate Americans. For  us, the new citizens, this was a moment of intense emotions. Strangers hugged  and kissed. For America, too, this was proof that the principles of democracy  and equal rights had triumphed. There had been a time not that long ago in  America's immigration history when I, educated, law-abiding, eager to be  American, would have been denied citizenship simply because of my "medium"  complexion.  </P> <P> For Americans and Canadians of Asian extraction, however, the battle for  acceptance doesn't stop with winning the right to become citizens. I became  painfully aware of how the New World marginalizes its Asian-looking citizens  when I was co-authoring a book on the 1985 terrorist-bombing of an Air India  jet en route from Canada to India. Three hundred and twenty-nine people died  when AI Flight 182 exploded in mid-air; in terms of body count, that terrorist  incident remains the world's bloodiest. Ninety percent of the victims were  Canadian citizens. But because those citizens were Canadians "of Indian  origin," a senior External Affairs official explained to me, the Canadian  government perceived them as being Indian rather than Canadian, and Canada's  prime minister, in a rush of mis-channeled sympathy, sent a cable of condolence  to India's prime minister.  </P> <P> It is this Asian-American, 150-year-long, two-phase fight for legal and  psychological acceptance that Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies at  the University of California, Berkeley, skillfully uncovers and forcefully  records in "Strangers From a Different Shore," his fifth book on American  minorities.  </P> <P> Takaki's aim is to correct the Euro-centric tilt favored by the majority of  American social historians, to render visible Asians' contributions to the  making of America, and to firmly establish the pluralism of American culture.  His scope is vast: He chronicles the very distinctive immigration odysseys of  the Chinese, the Japanese, the Koreans, the Filipinos, the Asian Indians, the  Vietnamese, the Hmong. And his method is extraordinary, seaming together  meticulous scholarship, impassioned analysis, popular culture and personal  memoir. The result is a compelling and timely document about America's changing  responses to the threat of de-Europeanization.  </P> <P> It was to California of the 1850s, staggeringly underpopulated and glittery  with gold dust, that the first Asian immigrants -- Chinese prospectors --  rushed. These were gutsy, hard-working pioneers who experienced the push/pull  syndrome familiar to most immigrants: as with their European counterparts, the  Chinese were "pushed" out of their homeland by poverty, and "pulled" in to  America by promises of self-improvement. And, at least at first, the Chinese  were accepted. In Jan., 1852, Gov. John McDougal of California described the  newcomers as "one of the most worthy classes of our newly adopted citizens --  to whom the climate and the character of these lands are peculiarly suited."  Theirs should have been a happy story.  </P> <P> What the Chinese soon stumbled against however, Takaki argues, was the violent  panic of white labor unions. Racism was a tool that labor leaders and savvy  politicians exploited to break the power of white capitalists who employed the  cheap and diligent Asian work force as "scabs." Labor unions successfully fed  the public's fears about miscegenation and de-Europeanization, and created a  backlash against the Asian immigrants.  </P> <P> Takaki is particularly dogged in tracking the changes in public perception and  official rhetoric. The "worthy" adoptees suddenly became the "servile" hordes  crowding America's shores, men too "dissimilar from ourselves in customs,  language and education" to be assimilated into the Founding Fathers' ideal of a  homogenously white and Christian sovereign state. Even a respectable newspaper  such as the New York Times labeled the Chinese "a population befouled with all  the social vices . . . with heathenish souls and heathenish propensities . .  .", the enemy of the American Constitution.  </P> <P> America needed Asian labor, but white Americans didn't want Asian compatriots.  The All-American solution? Pass new race-related laws that reduce the Asian  entrant to a low-waged transient, permanently ineligible for citizenship;  reinforce the vicious myth that Asians are "sojourners," only Europeans are  immigrants.  </P> <P> To be deprived of citizenship is to be rendered invisible, mute, marginal. The  Asians were both too "invisible" and too "visible" a minority. This is the  paradox against which Takaki rightly rages.  </P> <P> "Strangers" provides fuller information on the Chinese, Japanese, Korean and  Filipino groups than on South Asians and recent political refugees. But it does  include a succinct and astute chapter on America's strategies for keeping out  Indians, Asia's "Caucasian" immigrants.  </P> <P> Takaki is at his best when he quickens scholarship with tableaux of immigrant  life. With Chinese railroad workers, we shiver through the rough winter of  1866. "The snow drifts, over sixty feet in height, covered construction  operations. The Chinese workers lived and worked in tunnels under the snow,  with shafts to give them air and lanterns to light the way. Snow slides  occasionally buried camps and crews; in the spring, workers found the thawing  corpses, still upright, their cold hands gripping shovels and picks and their  mouths twisted in frozen terror."  </P> <P> And Takaki is very affecting when he empowers the long-silenced or the  inarticulate with voice. A Japanese-American woman interned during World War II  recalls, "I felt wonderful the day I left camp. We took a bus to the railroad  siding and then stopped somewhere to transfer, and I went in and bought a Coke,  a nickel Coke. It wasn't the Coke, but what it represented -- that I was free  to buy it, that feeling was so intense." A Hmong hog farmer in California  explains: "When you pull a plant out of the ground without any soil around its  roots -- soil from where it was grown -- and transplant it, the plant will have  trouble surviving."  </P> <P> Takaki startles when he reminds us repeatedly that it was President Franklin D.  Roosevelt, an American icon, who "issued Executive Order 9066, which targeted  Japanese Americans for special persecution and deprived them of their rights of  due process and equal protection of the law." F.D.R. did not incarcerate German  and Italian immigrants.  </P> <P> The heroic white American in this narrative is the late Atty. Gen. Robert  Kennedy who, heady with Civil Rights victories, told the Congress in 1964: "  'Everywhere else in our national life, we have eliminated discrimination based  on national origins. Yet, this system is still the foundation of our  immigration law,' " and who, in spite of protests from exclusionist groups such  as the Daughters of the American Revolution, negotiated new legislation that  fractured forever America's Euro-centric self-image.  </P> <P> The attack on "the Model Minority" myth is magnificent. But one wishes that  Takaki had allowed himself a longer discussion of the post-1965 wave of Asian  immigrants, especially of the new class structures and the new gender and  generational relations evolving within the immigrant communities. Perhaps that  will be the subject of this prolific author's next work.  </P> <P> "Strangers" is an important book. Given the documented flight of Anglos from  Southern California in the '80s and the increasinly reactionary stance of the  urban white middle class, this book should be required reading on campuses.  </P></p>

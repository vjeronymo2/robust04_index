			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S FIRST ADVANCE WINS SANTA ANITA FEATURE  </P> <P> It's First Advance, making her first turf start, retook the lead from favored  Lem's Peace in the final strides to win Friday's $41,000 allowance feature by a  head at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Jockey Laffit Pincay sent It's First Advance to the front from the start in the  mile race for 3-year-old fillies and opened a two-length lead coming off the  clubhouse turn. Lem's Peace, ridden by Robbie Davis, closed the gap at the top  of the stretch and took a brief lead in mid-stretch.  </P> <P> But It's First Advance, carrying high weight of 117 pounds, regained the lead  and finished in 1:38 1/5. Twain Harte, with Eddie Delahoussaye aboard, finished  third, another two lengths back.  </P></p>

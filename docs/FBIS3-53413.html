			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Shaykh Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of </F> Tunisia's al-Nahdah Movement, entitled: "The Region and the  World Poised for a New Lining of Forces"]    [Text] The leaders of the Zionist gangs in Palestine and  elsewhere, through public statements and the use of their  awesome international media muscle, seek to turn Arab and  international public opinion against an imminent danger, one  that threatens to wreck the stability of the Arab region and the  world and undermine civilization, peace, security, and  prosperity. This danger, they maintain, is fundamentalism,  a.k.a. religious extremism or political Islam.    The Zionist movement gave the go-ahead for this  international  campaign against Islam. The campaign got going with the  collapse of the Soviet Union and cruised through the  catastrophic Gulf War and the launch of the Madrid conference  for a settlement.    The campaign found a welcoming ear in Arab regimes faced  with  a worsening political and economic crisis, mounting social and  political demands, and the challenge of Islamic opposition. The  campaign also reinforced the Western traditional view of Islam  as a threat to Western interests and agents in the Islamic world.    All this led, with an accelerating pace, to the emergence of  a new lining of forces and interests on the Arab and Islamic  scene. The handshake between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin  was a symbolic milestone on a path that led several Arab  regimes, both in the Arab Maghreb and the Gulf, to flirt openly  with the Zionist entity. Those Arab regimes began exploring the  possibilities of normalizing ties and exchanging interests with  the Zionist entity, even ahead of a formal recognition. The  Arab Maghreb regimes began looking into the prospects for  security, tourism, and cultural exchange with the Zionist  entity. The Gulf countries began looking into the economic  aspect and to contemplate lifting the boycott. All this is a  measure of the noose tightening around Egypt, the largest Arab  country, which Israel still fears.    These developments are occurring behind a smokescreen of  rhetoric about the fundamentalist danger. A wider and more  dangerous deception of the masses is under way, the purpose of  which is to divert their attention from the real danger to their  civilization, and historical and economic integrity. It is,  namely, the Zionist entity.    The Zionist entity, having usurped Palestine, holy  Jerusalem,  and Arab land, is ready for a more dangerous round of expansion  in which it will seek to dominate the region economically and  culturally. The Zionist entity will seek to change the region's  identity and turn it from an Arab and Islamic world aspiring to  unity and liberation, and restoring its prestige and cultural  vibrancy to a Middle East region in which there is no room for  Islam and Arabism. The choicest place, economically,  politically, and militarily, will be reserved for Israel. The  Zionist entity threatens to bury the hopes and dreams of our  nation under the ruins of this region.    So where does the real threat to Palestine and its  honorable Jerusalem, and the Arab and Islamic entity and its  aspiration to unity lie? Does it really lie in fundamentalism  and independent, comprehensive development, as the Zionist  entity and the regimes advocating a peaceful solution--primarily  Tunisia, Egypt, and Algeria--like to propagate? Or does the  impending danger threatening the nation lie in Zionism and its  allies and associates, and in dictatorship and corruption?    Against this blatant defiance of the nation, its identity,  and aspiration to freedom and unity--the defiance that got the  nation and its resistance elements warmed up--ideologies and  policies have been restructured and reincarnated. The early  signs of this can be seen in the Palestinian national movement,  where there is a center of challenge, a crater, and the theater  of the conflict between the proponents of a settlement within  the framework of "the sole legitimate representative" [reference  to the PLO] and its opponents as represented in the 10  Palestinian factions that constitute the strategic alliance  between the Islamists and the leftist, nationalist current.    Judging by the historic status that the Palestinian cause  assumed among the circles of the pan-Arab, Islamic, and  nationalist struggle, and by the challenges the Zionist entity  poses the nation's existence, we expect a new strategic  Palestinian structure to extend up to and beyond the struggling  arenas in the Arab and Islamic worlds.    If this is the case, then two camps will emerge in the  coming  years. The first will be made up of the nationalists, the  pan-Arab, and Islamic regimes and movements that insist on  pursuing the goals of the Islamic, pan-Arab, and national  struggle for independence, freedom, unity, and justice on the  land of Islam, and democracy. This camp will be up against a  second camp embracing the regimes, movements, and currents that  wager on normalization with the Zionist entity, sacrificing the  pan-Arab objectives, and on diminishing the Islamic role and  message. Their only road to this will be violence and  dictatorship.    The dimensions and scope of such a battle go beyond the  Palestinian and even the Arab, Islamic entity to the human  struggle, because of the Zionist entity's influence worldwide  and its expansionist ambitions on every level. It perpetuates  the eternal struggle between right and wrong, progress and  backwardness, between the powers of liberation and arrogance,  and between prophets and idols. What a great battle, a splendid  gift sent by heavenly providence in the hand of Zionism and its  allies to reorganize the ranks of the nation and mobilize them  for a clear cause. (The unbelievers plot and plan, and God too  plans, and the best of planners is God.) [Koranic verse]</p>

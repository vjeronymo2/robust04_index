This is the disturbing  conclusion of Candidate of Technical Sciences Boris Karasev,  senior scientific associate at the Hydrogeology and Engineering  Geology Institute.    Few people know about the independent study conducted by  teams of experts from the Sociology Institute of the Russian  Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Center for Civic Initiative in  Bryansk, Zhitomir, and Gomel oblasts in 1991 and 1992. They  found that many people living in these regions displayed signs  of acute radiation sickness, which can be caused by doses of  100-400 rad. Some of the victims had died. In others, the  sickness had taken chronic forms: Their complaints included  asthenia, headaches, xerostomia, enlarged lymph nodes, and  tumors of the thyroid gland and other organs. Half of the  children in zones of radioactive pollution measuring more than  40 c/km[.sup]2[/] are suffering from these chronic forms of  illness.    The independent commission's findings contradicted the IAEA  reports that the radioactive pollution in the contaminated  regions could not cause any particular damage. Then why did  local inhabitants, contrary to the expectations of the nuclear  scientists, suffer radiation injuries? The independent experts  had no explanation. It was not until two years later than Boris  Karasev found the reason.    He went to the regions affected by the Chernobyl disaster  each year to study the content and migration of regressive  radionuclides. The experimental findings he accumulated are  unique: They serve as the basis for fundamentally new  theoretical conclusions.    Boris Karasev frequently encountered paradoxical cases: Some  of the people in regions where the average level of radiation  did not exceed the allowable limit had been exposed to doses of  radiation dozens of times as high as the hazard level set by the  USSR Ministry of Health. People in these regions sometimes died  of radiation sickness....    The researcher's observations were corroborated by the  Russian-American commission of independent experts. After  comparing its findings to his own, Boris Karasev was able to  guess the secret of the radiation injuries these people had  suffered.    "According to official data," Boris Viktorovich explained,  "the damaged power unit in Chernobyl discharged around 40  percent of the cesium-137 and almost all of the iodine-131 it  contained at the time of the accident. These radioisotopes  entered the environment in approximately the same quantities,  but their effects were incomparable. The fact is that iodine-131  has an extremely short half-life -- eight days -- and is  therefore highly radioactive. It is a thousand times more active  than cesium-137, for example, with its half-life of 30 years.  Iodine-131 is extremely volatile and can be carried thousands of  kilometers in clouds of radioactive dust. It is also highly  soluble, and it penetrates soil easily, where it is absorbed by  plants and then enters the organism of animals and humans. These  properties of iodine are the reason for the colossal damage it  inflicted on the environment in the first days after the  Chernobyl disaster.    Radioactive background levels were three or four times as  high even in Moscow at the end of April 1986, and in Kiev they  were almost 8,000 times as high, reaching 5 milliroentgens per  hour.    The population of Novozybkovskiy Rayon in Bryansk Oblast was  not advised to use powdered milk and to protect and  decontaminate buildings until after May Day. The antitoxin for  the radioactive iodine was distributed...three weeks after the  accident, when this isotope had already decayed. Many people  shared this experience: Almost all of us -- from Kiev to Moscow  and Minsk -- breathed, drank, and ate some iodine-131 in late  April and early May 1986. What did this do to us?    Almost all of the iodine entering the human organism is  absorbed by the thyroid gland. It takes on most of the brunt of  the iodine shock. Whereas the average load on the organism does  not exceed the maximum allowable dose of radiation by  radioactive iodine -- 30 rem -- the local radiation of the  thyroid can be as high as 800 rem. That is why people are  suffering from numerous disorders of the thyroid gland -- even  cancer and the destruction of thyroid tissue -- in regions where  the IAEA believes that the level of radiation is not dangerous.    The amount of radioactive iodine carried by precipitation  differed widely: In some places the content in the soil was  dozens of times higher than in surrounding areas. Some types of  plants absorbed it more vigorously and were then consumed by  humans. Other people ingested iodine-131 in concentrated form --  in the milk of cows and goats feeding on radioactive grass.    All of this could have been harmless for people who had  drunk  potassium iodide: This substance contains non-radioactive  iodine, and a thyroid saturated with it will cease to absorb  radioactive iodine, which will then quickly be flushed out of  the organism. Regrettably, most of the inhabitants of the  affected regions learned about this too late.    "But the nuclear scientists," I said to the researcher,  "must  have known about the horrible implications of the massive  accident at the nuclear plant. Why did they not warn the  civilian population in time and supply it with the means of  preventing radiation sickness?"    "On orders from the government," Boris Karasev replied,  "some  `specialists' are still pretending that they know nothing about  this danger. They calculate the average maximum allowable doses  for polluted territories and seem not to notice the statistical  disparities, which can be quite sizable. Their calculations are  based on methods military specialists have been using since the  early 1960's. For some unknown reason, however, the `experts' in  calculating the maximum dose for civilians have been drawing  harmonious isoflux patterns of radionuclide dispersion and  migration on their charts, showing that everything is fine on  the average, and have argued that exceptional cases cannot be  anticipated. It turns out, however, that they can: Several other  researchers and I compiled the logarithmic curves for different  isotopes long ago, showing how the population can absorb doses  of varying intensity. These curves have extremely long `tails':  This means that some people in territories deemed safe by the  IAEA can receive a more than lethal dose. This was corroborated  by the independent Russian-American commission in 1991 and 1992."    "Judging by your graphs, however, some people in the  polluted  territories received doses that were hundreds or even thousands  of times as high as the average. Is this really possible?"    "It is, and that is the whole problem. Specialists know that  the reactor discharged huge quantities of so-called hot  particles at the time of the Chernobyl accident in Chernobyl. At  a temperature of 2,000 degrees the radioisotopes were `fused'  together. They formed extremely tiny grains, no larger than a  hundredth of a micron, but they were many times more active than  the rest of the substance.    "These particles do not dissolve in water. If they get into  the lungs, they stay there until they decay. During that time  the individual could receive local doses thousands of times as  high as the allowable maximum: This individual would be just as  sick as someone who received a lethal dose when the atom bomb  was dropped.    "Of course, these details spoil the rosy picture the IAEA  has  painted, but is it not time to remove our rose-colored glasses  and face the danger? Accidents at nuclear plants are still  occurring, and no one is insured against new Chernobyls.    "It is no secret that small nuclear reactors are operating  in  Moscow and other big cities. Powerful Mev reactors are operating  in many oblasts. Even in the fail-safe mode, some reactors  discharge many different radioactive substances through their  exhaust pipes. Nuclear power engineers argue that these  substances are distributed evenly across a huge territory, but  according to logarithmic law there is the possibility of quite  sizable disparities. In some types of weather, the smoke from  pipes hugs the ground, and the iodine-131, krypton-85, and other  radioisotopes in the smoke can be washed away by rain. There is  the possibility, therefore, that the content of radioactive  isotopes in the air and soil in some places is higher than the  danger level -- with all of the ensuing consequences.    "If anyone still plans to start up huge new reactors at  nuclear power plants," the researcher said in conclusion, "he  must consider the serious danger of iodine shock as a result of  a disaster, as well as the uneven patterns of radioisotope  fall-out in the fail-safe mode. All of the old forecasts, after  all, turned out to be inaccurate, to say the least. We need new  calculations, based on logarithmic curves. They probably would  prove the need for higher expenditures on gas masks, potassium  iodide, decontamination agents, and other means of preventing  radiation injuries in the civilian population. Can anyone doubt  that these expenditures will be recouped a thousandfold by the  preservation of the health of millions of people?"</p>

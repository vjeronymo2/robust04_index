			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bumper crop puts cotton prices under pressure - This year's US harvest could be the biggest in nearly 60 years The US cotton harvest is moving into full swing in the US Mississippi delta region this week, with farmers projected to bring in the largest crop in nearly 60 years. Although traders and cotton merchants initially scoffed at the US Department of Agriculture's forecast of a record-breaking harvest of 19m bales (480lb each), early harvest data show the estimate is on target. 'Our cotton is picking a little better than it looks, and I'm hearing the same thing from folks in Louisiana and Arkansas,' says Mr Will McCarty, Extension Cotton Specialist with Mississippi State University. 'The farmer that was expecting to get about 775lb per acre is getting 800. What that means is the mid-South cotton crop could be a little bigger than expected.' Texas is the only state reporting disappointing yields in the early harvest period. Its crop suffered from localised early-season drought. While some traders still expect the USDA to reduce its crop estimate as the harvest progresses, local agricultural agents say it appears gains in the delta region will more than offset any shortfall in the Texas harvest. Prices as high as 86 cents a pound during the the spring planting season provided a strong incentive for farmers to seed more acres than usual to cotton, says Mr Kevin Brinkley, an economist with the National Cotton Council. Since then, as the reality of an extra-large crop has sunk in, the market has dropped into a range of 65 to 75 cents a pound, and is now feeling pressure from the harvest. However, even with the world cotton production situation much improved over last year, when China, India, and Pakistan all had crop shortfalls, the US producer will still benefit from strong exports, Mr Brinkley says. Last year, when world cotton production fell to 76m bales, the US exported 7m bales of raw cotton. This year, with world output projected to rise to 86m bales, US producers expect to export 7.3m bales. US manufacturers are also getting better at exporting finished cotton. They will ship the equivalent of 2m bales in finished textile products overseas this year, compared with only 429,000 in 1984, according to National Cotton Council statistics. Mr James Steel, a commodities analyst with Refco in New York, notes that US cotton consumption is also rising. 'Domestic demand is the highest it's been since 1947,' he says. 'We're currently projecting domestic consumption at 11m bales, but it could go even higher.' He is also optimistic that as Japan and Europe emerge from recession, cotton demand will increase in those regions. Over the longer term, Mr Steel sees world cotton demand rising as developing countries like China and India succeed in boosting the real incomes of their vast populations. 'China is consuming far more of its own cotton than ever before, and while their own harvest is better than last year, they still need to buy US cotton to mix to get the quality they need. The US is expected to ship about 1m bales of cotton to China this year, down only slightly from last year's 1.069m.</p>

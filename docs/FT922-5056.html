			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Union chief warns on Labour party funding MR TOM SAWYER, deputy general secretary of the Nupe public-service union and a strong influence in the labour movement, warned yesterday that unions would be unwilling to provide funds for the Labour party if they had no say in its policy. Defending the unions' links with Labour, Mr Sawyer said there was a case for modernising the relationship and for unions not casting block votes on behalf of anonymous members. He cautioned: 'People who fund the party must have a say. While we fund the party we will have a say. It is as crude as that.' Mr Sawyer's comments - he even advocated retaining the electoral college for electing the leader - amount to a further blow to supporters of root-and-branch reform of the party-union link. They appeared to make the running in the immediate post-election period. His comments come a week after Labour's national executive committee set in motion an inquiry into the relationship with unions. It was Mr Sawyer, an NEC member and last year's party chairman, who proposed the inquiry. The executive of Nupe, the fourth-largest union affiliated to Labour, said in a statement yesterday that it rejected any notion that the union-party links should be broken. In a speech to the union's annual conference in Scarborough, Mr Sawyer criticised party members who sought to make the unions a scapegoat for the Conservatives' election victory. 'Don't blame the unions,' he said. 'And don't blame the staff or the party's advisers. If the campaign wasn't good enough, it was the politicians who were in charge of the campaign that failed.' Mr Sawyer also criticised fellow union leaders and others who began advocating a diminution of union influence immediately after the election. 'Too many who should know better are saying too many things about the election and the future of the Labour party without thinking.' Later, Mr Sawyer said: 'We are in danger of losing the collective approach of unions in policy-making structures.' The basis of the inquiry should be to safeguard the rights of the people who fund the Labour party. The electoral college that chooses who should be Labour party leader should stay, although it should be democratised, he said. That may put him at odds with Mr John Smith, likely to be the next Labour party leader, who has said that he wants future leadership contests to be decided on the basis of one-person-one-vote. Mr Sawyer said he would favour calls for an examination into the separating of union block votes so that the preferences of individual members could be reflected. Under the present system, each union casts all of its votes for one candidate or another. Mr Sawyer said unions should also maintain a presence on the national executive committee. They gave 'balance, breadth and working-class representation.'</p>

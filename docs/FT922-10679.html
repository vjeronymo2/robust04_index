			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Increase in Channel 4 advertising share seen CHANNEL 4 is likely to increase its share of advertising considerably when it starts selling its own air time next year, according to James Capel, the stockbrokers. The ITV companies presently sell Channel 4's advertising air time and pay a subscription of 17 per cent of advertising rev-enue to fund both Channel 4 and the Welsh fourth channel, S4C, which costs Pounds 55m a year. From next year the government will fund S4C, which has had advertising revenues of about Pounds 4m a year. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst as James Capel, believes that next year Channel 4 will be able to earn 17.6 per cent of terrestrial advertising revenue in its own right, with the possibility of winning a greater share if it retains its audience. At the same time, James Capel is downgrading its growth estimates for UK commercial television this year from 8 per cent to 6 per cent without including inflation. As a result, James Capel is reducing its profit forecasts for most of the ITV companies and argues that most ITV share prices should now 'at least pause for breath'.</p>

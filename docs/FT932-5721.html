			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Lost decade a bonanza for Brazilian banks - A financial sector whose profits now represent 20% of GDP Most Brazilians regard the country's spiralling inflation with dismay: Brazilian bankers are an exception. For the 'lost decade,' which has seen falling per capita income and triple figure inflation in all but one year, has proved a bonanza for Brazil's banks. Largely due to arbitraging on inflation, the financial sector has enjoyed such healthy profits that its participation in the economy has risen to 20 per cent of gross domestic product, from 8 per cent in 1980. Since deregulation five years ago, the number of banks has more than doubled to 232. Last year was yet another bad one for Brazilian business in general, with inflation at 1,158 per cent and a 1 per cent contraction in the economy but one bank after another reported soaring profits - some increasing by more than 400 per cent in real terms. A study released by London-based credit analysis group IBCA shows that of the 29 largest Brazilian banks only one (the Rio state bank) suffered losses, while the others increased net profits by an average 86 per cent. Return on equity for private banks averaged 15.9 per cent. It is not surprising, therefore, that banks are portrayed as the villains in Brazil's struggle against inflation, often referred to by government members as 'the bloodsuckers'. 'We are easy targets,' says Mr Lener Marangoni, director of Banespa, 'but people should understand we do not create inflation, we simply profit from it.' This they do mainly through channelling private domestic savings to finance government debt in what is known as 'the financial merry-go-round'. Only 5 per cent of the country's money supply is cash, the rest is held in accounts, and over the past decade, as inflation has soared, banks have expanded branch networks to bring in the maximum number of current account depositors. Bradesco, Brazil's largest private bank, has 15m clients, many of whom are unsophisticated. Their money is held at zero interest or a rate less than inflation and used overnight to fund government bonds which pay a far higher rate. Last year, for example, Bradesco paid interest rates of 8 per cent real while receiving 30 per cent real from the Treasury. With banks making most of their money this way, a large question-mark hangs over their future in a non-inflationary environment. Mr Sergio Goldman, an analyst at Baring Securities in Sao Paulo, says: 'We must assume that if inflation were controlled, the financial sector would shrink to around 10 per cent of GDP; which means closures, mergers and a lot of job losses.' One banker admits, 'If inflation fell to say 5 per cent a month, we'd have to close.' But the major banks have undertaken massive restructuring since 1986 when they were caught unawares by the Cruzado plan, which briefly reduced inflation to zero. They have increased productivity by closing unprofitable branches, invested heavily in automation and slashed staff. Bradesco, for example, has reduced staff from 145,000 to 76,000 and Banco Nacional from 37,000 to 20,000. Mr Lazaro Brandao, chief executive of Bradesco, says: 'Today we're convinced we'll survive no matter what.' In some areas, such as cash management, Brazilian banks are the most efficient in the world. Despite Brazil's continental dimensions, cheques are cleared the same day anywhere in the country. Banespa's Mr Marangoni explains, 'Dealing with a situation which can kill you tomorrow makes the antibodies very alert.' He points out that in the US cheques take four days to clear: 'In Brazil, four days means a 10 per cent loss in value.' Moreover, the frequent economic shock plans of the past seven years, most of which altered the rules of the financial system or changed the currency, have forced fast reactions. 'Our banking system is the most agile in the world,' boasts Mr Brandao, pointing out that the Collor Plan of March 1990 doubled the number of accounts overnight by freezing 80 per cent of the nation's assets. Although banks have undoubtedly profited financially from inflation, the high real interest rates, recession and prolonged economic uncertainty have robbed them of their principal activity. Aside from financing government bonds, Brazilian banks have almost ceased lending. Mr Brandao argues: 'It's absurd to say banks like inflation. We lose our function as financial agents because there are no borrowers.' Bradesco, for example, has a loan portfolio of just Dollars 3.3bn, compared with total assets of Dollars 12.7bn. If the economy takes off and inflation is reduced, the loss in lucrative arbitraging possibilities should be partly compensated by a jump in borrowing. Industry has stood still for so long that equipment is outdated and large investments in modernisation and expansion are needed. The main banks are well capitalised so have a high leverage potential. The two largest private banks, Itau and Bradesco, have an equity to assets ratio of 20 per cent. But analysts question whether Brazilian banks still have the know-how for lending after such a long absence. The main hope lies with fees on the wide range of services the banks have been developing. Mr Goldman says they have become 'financial supermarkets - offering commercial banking, investment banking and brokerage under one roof'. Mr Georg Lipsztein, vice-president of Nacional, says: 'All the banks in the world make money through credit and services. Here we make it only through services and these we perform free as inflation means we make on the float.' Mr Goldman points out that 'if Bradesco charged Dollars 1 per client per month, that would be an extra Dollars 15m monthly profits'. But for the moment at least the party is far from over. President Itamar Franco has shown no signs of being able to control inflation, now running at 1,500 per cent a year and the banks are expecting an even better year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         BRAZIL'S LARGEST BANKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     Net income (Dollars m)     Per cent     Return on                         1992      1991         increase       equity  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco do Brasil          447      252            71.7           7.6 Banespa                  156      100            56.2          19.3 Bradesco                 289      162            49.4          11.9 Itau                     223      149            37.8          12.4 Unibanco                  61       50            18.6          10.2 Bamerindus                43       34            25.0           7.2 Nacional                  49       29            63.2          11.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Armenian Ambassador to Russia Feliks Mamikoniyan, who also  took part in the negotiations, told Interfax that the meeting  focused on a package of agreements which had been meant to be  agreed on rather than signed. "As a result, the differences  between the Russian and Armenian sides were settled," the  diplomat pointed out. Mamikoniyan stressed that "Armenia did not  take the role of an supplicant; it was a tough, but good-natured  talk between two partners, each with its own capabilities."    Commenting on the draft bilateral trade and economic  agreement for 1994, Mamikoniyan said "a mechanism for settling  differences was found." The ambassador added that the  differences were over Yerevan's settlements of payments for  Russian clearing deliveries of goods. He said "Armenia has  funds to pay, but the country finds itself in a transportation  blockade."    According to Mamikoniyan, the Russian prime minister spoke  against the proposal by the Russian concern "Roskontrakt" to  transform Armenia's debt for Russian oil worth 40 billion rubles  into Russia's state debt and enable this commercial organization  to independently look for ways to settle the payments issue with  its partners.    Mamikoniyan said the Russian side treated with understanding  the request to grant a humanitarian credit worth 10 billion  rubles to Armenia to enable it to reconstruct the facilities in  the area hit by an earthquake in December 1998. The meeting  also discussed granting 23 out of 40 billion rubles of the  Russian state credit to Armenia in 1993 that have never been  used.    According to Mamikoniyan, Yerevan proposed setting up a  joint  venture with Russia to exploit the Armenian nuclear power  station which is now under reconditioning and prepared for  launch. The two sides agreed to prepare a draft  intergovernmental agreement on the issue.</p>

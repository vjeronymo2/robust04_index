			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall and John Kohut in Beijing] </F>   [Text] One of China's best known dissidents, Wang Dan, has  threatened to go on hunger strike tonight unless the security  forces cease their surveillance and harassment.    Even though Mr Wang left Beijing for his hometown in  Shandong  prior to the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre in order  to avoid police harassment, he was still followed everywhere he  went.    The former student leader, who returned to Beijing on  Sunday,  said he was now "fed up" with constantly being followed and  routinely being called in for questioning by the police.    "Unless I get some kind of guarantee of freedom of movement  from the police, I will stage a hunger strike in protest," he  said yesterday.    Mr Wang said his mother had visited the local police station  yesterday to inform them of his intention but so far they had  received no reply Mr Wang said he had not yet decided how long  his threatened hunger strike would last, adding that its  duration would largely depend on the response from the security  forces.    Many observers predicted, however, that Mr Wang's hunger  strike, if it occurred at all, would probably last no more than  a few days.    "This sounds like just another publicity stunt," a Western  diplomat said, "an attempt to keep human rights on the agenda"  following U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision on Most  Favoured Nation [MFN] trading status. However, the threatened  protest was a sign that while security in the capital had been  generally more relaxed following the June 4 anniversary,  surveillance of key dissidents remained as intense as ever and  was unlikely to be curtailed.    Meanwhile a source close to the family said that dissident  Chen Ziming's health had improved slightly since being released  from prison, but he was still trying to find a doctor to give  him a thorough examination and help him on the road to full  recovery after having served nearly five years of a 13-year jail  sentence.    A family source said the 42-year-old dissident, released  from  prison last month but not allowed to return to his home until  last week, had been given medicine for his many ailments.    Of Mr Chen's troubles, his skin disorder was showing the  biggest improvement though it was far from cured. He was taking  medication for high blood pressure, and heart, stomach and  kidney troubles contracted while in jail.    Mr Chen, convicted by a court of trying to subvert the  Government during the 1989 pro-democracy rallies, was freed in  May on medical parole as part of a Chinese effort to win MFN  renewal.    However, Mr Chen is far from a free man. The source said he  was under 24-hour police guard. Even his family members had to  check through security to enter his apartment. He was not  allowed to answer telephone calls.    "They would never let you in to his apartment," said the  source. Asked about his spirits, the source said: "How can his  mood be good when he can't speak freely?"</p>

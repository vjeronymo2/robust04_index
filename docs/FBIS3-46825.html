			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 27 December, the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry [MITI] made firm its plan to discontinue voluntary  restraints on automobile exports to the United States at the end  of the current fiscal year. MITI has made its decision in  consideration not only of the fact that voluntary export  restraints [VER] have become meaningless due to decreased auto  exports from Japan as a result of expanded local production in  the United States by Japanese automakers, but also of the fact  that it was agreed at GATT's new round of multilateral trade  talks (Uruguay Round) that VER, among other measures, would be  abolished by 1999. In view of expected progress in the  Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks in which the automobile  trade is one of the key issues, MITI plans to make an official  decision as early as January 1994.    To ease Japanese-U.S. trade frictions over automobiles, a  quota of 1.68 million units was imposed on Japan regarding its  VER for fiscal year 1981. The quota was increased to 2.3  million units thereafter, but because actual exports began  dropping after peaking in fiscal year 1986, the quota was cut to  1.65 million units in fiscal year 1992. It has been kept at the  same level for the current fiscal year. Actual automobile  exports, however, remained below the quota from fiscal year 1987  and fell to 1.56 million units in fiscal year 1992. Thus, VER  have become meaningless.    Concerning the quota, MITI has so far maintained that it  "wishes to have the measure abolished because it runs contrary  to the principles of free trade." But MITI has been forced to  continue VER due to expected objections from the U.S. automobile  industry should MITI decide to discontinue them. While local  production of Japanese automobiles in the United States has  increased, however, Japanese export models have weakened in  terms of their price competitiveness due to the yen's  appreciation. The U.S. Big Three automakers have also regained  their competitiveness. Therefore, MITI has judged that Japanese  automobile exports would not increase immediately even if VER  were to be lifted.    Concerning VER, the United States has ostensibly maintained  that "it is a voluntary measure taken by the Japanese automobile  industry, and the U.S. Government has no part in it." It is  said that the issue will not be taken up in negotiations at the  Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks regarding the automobile and  auto parts sector to be settled before the summit meeting in  February. MITI plans to eventually decide to discontinue VER  while monitoring progress in the negotiations, and then to  present its proposal to the U.S. Government.</p>

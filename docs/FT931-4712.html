			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / British Coal to spend Pounds 7m at threatened pit BRITISH COAL is to invest Pounds 7m immediately in Wearmouth colliery, one of 31 collieries threatened with closure. The investment raises hopes among the pit's 800 miners that their jobs will be saved. Wearmouth was one of four pits earmarked for mothballing in October's closure announcement. Some of the Pounds 7m would be retrievable - and transferred to other mines  -if the pit closed. But it is unlikely British Coal would have made the investment unless there was a strong chance of Wearmouth surviving. A white paper is likely to provide measures which will enable at least 10 of the 31 pits to remain open. British Coal yesterday said that last week Wearmouth pushed up output per man per shift to 7.45 tonnes, the first time any pit in north east England has exceeded 7 tonnes. The Pounds 7m investment will allow British Coal to reap further benefit from Pounds 17.5m invested over the last three years at the Sunderland colliery to access coal reserves 2-metres thick. Wearmouth, which has access to up to an estimated 200m tonnes of coal reserves under the North Sea has lost about Pounds 15m this year, as substantial resources have been devoted to development work. The colliery was still not in profit last week because of its heavy investment programme, but its prospects look brighter thanks to access to the new seams, replacing thinner faces 1-metre thick. The Pounds 7m will be spent between this week and the end of May on powered roof supports and other heavy duty equipment. British Coal declined to speculate on whether yesterday's investment announcement meant Wearmouth had a secure future, either under British Coal or as a privatised operation. British Coal believes the pit deputies' union Nacods has failed to secure the 66 per cent vote it needs under its constitution for strike action from its 5,000 members in a secret ballot.</p>

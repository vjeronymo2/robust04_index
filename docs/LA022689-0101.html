			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VANISHING VINYL  </P> <P> You can't stop progress, and I do admit that compact discs can sound pretty  wonderful . . . but surely there is a place for the vinyl record.  </P> <P> I know I am not alone when I ask that the record companies not give up on a  format that has been pretty good to them for nearly 45 years.  </P> <P> I get an empty feeling when I think that vinyl albums are almost obsolete; I  feel like I'm losing a long-time friend. For me, LP albums are like old  baseball cards: There is a sense of history behind every one of them.  </P> <P> CDs and cassettes are now the desired formats in the music industry. It won't  be long before only a few of us Neanderthals are left with only a turntable and  our memories of more innocent days.  </P> <P> MARC PLATT  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

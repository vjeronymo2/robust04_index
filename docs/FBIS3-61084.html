			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alla Glebova and Sergey Tsekhmistrenko under the </F> "Arms Market" rubric: "Russia Regaining a Niche in the World  Arms Market"]    [Text]  <H5>  However, the State Will Trade in Arms </H5>   Mikhail Maley, the chairman of the Interdepartmental  Commission for Scientific-Technical Issues of the Defense  Industry, exclaimed: "The thing has happened that I have dreamed  about for the last two years: Specialized foreign trade  associations (trading in weapons--note by KOMMERSANT) were  removed from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations and placed directly under government  management."    According to information received by the KOMMERSANT  editorial  office, a secret document that as a matter of fact provides for  the creation of a unified state system for trading in arms  manufactured in Russia was signed by the president of Russia in  the middle of November. Until recently, the editorial office did  not have confirmation of the fact that the decision had been  made. Only last week did Aleksandr Shokhin mention the issuance  of the edict at a press conference, and Aleksandr Maley, whom  KOMMERSANT approached for consultation, confirmed the existence  of the document.    As specialists from Maley's commission hope, the restoration  of vigilant state supervision of the now numerous traders in  Russian arms who have already fanned out throughout the world  will help Russia to accomplish a very important task: to regain  the lost markets for arms sales in Eastern Europe, Africa, and  the Near East in the environment of stiff competition and to try  to assert itself in new markets.    As recently as five years ago, Russian weapons had  guaranteed  markets for sales in Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Near East.  However, these markets have virtually been lost because of the  well-known events. Meanwhile, competition in the arms market is  quite keen. Therefore, weapons from the United States, France,  and so on began to be delivered to these regions instead of  Russian weapons (whose exports have fallen by a factor of almost  five in the last three years).    This year, Russia has participated in the largest worldwide  arms exhibitions. Specialists say that the latest Russian  military materiel on display in Ankara, Abu-Dhabi, Dubai, and in  Budapest at the "C+D '93" exhibition which was held last week  "took the buyers' breath away." However, commercial results are  not that impressive. Despite the fact that many countries  (China, Syria, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and others) are  clearly becoming interested in Russian armaments, things did not  develop beyond an expression of interest.    However, this is not the main point either. The specialists  see reductions in output as the root cause of the disorderly  retreat of Russian arms producers from traditional markets for  their sales.    Last week, the Security Council of the Russian Federation  gathered in order to determine the reference points for a new  industrial policy of Russia and to discuss materials on the  situation in the economy based on the results of nine months of  this year, which had already been reviewed by the government.  The "Conversion" section was the smallest, just over half a  page, in a voluminous review prepared by the government staff.  To date, this has been the only attempt to show the defense  industry in the light of facts and trends. It is maintained that  over the period of the year that has ended, the total volume of  production in defense industries dropped 15 percent; the volume  of military output dropped by more than 30 percent, and that of  civilian output--by 10 percent. It turns out that the proportion  of civilian output in the total volume of output of the  military-industrial complex comes to about 80 percent (whereas  in 1988 it was just 44 percent). The number of plants that  manufacture mostly military output continues to decline  steadily, and comes to one-sixth of the total number of  enterprises in the "defense sector."    In short, the "defense sector" is being disarmed quickly,  and  the unknown author of the half-page of text discreetly praises  it for good behavior. However, as eyewitnesses testify, the  things that made the government happy scared members of the  Security Council--they came to the conclusion that the  military-industrial complex is on the brink of technological  peril. Having discussed the submitted papers, members of the  Security Council set forth borderline conditions, the violation  of which would pose a threat to the security of Russia.  <H3>  The Security Council Ordained: There Shall Be a  Military-Industrial Complex </H3>   Mikhail Maley viewed the last meeting of the Security  Council  as a milestone: "Solutions have become possible in Russia...."  In his words, the Security Council essentially gathered in order  to do a simple and understandable thing--finally establish the  reference points for the development of the military-industrial  complex of Russia. Reports on the condition of the defense  industry were made by Andrey Kokoshin, the first deputy minister  of defense, Viktor Glukhikh, the chairman of the State Committee  on the Defense Industry, Viktor Mikhaylov, the minister of  atomic industry, and Yuriy Koptev, the head of the Russian Space  Agency.    The positions of the speakers coincided: It is necessary to  preserve priority technologies; it is impermissible to  discontinue individual types of production which will not be  successfully restored in the future; the opportunity to build up  mobilization capacity in the event of a military threat may not  be lost. A member of the Security Council who wished to remain  anonymous stated: "This is not at all to say that the volume of  arms production should be boosted. It is just that we must not  lose the capability of producing modern tanks or missiles that  are far superior to the potential of foreign military materiel."    It was noted at the meeting of the Security Council that a  disproportionately sharp decline in the defense industry has  been caused primarily by the lack of funding. According to  information from sources close to the Government of Russia, the  debt of the Ministry of Defense to the enterprises of the  military-industrial complex that has piled up over the last few  years has come to 500 billion rubles [R]. Of course, this is of  a different order than the debt of the budget to the defense  complex as a whole (it has already reached several trillion  rubles and, incidentally, likewise has not been paid). However,  economists note that enterprises that produce mainly civilian  products can somehow stay afloat by selling such products.  Unlike those, a majority of enterprises that work almost  exclusively for the Ministry of Defense have no additional  sources of financing and are forced to cut back military  production, primarily outlays on scientific development.  Minister of Finance of Russia Boris Fedorov, who spoke at the  meeting of the Security Council, noted that norms for allowances  for science were set at the level of 5 percent of the military  budget; actually, 3 percent is spent for such purposes. This  means that Russia is running the risk of losing its primacy in  the development of the latest types of weapons which many  world-class specialists acknowledge.    Sources close to the Security Council maintain that the  council may secure a special decision of the president aimed at  supporting the defense industry, however, through changes in the  structure of the military budget rather than through additional  funds. In the words of Mikhail Maley, Boris Yeltsin stated at  the meeting of the Security Council that from now on, 10 percent  of the military budget will be allocated to develop the  industry. The Security Council also demanded that the government  guarantee payments for the arms already ordered by the Ministry  of Defense, and repay debts with the inflation index taken into  account.    Summing up the proceedings of the Security Council, Mikhail  Maley noted that he was particularly happy about the decision to  implement economic reforms in the territories with military  industry clusters under the aegis of the military-industrial  complex: "Comprehensive development programs will be worked out  for the Udmurt, Mari, Chuvash, and Mordvinian Republics, and for  Novgorod and Moscow Oblasts, which will provide for  everything--from weapons exports to the establishment of  bakeries whose equipment will be produced by the  military-industrial complex. According to Mr. Maley, these  programs will be presented at the February meetings of the  Security Council.  <H5>  I Am the State </H5>   The payment of state debts, improvements in conditions for  financing arms producers, supplemental funds for supporting  viable scientific programs in the area of military  technology--all of those may ultimately be considered  investments making it possible for Russia to produce good  weapons, and even the best weapons in the world. The defense  sector should recoup what is invested by boosting arms exports.  Military experts note that the military-industrial complex lived  through all of 1992 with the motto "Make money by selling  weapons." However, in 1992 exports of weapons generated only  $2.3 billion (an estimate by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr  Shokhin; other sources give an even smaller sum--$1.9 billion),  instead of the planned $6 billion, and then under older  contracts. Meanwhile, according to estimates by the same  military specialists, right now Russia may earn $10 billion, or  even more annually by exporting weapons. Experts in the defense  field note that a qualitative change will not occur until  Russian arms stop competing against Russian arms on the world  market.    Until mid-November 1993, as many as four specialized  Spetsvneshtekhnika, Oboroneksport, GUSK, and Promeksport--traded  in Russian weapons. In addition, the right to trade in weapons  was being sought by Voyentekh, which had been established to  sell weapons of old models from the stocks of the Ministry of  Defense. Each specialized association billed itself as a  structure representing state interests, but each was a  departmental structure and for this reason acted in its own  interest. Promeksport, which was established within the  organization of the Russian Federation Committee on the Defense  Industry, advocated the interests of the industrialists;  Voyentekh operated in the interests of the Ministry of Defense.  Spetsvneshtekhnika, Oboroneksport, and GUSK, foreign trade  associations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, were  together looking out for their own interests. Departmental  structures were endowed with equal rights, competed against one  another in foreign markets, drove down prices, and frustrated  the signing of one another's contracts for the delivery of  Russian weapons.    The departmental associations competed and continue to  compete against direct weapons producers, many of whom have been  granted the right to direct access to the market for products  manufactured above state requisitions. For example, the Baykal  company, Izhmash, or the Kalashnikov joint-stock company have  such permits. Until recently, the Tula arms plant also belonged  to this category, but the government permit it had has already  expired.    Finally, spice is also added to this sauce by "foreign"  suppliers of Russian weapons from both the faraway and adjacent  foreign countries, who are also doing a brisk trade in weapons  produced or designed in Russia.    Countries of Eastern Europe have resolved to considerably  reduce their national armies and are now selling off surplus  weapons accumulated by them during their tenure with the Warsaw  Treaty Organization. These surpluses are of Soviet manufacture.  Moreover, still in preperestroyka times, the countries of the  Warsaw Treaty Organization were granted the right to  independently sell some of the products manufactured at local  enterprises, and are now vigorously taking advantage of this  right. Soviet weapons (or spare parts for them) were produced  within the framework of state-to-state cooperation and  "technical assistance"; for example, the production of the  Kalashnikov assault rifle has been established in Poland,  Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Romania.    The export strategy of Moscow was guided by considerations  of  political trends, boosting the positive balance in trade with  African countries which, as it now turns out, are incapable of  paying for the deliveries; its brethren in the socialist camp  have mastered the principles of free competition, by no means  only in theory, and have achieved great success in the more  solvent Asian market.    Weapons specialists note that no modifications have been  made  in the design of weapons over the years in which Soviet licenses  were used. The legendary Mikhail Kalashnikov, who came to the  capital of Hungary for the "C + D'93" small-arms exhibition  studied carefully the models of his namesake automatic weapons  manufactured in Romania and Hungary. He subsequently remarked  that our former allies merely "modified handles and butts to  suit their ethnic specifics." As far as the quality of weapons  produced under licenses is concerned, specialists do not rate it  too favorably. What kind of confidence in the "Kalashnikov"  trademark on the whole may there be, they note, given that  Kalashnikov assault rifles manufactured in China on occasion jam  after the very first burst? This is also one of the reasons why  Russian weapons have begun to lose the battle for the world  market.    As KOMMERSANT experts in patent law say, Russia has  virtually  no opportunity to influence the former member countries of the  Warsaw Treaty Organization in order for them to stop the  production of weapons under licenses. The already mentioned  "Kalashnikov," having been developed by a secret laboratory, is  not protected by any patent; such was the procedure. One thing  remains--to count on buyers sooner or later giving preference to  the acquisition of higher-quality weapons directly from the  original producers anyway.    To be sure, such original producers turned out to be  unexpectedly numerous after the disintegration of the USSR. By  now, Russia has got competitors not only on the banks of the  Vistula and the Oder, but also of the Danube and the  Neman--Ukraine and Belarus, where the main plants producing  equipment for air defense systems and the largest plants for  aircraft and armored vehicle repairs are concentrated. Having  become independent states, these and other republics of the  former USSR are selling piles of the most up-to-date weapons,  which they obtained during the division of the assets of the  Soviet Army.    Specialists note that existing procedures for the issuance  of  licenses have become yet another serious obstacle in the path of  increasing arms exports from Russia. Up until the aforementioned  Yeltsin's edict, the issuance of licenses to export products for  military technical uses was among the responsibilities of the  Main Directorate of Military-Technical Cooperation (GUVTS) of  the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. According to GUVTS  Chief Aleksandr Kotelkin, in addition to an end-user certificate  (to avoid unauthorized re-exports of weapons to third  countries), a government permit, a petition, and an initialed or  signed contract should be filed with the directorate in order to  obtain this license. Mr. Kotelkin noted that, in and of itself,  this procedure is quite logical and justified. However, he  acknowledged that under Russian conditions, seeing the license  through the echelons frequently takes up to nine months.  According to information from Russian weapons traders, the  process of obtaining licenses in some CIS countries is much  simpler and much less time-consuming, which gives exporters from  the republics of the CIS a clear advantage in comparison to  Russians.    Worse still, in Russia the procedure for the issuance of  licenses for weapons applies to the delivery of spare parts.  Specialists from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  consider this feasible; after all, if one has a full set of  components it is not difficult to start the assembly of the  entire object. However, traders note that in many cases the  prolonged waiting period for licenses to export spare parts  interferes with prompt technical services for foreign buyers,  which substantially reduces the competitiveness of Russian  exports. Incidentally, the latest documents of the government do  not fundamentally change anything in the existing licensing  system (one of them is published in this issue of KOMMERSANT).  However, changes are forthcoming in the system of arms trade,  and major changes they are.    The simplest thing that immediately comes to mind would be  to  merge all Russian competitors together, which was actually  done--the Rosvooruzheniya corporation will unite all of the main  weapons traders existing in Russia as of now.    The first attempt to create a unified state company for the  arms trade was made as early as 1991 by Sergey Krasnov, the most  experienced weapons trader in the USSR (for a long time, he  headed the relevant division of the GKES--State Committee for  Economic Cooperation). After the GKES was abolished, the  relevant divisions were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, and Sergey Krasnov was fired by Petr Aven,  the minister of foreign economic relations at the time,  apparently for a bias toward monopolism. Two years later, they  revisited this idea. Boris Yeltsin stated at a meeting of the  Security Council last week that he intends to personally oversee  military-technical cooperation, and ordered that a statute of  the corporation be prepared by 25 December. General Viktor  Samoylov, an adviser to Deputy Prime Minister Shumeyko for  military issues, was appointed acting chief of the  Rosvooruzheniya.    According to Mikhail Maley, the Rosvooruzheniya corporation  will not adhere to strict centralization in the export of  weapons. It will retain jurisdiction over issues on which the  strategy of military-technical cooperation, the delivery of  large batches of arms, and the latest developments hinge. It is  expected that the existing regional associations of arms  producers, such as the "Kalashnikov" joint-stock company, to  which the largest military plants of Udmurtia belong (including  the Izhmash) and the Baykal association, will keep and even  strengthen their status. The federal company will operate in  coordination with them, providing general guidance. However, the  managers and government overseers of the federal structure do  not conceal the fact that the degree of freedom of action for  regional associations will be determined by them, after all,  proceeding from the situation in each segment of the world arms  market.    In a conversation with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, Mikhail  Maley noted that the employees of Spetsvneshtekhnika,  Oboroneksport, and GUSK will be hired to work for the state  corporation only subject to certification. In his opinion, the  Voyentekh and the Promeksport do not have any prospects, whereas  great deeds lie in store for the Rosvooruzheniye company. In his  words, even Andrey Kozyrev, a well-known fighter for compliance  with international agreements, called on Russia to expand arms  exports as he spoke in the Security Council.    As Vitaliy Bokhanov, one of the leading arms specialists of  the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia, noted,  Russian exporters intend to expand their presence in the already  familiar markets of Central Europe, the Near East, and Africa,  which Americans have lately begun to dominate. New markets have  been planned--Southeast Asia, where Russia will have to fight  China for a place in the sun, and Latin America, where the  positions of American producers are also strong.  <H5>  All the Best for Sale </H5>   It is worthwhile to consider the exhibits presented by  Russia  at the two most recent arms exhibitions in Dubai (the United  Arab Emirates) and Budapest (Hungary) precisely from this  standpoint--as an attempt to make [Russia's] presence known in  new arms markets and to revisit those already familiar to  Russian producers.    In the opinion of Russian specialists who participated in  the  exhibition, the Dubai-93 aviation exhibition (which was held  from 7 to 11 November) brought Russian aviation back to the Near  East. Having joined UN sanctions against Iraq, Libya, and the  former union republics of Yugoslavia, Russia deprived itself of  traditional markets for the sale of armaments. The IDEX-93  exhibition in Abu-Dhabi (the United Arab Emirates) which was  held at the beginning of the year heralded the return of Russian  arms to the Near East, but this time from the side of the  Persian Gulf. Out of 30 aircraft that took off there daily, 10  were Russian-made. No contracts have been signed so far, but in  the opinion of the managers of the Aviaeksport joint-stock  company (the organizer of the Russian exhibit), the results  exceeded all expectations.    The Russians demonstrated their most up-to-date weapons at  the Dubai-93 aviation exhibition. The new combat plane Su-35,  which, according to Yuriy Tsupko, the main engineer of the  mass-production plant for the Su-35, "has no analogs throughout  the world because of unique design solutions and technologies,"  had its foreign debut precisely in the skies over Dubai. In  conversations with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, both Soviet and  foreign military specialists noted that the Su-35 displayed  incredible maneuverability, despite the fact that this is the  only combat aircraft whose auxiliary fuel tanks are located in  the tail. The plane is interesting not only as a  state-of-the-art design development: Technologies for the  processing of titanium, lithium, and composite materials in  which Russia has a lead were extensively used in manufacturing  the plane. In addition to the Su-35, which is not being  mass-produced yet, the Su-27, the Su-30 MK, and a couple of  sports Su-29's--a present to the king of the United Arab  Emirates--performed in the skies over Dubai. Even the delivery  of the equipment to the United Arab Emirates was thought-out and  spectacular: En route to the aviation exhibition, the Su-27, the  Su-30 MK, and the Su-35 performed the first Moscow to Dubai  direct flight in the history of Russian aviation, refueling from  a transportation Il-76 in the air.    Russian specialists have just one answer to the question  about the need for such spectacular deeds: the market. Following  the defeat of Saddam Husayn, the market of Persian Gulf  countries is the most favorable for the member countries of the  anti-Iraqi coalition, whose materiel acquitted itself splendidly  in action. The above notwithstanding, Western experts who put  the need of the United Arab Emirates Army for combat planes at  30 refer to the Su-27 as the most likely competitor of the  American F-16 and F-18.    Unlike the United Arab Emirates, which is an arms market new  to Russia, the Budapest exhibit took into account the  circumstance that, after all, Central Europe once was a  permanent buyer of Russian weapons. To this day, the armies of  Eastern Europe are outfitted almost 99 percent with materiel  produced under licenses or on the basis of documentation from  the USSR (although specialists noted joint developments with  third countries which were presented at "C + D '93"). At  present, as this materiel is already becoming obsolete, Russia  offers know-how in the area of its upgrading; a special section  of the exhibit was devoted to this. The former colleagues of  Russia from the Warsaw Treaty Organization simply cannot afford  Western weapons. Russian weapons sellers count on Prague,  Warsaw, or Bucharest volens nolens turning their gaze to the  former "elder brother" again, having postponed the ideas of  re-equipping their armies to NATO standards until better times.    The Russian exhibit at the "C + D '93" in Budapest followed  the policy of presenting the latest types of weapons. Against  the background of other countries' exhibits, the Russian exhibit  looked superb, as was noted by Russian and foreign specialists  alike and the minister of foreign affairs, who visited the  Russian pavilion.    To be sure, as the leaders of the Russian delegation noted  in  private conversations, the brilliance of the Russian exhibit was  also due to the fact that the competition was caught off  guard--"had they known what we were bringing, they would have  prepared better." The competition did not expect the Russian  side to show this extensive selection of products without  analogs on the world market at an exhibition which is being  organized for the first time and so far does not have a  sufficiently weighty reputation among specialists.    Nonetheless, the latest accomplishments of the domestic  designer thought in the area of small arms, hand-held antitank  systems, and individual protective equipment were shown in the  main Russian pavilion organized by the GUSK. The following were  presented internationally for the first time: the 9-millimeter  Baksan submachine gun (Russian gun producers pin great hopes  specifically on this caliber, because it fits NATO standards),  the 12.3-millimeter Udar revolver system, the original firearm  system consisting of the AKS-74U assault rifle with grenade  launcher attachments and the GP-25 grenade launcher mounted  under the barrel, and the hunting carbines 6P18 (7.62  millimeters), Berkut (7.62 millimeters), and Sobol (5.66  millimeters). Visitors to the exhibition could also familiarize  themselves with the models of weapons without analogs elsewhere  in the world which had already been displayed in Abu-Dhabi and  Ankara, such as the APS submersible assault rifle (5.66  millimeters), the SPP-1m submersible pistol (4.5 millimeters),  the PSS pistol (7.62 millimeters), the AS assault rifle (9.0  millimeters), and the PSS sniper rifle (9.0 millimeters) with  silencers; the improved-effectiveness Gyurza pistol; the RPG-29  shoulder-fired antitank grenade launcher and the RPG-27  rocket-propelled antitank grenade. Some specialists, in  particular Vitaliy Bokhanov, one of the leaders of the Russian  delegation, believe that in the future, it will be precisely the  sale of antitank systems (they are manufactured by the NPO  [Scientific Production Association] Bazalt), which will dominate  the Russian exports of close-range weapons.    The Kub Association of Aid to Entrepreneurship represented  at  the exhibition the interests of a number of enterprises  enterprises [as published] of the military-industrial complex of  the Urals Region--the Motovilikhinskiye Zavody joint-stock  company, the Permskiye Motory, the Inkar, the Nytva  metallurgical plant and the Kamensk-Uralskiy foundry. In a  conversation with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, Igor Lazukov,  executive director of the association, stressed that  participation in the "C + D '93" is both the first foreign  venture by Kub and its first military experience. Products  manufactured by people from the Urals--the Uragan and Smerch  artillery systems, aircraft engines for civilian aviation and  the air force, bimetallic rolled metal sheets for the production  of cartridges--were geared specifically toward consumers from  the Central European countries.    Participation in the exhibition became the swan's song for  GUSK: Under the edict that has already been mentioned  repeatedly, it became a part of the Rosvooruzheniya company  established under the president. Although GUSK technically does  not exist anymore, the task of breaking into the world markets  for small arms and some other close-range weapons still remains  topical, according to Aleksandr Semenov, the general director of  the Russian exhibit at "C + D '93" and GUSK deputy chief. Russia  does not intend to be content with a secondary status in this  struggle.    For now, it is premature to talk about the commercial  effectiveness of Russia's participation in the "C + D '93,"  despite the high grades given to the Russian exhibit by foreign  specialists. There were virtually no official delegations in  Budapest; for this reason, the interests of potential customers  were represented mostly by intermediary companies that are not  authorized to sign contracts. However, the Russian side did not  count on instant success to begin with. As Mr. Semenov noted, by  participating in the exhibition, Russia strove to show that,  despite the complex period that the country is going through,  its "defense sector" has overcome the stagnant condition  characteristic of recent years, and that its products, despite  the opinion of the competition, are quite up to world standards  and are even superior to them.    [Boxed item]  <H5>  Foreigners Finance the Russian Military-Industrial Complex </H5>   At present, the Su-35, the most advanced combat plane in the  world, carries the trademark of the Tesmo-Don-Gulf company. Givi  Papiashvili, who came from Soviet Georgia, founded a company by  this name in Dubai. This trading company intends to accomplish  programs for the placement in the United Arab Emirates market of  not only the Su's, but also the largest helicopters with the  greatest load-lifting capacity in the world, the Mi-26's. Mr.  Papiashvili will receive profits from his investment activities  only after contracts are signed.    Experts are inclined to believe that two years of efforts by  the Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau to return to the Near East  will be crowned with success after the Dubai-93 aviation  exhibition. American interests will also be taken into account  in this case, because the Su-27 will most likely be outfitted  with American airborne equipment. [End of boxed item]    [Boxed item]  <H5>  Russian Businessmen Are Also Prepared To Pay </H5>   Vladimir Kastyrin, who heads the Moscow Airways joint-stock  company, made a sensation in Dubai. He stated that he was buying  50 Be-32 planes produced by the imeni Beriyev Taganrog  Scientific and Technical Aviation Complex (TANTK). Moreover, as  a KOMMERSANT correspondent learned, the first Be-32 presented in  Dubai is already the property of Moscow Airways and was built  with its funds.    So far, Moscow Airways has been the only Russian air carrier  company that has dared to finance the domestic aircraft  industry. Mr. Kastyrin believes that, to be sure, it is  necessary to turn to the West; however, the main point is not to  lose the promising domestic market for air carriers. It is  profitable to develop the latter only through using the  relatively cheap Russian equipment.    Mr. Kastyrin said: "We need the Be-32 as the Chinese need  rice. This plane is extremely versatile: It can use virtually  any surface as an airfield (including water and ice). This plane  is inexpensive (its base price is $2.4 million), convenient, and  indispensable in environments lacking roads, such as Russia,  Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula."    In Dubai, representatives of the Aeroconsulting private  company, the Irkutsk aviation plant, the imeni Beriyev TANTK,  the Aviaeksport joint-stock company and the Moscow Airways  joint-stock company announced their intention to form a  consortium to mass-produce the Be-32 by the middle of 1995.  According to Nikolay Sharlau, the ideologist of the creation of  the concern and director of the Aeroconsulting company, it is  planned to manufacture five Be-32's in 1995, as many as 24 in  1996, and subsequently 50 aircraft annually. Vladimir [as  published] Sharlau said: "The government is preparing a decree  'On the Implementation of a Program for the Mass Production,  Sale, and Operation of the Commuter Airline Plane Be-32.'  However, this will be merely moral support for the Be-32  program. For the first time, not a kopek of state funds will be  used to organize the mass production of a plane." The program  will be profitable if 500 aircraft are manufactured with the  last delivery date in 2004. [End of boxed item]</p>

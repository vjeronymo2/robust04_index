			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Bulls cheer the 'January effect' - Wall Street with a sudden and remarkable upward surge in US stock markets. The rally which started just before the Christmas holiday was sustained right the way through to 1992, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising by nearly 9 per cent between December 19 and New Year's Eve, from 2914.36 to a new record of 3168.83. While the momentum of the advance has slowed this week, the Dow still managed small advances on Thursday and Friday morning. The remarkable about-turn in market sentiment from pre-Christmas gloom was reminiscent of the Dow's sudden upward charge last January on the outbreak of the Gulf War, when it became clear that Western technological superiority would make that conflict brief. But the reason for the year-end rally was utterly different. The Federal Reserve's one percentage point cut in the discount rate on December 20 transformed investor sentiment for the better - and fund managers did not want to be left behind in the rush into equities. The result was a 1991 gain in the Dow of 535.17 points, or 20.3 per cent, while the broader Standard &amp; Poors 500 index was up 86.87 points, or 26 per cent. Smaller stocks,which often perform better than large capitalisation companies when coming out of recession, did even better, with the Nasdaq Composite Index ending the year with a gain of 212.5 points, or 56.8 per cent. The question now is whether the upward momentum can continue, or whether December's rally has simply anticipated the 'January effect' - the historic propensity for stock markets to post strong advances in the early months of the year. The bull case is that the Fed's aggressive easing demonstrates that the central bank is prepared to do whatever it takes to get the flagging economy moving. The Wall Street consensus is that by the middle of the year the economy will be expanding, albeit at a more modest pace than after most post-war recessions. Throw in a mildly stimulative economic package at the end of this month from the White House, plus the probability that George Bush will be re-elected in November's presidential election, and the stage could be set - say the bulls  -for a prolonged period of rising equity prices, interspersed with modest corrections. The most optimistic analysts believe 1992 could see stock market gains rivalling those of the past year - up to 15 or 20 per cent on the Dow, carrying it towards 4,000. A dwindling band of Cassandras, many of them technical analysts, believe this is a fool's rally and the stage is merely being set for a plunge in the Dow towards 2,600 as the US enters a severe 'double dip' recession. A majority of Wall Street's pundits is probably cautiously optimistic, fully expecting an economic recovery but concerned that, as in the early months of 1991, the market is in danger of getting ahead of itself, anticipating too much good news. Certainly, the news of the past week has been mixed and shows little economic or corporate evidence of an early recovery. The National Association of Purchasing Managers Index fell below 50 per cent in December for the first time in six months - indicating a contracting manufacturing base. True, figures for sales of existing houses showed a 5.7 per cent year-on-year gain in November, showing that low interest rates are starting to get that market moving. Yet any strong recovery in housing and other key sectors, such as automobiles, will be dependent on an improvement in consumer sentiment, and the much-followed confidence index produced by the Conference Board was virtually unchanged in December from November's insipid reading. Yet that in itself may be mildly encouraging, since it suggests that confidence may at least have touched bottom. Sluggish Christmas sales claimed a large corporate victim this week when Zales, the largest jewellery retail chain in the US, announced that it was closing 400 of its 2,000 outlets and stopping payments to its creditors as part of a financial restructuring which, many analysts believe, will involve a passage through the bankruptcy courts. Zales, which was acquired in 1986 by a Canadian company, Peoples Jewellers, and Swarovski International of Switzerland, had been ailing financially for months and sent early warning signals of its problems in early December when it missed an interest payment. The company forecast that good Christmas sales would enable it to meet the payment before a grace period ended last Thursday. In the event, Christmas sales were awful - down more than 10 per cent on 1990 - prompting this week's drastic action. But Zales may be just the first in a string of retailers - some large, but many small - finally driven to the brink of bankruptcy by this singularly unfestive, festive season.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monday       3163.91  +62.39 Tuesday      3168.83   +4.92 Wednesday    Closed Thursday     3172.41   +3.58 Friday       3201.48  +29.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

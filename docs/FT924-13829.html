			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / SA government to meet Inkatha soon MR FW de Klerk, the South African president, said yesterday that government officials would meet the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party within a fortnight, removing one of the most serious obstacles to the resumption of multi-party talks on a new constitution. Delivering a 'state of the nation' address to a special session of parliament in Cape Town, he stressed his determination to proceed with constitutional talks with the ANC and other parties, including Inkatha which suspended talks with the government two weeks ago. He lashed out, however, at the ANC shortly after thousands of its protesters surrounded the parliament building, demanding that it scale down its campaign of mass action which he blames for exacerbating political violence. The ANC demonstration, called to protest at continued exclusion of blacks from parliament and at government plans to amnesty police and army officers, was much smaller than expected, with only about 5,000 people taking part. Organisers had expected 25,000. South African Communist party veteran Joe Slovo addressed the crowd. 'We want this place closed down and replaced by a people's parliament. The people have no vote here. The only parliament you can participate in is the parliament of the streets,' he said.</p>

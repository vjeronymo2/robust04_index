			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL EXHIBITION SERIES REPORTEDLY OFF  </P> <P> The Angels' opening series of spring training against the San Diego Padres in  Yuma, Ariz., will be canceled, according to sources who declined to be  identified.  </P> <P> Even though negotiators for baseball's players and owners will continue to meet  through the weekend in New York, several sources said Friday that it's too late  to save the first four games in Yuma March 2-5.  </P> <P> Yuma Mayor Bob Tippett said the lost series will cost the city about $2  million.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, it's something we anticipated," Tippett said. "It's too bad,  because we had the Saturday and Sunday games (March 3-4) sold out. We just hope  it doesn't get any worse."  </P> <P> Although no one has provided a specific timetable for spring training should  there be an agreement, several baseball officials said Friday that they have  been advised it will take at least 12 days after a settlement before games are  played.  </P> <P> The commissioner's office has informed clubs that players will be allowed at  least five days, but probably a week, to report to camp once a settlement is  reached. Then there is the matter of practice time before a game can be  scheduled.  </P> <P> "The general rule of thumb is that they will be given 10 days of practice time  before playing games," said Jack McKeon, Padre manager and vice  president/baseball operations. "That could be shortened by a couple of days,  but that's about it."  </P></p>

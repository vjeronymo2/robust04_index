			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures produced another strong advance, applying clear upward pressure to the cash market throughout a busy afternoon, writes Jeffrey Brown. The market drifted through most of the morning session with few houses prepared to take the lead. But the moment the latest US inflation figures bounced on to the screens, it was every man for himself. The FT-SE 100 December contract shot ahead with the premium to cash equities widening again to 30 points. At the official 4:10pm close, the contract was 55 points higher at 3,169 after touching a high for the day of 3,179. At this level the premium to the cash market was 27.1 points with the fair value premium standing at around 13 points. Heavily concentrated into the afternoon session, trading volume was heavy at 16,146 contracts, against less than 14,000 at the official close on Wednesday. Traded option volume also moved up strongly, rising to 58,530 lots from 48,750 a day earlier. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for 26,600 lots. Hanson was by far the busiest individual stock option, turning over 5,103 lots - the highest volume for a single option for some weeks. Guinness and Cable and Wireless were also actively traded.</p>

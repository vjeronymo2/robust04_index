			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS GRAPPLE WITH THE DROUGHT  </P> <P> What I find most disturbing in your article on California's drought (front  page, April 1) is that the officials at MWD seem to be surprised that we are  running short of water.  </P> <P> For years now MWD has been openly supportive of the extraordinary growth in  Southern California as though there was an unlimited supply of water.  </P> <P> Never once have they suggested that we should limit our growth to ensure that  we have an adequate supply of water to meet future demand. Even now when they  are on the verge of rationing water, MWD officials are still not suggesting  that we attempt to plan California's growth.  </P> <P> At our present growth rate, this year's 12% water shortage is equivalent to the  amount of water that three years of Southern California's growth uses. After  the 1977 drought if our water officials had recommended that we start planning  our growth instead of just accommodating it, we would not be facing the severe  water shortage we are today.  </P> <P> BOB ROWLAND  </P> <P> Hemet  </P></p>

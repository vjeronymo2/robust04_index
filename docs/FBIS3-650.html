Speaking on SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  television, he said: "We had a specific request not to deploy  the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) in the area." Troops  from the farming community were therefore sent into Mmabatho.    Gen Viljoen said he was aware the AWB had arrived in  Bophuthatswana but after discussions with the Bophuthatswana  government he had, at 4.45 AM Friday, asked the AWB to withdraw.    He was aware that a political, and not military, solution  was  needed in Bophuthatswana but the territory needed stability for  that to take place.    The Bophuthatswana government should be allowed to make a  decision about the territory's continued independence without  being intimidated, he said.</p>

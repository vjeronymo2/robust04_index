			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE DISCOVERY CAME BACK TO GARAGE IN MINT CONDITION  </P> <P> A preliminary inspection of Discovery indicates that it returned from its  five-day mission apparently in better condition than any space shuttle ever  had, with only 10 of its thermal protection tiles in need of replacement, NASA  officials said Sunday.  </P> <P> They said the tires, brakes and engines also performed well.  </P> <P> "We need to go back and look" at mission records, "but I doubt if we could even  find one that looks this good," said Discovery Flow Director Tip Talone, who  coordinates processing of the orbiter for each flight.  </P> <P> A day after Discovery landed, technicians said they counted only 82 "hits" on  Discovery's tiles and only 15 were bigger than one inch, said Jay Honeycutt,  director of shuttle management and operations at Kennedy Space Center in  Florida.  </P> <P> The previous shuttle mission ended with 707 debris hits on the orbiter.  </P> <P> Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure monitor snapped  as the right main landing gear dropped, said Cindy Lodge, a director for the  shuttle tile system that shields orbiters from the fiery re-entry. Only one of  those five tiles will need to be replaced, she said.  </P> <P> The two 10-inch wires and printed circuit board from the pressure monitor were  found on the runway.  </P> <P> Talone said the wires, which run down the landing gear strut, apparently got  tangled and yanked the circuit board out when the gear came down.  </P> <P> Discovery blasted off Monday from Kennedy Space Center and in six hours  accomplished its major goal, deploying a $100-million Tracking and Data Relay  Satellite.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Nikolayev, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA </F> correspondent: "The Zhayrem Knot: Who Will Cut It?"]    [Text] Zhayrem--this is the location of a group of deposits  of lead, zinc, silver, manganese, and rare metals that is unique  in scale. There were plans in the USSR Government to create the  country's largest polymetallic combine here. Zhayrem was a  directive construction site of the last Soviet five-year plans  and the main theme of numerous decrees at the highest level.  Sovereign Kazakhstan organized a free economic zone here, and  these places were visited repeatedly by foreign firms with  intentions to invest their capital. But everything ended up with  the fact that, unexpectedly for the collective of the  joint-stock company Sary-Arkhapolimetall, 51 percent of the  shares were sold at a coupon auction.    This caused a shock in Zhayrem. Fazylzhan Sadvakasov, the  president of the joint-stock company, made an urgent flight to  Almaty, where he tried to have a talk with Goskomimushchestvo  [State Committee for the Administration of State Property]  regarding the "hasty" privatization of the enterprise without  wide publicity and an individual project. An appeal to  parliament and the president was approved at a stockholders'  meeting concerning a restoration of violated laws and decrees of  the government and the provisions of the state committee itself.  After all, there was no mention of the Zhayrem ore-dressing  combine in any of the published lists submitted at the auction  of products. Nor was the cost of the charter fund evaluated,  which was determined according to the status of April of last  year and amounted to a total of 16 million tenge, while the real  current price is tens of millions of dollars.    This haste could have been explained if the combine were  chronically unprofitable and a completely hopeless enterprise.  But this is not the case at all. For example, last year the  production of polymetallic ores was halted because of shipment  distances and the unprofitableness of its processing. But a  demand for manganese emerged, and the production was reprofiled.  At that time, 84,000 tonnes were produced, and this year it is  planned to extract seven times more from the earth. But the main  thing is that ore consumers were found in Kazakhstan. It was  requested by the Karmetkombinat, the Yermakovkiy ferro-alloys  plant, and the Zhambylskiy chemical industry, which gave the  practically stalled extraction a second wind. Also for the first  time in recent years, the Sary-Arka Polymetall joint-stock  company will acquire a solid profit. But in order to cover fully  the growing demand of the republic for manganese and to come out  on the foreign market, it is necessary to build a factory at a  cost of $50 million. And if three times more is added to this to  erect this kind of a factory for the processing of polymetallic  ores, then it will be possible to restore the main production  and make it profitable.    Who will invest these sums, when 46 percent of the shares  were acquired by Kazpotrebsoyuz? If Zhayrem proved to be not  affordable for the former powerful Ministry of Nonferrous  Metals, the present Ministry of Industry, and the Aksunkar  holding company, then where will the resources and forces be  gotten for the consumer cooperative? Its privatization funds  bought shares of Zhayrem, as Sadvakasov told me, after  submitting applications the night before the auction, without  even becoming familiar with the large economic activity ahead of  time.    However, this is their right, and I have nothing against  Kazpotrebsoyuz. There is concern only that one of the most  important enterprises in the republic, which started to come out  of the crisis independently, will become an object of discord,  will not get a reliable manager, and, consequently, that no one  will cut its knot of problems.</p>

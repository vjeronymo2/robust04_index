			<p>SUMMARY                                 Pyongyang has rejected a UN Security Council presidential  statement calling for North Korean compliance with International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) requests concerning the refueling of  one of its nuclear reactors in Yongbyon.  At the same time, the  North Koreans are continuing to maintain that they are taking  measures to preserve the possibility of verifying the  nondiversion of nuclear fuel.  In rejecting the UN statement,  Pyongyang also conspicuously failed to call for talks with the  United States and coupled its rejection of the statement with a  renewed warning of dire consequences if UN sanctions are imposed  on North Korea.                                     END SUMMARY   Pyongyang used the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry  spokesman's statement to reject as "entirely unjust" a 30 May UN  Security Council presidential statement calling for the  acceptance of IAEA requests to segregate selected spent fuel rods  for future measurement (Pyongyang radio, 1 June).  The statement  contained no hints that North Korea would stop or even slow down  the current refueling activities at Yongbyon.  Moreover,  appearing to underscore Pyongyang's realization of the  seriousness of the situation, the statement did not even mention  the possibility for future DPRK-U.S. talks, as its most recent  pronouncements have done.   Pyongyang seems to be combining its rejection of the UN statement  with a renewed threat to withdraw decisively from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).  Suggesting that this is the case,  the statement darkly warned that the DPRK will "free itself from  the restrictions of an unreasonable framework" (l) if the IAEA  declares that the technical feasibility of ascertaining past  nondiversion of nuclear material is lost or (2) if the Security  Council even "threatens" to impose sanctions.  The statement went  further to intimate that if either of these contingencies were to  materialize, Pyongyang would resume "peaceful nuclear  activities"--presumably by starting to reprocess discharged fuel.   At the same time, the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement  claimed that Pyongyang is working to maintain nuclear  transparency and tried to blame "some officials of the IAEA  secretariat" and "some [UN] member states" for bringing about the  current crisis.   -- Past nondiversion.  Reiterating Pyongyang's past claim that it  cannot accept IAEA requests for segregating selected fuel rods  for future measurement, the statement again insisted that North  Korea's method of storing discharged fuel rods makes their future  measurement technically feasible.  The statement claimed that  IAEA representatives had agreed earlier to "seriously study" the  efficacy of the North Korean method and to "continue  discussions," but that the IAEA reneged on that agreement by  referring the matter to the Security Council.  The statement  justified the "rather fast speed" of the fuel withdrawal  operation as "necessary" to "test the maximum efficiency" of the  refueling machine.   -- Current nondiversion.  The statement claimed that the IAEA had  confirmed that none of the current batch of fuel rods "had been  diverted to another purpose" and that the current refueling is  being conducted under IAEA surveillance, either in the presence  of agency inspectors or under IAEA-installed cameras.   Implications     The latest Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement reflects Pyongyang's apparent calculation that the IAEA  and Washington would be reluctant to forego the possibility of  ensuring future nondiversion of nuclear material--which the  imposition of economic sanctions could lead to--for the sake of  determining whether North Korea has diverted nuclear materials in  the past.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Masato Ishizawa, staff writer: ``Toyota Sells </F> the Secret of Its Success'']    [Text] Toyota Motor Corp.'s world-renowned production  system has helped it sell more passenger cars than any other  automaker. Now, the company has decided to sell some of the  secrets of this key process.    In late October, Toyota joined with Mitsui Engineering &amp;  Shipbuilding Co. to set up a subsidiary, Toyota Caelum Inc., to  market computer-aided design and manufacturing systems  (CAD/CAM), which allow engineers to not only design products but  to control manufacturing processes.    Toyota Caelum -- which has been formed from Toyota Motor's  Caelum division -- is also negotiating with Ford Motor Co. to  sell graphic displays, which are used to make blueprints of car  bodies and engines, said the subsidiary's president, Iwao  Isomura.    The computer systems, run on engineering workstations or  personal computers, were originally developed by Toyota's  systems engineers and have been used at the automaker's domestic  and overseas plants as well as at its parts suppliers.  <H5>  Choice of Dimensions </H5>   The systems offer both two- and three-dimensional software.  The 3-D version, of course, allows easier design of machinery  and electric appliances and can be linked with computer-aided  engineering, computer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided  testing software.    Toyota says the systems allow users to readily grasp the  design process, from development through production, and  encourage quality control, allowing structural and material  changes to be incorporated without having to rework the entire  process.    The systems also have allowed engineers from both Toyota and  its parts suppliers to directly exchange data and cooperate in  the development of passenger cars.    Said Hiromi Araki, chief executive officer at Toyota Caelum,  ``Our system is different from other CAD/CAM software because it  accounts for factors peculiar to stamp-pressing and molding,  such as the resiliency of materials to shrinkage.''    He also said that unlike other CAD/CAM systems, many of  which  have been designed for the production of small volumes of  airplanes, the Toyota Caelum system can be used in the  manufacture of large volumes of products of uniform quality.    Not the least of the new subsidiary's goals is earning money  through the sale of computer systems.    ``We have separated the computer-system division from Toyota  and started to aggressively sell the system to non-group firms  in order to generate funds to develop (even more) upgraded  systems,'' Araki said. Because revenue from the Caelum division  was only a small part of Toyota's huge sales, the division has  been unable to acquire sufficient funds and talented systems  engineers.    Actually, Toyota began selling output from Caelum -- which  stands for Computer-Aided Engineering Leading Ultimate  Manufacturing -- to other firms in electric appliance and  machinery industries in 1989. With the growing need in Japanese  industry to cut research and development costs, sales of the  computer system grew more than 20&percnt; year on year.    In the next five years, the subsidiary plans to boost sales  to firms outside the Toyota group from 20&percnt; of all sales  to more  than 50&percnt; and expand annual sales from &yen;5.5 billion to  &yen;10.5 billion, the company said.    Through the subsidiary, Toyota will also offer consulting  services to improve production efficiency. But many Toyota  officials are concerned that some of the company's key  technology may be leaked with the sale of the computer systems.</p>

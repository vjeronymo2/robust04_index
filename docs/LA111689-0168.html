			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS VOCAL QUINTET DEFINITELY HAS A NEW YORK STATE OF MIND;  </P> <P> JAZZ: NEW YORK VOICES TACKLES MUSIC RANGING FROM JOHN COLTRANE TO ARETHA  FRANKLIN, WHICH IS JUST FINE WITH ITS LEADER.  </P> <P> New York Voices, the quintet playing at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood  through Sunday, has lofty ambitions. Sure, the singers interpret jazz classics  from Monk's "Round Midnight" to Ellington's "Caravan." Granted, they mixed Bach  with bossa in the wordless "Baroque Samba" and have dipped into pop with words  to the Yellowjackets' "Top Secret."  </P> <P> Can they have it both ways? Which audience are they aiming at? Why do their  lyrics range from socially significant ("National Amnesia") to utterly bland  ("Come Home")?  </P> <P> Ask Darmon Meader, the group's leader. As composer and arranger of much of  their material, vocal improviser and saxophonist, he plays a significant role  in determining the quintet's direction.  </P> <P> "We all have different backgrounds," he said. "Consequently you hear various  influences and styles at work. I'm at one extreme with my experience as a jazz  instrumentalist. Caprice Fox has done a lot of R&amp;B, also some workshops  with Bobby McFerrin. Peter Eldridge had classical training, but his background  is ridiculously wide, from early classics up to rock 'n' roll. Kim Nazarian and  Sara Krieger both have had theatrical experience. You add those up and you kind  of get what we do."  </P> <P> The fivesome is logically named. All the members except Krieger studied at  Ithaca College in Upstate New York. In the summer of 1986, the school was  invited to take an alumni vocal unit to play at such European events as the  North Sea Jazz Festival.  </P> <P> "I was well prepared. For a few years after graduating I'd done resort gigs and  explored the vocal jazz idiom as a performer and writer," said Meader. "We were  a big hit in Europe, and back home, four of the six of us decided to form a  similar group. We needed one more female voice, and Sara, who had been doing  her own thing in New York City for 10 years, joined us in the fall of '87."  </P> <P> A contract with GRP Records set the quintet on the road to public awareness.  Their first album, released last May, has moved slowly but surely up to the Top  10 on the Billboard jazz chart; meanwhile, as calls for dates improved, the  quintet went to Europe last month.  </P> <P> "The Berlin Jazz Festival was a great experience," said Meader. "We'd been  accustomed to playing mostly smaller clubs, so it was nice to be part of  something on a grand scale, at the Philharmonic, along with people like Mel  Torme and Abbey Lincoln. The reception over there is amazing. They can be very  demanding and very critical, but when they like you it's truly exciting."  </P> <P> Unlike the precedent-setting Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross trio, New York  Voices generally avoids the customary practice of setting words to what were  originally recorded jazz solos. In "Caravan," for example, Meader has a long  improvised passage that resembles just such a solo, though in fact he devised  the melody himself.  </P> <P> "As a saxophone player I base some of the writing on my own improvisational  style," he said. "We don't want to duplicate what Manhattan Transfer did on the  'Vocalese' album."  </P> <P> New York Voices is evidently finding its own avenue to success. New  arrangements include John Coltrane's "Giant Steps," Tadd Dameron's "Lady Bird"  and Aretha Franklin's "Chain of Fools."  </P> <P> Are they or are they not a jazz group at heart? The answer can be found in  those titles: Jazz, it would seem, is a New York vocal state of mind.  </P></p>

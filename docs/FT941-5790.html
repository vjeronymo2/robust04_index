			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BBA sells plastics offshoots for Pounds 25m BBA, the engineering and motor components group, yesterday embarked on the first stage of a wide-ranging disposal programme with the sale of three engineering businesses to United Industries, the precision tools and springs manufacturer. The move follows the group's decision to focus on four core businesses and sell up to 12 subsidiaries with a combined turnover of Pounds 200m. United, in which BBA holds a 21.23 per cent stake, has agreed to pay Pounds 25m cash for Holden Hydroman, Perplas and Railko - all manufacturers of plastic and polyurethane components. The Leicester-based group said the acquisitions, funded by a Pounds 26m placing and open offer, would transform it from a small specialist company with a market capitalisation of Pounds 6m into an operation worth more than Pounds 40m. Mr Tom Brown, United's chief executive, confirmed that BBA would be taking part in the 1-for-5 offer - involving a total of 186m new ordinary shares at 15p each - to maintain its existing stake. 'This is a mutually beneficial deal to both companies. It allows us to grow and BBA to refocus,' said Mr Brown. BBA, which is expected to report annual profits before tax and exceptional items of about Pounds 54m (Pounds 47.4m) next Monday, also welcomed the transaction. Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, said the group intended to concentrate of improving profitability of its automotive, industrial and aviation operations. The former BBA companies, which made a combined operating profit of Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 828,000) in 1993, are expected to bolster profits at United, which admitted that it had been struggling to overcome the effects of recession. United incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.5m on sales of Pounds 19.2m in the nine months to December 31 last year, against a deficit of Pounds 3.63m on sales of Pounds 29.6m in the 12 months to April 3. United warned that it would not be paying a final dividend for the second successive year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Viola Herms Drath: "The Test Case for Clinton's </F> European Policy Is the Unsolved Bosnian Conflict"]    [Text] When President Clinton pays tribute to the veterans  of World War II half a century after the landing of the allied  troops in Normandy, he will also be confronted with the basic  issue of the U.S. commitment in Europe and Washington's notions  of the Western security policy. When the Allies liberated  Europe, the U.S. leadership role was as undisputed, as it was in  the postwar era when the continent was being stabilized. Today,  the voices that deplore the leadership vacuum of Washington as  the only superpower left cannot only be heard in the U.S.  Congress, but also in European capitals.    In the past, the leading role played by the United States  ensured the implementation of a security policy system that  brought peace but led to the division of Europe. Meanwhile, the  question is being asked more and more audibly of how U.S.  interests should be defined, given the Clinton administration's  declining global commitment and the reorganization of Europe.  In the context of the offer made to the East European states of  a Partnership for Peace, not only Russia's role in a  pan-European peace order is at issue in the United States, but  also Germany's position.    The U.S. President, who during his trip to Europe will visit  Rome, Paris, London, Oxford, and Cambridge, will undoubtedly  feel more at ease in places where protest demonstrations against  the Vietnam War during his university years took place than on  the battlefield of the veterans. This holds all the more true  since confidence in Clinton's foreign policy has increasingly  declined following the failure in Somalia, the zigzag course in  Bosnia and Haiti, his backing down on human rights in favor of  trade interests in China, the refusal of India and other nuclear  threshold countries to support the renewal of the expiring  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and the unsuccessful  intervention against North Korea's nuclear policy. No more than  53 percent of Americans are still satisfied with his performance.    Clinton continues to place his foreign policy stakes on the  propagation of democracy, economic progress, and a security  policy that is adjusted to reality. However, the primacy of  active multilateralism at the UN level has already lost much of  its weight. Despite a one-sided Russia policy, in the framework  of which Washington has mobilized $4.1 billion for Moscow's  reform programs, the White House has become increasingly aware  that the relevant basic security and economic policy decisions  for East Europe will in the future be made on the Bonn-Moscow  axis to a much larger extent.    The real test case for the United States' European policy is  the unsolved Balkan conflict. It is true that Clinton agreed to  case-by-case air raids at UN request, but he left no doubt about  the fact that U.S. troops would not be sent to the war area.  Even though the early recognition of Croatia by the European  Union, which had been engineered by Germany, has met with  considerable criticism, the U.S. Administration is seeing an  encrusted position in the current situation, which will thwart  every endeavor by Bonn to bring about a European balance in the  Balkans.    Washington is still divided on Germany's position in Europe  and the world. If the Federal Government, in the interest of  consensus, maintains a low profile, it is accused of neglecting  the alliance's interests. If Bonn assumes a leadership role,  people will soon speak about the reemergence of hegemonic  aspirations that are allegedly manifesting themselves in a  presumed sphere of influence from the Baltics to the  Mediterranean.    Even the Clinton team, which is largely focused at domestic  policy matters, is beginning to see that the United States  cannot dodge its leadership obligations in foreign policy. It  is true that at the NATO summit Clinton corroborated the  presence of 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe. But, given the  reserved attitude regarding their mission, it remains an open  question whether these U.S. forces can be assigned a European  defense task.    What is certain is the fact that U.S. leadership is  indispensable for solving global problems, just as European  problems cannot be solved without Germany. Washington's divided  attitude toward its partner Germany is also reflected by the  fact that 50 years after D-Day, the victor powers still consider  it necessary to exclude the former enemy from ceremonies  intended to mark reconciliation and solidarity.    With the argument that there is "no magic formula" for the  assessment of national interests and no ready solution to many  regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts, Clinton is seeking to  stress the difference between the world war generation fighting  for democracy and freedom and the challenges to policymakers  today. The U.S. President is still trying to prove his  leadership claim through steadfastness and efforts to define  clear goals.</p>

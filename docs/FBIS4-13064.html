			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Ali Nun] </F>   [Text] London--Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman of the  Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, told AL-HAYAH yesterday that  "the principle of reciprocal treatment is approved by all  secular and religious laws. When Israeli Prime Minister Rabin  stops killing our children and women, Hamas will then stop  attacking Israeli civilians and commit itself to attacking  soldiers and settlers only."    Replying to a question, he asserted that "the intifadah  youths will perform miracles and prove that the Israeli Army is  a paper tiger." Ghawshah rejected President Yasir 'Arafat's  declared regret over the killing of Israeli civilians, and  reiterated that "the ball is in Rabin's court. The blood of  Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood of  Israeli civilians."    In a telephone contact, Ghawshah told AL-HAYAH that the  Hadera operation, for which the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions  claimed credit, "came as part of the Palestinian people's  reaction to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre. Moreover,  it was directed against Israeli occupation and is part of the  Hamas Movement strategy. We believe that there cannot be any  peace as long as there are settlers on our land. No doubt,  these strikes have put Rabin, 'Arafat, and U.S. President Bill  Clinton in an impasse because they are in the same boat."    Ghawshah added: "These strikes prove that Rabin failed to  fulfill his promise to the Jews that he would restore calm and  guarantee security. These strikes happened in the territories  occupied in 1948 under strict and serious security measures.  Rabin's situation is being eroded. As for 'Arafat, the  Palestinian people have bypassed him since the Ibrahimi Mosque's  massacre in Hebron. When the 'Afula operation was carried out,  Hamas managed to prove to the world that it can punish the  criminals and murderers and impose respect for the will of  Muslims and Arabs throughout the world."    Replying to a question, Ghawshah said that "Hamas was  committed to attacking soldiers and settlers. What happened,  however, is that Rabin did not stop killing children and women.  Yesterday, they killed a pregnant woman, and they did not stop  blowing up houses, which reminds us of the Nazi actions in  Europe. Therefore, Hamas was obliged to expand the circle. The  principle of reciprocal treatment is approved by all secular and  religious laws. As we eagerly adhere to Islamic principles, we  are aware that Islam permits reciprocal treatment for us. Thus,  let them stop killing children and women, and Hamas will then  commit itself to attacking only soldiers and settlers. If,  however, they continue their actions, we tell them that the  blood of Palestinian civilians is not cheaper than the blood of  Jewish civilians. Rabin should be aware of this."</p>

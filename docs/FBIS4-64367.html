			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "a.u., rie, d.n.": "Mock Against Referendum </F> on Neutrality"]    [Text] After the irritation about statements by Foreign  Minister Alois Mock at the weekend, which could be interpreted  as proposing a new referendum if Austrian neutrality were to be  abolished, Mock clarified things on Monday [2 May], and, in an  interview with DIE PRESSE, strictly rejected such a referendum.    "If neutrality were really to be abolished one day, the  decision would have to be made by parliament and not in a  referendum," the foreign minister emphasized in the interview.  Legally, it is clear that neutrality is not an intrinsic law of  the Constitution, and it is only such laws that require a  referendum.    In an earlier news conference, Mock explained the confusion  created through his address to the Greens conference in the  following way: He would not be told not to think ahead. All he  did was discuss possibilities that might become relevant in a  few decades. Not many things, apart from God, are forever, Mock  said.    In another news conference, Austrian People's Party [OeVP]  Chairman Busek also gave assurances that this question was not  currently on the agenda. "We will join the European Union [EU]  as a neutral country. Everything else will depend on whether  there will be changes in the EU, and what changes. If such  changes were to affect an intrinsic law of the Constitution --  which we do not know today -- then we are obliged to put the  issue to a referendum in Austria; but everything in its time."    Mock's statements at the Greens' Federal Congress were  described by Busek as "technically most upright." Yet the  Greens deliberately misinterpreted Mock; moreover, some of  Mock's statements were quoted in a condensed version.    The vice chancellor once more stressed "the clear course of  the OeVP," which "has always advocated a collective security  system for Europe." The "logical development" is a collective  security system, about which there is "absolutely no dissent"  even with Chancellor Vranitzky -- "That is government policy,"  Busek said.    Yesterday, on the sidelines of a news conference, Heide  Schmidt, chairwoman of the Liberal Forum, described the  Government's position on the issue of neutrality as "two-faced  and cowardly." She said she saw no need to raise the question  now of whether a referendum might become necessary at a later  time.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / People: First head of environment for British Gas Competition is not the only challenge British Gas, the former UK monopoly gas supplier, faces in the next few years. It also has to confront increasingly tough environmental standards. Leading the charge will be Patrick Weatherilt (left), recently appointed by British Gas to the new post of head of environment. The job has been developed to ensure that British Gas's environmental policies and practices are 'at least equal to those of the best companies'. This is the first time there has been a manager with overall responsibility for environmental matters at corporate services level. Weatherilt will report to Mike Arnold, group director of safety and environment. Weatherilt joined the company in 1974 and was involved in developing the national transmission system before becoming chief environmental planning officer. In 1991 he joined health and safety to manage the huge environmental audit BG is conducting at 4,000 installations around the world, designed to ensure that standards are met wherever the company operates. He will keep responsibility for that project, and is also charged with ensuring that standards of environmental management are consistent throughout the different arms of the company - UK marketing, exploration and production, and global gas. A third role will be monitoring national and international environmental legislation.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Engineers' chief to quit IoD in protest The controversy in the business community over the acceptable level of government support for UK industry has been re-ignited with the protest resignation from the Institute of Directors of Mr Noel Davies, president of the Engineering Employers' Federation, Michael Cassell writes. Mr Davies, who is also chief executive of VSEL, the submarine and shipbuilding group, has told the IoD that he is leaving the organisation because of its support for demands by Mr Michael Portillo to cut the level of state aid given to industry. Mr Portillo, now the employment secretary, made the demands when he was chief secretary to the Treasury. The Confederation of British Industry has said it fully supports Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who is resisting calls for reductions in his budget. In a letter to Mr Tim Melville-Ross, who has just taken over as IoD director general, Mr Davies says he will not renew his personal membership because of remarks made recently by Mr Melville-Ross in which he endorsed Mr Portillo's call for a fundamental review of public expenditure across all government departments. The IoD chief questioned the effectiveness of some state funding for industry and said all government spending had to be scrutinised if taxes were to be lowered. Mr Davies says the IoD's views are contrary to those of others 'who I believe know and understand the problems of industry better'. The IoD said last night that the organisation had received critical letters from only three of its 32,500 members. Mr Melville-Ross said he was sorry Mr Davies had indicated his intention not to renew his membership. He added: 'I hope he will reconsider when he has had a chance to read my explanation of the context in which I expressed the IoD's support for a full review of public expenditure so that we can ultimately reach a point when both the borrowing requirement and the burden of taxation can be reduced in the interest of all businesses.'</p>

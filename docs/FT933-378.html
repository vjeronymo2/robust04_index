			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: First half advance at London and Manchester LONDON and Manchester, the life assurance group, increased its interim dividend by 10 per cent from 4.65p to 5.12p after announcing a 24 per cent rise in premium income in the first half of 1993. Mr Tom Pyne, chief executive, said he was optimistic about full-year profits because the group could distribute to shareholders part of the investment return on the life fund. In addition, its non-insurance businesses had benefited from a return to stability in the housing market. London and Manchester is the only insurer with permission from the Department of Trade and Industry to distribute part of the long-term investment return on the shareholders' interest in the roughly Pounds 1.5bn life fund. This return will be shown on the profit and loss account with the full-year results as part of the total annual transfer from the life fund. In the first half, ordinary life single premiums fell 42 per cent to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 17.8m). However, total income from single premiums, including pensions and managed funds, rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 120.7m (Pounds 84.2m). Total annual premium income increased 6 per cent to Pounds 95.3m (Pounds 89.8m). The company said its residential mortgage book is 'exhibiting a much improved performance'. Arrears and repossessions were lower and provisions had returned to normal levels from last year's higher amount. The commercial mortgage book has been closed for 18 months. It is now being run down and the provisions made at the time of closure are considered adequate.</p>

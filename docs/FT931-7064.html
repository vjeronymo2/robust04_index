			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs say Bank 'fell down' on its BCCI duties MPS ACCUSED the Bank of England yesterday of failing 'to discharge its supervisory duties' towards Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt international bank which was closed in 1991. The cross-party Commons Treasury and Civil Service select committee also said that the absence of disciplinary action against Bank employees in the wake of the BCCI affair undermined the 'future effectiveness of the Bank'. This was because it might lead staff to conclude that poor performance carried 'no adverse consequences' for them as individuals. The report added: 'We consider it is incumbent on the Bank of England to accept responsibility for its failure as the supervisor of BCCI'. But the committee stopped short of demanding that the government reconsider the question of compensation for BCCI's UK depositors after Conservative MPs on the committee joined forces to excise the relevant sentence from the final report. Mr Quentin Davies, MP for Stamford and Spalding, one of the Tories who supported the omission, said he felt it would be 'quite wrong in principle' for the Bank to pay compensation in this case. The rejected sentence, which sparked clashes between Labour and Tory committee members during yesterday's stormy press conference, argued that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was 'honour-bound to reconsider the case for partial compensation' to BCCI's UK depositors. Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, the committee's acting chairman, said the committee's central finding - that the Bank 'fell down' on its job as a supervisor - was backed by the whole committee. Plans were in hand for the body to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the Bank's general role in supervising financial markets, he said. There was 'a strong case' for separating the Bank's regulatory and monetary roles. The Bank said it did not accept 'either the judgments or the conclusions' of the committee. There was 'nothing new in the report at all: it is simply a precis of all the negative parts of the Bingham report,' an official said. The Bank had nothing to add to the response it gave at the time Lord Justice Bingham's report was published last autumn, he added. It did not believe there was 'any case for giving additional compensation to UK depositors over and above that already provided by the statutory Deposit Protection Scheme (which provides depositors with compensation equal to 75 per cent of lost deposits up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000)'. It is widely accepted within the Bank that the 'culture' of the supervision department was not aggressive enough for the Bank to act effectively against BCCI. It has set up new legal and investigative units in an attempt to become more professional and rigorous in the assessment of whether banks are being managed honestly and prudently.</p>

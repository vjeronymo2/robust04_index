			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Walker says coal fund is sufficient LORD WALKER, the former Conservative cabinet minister selected to oversee the regeneration of coalfield areas, insisted yesterday that the Pounds 165m allocated by the government was sufficient for the task in the coming 12 months. On his first public visit to a coalfield since his appointment in October, Lord Walker said he wanted more government money to continue the regeneration effort - using his first-year experience to assess how much was needed. 'As far as future years are concerned, when I've got down to the detail of the task I would discuss with the government departments what was required,' he said.</p>

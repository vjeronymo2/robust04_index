			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEEDED BREAK;  </P> <P> SHRIVER TAKES TIME OUT FROM OUTSIDE COMMITMENTS TO FOCUS ON HER GAME  </P> <P> Once, Pam Shriver decided to go to a movie. This is something she often does  when she is on the road. The feature hadn't started yet in the tiny theater on  Bourke Street in Melbourne, Australia, so Shriver went into the restroom.  </P> <P> Two elderly women were standing just inside the restroom door as Shriver neared  them on her way out. She was startled as they gasped in shock.  </P> <P> "My word, this is the Gents'," one of the women said.  </P> <P> Shriver did a quick personal audit. As usual, she measured a shade over six  feet from the soles of her sneakers to the top of her brown, curly semi-short  hair. Wearing blue jeans and a light jacket, Shriver realized that she had been  mistaken for a man.  </P> <P> Shriver quickly reassured the women that she was indeed no gender bender and  they were in the right rest room.  </P> <P> "I don't think they believed me," Shriver said.  </P> <P> The women viewed Shriver suspiciously as she walked past.  </P> <P> But this was the latest case of mistaken identity involving Pam Shriver. Why,  it was nearly 11 years ago that she was being mistaken for Britain's Margaret  Court.  </P> <P> Shriver was 16 years old and more Maryland than crabcakes. According to a New  York Times description, Shriver had more curls than Little Orphan Annie when  she became the youngest finalist in the history of the U.S. Open. The  Lutherville, Md., schoolgirl won every set she played and defeated  then-Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova in the semifinals before losing to  Chris Evert in the final.  </P> <P> Even at such a young age, Shriver was impressive. To many, she was the  reincarnation of Court, but leaner and hungrier. A serve-and-volley player,  Shriver stood out in the women's game, where the party line was the baseline.  </P> <P> Looking back, all of it must have seemed pretty simple to Shriver. The world  was her oyster, or at the very least, a steamed clam.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure how high my expectations were, but I thought things would be  easy," she said. "I thought that the progression would be finals one year,  maybe I'll struggle (in the) semifinals, quarterfinals a year or so, but I'd  win it within the next few years. 'Who is this Chris and Martina anyway?' But  pretty soon, I was definitely back down to earth."  </P> <P> Years passed. Shriver grew up, all the while playing tennis. She became a  well-rounded person, a champion of causes, a salmon fisher in Canada. And she  developed a fondness for politics. Born on the Fourth of July, she bleeds red,  white and blue. Shriver was a collector of Australian art when it was  fashionable and a Baltimore Orioles fan when it was not. She knew something  about a lot of things. Her interest rate was 100%.  </P> <P> Now, Pam Shriver is 26 and winning the U.S. Open, or any other Grand Slam  singles event, hasn't happened. It is the only chunk missing out of what has  been an otherwise complete life of tennis and Shriver wonders if this is  something that is actually meant to be.  </P> <P> Yet even without a Grand Slam title, since 1983 Shriver has been able to hang  onto a place near the top of the rankings, right there a few rungs below Steffi  Graf, and also Navratilova and Evert, who are her contemporaries in terms of  tour of duty, if not success. Although that missing element gnaws slightly at  Shriver's insides, she is at the same time proud of her station.  </P> <P> "To be the only one that hasn't had the glory of Grand Slams and still be able  to keep the drive is something that I'd say in my career I'm most proud of,"  Shriver said. "OK, she hasn't held up the Wimbledon trophy or the U.S. Open  trophy or even the Australian, but doggone it, she's been a contender that long  and she hasn't lost her mind."  </P> <P> Maybe not, but for a while there recently, Shriver thought she might have  misplaced it.  </P> <P> At this very moment, Shriver has not played singles in a tournament since  shortly after seeing that movie in Melbourne. She lost to Catarina Lindqvist in  the third round of the Australian Open, 0-6, 6-4, 8-6, then pulled out of  singles in events at Washington and San Antonio.  </P> <P> She said that her singles game had sunk so low, she couldn't find it on radar.  Because of all her obligations and commitments, Shriver felt her tennis was  being shortchanged. She was spread too thin.  </P> <P> "It hit me when I was in Australia that I had eight zillion things to do," she  said. "I realized I had no time for myself. I just needed to take a breather."  </P> <P> This was no case of burnout, Shriver said. Something wasn't quite right in her  life and the symptoms showed in her tennis.  </P> <P> She began adding up the major commitments of her time and energy. She soon  realized that she:  </P> <P>  -- Is on the board of directors of the McDonough School, a private school near  Baltimore.  </P> <P>  -- Runs the Orchard Indoor Tennis Club at Towson, Md.  </P> <P>  -- Is a vice president of the Womens International Tennis Assn.  </P> <P>  -- Serves on the President's Council on Physical Fitness.  </P> <P>  -- Produces a Cystic Fibrosis celebrity tennis tournament.  </P> <P>  -- Is involved in various public-service projects.  </P> <P> In addition, Shriver has discussed with the Bush Administration the possibility  of getting involved in a youth-service agency in which she would work with kids  to persuade them to get involved in helping others.  </P> <P> Evert sent Shriver a message of sympathy.  </P> <P> "It said: 'Dear Pam, I had a mini-emotional breakdown when I was 24 or 25,' "  Evert said. "John Lloyd and I were on the cover of People magazine and it was  like "Chris Retires." I took a sabbatical, four or five months off, because I  was very emotional.  </P> <P> "Every time I stepped out on the court, I was crying," Evert said. "I was  thinking, 'This isn't me. Something's not right.' I had just gotten married and  I was confused how career, marriage and family fit in.  </P> <P> "Pam takes on a lot more than I ever did," Evert said. "I was pretty  single-minded when I was younger, but Pam is involved in other aspects, so it  caught up with her. She's an extremely well-rounded person."  </P> <P> Now, though, she's slightly less so. Last week, Shriver leased some office  space in Lutherville and is hiring someone to take off some pressure in her  business.  </P> <P> "You can't let outside things gnaw away at your singles game to a point where  you can't play," Shriver said.  </P> <P> She also parted with Bud Schultz, one of her coaches, after the Australian  Open. Shriver said that Schultz wanted to alter her philosophy of preparing for  matches, which she considered a solid fundamental and one she did not want to  give up.  </P> <P> "It's a very, very fragile thing," Shriver said. "I wouldn't expect anyone who  hadn't known me for years and years and years to know it. You can't replace  that familiarity. It was like a change of who I was about. At 26, I couldn't do  that, and it would hurt my tennis."  </P> <P> Hank Harris, who has been Shriver's hitting coach for years, is being counted  on more than before, as is Don Candy, the former Australian Davis Cup player,  who was Shriver's guru.  </P> <P> "Don is going to be a resource for as long as I play," Shriver said. "He  doesn't come to all the tournaments, but all the major ones. Day in and day  out, (since) he's going to be 60 this month, obviously his working-out days are  finished."  </P> <P> So it is a new and presumably revitalized Shriver descending on Indian Wells  this week for the $250,000 Virginia Slims tournament at Hyatt Grand Champions.  After laying off tournament singles for about six weeks, Shriver is confident  her tennis will show improvement, now that she has begun to sort out her  business and personal affairs.  </P> <P> "I think I'll play my best tennis," she said. "In a year and a half, I'll  either be playing the best tennis of my life and loving it, or I won't be  playing singles anymore.  </P> <P> "Now, I play my tennis, I give it 100%, as much as this body-type can, but at  the same time, I really get excited about the things I've been exposed to and  the people I've met. The people I get to know now will be able to help me make  that transition into whatever I'm going to do later."  </P> <P> Shriver said she has been intrigued by meeting some top executives at Philip  Morris, the parent company of Virginia Slims, which has sponsored the women's  professional tennis tour since 1970.  </P> <P> "The odds of going to work with Philip Morris would, I guess, be slim . . . ha,  ha," Shriver said.  </P> <P> Entering the political arena may be appealing to Shriver, who campaigned for  both Ronald Reagan and George Bush. But Shriver said the boundaries of her  support may be slightly broader than is widely assumed. She also has  contributed to the campaigns of Rep. Tom McMillen and Gov. William Schaefer,  both Maryland Democrats.  </P> <P> "Actually, I'm a little bipartisan," she said. "I don't advertise it too much."  </P> <P> One of three daughters of Sam and Margot Shriver, Pam was 3 when she started  going to the tennis courts with her parents. She used a sawed-off squash  racket. When she was 9, Shriver began taking lessons at the Orchard Indoor club  from Candy, who was the pro.  </P> <P> A student of famed Australian tennis master Harry Hopman, Candy found Shriver a  talented pupil. By late 1977, when Shriver was 15 and ready to play on the Avon  Futures circuit, she asked Candy to travel with her full-time.  </P> <P> In early 1978, Shriver won the Avon Futures in Columbus, Ohio, getting through  pre-qualifying, qualifying and the main draw. A buoyed Shriver entered the  Virginia Slims of Dallas and scored surprising victories over Dianne Fromholtz  and Kerry Reid before losing to Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the semifinals.  </P> <P> That summer, Shriver found herself on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Shriver held  three match points on Sue Barker, but wound up losing. She returned to playing  in junior events and lost to Tracy Austin in the final of the national 16 and  18 championships. Next came her stunning debut at the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> Shriver defeated Navratilova in two tiebreakers in a semifinal that was twice  delayed by rain. Then in the final against Evert before a packed stadium,  Shriver lost, 7-5, 6-4, after leading, 5-4, in the first set and, 4-3, in the  second.  </P> <P> At 16, she was the youngest woman ever to reach the Open final.  </P> <P> She hasn't been back since.  </P> <P> In any event, Shriver remembers what she went through after her narrow loss the  very first moment she burst upon the scene at the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> "It was great to get to the finals, but all the baggage that came with it was a  shame," she said. "But you can't have one without the other. Just like Becker  won two Wimbledons before he was 20, so he's supposed to win eight out of 10.  </P> <P> "So it could have been worse -- I could have won it," she said. "Well, I guess  that would have been better."  </P> <P> It didn't take long to find out that this Open business wasn't a snap.  </P> <P> After going back to McDonough school and not playing for three months, Shriver  joined the 1978 Wightman Cup team and played No. 3 singles, losing to Michelle  Tyler, a little-known English player at the Royal Albert Hall. That was the  last time the United States lost the Wightman Cup.  </P> <P> "It was a horrible experience," Shriver said. "I knew then that things were not  going to be easy."  </P> <P> In fact, they got worse. Shriver turned pro in early 1979, but did not win a  match from June to November. She played five tournaments and lost in the first  round of each.  </P> <P> And during the summer in Chichester, England, she injured her shoulder while  hitting an overhead in warmups. She still wears mounds of ice packs on her  right shoulder after matches, looking like a Quasimodo whose hump has shifted a  little to the right.  </P> <P> Shriver returned to the U.S. Open, the scene of her greatest triumph. She lost  in straight sets to Julie Harrington in the first round.  </P> <P> "To have all that happen within one year of when you've gotten through to the  finals is really extreme," Shriver said. "But within one year of getting my low  in the rankings (36), I was in the top 10. It's like 1980 was my big recovery  year."  </P> <P> And Shriver had just turned 18.  </P> <P> Along the way, Shriver has managed to delight audiences and entertain the media  with her tennis and her comments about tennis, in that order.  </P> <P> She has also shown an ability to occasionally infuriate opponents with biting  on-court remarks. In Toronto in 1981, for instance, Shriver said something  vulgar to Austin, who Shriver felt was taking things a little bit too  seriously. Shriver later sent an apology.  </P> <P> Shriver has also been one of the top deflected-cursers in the sport. When she  gets really angry, she speaks naughty words to the back of her hand. Of course,  such peccadilloes are part of Shriver's charm, now that she has been around  long enough to be appreciated as one of the continuing standard-bearers of the  women's game.  </P> <P> Grand Slam titles?  </P> <P> Shriver actually has 21 of them. They are all doubles titles, though, 20 of  them with Navratilova as a partner.  </P> <P> She vows to play well at Wimbledon this year because she can be more focused,  now that her schedule is settled somewhat.  </P> <P> "This is my time," she said.  </P> <P> Of course, time is always the issue, especially not having enough of it to go  around. Shriver, who takes her responsibilities seriously, may soon get an even  bigger one when Evert retires as both player and WITA president. Shriver would  almost surely move up.  </P> <P> Since the days of Billie Jean King, it is traditional that the No. 1 player sit  at the head of the players' group, but Evert senses an absence of interest in  that role now, especially among No. 1 Steffi Graf and her youthful challenger,  Gabriela Sabatini.  </P> <P> "I would say right now that the state of women's tennis is very, very healthy,"  Evert said.  </P> <P> "But the problem might be in the leadership aspect, off the court," she said.  "Martina and I were taken under Billie Jean's wing, we were open to learning,  to the WITA and responsibilities. Pam, too. I don't see the other players  opening up and saying to the top players, 'We'd like to continue to carry the  torch.' I'm sort of throwing it off to their youth.  </P> <P> "They're young, they're single-minded, and, quite frankly, I wouldn't want a  bunch of 18- and 19-year-old girls to run the game. But what they could do is  attend more board meetings, more general meetings, just show up two or three  times a year, read the material we send them."  </P> <P> Shriver always shows up when and where she is supposed to. On her return flight  from Australia, Shriver landed at Los Angeles International airport, did one  interview, then hopped a plane to Palm Springs for another round of interviews.  She did all this on one hour's sleep.  </P> <P> She spent the rest of the time between Sydney and LAX doing her bookkeeping and  writing in her journal. Last spring, Shriver touched on the No. 3 ranking for a  while after she began the year by winning tournaments in Brisbane and Sydney,  Australia. She went on to win the Pan Pacific and the European Indoors.  </P> <P> Shriver, as usual, did not play in the French Open, lost in the semifinals at  Wimbledon and the second round of the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> "A disastrous summer," she said.  </P> <P> "The thing I realized is that no matter how bad my results are or how good my  results are, you are never quite sure what's around the corner. So what you do  is you just keep preparing and being as enthusiastic as you can about your game  and your life style."  </P> <P> The year ended happily for Shriver at the Virginia Slims championships. She  beat Evert and Graf on the way to the final, where she lost to Sabatini. Even  so, it all looked pretty good to Shriver.  </P> <P> "Once upon a time, if I beat Chrissie and Graf back-to-back, that would have  been good enough to have won a pretty big title," she said.  </P> <P> A Slam, possibly?  </P> <P> "A lot of it is timing and luck," she said. "I just think if you're there  knocking long enough, at some point it's going to happen. But if it doesn't,  onward."  </P> <P> This week, at Indian Wells, the draw is small, only 28, and just about anyone  could win. The usual suspects: Evert, Helena Sukova, Shriver, Lori McNeil.  </P> <P> Shriver will have some help in her corner -- her two grandmothers are coming to  see her play.  </P> <P> Marion (Moppie) Ketcham, 80, is Margot Shriver's mother and lives in San Diego.  Eleanor (Ga Ga) Shriver, 78, Sam Shriver's mother, will come from Pennsylvania  to watch granddaughter Pam play.  </P> <P> Marion Ketcham is a four-times-a-week player on the courts at Hotel del  Coronado on Coronado Island. Shriver sent her a Valentine's Day card.  </P> <P> "She wrote on it, 'Palm Springs, here we come,' " Ketcham said. "She has too  much energy. She's a great girl and she doesn't have just tennis. But she's  done so many other things, it's too bad one thing she hasn't done is won a big  singles title. I know it's within her to want a Grand Slam singles title."  </P> <P> Ketcham said, however, that Shriver is more of a doubles player than a singles  player, which seems fair considering Shriver's Grand Slam doubles record.  </P> <P> "The little girls can move faster," she said. "But with her long legs and long  arms, she can use those on just about anybody and get to the finals. Whether  she can win it, I don't know."  </P> <P> This assessment seems fair. It is something Pam Shriver probably can live with.  She is waiting for her moment to come around again. There have already been so  many, not the least of which was winning the gold medal with doubles partner  Zina Garrison at the Seoul Olympics. Barcelona and 1992, which aren't that far  off, are the end of the line for her, Shriver said.  </P> <P> But until then? And what if there are no more great moments?  </P> <P> "Hey, I've had a great run," she said.  </P> <P> And when yet another moment comes, when she decides to stop playing, Shriver  already has a retirement speech prepared -- what will be said about her.  </P> <P> This is what she hopes people will say: "Isn't it great that she finally won a  Wimbledon.  </P> <P> "But if it doesn't happen, I just hope they say, 'There's someone who was fun  to watch. She hung in there.' "  </P></p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television So far The Essential History of Europe (BBC 2, 8.00) has been an enjoyable romp through the vagaries of our EC partners. Now it is our turn to squirm as the spotlight swings on the UK through the eyes of French director Patrick Le Gall. Predictably, he reckons we are class-ridden and racist, characteristics that could be flung with some accuracy at the French. Thursday night has become comedy night, built around Minder (ITV at 8.30). Unfortunately it clashes with one of the better of the current comedy sitcoms, The Brittas Empire (BBC 1), with Chris Barrie as the anti-hero who runs his leisure centre with the delicacy of a power drill, and with Joking Apart, a bitter look at divorce (BBC 2), but it leads to the subversive Dave Allen (ITV, 9.30) and Drop the Dead Donkey (Channel 4, 10.00). Despite its many awards and rave reviews (the media loves programmes about the media) this parody of a TV newsroom can grind to an embarrassing halt when the cast interrupt the plot to tell the weak topical jokes that the writers think essential. It is best when it concentrates on media bitchiness.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CULT LEADER SENTENCED TO DIE IN FAMILY'S SLAYING  </P> <P> A judge today sentenced religious cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren to death for  killing a five-member family belonging to his cult.  </P> <P> Defense lawyer Charles Grieshammer pleaded Thursday for Common Pleas Judge  Martin Parks to spare Lundgren's life, saying the Independence, Mo., native  believed he was following God's will when he killed the Avery family, which  included children ages 15, 13 and 6.  </P> <P> Lundgren, 40, a one-time lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter Day Saints, was convicted Aug. 29 of aggravated murder for the 1989  killings.  </P> <P> Grieshammer said the Reorganized Church, which Lundgren broke away from to  start his cult, is based on the belief that the second coming of Christ is  near, and he said there is a belief there will be a prophet to lead the church.  </P> <P> "You ended up with a man who felt he was the final prophet," Grieshammer said.  "Jeffrey Lundgren and his followers went over the edge. Jeffrey Lundgren lost  touch with reality. There is no doubt about it."  </P> <P> Grieshammer said he was not trying to say Lundgren was innocent by reason of  insanity.  </P> <P> "The penalty we are asking for is a horrible penalty," Grieshammer said. "To  send Jeffrey Lundgren to prison for the rest of his life, to reside in an  8-by-10-foot cell, that is a horrible punishment. It is the second most  horrible punishment we have but it is what Jeffrey Lundgren deserves."  </P> <P> Lake County Prosecutor Stephen LaTourette said Lundgren killed the Avery family  because Dennis Avery, the father, was lazy and his children were unruly.  </P> <P> "Believing you are a prophet of God or even being a prophet of God is no excuse  for murder," LaTourette said.  </P> <P> The cult disbanded in December.  </P> <P> "The evidence has shown that Jeffrey Lundgren didn't believe he was doing God's  will but rather he was doing his own will," LaTourette said.  </P> <P> Also facing a possible death penalty is Jeffrey Lundgren's 19-year-old son,  Damon Lundgren.  </P></p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan balks at US tough line over semiconductors THE JAPANESE semiconductor industry has raised its voice in protest against recent criticism from the US over Japan's expected failure to fulfil a bilateral agreement on foreign market share of the Japanese semiconductor market. That was supposed to reach 20 per cent by the end of last year; the third quarter figure was almost 16 per cent. The Electronics Industry Association of Japan has published a report on the 1991 US-Japan Semiconductor Arrangement, which tries to clarify what the bilateral agreement calls for and to explain why the 20 per cent market share figure the US has focused on is not a fair measure of the improvement in foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market. The report comes as the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has become increasingly insistent that Japan meet the 20 per cent target. Last week, the SIA said that, if Japan failed to comply with the agreement, it would 'work closely with the Clinton administration to seek redress and pursue appropriate measures to ensure compliance'. The EIAJ has responded with a clear protest against the SIA's stance. The 20 per cent figure, as it appears in the agreement, 'represents the US industry expectation, not a guarantee', it says. Furthermore, the 20 per cent figure should not be taken as the only measure of whether access to the Japanese semiconductor market has improved, it says. Since the original US-Japan Semiconductor Arrangement was signed in 1986, foreign market share has more than doubled from 8 to about 16 per cent; sales of foreign semiconductors have more than tripled from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 3.2bn. Nor is overall market share a completely reliable measure of progress in foreign access to the Japanese market, says the EIAJ. Foreign semiconductor manufacturers are not competitive in semiconductors for consumer electronics, which comprise about 42 per cent of the Japanese semiconductor market against only 5.3 per cent in the US. Also, in certain other product categories, US companies do not have a sufficient supply to service Japanese demand. Rather than focus on the failures, it says, the US should look at how much the agreement has achieved. The 1991 agreement has resulted in increased foreign sales in Japan, greater foreign market share, design-ins and joint relationships. As such, it is having its intended effect, the EIAJ report concludes. With a bilateral meeting to determine last year's the foreign market share, due next week, the report's unwritten plea seems to be that the US should refrain from taking any rash decision that could undermine progress made so far.</p>

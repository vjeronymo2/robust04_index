			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Capital spending rise seen CAPITAL spending by small companies in Britain rose 37 per cent in the second half of last year, following two half-year periods of steep decline, according to National Westminster Bank's small business investment index published yesterday. However, part of the increase came from businesses switching from overdrafts to term loans. Excluding this factor the underlying upward trend was less pronounced and did not mark a significant improvement in business confidence, the bank said. The rise in capital spending in the second half of last year was still only half the level of early 1988. The strongest recovery was in the Midlands and Wales where capital spending rose 46 per cent compared with the first half of last year. Spending in the south-west rose 41 per cent while the weakest upturn - 27 per cent - was in north England. The sharpest upturn in spending by investment category occurred in working capital and stock. Spending rose by about 33 per cent, though from a very low base. The index is based on lending made under NatWest's Business Development Loan Scheme.</p>

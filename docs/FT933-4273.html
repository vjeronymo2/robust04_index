			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: KHD loss deepens to DM98m GROUP losses at Klockner-Humbolt-Deutz, the German engineering group, more than trebled in the first six months of the current year. It said the impact of the recession in Germany had turned out to be worse than expected. Despite the loss of DM98m (Dollars 61.25m) - up from a DM29m loss in the first half of last year - KHD said it expected to break even for the year as a whole. It said extensive rationalisation measures had led to a permanent lowering of the group's break-even point. The group will take some DM300m of restructuring costs 'below the line' as extraordinary expenditure, reflecting the cost of shedding 2,500 jobs during the year. Sales for the first six months dropped 21 per cent to DM1.28bn, and order intake fell 23 per cent to DM1.66bn. The drop in domestic demand for machinery was behind these falls, the group said. The year-on-year fall in orders concealed the fact that the order book itself was 16 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. KHD saw no short-term prospect of recovery in the European markets for its motors, and agricultural products such as tractors.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / MMC to investigate wholesale distribution of newspapers THE OFFICE of Fair Trading asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission yesterday to investigate the wholesale distribution of national newspapers in England and Wales after complaints from independent retailers and MPs that practices restrict competition. The OFT said it was particularly concerned about barriers to entry into retail newspaper sales. The main wholesale suppliers can currently refuse to supply newspapers to shopkeepers who wish to set up new retail outlets. The MMC would be expected to report to the trade and industry secretary in a year. Wholesale newspaper distribution was first referred to the MMC in 1976. Its report two years later found a complex monopoly existed in favour of WH Smith, John Menzies and Surridge Dawson - still the three largest wholesale distributors - and a few smaller companies, but concluded it was not against the public interest to limit the number of retailers. The subject was reviewed in 1986 and again in September 1991, when the OFT decided that a further referral to the MMC was unwarranted. In 1988, distribution switched from rail to road and exclusive contracts began to be awarded by some newspaper publishers to wholesalers. That has resulted in retailers in many areas having only one of the main wholesalers as a supplier. Retailers who have been denied supply have the right to appeal to the publishers and wholesalers. However, according to Mr Alan Taylor, national secretary of the British Independent Grocers' Association, representing some 2,000 independent retailers, the appeals system has failed: 'An application from a small convenience store will be dealt with by a letter stating that 'the area is adequately served'. But if you happen to be Dillons or Tesco, they usually decide your area isn't adequately served. Strange, isn't it?' Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, managing director of John Menzies, with some 20 per cent of the market, denied his company restricted retail growth: 'We spend all our time seeking ways to promote sales of newspapers. You do not do that by cutting a finite cake into ever decreasing slices.' WH Smith, which has some 27 per cent of the market, said: 'We have been down this road before and we are quite happy to co-operate with the OFT again.' Smith shares fall, Page 34</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UN chief wants 3,500 troops to guard Somali aid THE United Nations should send a force of 3,500 troops to Somalia to escort relief supplies, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, Agencies report. A force of this size is bigger than many diplomats at the UN had anticipated. The UN chief - who sent his recommendation to the Security Council in New York yesterday - said the UN force would include the 500 Pakistani troops about to be deployed to the famine-stricken country. Mr Boutros Ghali said the UN force should operate in four port areas. A total of 1,500 troops would go to Bosasso in the south-west and two contingents of 750 each would be based in Berbera and Kismayu. The Pakistanis are assigned to Mogadishu. Looking beyond humanitarian aid, he said the UN would need to help demobilise regular and irregular forces and to re-establish law and order in Somalia. Earlier, the International Committee of the Red Cross called for increased co-ordination of relief aid for Somalia, warning that simply bringing food could lead to further strife. 'Somalia still remains an extremely dangerous and volatile place,' it said. 'Large quantities of food swamping the country in an uncontrolled fashion could quite easily spark off new security problems.' Since the regime of Siad Barre fell 18 months ago, the country has disintegrated into anarchy. Many thousands have died, one in six has fled the country and unescorted food shipments for the large number of starving people risk being looted by armed gangs. Since Friday, Washington has been flying food to north-eastern Kenya for about 1m Kenyan drought victims and the nearly 400,000 refugees - mainly Somalis - living in camps along the border. More US food is to be flown into Somalia this week.</p>

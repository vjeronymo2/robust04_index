			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Aid barely lifts Andalucia - Region languishes despite quantities of EU cash Hundreds of German and Dutch families moved down to La Carolina in southern Spain but discovered the homes they were promised were still unbuilt. The promoter had called it 'the gateway of happiness'. Instead, they found themselves in a barren landscape where the locals treated them as loafers. Another Costa time-share scam? Not quite. It was an experiment in farm settlement, in 1767. Today's mayor says it created 'a European Union in miniature'. Its remnants are some curiously tall, blond people in surrounding villages and the occasional odd-sounding surname like Nef or Schefle. La Carolina is no longer the end of the world. A spanking new highway runs close by. But these days hardly anybody goes there. There are no tourists and few jobs to be had. Last year, two of the main employers, including a telecommunications equipment plant belonging to Siemens of Germany, shut down. More jobs hang precariously on the future of Suzuki's car-making subsidiary, Santana Motor, in nearby Linares. Linares, as near to being an industrial town as anywhere in Andalucia, has been on a war footing for more than three months. Suzuki, fed up with paying for losses, wants out. The whole area has taken to the streets against job cuts. The factory fence is strung with banners pledging the support of everybody from the fire brigade to the basketball club. The company's Japanese executives have gone to ground. The plant is not big by European standards, employing 2,400. But this is more than any other single industrial facility in Andalucia, a region of almost 7m people. And Linares, sitting among disused lead mines, has little else. More than half the population of 60,000 depend on it directly or indirectly. European funds, following Spain's accession eight years ago, and a spending-spree connected to the Seville Expo in 1992 have outwardly changed Andalucia, with public works galore - new roads, high-speed railways, airport buildings, drains, schools and hopeful business parks. But, at the same time, the region's official jobless rate has risen to 34 per cent, three times the EU average and the highest in Spain, Europe's record-holder for unemployment. The number out of work in the region - 885,000 - has increased by half in the past decade. Last year, according to the Fund for Economic and Social Research, Andalucia's gross product fell by 2.9 per cent, the sharpest recession of any Spanish region. Income per head is 53 per cent of European Union average. Since Spain's entry to the EU the gap has closed a little, but less than for Spain as a whole. 'In relative terms we are not in the group of regions that are converging,' says Mr Alfonso Pajuelo, planning director in the economy department of the regional government in Seville. Villages depend heavily on payments from the government's rural employment plan, designed to ease the plight of 200,000 seasonal farm labourers in Andalucia and neighbouring Extremadura. Agricultural 'day-workers', who work at least 60 days, usually moving from harvest to harvest on big estates, can claim about Pta27,000 (Pounds 130) net a month for half the year when they are not working. Notoriously vulnerable to fraud, the plan has cost about Pta1,000bn since it was introduced 10 years ago. Opposition conservatives see it as a disincentive to work. Distant from any of the standard images of European farming, it has created its own unique brand of subsidy culture. Andalucia is the European region which receives most structural aid from the EU. But it has only a third as many companies as Catalonia, which has a smaller population. Ninety per cent of those employ fewer than 50 people. 'Attempts at industrial take-off have repeatedly failed,' notes a regional government study. There is little entrepreneurial spirit, and many established companies - like Santana Motor - have become uncompetitive. Mr Francisco Vallejo, La Carolina's Socialist mayor, thinks the impact of the single market will be 'fairly negative in the short term' in the region. 'These companies worked well when the market was closed.' Andalucia is a prime focus of attention in the European election, with regional elections being held simultaneously on June 12. The Socialists' outright majority in this stronghold region and their leading position in the country as a whole are both in jeopardy. Mr Fernando Moran, the former foreign minister who heads the list of Socialist candidates for the European parliament, used to be MP for Jaen, the olive-growing province which includes Linares and La Carolina. He says the south is 'a priority problem' and hopes it will not become a distinct world like Italy's Mezzogiorno. Government officials in Madrid say the north-south divide is less accentuated in Spain than in some other countries. 'It is not the worst south of southern Europe,' one commented. But the pattern of dependence  - on Madrid, on foreign investment, on second-hand technology, on Brussels - is far from being broken.</p>

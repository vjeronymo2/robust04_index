			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EX-PROBATION OFFICER TO STAND TRIAL IN AMBUSH KILLING  </P> <P> A former probation officer was ordered Wednesday to stand trial in the ambush  slaying of a girlfriend, a nurse who authorities said was shot when she stopped  her car to help a man who appeared to be injured in the street.  </P> <P> A Studio City doctor identified Giles Aubrey at a preliminary hearing in San  Fernando Municipal Court as the man he saw rise from the pavement and shoot  Lucille Marie Warren, 40, of Inglewood on Feb. 22.  </P> <P> Aubrey allegedly lay in the street in the hills above Studio City, apparently  pretending to be injured, a few blocks from a residence where Warren worked as  a night nurse, until she passed on her way home.  </P> <P> Surgeon Philip Quilici testified that he was driving on Montcalm Avenue when he  saw Aubrey on the ground next to Warren's parked car. Quilici said he saw  Warren get out and run toward Aubrey. Detectives have said they believe that  Warren thought that the man was injured, although they do not know whether she  recognized him.  </P> <P> Quilici said that as Warren reached the front of her car, Aubrey stood up,  holding a small, dark object, which detectives say was a gun. As Quilici drove  past, he heard three gunshots, looked in his rear-view mirror and saw Warren on  the ground, he said.  </P> <P> She had been shot four times, once in the head, police said.  </P> <P> Minutes later, the surgeon testified, he saw Aubrey following him in an orange  car. He said he saw Aubrey's face and knew immediately that it was the same man  he had seen on the ground.  </P> <P> Quilici testified that he was afraid that Aubrey was going to harm him, but  they came to an intersection and Aubrey drove in another direction. Quilici  said he returned to give Warren emergency aid, using a section of a neighbor's  garden hose to give her oxygen until paramedics arrived.  </P> <P> Warren died four hours later without regaining consciousness.  </P> <P> Richard D'Arbo testified Wednesday that he was driving through the area when he  saw Warren lying in a pool of blood on the road and saw an orange car driving  away. D'Arbo said he could not see the driver's face, but used his car phone to  report the car's license plate number to police.  </P> <P> Authorities traced the car, registered in Arkansas, to Aubrey. He was arrested  two days later at his home near Inglewood, where he lived with his wife.  </P> <P> Warren's son and daughter, ages 14 and 15, told police that their mother, who  was divorced, had dated Aubrey for two months before her death. The children  told authorities that Aubrey had known their mother for at least four years.  </P> <P> At the time of his arrest, Aubrey was working as a hospital janitor. He had  served as a Los Angeles County probation officer for a year in 1981, but left  the job because of mental problems, including depression and anxiety, said  Deputy Dist. Atty. Edwin Greene.  </P> <P> Greene said Aubrey was jealous of Warren, suspecting that she was seeing other  men, although there is no evidence she was.  </P> <P> Aubrey, who spent about five months in the County Jail's mental ward until  doctors decided that he was competent to stand trial, faces the death penalty  if convicted because of the special circumstance that he lay in wait for  Warren, showing extra premeditation, Greene said.  </P></p>

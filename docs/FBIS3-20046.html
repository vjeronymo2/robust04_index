France and the United States  want to act against low-wage countries which distort free trade  and competition by their products, which they are able to keep  cheap thanks to low wages and poor working conditions.    GATT Director Peter Sutherland is warning against  "simplistic  arguments, which look very much like the old protectionist  rhetoric."    Everything points to the already very tense North-South  trading relations coming under even greater pressure thanks to  the new Franco-U.S. initiative. Washington and Paris want  drastic action to be taken against countries which ignore  international labor law and trade union rights. The arguments  between the United States and Beijing about the link between the  two countries' trade relations and the respect of human rights  by China have not yet subsided before new trouble has broken  out, this time with countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and  Singapore. In these low-wage countries there is no such thing  as trade union rights; workers there work for starvation wages  and children are still massively exploited.    After France and the United States made life difficult for  one another for years during the GATT's Uruguay Round, it is  striking how much they agree today on the low-wage countries.  Both countries have a virtually identical position on the  matter, and they want action to be taken -- if necessary with  economic sanctions -- against countries which do not respect  labor legislation recognized under international law.    The subject is on the agenda in the European Union (EU) as  well. Yesterday European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan  presented a report dealing with the question. Brittan is  pushing the EU governments to take a joint position in  Marrakesh. The European commissioner believes the EU must  demand that the World Trade Organization, which will shortly  replace the GATT, should pay considerable attention in the  future to violations of trade union rights throughout the world  and problems like child labor, mass forced labor by prisoners  and other social issues. Nevertheless Brittan does not want go  as far as the French and Americans. He wants nothing to do with  a crusade to impose economic sanctions against low-wage  countries.    That is also the opinion of GATT Director General Peter  Sutherland. In a speech last week in Toronto, Canada, he warned  against "simplistic demands for drastic trade remedies which  show a great similarity to more conventional forms of  protectionist rhetoric."    The new Franco-U.S. eagerness in social matters is arousing  considerable resentment in international trade union circles.  Dennis McShane, spokesman of the International Metal Workers  Union in Geneva, pointed out that, at present, Asia was the  "low-wage paradise par excellence -- without trade unions and  with unacceptable social conditions -- for every European  company which wants to avoid its social responsibilities and put  every job in European industry at jeopardy." McShane pointed  out how his federation had been campaigning in vain for years  against the terrible social conditions in a country like  Malaysia, where trade unions are not even recognized and where a  company like France's Thomson presently employs more workers for  very low wages than in its own country.</p>

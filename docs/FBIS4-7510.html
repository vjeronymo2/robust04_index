			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Milan Jelovac: "Martic's Last Card"] </F>   [Text] Are the rebellious Serbs in Croatia now using their  most recent tactics? Do the more frequent breaches on the lines  of contact come from uncontrolled groups, or are new hotbeds of  conflict being generated systematically? Is the focus of the  crisis being shifted as a part of that Serbian plan, so that one  day there is a crisis in the eastern, the next in the western,  and the day after that in the southern sector of the UNPA [UN  Protected Area]?    Does that mean that the recent more frequent military  breaches and fierce skirmishes in Lika, for example, were  incited by those in Knin who are carrying out the policy of the  Belgrade strategists on behalf of priority political  considerations and to give a signal to the international  community, to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], and to the  United States, which has finally become more actively involved  in resolving the drama of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in  Croatia?    There is no doubt that the answers are affirmative to this  entire string of questions. Knin, which has been very much  shaken politically, is today stopping at nothing in its attempts  to prove that world guarantees concerning reintegration of the  UNPA into the constitutional system of Croatia "are not  realistic," which is evidenced, according to them, by the  frequent firefights with the Croatian Army [HV] in the border  areas of the UNPA. The resoluteness of Milan Martic, newly  elected president of the self-proclaimed "krajina," in proving  that "life is no longer possible with the Croats in a joint  state," is confirmed by the constant production of breaches.  Many analysts do not even preclude the possibility that in a  subsequent development of the situation unfavorable for Martic  the krajina Serbs will encourage a general conflict with the  Croatian Army, which the international community would have to  stop because of the firepower on both sides, the devastation and  numerous casualties, and according to the formula of the Vance  Plan, the status quo would be cemented in place, which would  postpone integration of the UNPA. Such a possibility would be  the last step for the Serbian side in maintaining the status  quo, and thereby its authority in the UNPA.  <H5>  War Hysteria </H5>   Why are the rural Serbs in Croatia deciding on such radical  changes at a time when the Serbian policy of normalization of  relations with Croatia has been officially proclaimed? For  several reasons. First of all, because of the U.S. initiative  and normalization of relations between Croats and Muslims and  because of the future federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and  the confederation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. That  is, it is well-known that if Croatia accepts confederation with  the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it also gets firm  guarantees of recovery of its occupied areas. This is certainly  not at all to the liking of the krajina Serbs, who are already  announcing that the "krajina" will be annexed to the Srpska  republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thereafter also to  parent Serbia, if the Croats and Muslims agree on confederation.    As a matter of fact, the merger of the rebellious Croatian  Serbs with their Bosnian fellow countrymen is for them only a  matter of protocol in view of the high level of linkage there  has been up to now with the Bosnian Serbs and the FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia]. As a matter of fact, for a long time  now the self-proclaimed "krajina" has been in a military,  monetary, news, intelligence, and administrative alliance with  the Srpska republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina and with Serbia.  To illustrate, let us mention only the appearance of the newly  printed identity card that is in effect at the moment in Knin.  Beneath the title which reads "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"  it says "Serbian republic Krajina," and after that "Knin  Ministry of Internal Affairs."    That inclusion of the self-proclaimed Serbian state in  Croatia to that of the Bosnian Serbs is actually the last card  which Martic and company can play. With the possible military  support of the Bosnian Serbs, their position would be  considerably strengthened, and that would certainly cancel a  possible Croatian (Muslim) military solution and contribute to  an extension of the status quo. Keeping the people in a state of  war hysteria, that tried-and-true tactic of the Knin leaders, is  counterproductive in the long run, and its first adverse  consequences are already obvious--large-scale abandonment of the  area of the "krajina" and departure for Serbia. Martic is, of  course, aware of that, but so is Belgrade, and so the option of  "linking up all the Serbian lands" is new spiritual food for the  impoverished Serbian population.  <H5>  An End to All the Games </H5>   There have been many breaches in the less than two months of  Martic's "presidency," and they have been exceedingly  unfavorable for him. The crisis over the Sava bridge between  Stara Gradiska and Bosanska Gradiska, first the Serbian taking  of the bridge, the possibility of a conflict with the UNPROFOR,  and then the withdrawal, which the media moderated by speaking  of "joint control," or again the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian  Serbs, sent a clear message to Martic that there are to be no  more games with the international forces.    The downing of the Udbina Hawks belonging to the "1st  Squadron of the Air Force of the Army of the Serbian republic  Krajina" in the sky over Novi Travnik and Bosanski Petrovac was  a new slap in the face to the "sheriff of Knin," who has been  unsuccessfully concealing the redness of his cheek from his own  media public. From the public which so far has never been  officially informed that the downed planes were those which in  the past months have been rending the sky with low-altitude  passes over Knin, presumably demonstrating both to the people of  Knin and also to the UNPROFOR, the strength and spirit of the  "krajina army." An army from whose command its chief until  yesterday, General Mile Novakovic, has literally been removed.  And Major General Milan Celeketic, born in Vojvodina, has been  appointed to take his place; whether with the blessing or by the  order of Belgrade it makes no difference at all! Alongside the  dismissals from the top military leadership, Martic has also  been punishing every form of liberalism concerning relations  with the legal Croatian authorities. That is best confirmed by  the case of Dzakula and Ecimovic.    Martic is bringing up new units to the lines of demarcation  with the Croatian Army to replace the old ones. Units from the  eastern sector are coming to the southern sector, the command  personnel are being replaced with those from Bosnia or even  Serbia. The military negotiators are not being given any broad  authority, and Martic is applying Milosevic's tried-and-true  tactics of increasing the size of police forces on which one can  count, because he is aware that slightly less than half of the  electorate voted against him. That is why the war hysteria is  being maintained with new breaches, and he has been successfully  gagging his opponents.  <H5>  The Media Offensive </H5>   New (old) crisis points are dots being added every little  while on the map of Croatia. The hospital in Vinkovci is being  hit from Ceric, just recently renamed Srbac, a place not far  from Vinkovci. The extensive area of Perusic, Gospic, Licki  Osik, and Otocac is being shelled from the area of Lika under  Serbian control. Although we do not have official confirmation  of possible skirmishes in the Lika part of the theater (the HV,  the UNPROFOR, for example), the krajina media offensive, which  has been talking about violent skirmishes between the HV and  Serbian forces "west of Korenica," is indicative. Referring to  Kozjan as a battlefield where fierce skirmishes took place over  several days, the Serbian side obviously wants  internationalization of this report, which for the present has  not been verified.    Knin "state television" has even published a report, which  could not be verified, that Croatian forces held Novi Licki Osik  (renamed Teslingrad) for three days, and then withdrew.  Regardless of the authenticity of these reports, their purpose  is to create an international public opinion that would oppose  reintegration of the UNPA into the constitutional system of  Croatia, and would portray Croatia as the attacker.    If we add to that the (Serbian) firing of light antiaircraft  SAM missiles on the Spanish transport plane in the general area  of Plaski (a city under Serbian control) and its forced landing  at the airfield on Krk, and the Serbian accusation of the  Croatian side for the attack on the aircraft, the contribution  to the new Knin strategy for intensifying the crisis is quite  convincing.  <H5>  A New Cooling of Relations </H5>   How will the new "krajina tactics" of a programmed  escalation  of the conflict affect Croato-Serbian relations? Certainly  adversely, because the signing of the long-awaited complete  truce seems further away than it did a month ago. As is already  well-known, a cease-fire is a first step toward establishment of  a political dialogue between Zagreb and Knin. But recent events  have not only put symbolic distance between Zagreb and Knin,  they have also postponed the entire process of normalization  between Zagreb and Belgrade. The obvious halt in the process of  warming relations between Croatia and the FRY is also indicated  by the unfulfilled promises made during last month's visit by  Zeljko Simic to Zagreb. It was agreed that offices in Belgrade  and Zagreb would be opened by the end of February. So far,  nothing has come of the announced reestablishment of telephone  lines, and few people believe any longer in the opening of the  limited-access highway, announced so optimistically for 15  March, when Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister, is  supposed to visit Belgrade.    Thus, new barricades in Croato-Serbian relations have again  been set up in Knin. And that, in the opinion of many, is the  reaction of the Belgrade headquarters and its Knin branch office  to the Washington ink with which the agreement between Croats  and Muslims was signed. We soon will see what are the next moves  envisaged by Slobodan Milosevic. Nevertheless, one thing is  predictable. He certainly will not sacrifice his pawn, Martic,  in the foreseeable future.</p>

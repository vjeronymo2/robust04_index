			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Cash-with-order adverts reprieved A European Union plan that would have prevented advertisers from demanding cash with customers' orders has been scrapped. The EU's draft 'distance selling' directive has been amended, after strong lobbying by UK advertising groups, and now omits all reference to the proposed cash-with-order ban. Under the previous draft, consumers ordering goods by post would have been entitled to wait for the goods to arrive before forwarding their cash. The Direct Marketing Association said it was 'surprised and pleased' that the Greek presidency of the EU had decided to amend the draft. The association said the cash ban would have been a 'fraudsters' charter' and some advertisers' existence would have been threatened by the increased burden of bad debt. The redrafted directive cuts out other controversial proposals, including restrictions on the way travel agents collect payment, and a clause which would have outlawed unsolicited selling by telephone. The selling of financial products is also now excluded from the draft directive as it is covered by other legislation. The remaining provisions of the draft directive are broadly in line with current industry agreements and legal restrictions on direct marketing in the UK, said the DMA. However, there were still a few clauses relating to credit card payments, books and magazines which were unacceptable, said Mr Colin Fricker, DMA legal director. The European parliament is due to consider the draft directive later this year. Concerns remain that the parliament could reverse the latest amendments. Mr Fricker said 'vigilance and pressure' must be sustained to prevent reversion to the earlier wording.</p>

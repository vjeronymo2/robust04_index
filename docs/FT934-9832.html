			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / People: Dick boards National Express Coaches tend to get treated as an afterthought when the planners sit down to devise or tinker with transport networks. One proposal currently being studied is to ban coaches from the overtaking lane of motorways, an idea which would have a disastrous effect on their journey times. Alastair Dick, newly appointed director of group planning at National Express, Britain's largest scheduled coach operator, hopes to change all that. He wants to see the needs of coach operators taken more into account and an early task will be to fight the overtaking proposal. Dick, 57, has worked as an external consultant to National Express for some time but has now been brought on board to implement his ideas. He moves to National Express at an interesting time for the company. It was floated on the London Stock Exchange last December and has since been expanding, acquiring its Dutch partner in a pan-European coach consortium and taking over the operation of East Midland International Airport last August. Dick has a background of more than 35 years in transport planning and has worked for the past 18 years as an independent consultant. He was involved from the outset in the passenger and revenue forecasts made for the Channel Tunnel project and has also worked on the planning of a network of toll motorways for the Hungarian government. He sees his main task in bringing together the different specialists involved in big transport projects. The technical side is often the easiest part but, as the British government has recently found to its cost, making sure a project will generate sufficient revenues and finding financial backers is trickier, he says.</p>

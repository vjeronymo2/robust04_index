While the ultimatum given by the NATO Council to the  belligerent sides expires on 21 February, negotiations between  Bosnian Serbs and Muslims in Geneva have not seen any positive  results. According to the press center of the Ukrainian World  Coordinating Council, there are two approaches in Ukraine  towards the Sarajevo bombing. The first one is to support the  international community, which seems inclined to resort to  violent measures to stop the conflict; and second, to support  Russia -- openly sympathetic with Serbia and intent on delaying  any forced outcome. Here is how Ivan Drach, chairman of the  Ukrainian World Coordinating Council, commented on this issue:    I would say that the truth is somewhere in between these two  stances. All those events affect the interests of Ukraine,  ethnic Ukrainians living there, and Ukrainian soldiers serving  in peacekeeping battalions stationed in that region. Given the  above factors, let me say that our position should be well  balanced. The shelling of Sarajevo is, so far, a sort of  intimidating action, and not a combat operation yet. Both sides  were offered one more chance for reconciliation. After all, the  bombing threatens to become another spiral in the escalation of  violence. This time, Serbian President Milosevic threatens all  of Europe, saying that he cannot guarantee the security of UN  peacekeeping forces after any air strikes. This should make all  those who assumed the peacekeeping mission think twice before  deciding on this serious move.</p>

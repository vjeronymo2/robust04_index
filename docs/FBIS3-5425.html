			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Karenni National People's Liberation Front  [KNPLF] has issued a statement on the cease-fire talks with the  State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]. The statement,  issued on 27 February, showed optimism that the cease-fire  agreement between the KNPLF and the SLORC would be signed in the  near future. It stated that the present world situation and  Myanmar's [Burma] circumstances have shown that all political  problems can be solved peacefully by negotiation. Myanmar,  which is part of the international community, should resolve  ethnic problems and armed insurrections peacefully using  political means. The KNPLF, for the good of all the people in  the Karenni State -- who have suffered bitterly from the civil  war which has been going on for more than 40 years -- has  decided to hold talks with the SLORC. The statement also noted  that the decision was made to stop the use of Karenni people as  forced labor, prevent forced relocation, and overcome economic  difficulties. In accordance with SLORC's invitation of 18  November 1993 to hold talks with ethnic armed organizations, the  KNPLF sent Lieutenant Colonel Tin Tun to hold talks with the  SLORC on 18 December 1993. Colonel Maung Kyi, Major Zaw Thet  Naing from the No.27 military intelligence unit, and other  members from the SLORC's side held talks with Col. Tun Kyaw,  KNPLF vice chairman and commander in chief, and a delegation in  Me Thet Village, Loikaw Township, on 8 February 1994. Religious  leaders -- Roman Catholic Bishop Sotero Phamo and Baptist Pastor  Saw Ambia -- attended the meeting as observers.    The KNPLF hopes that the SLORC will be able to sign a  cease-fire agreement in the near future and believes the  bilateral talks will lead to peace for the benefit of the  Karenni people and for the development of peace, tranquility,  democracy, and harmony in the Karenni State.</p>

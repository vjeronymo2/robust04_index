			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Duran set for victory in Ecuador MR Sixto Duran was set to become the next president of Ecuador, according to exit polls issued at the close of voting in the presidential election's second round which was held yesterday. Mr Duran, 70, who had been a presidential candidate twice previously, was given 56.4 per cent of the votes by Ecuavisa television compared with 43.6 per cent for his rival and fellow right-winger, Mr Jaime Nebot, a former state governor. There were more than 5.7m registered voters in the country of 10m people. Mr Duran, a former cabinet minister and mayor of Quito, said he would be leading a government of 'action, progress and unity'. Economist Mr Alberto Dahik, who will be vice-president, is a free-market supporter. The new government has promised to pare down the state bureaucracy and ensure a stronger role for the private sector and foreign investors. Mr Duran's and Mr Dahik's parties - the Republican Union and the Conservative party - have only 17 of the 77 seats in Congress between them. The president-elect will have to form alliances with other political groups when he takes over for a four-year term from Mr Rodrigo Borja, a moderate leftist who was ineligible for re-election, on August 10.</p>

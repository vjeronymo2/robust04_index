			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> END TO EMERGENCY MEDFLY STATUS SEEN  </P> <P> Orange County supervisors, who have been forced to grapple with declaring a  county state of emergency every two weeks for the past six months because of  the Mediterranean fruit fly, will gratefully wash their hands of the subject  today, officials predicted.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Don R. Roth circulated a letter to his colleagues Monday in  which he asked them to join him in formally ending the state of emergency now  that the state has completed its aerial malathion-spraying program in Orange  County.  </P> <P> Under state law, the county was obligated to review its emergency declaration  every two weeks. That process had become a forum for citizens to complain to  the supervisors, creating some tense sessions and prompting disagreement among  board members. Although none of the board members supported aerial spraying of  the controversial pesticide, the supervisors differed about the best way to  intervene in the state-mandated program.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 500,000 PACK BEACHES IN SEARCH OF A COOL FOURTH  </P> <P> Mission Boulevard was jammed all day Tuesday. Parking along Pacific Beach was  chock-full by 10 a.m., and police were already setting up barricades and  warning motorists no lots were vacant and no curbs taken.  </P> <P> On Ocean Beach, lifeguards had rescued 18 swimmers from the surf by  mid-afternoon. But on Black's Beach, where swimwear and all-other-wear is  optional, not one rescue call was sounded.  </P> <P> "People at Black's don't get in the water much," said lifeguard David Humphrey.  "People at Black's Beach do their thing in the sand."  </P> <P> It was the Fourth of July on San Diego County beaches. By day, there was sand  and sun. By night, several gigantic fireworks displays up and down the coast.  </P> <P> And all day long, unbearable heat in the inland areas of the county sent  thousands of residents west seeking cooler ocean breezes, and relief as the  temperature hit 105 degrees in Fallbrook, Ramona and Santee.  </P> <P> The Mission Bay Harbor Patrol estimated that 500,000 people turned out to the  beach and bay. And while the crowd of half a million -- large but apparently no  record, according to Harbor Patrol officials -- smothered almost every inch of  sand available, police surprisingly reported no major fights or disturbances.  </P> <P> "It seems to be primarily a family-type crowd," said one San Diego police  communications officer, noting that there were no significant incidents along  the water.  </P> <P> "It's mostly been barbecues and that kind of thing."  </P> <P> Added Humphrey: "Everyone's been really good. The police are out here in full  force. We let them take care of the legal problems, and we concentrate on the  water."  </P> <P> Concentrate they did.  </P> <P> By nightfall, lifeguards had conducted a total of 68 rescues. Again not a  record, officials said, but still something to keep lifeguards' eyes trained on  the water, tides and unusual rip currents. And Humphrey said there probably  would have been more rescues for such a large crowd, but the water temperature  was only 60 degrees by midday, which he said is cooler than normal.  </P> <P> Otherwise, he said, more swimmers would have meant more rescues. But lifeguards  were taking no chances.  </P> <P> "On south Pacific Beach, we've had a high rip current," Humphrey said. "It's  been pulling pretty hard all day.  </P> <P> "So we've had a lifeguard hanging around in the water out there. But don't  worry. He's an experienced swimmer and he's wearing fins and all that. He knows  what he's doing."  </P></p>

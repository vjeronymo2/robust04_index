			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Guinness pint with a touch more froth - Other Companies There is little excitement over the full year figures from Guinness, reporting on Thursday, since it forecast them on the completion of its deal with LVMH in late January. It expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 905m, compared with an underlying Pounds 920m the year before. From that will be deducted a Pounds 30m charge for UK pensions and a charge of Pounds 173m on the LVMH transaction, leaving Pounds 702m.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Rise in raw material prices fuels UK fears of inflation The cost of raw materials used by British manufacturers rose significantly last month as the surge in world commodity prices pushed up the expense of imported materials. The rise fuelled fears that there could be price pressures in the pipeline which might increase the UK's currently low inflation rate. The cost of goods leaving factory gates last month rose at a relatively subdued rate, suggesting that many companies are still being forced to absorb the rising costs. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the price of goods purchased by manufacturing industry rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent last month and by 5.7 per cent in the 12 months to September. The rise was larger than the City had expected. In August the annual growth rate was 3.9 per cent. The cost of goods leaving factory gates increased by 0.2 per cent in September, however. Measured without the volatile elements of food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, output price inflation grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in September and by 2.1 per cent over the 12 months. The prices of imported materials, especially commodities such as coffee and copper, rose particularly sharply. Consequently, the sharpest price increases were reported in manufacturing sectors with greater exposure to world commodity prices, such as the pulp and paper, metals, rubbers and chemicals sectors. The Treasury said yesterday that the underlying inflation trends remained very benign. 'This is a sharp price increase, but it is from a pretty low level,' it said. In addition, any rise in material costs should be partly offset by the fact that unit wage costs - the key component of business costs  - had fallen slightly. Nevertheless, City economists yesterday pointed out that last month's rise had come after several months of increases in output costs. Some analysts suggested that this indicated companies were increasingly seeking to pass on the recent price increases. Others argued that customer resistance to price increases remained strong and warned that the recent surge in commodity prices might squeeze corporate margins in those sectors that were highly commodity dependent.

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: French inflation stays low French consumer prices rose by between 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent last month, giving a relatively stable annual inflation rate of just under 1.7 per cent, according to Insee, the national statistics office. The monthly rise, in line with expectations, reflected an increase in prices for fresh foods. Most other sectors, including manufactured goods and public sector services, showed a slower rate of increase than in October 1993. The release of the inflation statistics coincided with an Insee survey which showed a small decline in French consumer confidence last month. Officials said the decline reflected increased concern about the persistence of high unemployment, despite broader economic recovery. In September, unemployment increased by 14,000 to a record high of 3.35m, or 12.7 per cent of the workforce. Russia's economy showed the first signs of rebound in three years last month, with gross domestic product growing 4 per cent from October 1993 after falling 14 per cent year-on-year in September. Last year, GDP contracted by 12 per cent. German retail sales in September rose a real 1 per cent from August, but year-on-year they were down 1 per cent. Norway's consumer prices rose a stable 1.7 per cent in October year-on-year.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / MI6 bugged embassy in UK, says Iran The British intelligence service has bugged Iran's embassy in London, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia. Mr Rafsanjani, quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA, said Iranian embassy staff had discovered 'the hidden microphones installed by the British MI6'. The agency said in a brief report that Mr Rafsanjani made the charge in a speech in Tehran. 'The British government has launched propaganda moves in order to overshadow the issues,' it quoted him as saying. Last month Britain accused Iran of holding secret contacts with the Irish Republican Army, fighting to oust Britain from northern Ireland. Tehran denied the charge. Ties between the two countries are also strained by Iran's call for the death of British novelist Salman Rushdie whose book The Satanic Verses is condemned as blasphemous by many Moslems.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Heath accuses Thatcher of inciting rebels SIR EDWARD Heath exacerbated Conservative divisions yesterday by accusing Baroness Thatcher, his successor as prime minister, of inciting Tory MPs' opposition to Maastricht and the government. Sir Edward also said that Mr John Major, the prime minister, should stop being 'quite so nice'. At the same time as Sir Edward was warning Mr Major that the Tory right wing could never be appeased, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, was preparing a speech urging Britain to fight for a Europe 'in our own image'. But he appealed for loyalty, saying that as ratification of Maastricht neared, 'the Conservative party is visibly pulling together on Europe'. Mr Howard said in Folke-stone: 'The Tory vision is of a wider Europe dedicated to free trade, decentralisation, deregulation, low taxation, and above all, a low-cost Europe, flexible enough to compete with the dynamic economies of the Far East.' The renewed tension between Euro-enthusiastic and Euro-sceptic wings of the Conservative party will serve as a warning to the government that its Maastricht problems are far from over. This is in spite of its success this week in pushing ahead with the treaty legislation, helped by Liberal Democrats. Speaking on Channel Four television, Sir Edward said there was 'no doubt' that Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, were inciting rebel Conservative MPs. 'We see Lord Tebbit sitting in the lobby just by the entrance to the members' chamber and grabbing people and trying to influence them, and they are taken down to Lady Thatcher's room in the Lords where they are also addressed and where she also attempts to influence them against Maastricht and against the government.' Sir Edward said Mr Major 'simply mustn't be quite so nice'. He added: 'There is one thing that one always has to remember in my party which is you can never appease the right wing. Never. You live happily with them but you recognise they will not accept your general policies and they will, wherever possible, protest.' He complained that Maastricht opponents had stood on the Conservative ticket at the last election. 'If they wanted an election to object to Maastricht they can form their own party. Or they can stand as independents. That is the honourable course,' Sir Edward said. Separately, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday warned at a Scottish conference that his party's support could not be taken for granted by ministers: 'We are an independent party in this. We do not toe the Tory line.'</p>

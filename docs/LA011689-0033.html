			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUD PROBLEMS;  </P> <P> KEMP SPURS HIGH HOPES ON RIGHT, LEFT  </P> <P> It was "Black Monday" -- Oct. 19, 1987. The Dow Jones Average had just fallen  more than 500 points and a group of young stockbrokers had gathered in a  Manhattan nightclub to listen to a speech by Jack Kemp, who was then a  Republican presidential candidate.  </P> <P> Stunned by the events of the day, some people in the audience expected a stern  lecture about Wall Street run amok and about the need for new brakes on the  economy. They did not know Jack Kemp.  </P> <P> The only cure for an ailing free enterprise system is more freedom, Kemp  argued. Fiercely ebullient, he talked about a "Kemp bull market" fueled by  reduced taxes, lower interest rates and less government interference that would  spread prosperity from Wall Street to the South Bronx and beyond.  </P> <P> "I want to unleash the power of entrepreneurial capitalism not only in New York  City but in Liberty City, Miami, in East St. Louis and in Watts," he said.  </P> <P> Now, it appears that Kemp will have a chance to test his vision of capitalism  for the urban poor and do it amid the sort of crisis atmosphere that the former  professional football quarterback says he relishes.  </P> <P> President-elect Bush has nominated him to be secretary of Housing and Urban  Development, a position that could quickly make Kemp one of the most watched  officials in the new Administration. Awaiting him will be the decade's harvest  of shame, the million or more homeless people who are HUD's most conspicuous  constituents.  </P> <P> Bush has promised a "kinder, gentler America," and the sincerity of that  promise will be gauged in large part by what HUD and other domestic agencies do  in the inner cities to ease the pain of homelessness, joblessness, drug  addiction, gang violence and economic stagnation during a period of acute  fiscal austerity.  </P> <P> The nomination of Kemp, until this year a congressman for 18 years from Upstate  New York, is raising expectations on both the right and the left. Conservatives  remember him as one of the architects of Reaganomics and see him as one of  their closest kinsmen in the Bush Administration. Many congressional liberals  recall Kemp as a friendly adversary who was committed in his own way to making  a better life for the urban poor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cranston Optimistic  </P> <P> California Sen. Alan Cranston is one of the optimistic Democrats. He is  sponsoring a bill that calls for an expensive new federal housing program that  could quickly put him at odds with Kemp. But aides say Cranston isn't worried  about that.  </P> <P> "He (Cranston) feels good about the nomination. He feels Kemp is someone we can  work with," said Don Campbell, a housing specialist on Cranston's staff.  </P> <P> But many of the people who like Kemp have less affection for his ideas. Kemp  has long championed the view that the poor need fewer handouts and more  incentives to own their homes and start their own businesses.  </P> <P> So far, there is no serious opposition to his nomination, but there is plenty  of apprehension in the air as people wait to see how Kemp responds to the most  urgent question awaiting the next HUD secretary: What can be done about the  growing shortage of low-income housing?  </P> <P> The crunch began in 1983 when the number of poverty-level families in the  nation began to overtax the supply of affordable housing, according to an  analysis by the U.S. Conference of Mayors.  </P> <P> Kemp's voting record reflects a longstanding opposition to increased federal  spending for new housing. However, people close to him caution against  prejudging him from his votes.  </P> <P> "Some votes were cast on HUD and on housing issues out of loyalty to the Reagan  Administration. I think now there are areas where you might expect a different  approach," said Mary Brunette, Kemp's press secretary. Kemp is not granting  interviews while his appointment is pending.  </P> <P> A nationally known real estate developer, James W. Rouse, a strong advocate of  housing construction, met with Kemp this week at Cranston's behest and came  away optimistic.  </P> <P> "The difference between Kemp and some other conservatives is that he  acknowledges that the shortage of low-income housing is a terrible problem,"  Rouse said.  </P> <P> If his nomination is approved by Congress, Kemp will take over an agency whose  declining budget and prestige have made it a ghost of its former self. Under  the Reagan Administration, HUD funding for low-cost housing was cut by nearly  80%. At the same time, HUD's principal programs of economic assistance to  cities were either eliminated or severely curtailed.  </P> <P> Nor can the next HUD secretary expect the level of political support in  Congress that heads of agencies enjoyed during the 1970s. As a result of  population shifts, members of Congress from cities are now outnumbered more  than 3 to 1 by suburban representatives. In 1970, urban legislators were in a  majority.  </P> <P> Kemp would be assuming an office that has lost much of its sway over domestic  policy. The man whom Kemp would succeed, Samuel R. Pierce Jr., was nicknamed  Silent Sam and cast such a small shadow across official Washington that  President Reagan, who appointed Pierce to the Cabinet job, once mistook him for  a mayor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Highly Visible  </P> <P> The voluble Kemp would surely cut a different figure. Friends and foes say that  Kemp's energy, combined with his influence in the White House and Congress,  will ignite national debate on the problems of the cities.  </P> <P> "Kemp will generate debate. Once the debate starts, we'll win," said Maria  Foscarinis, Washington counsel for the National Coalition for the Homeless.  </P> <P> Rep. William H. Gray III of Philadelphia, a leading House Democrat and vice  chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, speaks fondly of Kemp's evangelical  zeal and predicts that Kemp will turn HUD into a bully pulpit for cities.  </P> <P> "I used to tease Jack, 'What you really wanted to be in life was a black  preacher,' " Gray said.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure what he will be able to accomplish with the limited resources at  his disposal, but he will raise the issues. The world will come to know who  Jack Kemp is. His boss in the White House will know who he is. That alone will  be a welcome difference."  </P> <P> Kemp's ties to black and Latino Democrats in Congress distinguish him from many  other conservatives and help explain the enthusiasm some liberals in Washington  have expressed about his nomination.  </P> <P> On this subject, Kemp is not shy about blowing his own horn.  </P> <P> "I take a back seat to no one in my ability to reach out to the blue-collar  worker, to Hispanics, to blacks and folks at the grass-roots level," he said on  the campaign trail last year.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert Garcia, a Democrat who represents the South Bronx, one of New  York's most destitute neighborhoods, still speaks with amazement at the  friendship that developed between him and Kemp.  </P> <P> "We were having a memorial for Munoz Marin (the late Luis Munoz Marin, former  governor of Puerto Rico) when all of a sudden this fellow Kemp gets up to  speak. I was dumbfounded. Here was a complete right-winger, getting up and  speaking with such knowledge and such praise about Munoz and about Puerto  Rico," Garcia said.  </P> <P> "I quickly learned he was someone who was not afraid of blacks or Hispanics. We  became fast friends and we started working on things. . . . They called us the  odd couple."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urban Projects  </P> <P> Together, Kemp and Garcia sponsored a bill to create urban enterprise zones.  The legislation was never fully enacted. It remains the subject of intense  debate, and it lies at the heart of Kemp's congressional agenda for rebuilding  inner cities.  </P> <P> Enterprise zones take their cue from prosperous Third World cities, notably  Hong Kong, where rapid economic growth has been attributed, in part, to an  absence of taxes, government red tape and regulation. The Kemp-Garcia bill  sought to foster a similar business climate in depressed areas of American  cities.  </P> <P> Congress passed the bill but withheld the federal tax credits that the authors  proposed. Meanwhile, several cities around the country have been able to set up  enterprise zones free from some local levies and regulations.  </P> <P> Conservatives, including officials of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation,  where Kemp is working for the time being, predict that enterprise zones will  take root across the country once Congress agrees to the tax incentives that  were originally intended.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Further Action Urged  </P> <P> But others argue that the federal government must do more. A study by the Urban  Institute, a Washington foundation, of several successful enterprise zones  concluded that tax abatements and deregulation were only the first steps.  </P> <P> "Far from creating an environment of no government and unfettered free  enterprise," the study said, successful zones have required hefty expenditures  from local governments for assembling land, upgrading utilities, improving  police and fire protection, providing technical assistance to businesses and  training for disadvantaged employees.  </P> <P> However, the debate over enterprise zones pales compared to the fight over  housing policy that the next HUD secretary will have to resolve.  </P> <P> Defenders of the Reagan Administration, which all but shut down federally  subsidized housing construction, contend that in the past HUD building  subsidies had amounted to a pork barrel for contractors and federal  bureaucrats.  </P> <P> A new book by the Heritage Foundation urges HUD to stick to its current system  of rent subsidies. Subsidy certificates, called vouchers, are distributed to  lowincome renters who are then left to find available housing. The Heritage  Foundation argues that under the voucher system more poor Americans are  receiving housing assistance than ever before.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blamed for Homelessness  </P> <P> Congressional liberals, on the other hand, blame the ballooning homeless  population on the decision to stop subsidizing new housing. As the housing  shortage worsens, the voucher system becomes more of a cruel hoax, its critics  say. "It's like giving hungry people food stamps to shop in an empty store,"  said Derek Shearer, a professor of public policy at Occidental College.  </P> <P> A housing task force funded by Congress and chaired by James Rouse recently  recommended a $3-billion construction program for low-income housing. The  National Coalition for the Homeless and other groups are pushing for a  $15-billion effort.  </P> <P> But over the various wish lists looms the federal deficit, an inky cloud that  could envelop the most visionary HUD agenda.  </P> <P> "It may not matter who runs HUD, be it a Scrooge or a spendthrift," said a  senior staff member on one congressional budget committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tribute to Kemp  </P> <P> In such a difficult time, it is a tribute to Kemp that both conservatives and  liberals have high hopes for him.  </P> <P> "Kemp's nomination is a master stroke. It shows you can have a kinder, gentler  nation with tough, conservative policy," said Stuart M. Butler, one of the  contributors to the Heritage Foundation's recent book dealing with HUD.  </P> <P> However, Democrat Stanley Treitel, director of a Los Angeles nonprofit  corporation that builds low-income housing, believes that Kemp ultimately will  side with those who say the federal government must build more housing.  </P> <P> Treitel knows Kemp and admired him enough to contribute to his presidential  campaign.  </P> <P> "I'm optimistic about him because I know what kind of person he is," Treitel  said. "Once he starts traveling around the country and sees that he is dealing  with people, with human lives, he will respond. It may mean he has to change  his philosophy somewhat, but I think he is capable of that."  </P></p>

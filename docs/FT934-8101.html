			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Elections in Russia: The people need persuading - Russia's election campaign is off to a good start with a wide range of political views on offer The Russian election campaign resembles a contest between ardent suitors for the hand of virgin voters. Both sides are new to the game of wooing. The battle is turning into an impressive display of debate and argument, as people size up how far the candidates can fulfill their hopes and calculations. This does not come naturally. A people long told that only unanimity was acceptable has more than a few tremors about political division, while the discrediting of party politics, common to all post-communist societies, makes candidates defensive about their ambitions and vague about their programmes. But it is, raucously, under way. Some 13 parties, covering the left-right spectrum much more fully than in more settled democracies, are now registered and their chosen runners and supporters are on the stump. The only notable political absence is that of a hardline nationalist party: Mr Sergei Baburin's Russian National Union was disqualified for non-compliance with the registration requirements (though he wants to be selected as a candidate in his home town of Omsk). But since all the other parties - especially the Communist party of Russia - stress the need for nationalist revival, it cannot be said that the idea itself lacks expression. Some parts of the written press are lively and varied. Izvestiya, the most prestigious of the post-Soviet papers, is firmly pro-Yeltsin and for the liberal Russia's Choice bloc of Mr Yegor Gaidar; others are as vociferously against. Pravda, back on the news-stands, is solidly anti-Yeltsin and still claims national coverage; papers such as Trud and Selskaya Zhizn, serving union members and farm-workers respectively, are at best sceptical of the authorities; and of the new upmarket papers, Nezavisimaya Gazeta is increasingly sharply critical. Television, the dominant medium, does not show such diversity of opinion. Mr Vyacheslav Bragin, chairman of the main state channel, Ostankino, is a candidate for Russia's Choice and is wholly a Yeltsin man. Mr Oleg Poptsov of Russian TV, the other main state-owned channel, is less so, but says he is under constant pressure to conform to the government line. A bulletin on Russian TV last week, chosen as a random example, illustrates the problem. It began with a piece on the new constitution, the text of which had been published that day. The accompanying voice told the story of a document replete with citizens' rights and advantages, while under the commentary, a gentle musical theme swelled. It could have been a commercial. The danger is only in part an overweening political establishment which has placemen at the top of television. This control rests upon a profession which has insufficient regard for itself as a separate estate. TV still gets little of its support from advertising and most papers (including Pravda) depend on subsidies. Further, the psychology of journalists over 30 was formed in Soviet times, when freedom had a very low ceiling - even the best editors are grateful to a president who has brought them out of servitude. As a result, the themes of the campaign remain insufficiently clarified. Grand statements and allegations surface like spouting whales, then submerge unchallenged. But the themes, and the personalities around which they are entwined, are clear enough. The party which is the nearest to being the governing party - Russia's Choice - campaigns on a continuation of reforms as essential both for a fight against inflation, now at about 20 per cent a month, and, as Mr Gaidar put it recently, to close the widening gap between rich and poor. Every other party, including those which proclaim themselves as pro-market, argue that it is precisely the policies pursued by Mr Gaidar which create inflation and the gap between rich and poor. Mr Alexander Vladislavlev, a leader of the group Civic Union for Stability, Fairness and Progress, said that his group - backed by Russia's industrial lobby - stood for 'therapy without the shock': he has not been the first nor the only politician to use the phrase. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin group, says that 'it is useless to try for tight money policies while property is not widely dispersed and the economy is dominated by monopolies'. The Party of Russian Unity and Accord, led by deputy premier Sergei Shakhrai, tempers its support for further market reforms with a promise to develop 'an active industrial policy, directed to the support of branches and enterprises able to become the locomotives of economic growth'. Where Yeltsin/Gaidar policies have been blamed for weakening the sinews of the state, all the opposition parties in different ways pledge their commitment to strengthening these again. Some, especially the Civic Union and the Communists, cast more than a glance at the former Soviet Union and pledge an active policy of reforging the links between the republics. Where Yeltsin/Gaidar are seen to have weakened Russian power by an overharsh dose of market reform, the other parties propose a strengthening of the state - consonant, of course, with the widest development of civil rights. The publication of the constitution, and Mr Yeltsin's ambiguous withdrawal of his promise to stand in elections for president on June 12 next year, are gifts for the opposition. Mr Yavlinsky, himself a declared candidate for the presidency, is particularly scathing about Mr Yeltsin's apparent decision to serve his full term to 1996. The Communist party, ably led by Mr Gennady Zyuganov, has accused Mr Yeltsin of giving himself more powers than 'tsars or pharaohs' - a deliberate if breathtakingly impudent attempt to tar Mr Yeltsin with the brush of reaction. Polls reveal a country confused and as yet far from convinced by anyone. Russia's Choice routinely scores the highest approval rating: but in a recent Moscow poll it received 37 per cent of the vote and the Communist Party 26 per cent. Mr Zyuganov said last week that he aimed to 'unite the patriotic forces' - a bid for the supporters of Mr Baburin's banned Russian National Union, many of whom would naturally tend towards the Communists. Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg and himself a broadly pro-Yeltsin candidate in the Movement for Democratic Reform, said that 'the likelihood is for a parliamentary mosaic of parties, none of which dominate, which turns out like the first Polish parliament where they couldn't agree on electing a prime minister'. Mr Genady Burbulis, a founder-candidate of Russia's Choice and a former first deputy premier, sees a similar danger - with the Communists-nationalists making a strong showing. An internal government paper, published by Nezavisimaya Gazeta, produced figures of 30-33 per cent for Russia's Choice, 33-36 per cent for the centrist parties like those of Mr Yavlinsky, Mr Shakhrai, Mr Sobchak and Civic Union; and 15-20 per cent for the hardline opposition, led by the Communists. There is no doubt that Mr Gaidar faces real opposition. Unable to canvass properly because of his government duties he carries the load of past unpopular policies. Temperamentally unable to put on a populist act, Mr Gaidar and his colleagues have considerable disadvantages to set against their undoubted advantages in the media and among the elite. If Russia's Choice does well, however, he can claim the premiership: if not, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the present prime minister, a man whose stature has grown in the country, will probably be asked to continue. Shrewdly, he chose to declare himself as merely an honest public servant above all politics and is not standing for election. Three weeks from Sunday, Russia will make her choice for a free parliament, the first time the country has been able to exercise such a right in more than three-quarters of a century. The political atmosphere is still fragile and tense - it is, after all, only six weeks since tanks were shelling the last parliament. But the signs are good.</p>

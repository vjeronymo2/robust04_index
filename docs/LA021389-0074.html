			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMO: KIDS' VIDEO  </P> <P> "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Cinderella" aren't just big hits with  children. They are the top-selling videos of any kind. The third best-selling  video is Disney's "Lady and the Tramp," followed by Paramount's "Top Gun" and  "Good Morning, Vietnam," by Disney's Touchstone unit, according to Video  Marketing News.  </P> <P> How big were videocassettes in 1988? According to Paul Kagan Associates,  consumers paid $1.5 billion last year for 95.5 million videocassettes. In 1987,  consumers spent $1.1 billion to buy 64.9 million videocassettes. Measured in  dollars, that's a 36% gain. The Carmel-based research firm predicts that  consumers will spend $1.8 billion this year on 120 million videocassettes.  </P> <P> Although videocassette sales are growing, the rental market is still much  bigger. According to Paul Kagan Associates, consumers spent $6.4 billion last  year to rent tapes -- four times what they spent to buy tapes. Rental spending  was up 23% last year, from $5.2 billion in 1987.  </P> <P> The revenue that studios make on each videocassette has dropped. Paul Kagan  Associates estimates that the videocassette producers took in $10.75 last year  for each cassette sold to consumers, compared to $11.50 in 1987. The research  firm predicts that revenue will fall this year to $10.30 per tape. DENISE  GELLENE  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NO TAKERS ON DAN RATHER CHAT  </P> <P> Amateur footage of CBS anchorman Dan Rather talking to sailors in the boiler  room of the carrier Independence was offered to other networks, but there were  no takers.  </P> <P> "I thought it was shabby," NBC foreign editor David Miller said of the tape's  quality.  </P> <P> Rather was among network correspondents on the aircraft carrier Monday as it  steamed in the Gulf of Oman.  </P> <P> The rules of the press pool required CBS to share the footage that a sailor  took of Rather as he explored the ship and interviewed crewmen.  </P> <P> Some of the footage was fuzzy and taken in poor light.  </P> <P> As Rather held the microphone, one grinning young sailor blurted out, "Hi, Mom  and Dad."  </P></p>

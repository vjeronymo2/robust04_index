			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MARC BOHAN TO JOIN HARTNELL  </P> <P> Marc Bohan, the former designer for Christian Dior, is expected to take over as  artistic director of the fashion house of Norman Hartnell, dressmakers to two  generations of British royalty.  </P> <P> If the Bohan appointment is sealed, as expected, he will become the first major  French designer to head an English fashion house.  </P> <P> The appointment of the 63-year-old Bohan would be a coup for Hartnell's  chairman, Manny Silverman, who led a consortium that rescued Hartnell from the  brink of bankruptcy in 1987.  </P> <P> Bohan, a star in the French fashion world, was abruptly dismissed by Dior in  1989 after 28 years and replaced by Italian designer Gianfranco Ferre.  </P> <P> The house of Hartnell, founded in 1924 by the late Sir Norman Hartnell, has a  prestigious past, which Silverman has said he wants to revive.  </P> <P> A romantic designer who loved full skirts, embroidery and sequins, Hartnell  designed the wedding and coronation gowns of Queen Elizabeth II and the floaty  chiffons still worn by Queen Mother Elizabeth.  </P></p>

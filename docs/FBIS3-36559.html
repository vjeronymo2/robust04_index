			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of Ukraine's </F> People's Rukh in Kiev on 30 January: "We Are Ready To Assume  Responsibility"]    [Text] On the eve of the elections to the Supreme Council,  Ukraine's People's Rukh was subjected to a brutal assault -- on  15 January 1994, the chairman of the Secretariat and cochairman  of Rukh's Central Electoral Committee, Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, was  abducted. His fate is still unknown -- this is the beginning of  the appeal by Ukraine's People's Rukh to citizens.    The steady political pressure exerted upon Rukh, the  information blockade imposed by the authorities, the pogroms in  the buildings of local Rukh organizations, and the use of force  against its activists during the election campaign have become  systematic.    As is known, the activity of political parties and public  organizations has no financial backing from the state. The law  "On Associations of Citizens" prevents political organizations  from engaging in political activity. Nor do they have the right  to receive material support from their foreign supporters.  Therefore, the parties may only act effectively if they get  assistance from collective or individual sponsors in Ukraine,  those who want to support a political force that will defend  their interests.    The offensive against those who have rendered assistance, no  matter how small, to Rukh, is an attempt to deprive our  organization of support during the election campaign.    People's Rukh consistently pursues a policy of building a  democracy in the independent Ukrainian state and of reforms that  will guarantee the well-being of the people. It actively  opposes the present corrupt authorities and promotes equality of  all citizens before the law.    If we win the elections, we will form a government that will  enjoy the confidence of the people. We are ready to take upon  ourselves the responsibility for the fate of our state.    This is what our opponents in the party in power  particularly  fear. They have decided to leave Ukraine's People's Rukh  without means of subsistence.    We appeal to you, dear friends, to support Ukraine's  People's  Rukh. We appeal to all those who strive for effective reforms  in the economy, want positive changes in society, and associate  these hopes with the People's Rukh. Your support is the pledge  of our common victory.    We will gratefully accept your donations at the following  address: 252032, Kiev, Taras Shevchenko Boulevard, 37/122 or to  bank account No. 609893 in the Commercial Bank "INKO," MFO  300261.    [Signed] Chairman of Ukraine's People's Rukh Vyacheslav  Chornovil    [Dated] Kiev, 30 January 1994</p>

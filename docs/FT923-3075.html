			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Servomex ahead but warns on second half Servomex, the East Sussex-based gas analyser and instrumentation systems manufacturer, benefited from the increasing focus on environmental matters, particularly control of process emissions, and saw interim profits advance by 13 per cent. The outcome for the six months to June 30 - Pounds 1.04m against Pounds 922,000 - was achieved on turnover ahead to Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 8.54m). However, Mr John Burton, chairman, warned that there may be a worsening of trading conditions in the shorter term and the company was therefore taking a more cautious view on the full year outcome. The interim dividend goes up to 1.9p (1.8p), payable from earnings of 7p (6p) per share.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: Dog in a Manger - Cockpit Theatre, NW8 I have seen only five plays by the Spanish master Lope de Vega (1562-1635) - he wrote at least 500, possibly 800 - but what staggers me about these few is the way he shows love and jealousy as subversive forces. Here is another superb work, which, though here receiving its first professional production in Britain, is, according to the advance blurb, perhaps the most enduringly popular of them all. The eponymous dog in a manger is a countess, Diana. No sooner does she find that her secretary Teodoro is paying clandestine attentions to her lady-in-waiting Marcela that she realises she loves him herself. Which should rule - love or social propriety? She vacillates: she wins his love, she rejects it, she punishes Marcela, she sends him away, she keeps him at court. She treats him, as Marcela remarks, like a bucket in a well - raising him only to empty him, lowering him only to desire him. Dog in a Manger is a comedy. That is, Lope makes it richly funny and gives it a happy ending, sort of. Yet its central situation is so real and disturbing that until the last minute we don't know how it will end. Or even how we want it to end. There is a wonderful ambiguity about both Diana and Teodoro. How much is her love really just possessive jealousy? And how much is his love sheer ambition? Lope never quite makes them that transparent to us, but he makes them wonderfully intense. In the most burning scene of confused emotions, Diana boxes Teodoro's nose and makes him bleed; but he, amid his shock, longs to 'stroke the hand that struck.' De Musset treated a similar subject in Don't Play With Love, recently broadcast on BBC radio, though the twists and turns of his plot culminate in a bitter conclusion. The thrill of Lope's play lies in its tragicomic shifts of tone; and its floods of oxymorons and imagery. Teodoro compares the Countess to the sun, and himself to Icarus, sure to fall for flying so near the heat; but later he likens her to a mere sunflower, turning her head this way and that. The Countess reminds him that her name is Diana, the moon, and that he may ascend into the moonlight without scorching. At her next rejection, therefore, he sees himself to a wolf howling for the moon. And so the language blooms in quick accord with the plot. The translation, by John Farndon, indulges in expletives and terms of abuse that, though funny, are out of character. It is, however, fresh and fluent and often uses rhyming quatrameters with surprising success. The staging, which Martin Lloyd-Evans directs and which was seen on the 1991 Edinburgh Fringe, is not for refined connoisseurs of verse-speaking or gesture - and yet I have known more experienced actors turn Spanish baroque drama into something far more flat, repressed and unlyrical. Jane Hillier (Diana) and David Howarth (Teodoro) lead a cast who relish all the vigour, surprises and range of this exhilarating play.</p>

Geringer, 19, of Agoura Hills, appearing in Municipal Court for  arraignment, pleaded not guilty to one count each of assault with a deadly  weapon and battery causing serious bodily injury, both felonies.  </P> <P> Judge Candace Beason allowed him to remain free on $30,000 bail and ordered him  to return to court on Nov. 19 for a preliminary hearing. Each charge carries a  maximum four-year state prison term upon conviction.  </P> <P> Geringer, accompanied to court by his parents and defense attorney Leslie  Abramson, declined to comment. He was baited by at least one bystander, who  shouted out, "Want a beer?"  </P> <P> Abramson described Geringer as "a fanatic Raiders fan" who has had a drinking  problem since age 13.  </P></p>

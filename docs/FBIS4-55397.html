			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on the meeting between Croatian and Bosnian </F> delegations in Geneva on 13 May, including recorded remarks by  Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic; Bosnian Croat  leader Kresimir Zibak; and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate  Granic; from the "Picture Versus Picture" program]    [Excerpt] The Croatian and Bosnia-Herzegovina Croat  delegation arrived in Geneva on 13 May. They met with the  Bosniak delegation immediately on arrival. Judging by the  statements made after the meeting, we can expect the agreement  to be signed successfully tomorrow, although it is still unclear  what the territorial percentage ratio will be -- 51 to 49, as  recommended by the international community, or 58 to 42 as  proposed by the Bosniaks and Croats.    [Silajdzic] We arrived at the conclusion that we all wish to  negotiate, that a peaceful solution would be the real solution,  if it can be found. What awaits us now in the implementation of  this agreement -- which has become a constitutional obligation  -- is a series of extremely serious issues to be resolved in  practice.    On the other hand, we hope that the international community  will accept this agreement as the first step in finding a final  peaceful solution for both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. He  hope we can count on the international community regarding a  just solution. This means that genocide and aggression must not  be rewarded.    [Zubak] As Mr. Silajdzic said, at today's meeting we  analyzed what we had agreed on in Vienna and reconfirmed the  assessment that we had reached agreements in Vienna that were in  the interests of both peoples. We also concluded that the  reactions among the world public were positive, as well as on  the home political scene, which instills hope and confidence  that what was agreed in Vienna will be translated into practice  as well.    After that we discussed several concrete questions. As Mr.  Silajdzic said, we agreed to immediately form a commission  charged with searching for missing persons. This commission  should resolve the issue of a number of persons imprisoned in  Bugojno and thus resolve the question of the blockade of the  road leading across Mount Vran. We will designate this  commission on the basis of parity and it will be constituted and  will begin operating within seven days. We also agreed to  convene a session of the constituent assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina for the end of this month, 30 May to be  precise, which is an approximate date [as heard], and to include  these agreements reached in Vienna on the agenda. This means  that we should proceed with the election of the federation's  president, vote on laws on the government and ministries, and  prepare other documents necessary for the implementation of the  federation's constitution.    [Granic] During the two-hour long talks we discussed a  number of important strategic issues and many vital issues of  the relationship between the federation and Croatia. This means  that we talked about the ways of ending the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which implies negotations between the  federation and the third party, and a just peace, on the one  hand and, on the other, the reintegration of the UN Protected  Areas [UNPA's] into the legal and constitutional system of  Croatia. Our view is that we shall coordinate many future  actions at various levels, including the United Nations.    In specific terms, Croatia will not agree to the lifting of  the embargo on Serbia unless the issue is linked with the UNPA's  in the Republic of Croatia.    We also talked about the problem of succession and our joint  approach to that issue, the issue of entry into Croatia from  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the movement of convoys, border crossings,  and the strategic problem of refugees and, in particular, the  issue of their return, help in rehousing them, and all other  issues of importance for ensuring that the federation can start  functioning successfully, and also the relationship between the  Republic of Croatia and the federation.

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Guatemala right wing sweeps elections The party of a former general allegedly linked with human rights abuses won Guatemala's congressional elections on Sunday, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal said. The Guatemalan Republican Front party (FRG) led by Christian fundamentalist General Efrain Rios Montt, won 32 seats in the 80-member Congress, well clear of the right-wing Party of National Advancement (PAN) with 24 seats, tribunal president Mario Guerra said. The Christian Democrat party trailed with 13 seats and other parties won the remaining 11 seats. Voters appear to have been swayed by the general's promise to root out corruption and improve security, while largely ignoring his record during his 17-month de facto rule in 1982-83. Results will be officially ratified later this week. The traditional parties which have dominated Congress in recent years and have come to be viewed with disdain by much of the electorate suffered heavily, particularly in Guatemala City, where the PAN and FRG appeared to have won 85 per cent of the vote. But the FRG's victory was undermined by an abstention rate of almost 80 per cent, reflecting the deep-seated scepticism towards Congress, which is widely considered to be deeply corrupt. The government must gain congressional approval before the end of September on a Paris Club debt rescheduling and push through tax reforms to meet commitments to the International Monetary Fund.</p>

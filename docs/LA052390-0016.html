			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> $950,000 LOSS CALLED INEVITABLE FOR SIX SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The San Diego Unified School District is helpless to prevent six of its schools  from losing a total of $950,000 in federal funds meant for schools with large  numbers of low-income students, the board told an audience of about 200 at  Tuesday's meeting.  </P> <P> A federal audit of the distribution of the entitlement program, called Chapter  1, was conducted in February and used San Diego Unified as a representative of  all the districts in California. That audit found that the district had used  improper criteria to distribute part of the $23 million the district receives  under the program, said Supt. Tom Payzant.  </P> <P> In order for the state to continue to receive money under the program, the  state must satisfy the federal Department of Education that San Diego is in  compliance with the program, Payzant said.  </P> <P> Five elementary schools and a junior high school, all in Paradise Hills, stand  to lose the $950,000 beginning with the 1990-91 school year. An appeal of the  audit's findings could freeze all the money the district is entitled to under  Chapter 1, according to a staff report.  </P> <P> Traditionally, a school being taken off the Chapter 1 program is given a  one-year grace period to prepare itself for the funding cuts. The audit,  however, found that the Paradise Hills schools were ineligible for the program  this year, and thus have lost their grace period.  </P> <P> "There's not going to be any grace period, and we don't have any choice but to  comply," Payzant said. "We are literally talking about putting millions of  dollars at stake for all the city schools."  </P> <P> The federal government requires school districts distribute the funds based on  poverty levels, with the schools with the highest poverty levels receiving  money, while those that fall below a certain level do not. The San Diego  district added an additional criterion based on academic achievement, the only  district in the state to do so.  </P> <P> "The district has used that criteria since the mid-1970s, and it was reviewed  and approved by the state," said Noble Shade, director of external funding for  the district, who said the federal ruling had not come as a surprise. "I had  always felt wary about the district's criteria."  </P> <P> Shade said that regulations and interpretations of the law have changed in the  last year, bringing the district out of step.  </P> <P> The schools that stand to lose their funding are: Boone, Field, Lee, Paradise  Hills and Penn elementary schools and Bell Junior High School.  </P></p>

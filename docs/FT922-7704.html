			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Travel: Awful intimacy with tablemates worth Dollars 500,000 WE DEFINE our horror journeys according to our tastes, said novelist Martha Gellhorn, whose own definition of what makes a journey wholly or partially horrible was boredom. 'Add discomfort, fatigue, strain in large amounts to get the purest-quality horror,' she wrote in Travels With Myself And Another, 'but the kernel is boredom. I offer that as a universal test of travel; boredom, called by any other name, is why you yearn for the first available transport out. But what bores whom?' One sort of travel that did not appeal to her was grand culture touring  - the antiquities of Greece, Ethiopia's Coptic churches - with a charming scholar-lecturer to inform and instruct. But cruising was just as bad, even though it was a 'super delight' to large numbers of travellers. 'It bores me even to think of such a trip, not that I mind luxury and lashings of delicious food and starting to drink at 11am with a glass of champagne to steady the stomach. But how about the organised jollity, the awful intimacy of tablemates, the endless walking round and round because you can't walk anywhere else, the claustrophobia?' I was reminded of Gellhorn's views on cruising when stepping aboard the 10,000-ton Royal Viking Queen, operated by Royal Viking Line, which recently made her debut in the luxury category at the tip of the top of the cruise market. The Queen cost Dollars 86m (Pounds 48m). She takes 212 passengers and boasts 135 crew, one of the highest crew-to-passenger ratios (1 to 1.6) in the cruise business. Naturally, she is completely air-conditioned. She is the cutest little number, a draught of 17 ft enabling her to navigate small scenic waterways such as the Corinth Canal, or to breeze along the Guadalquivir river to Seville, the Seine to Rouen and the Thames to the Tower of London. The Queen was built in Bremerhaven, Germany, and sailed her inaugural voyage (Palm Beach to San Francisco) a few weeks ago. Every stateroom on the Queen is an outside suite with 5 ft windows and panoramic ocean views. Measuring at least 277 sq ft (some are much larger), all suites have marble bathrooms with shower and bath, walk-in cupboards, TVs, video recorders, telephones, fridges and personal security boxes. Each suite, says Royal Viking flirtily, can be stocked with queen-size bed or twins. We are talking enormously detailed comfort here. We are talking first-rate food - sorry, cuisine - in what the marketing folk, bless them, are pleased to call 'a wide scope of dining options - from romantic stateroom repasts and casual, poolside snacks to formal, candlelit occasions with fellow passengers in the sumptuous Royal Viking Restaurant.' We are talking on-board lectures, part of a programme of 'enrichment activities.' We are talking whirlpools and a jogging track; a beauty salon and a health and fitness centre which has an aerobics room, exercise equipment, steam rooms, sauna and massage; a night club, casino and 'air-conditioned mahogany water taxis' (ship's tenders to you and me) to transport Royal Viking Queen passengers ashore in the world's 'most exotic destinations.' We are talking ship's decks inlaid with polished teak (hand-selected from timber farms, not ripped from virgin rainforests) and luxurious furnishings, including tapestries. We are also talking exceptionally large cruise fares. Just before the Queen's inaugural voyage, I spent three nights aboard her cruising prettily from St Maarten to Miami. On the first evening - presumably on the strength of my brass-barnacled blazer and my Jermyn Street necktie - I was invited to join a power-dining table hosted by Hans Golteus, president and chief operating officer of Kloster Cruise, parent company of Royal Viking Line, who claims that in the Royal Viking Queen and the (larger) Royal Viking Sun he operates the two best ships in the market. The luxury category of the world cruise market contains eight ships, amounting to fewer than 3,000 berths. Royal Viking says it has about 25 per cent of the UK market for luxury cruise holidays (say 4,000 in total) with Cunard enjoying the bulk. According to Golteus, the average daily price paid by US clients for a two-week cruise on the Queen is Dollars 9,500 per person. In the UK, his henchmen say the average price being paid by UK clients for cruising on the Queen is Pounds 9,500 per person for two weeks: apparently, Britons tend to take longer cruises, and book more expensive accommodation, than their US cousins. Could the Royal Viking Queen possibly show a meaningful return on her Dollars 86m cost? Golteus's reply was charming and convoluted, but the gist was that, well, yes, quite possibly she could; that the luxury cruise market is expected to show further significant growth; that Americans are starting to travel abroad once more, and that the Royal Viking Queen is attracting rather younger passengers than the Royal Viking Sun (55+ vs 65+). These passengers' net worth is put at well in excess of Dollars 500,000. Are you worth more than Dollars 500,000 net and unbothered by Martha Gellhorn's worries about cruising? I have looked up a few prices for you. Next Saturday, the Queen leaves Venice on a 14-day cruise to Monaco. The fares from the UK, including scheduled economy-class flights, range from Pounds 5,839 (basic suites) to Pounds 10,942 (Owner's suites I &amp; II) per person. That is: a minimum of Pounds 417 per person per day. As a matter of fact, the Queen leaves Venice at midnight and arrives in Monte Carlo at 7am on June 6, so you are really on board for 12 1/2 days and 13 nights: a minimum of Pounds 467 per shipboard day. Or Pounds 875 per shipboard day if ensconced in one of the Owner's suites, whose dimensions and appointments you would scarcely credit. As well as flights, the price includes gratuities for cabin stewardess and dining room waiters; pre- and post-cruise hotel accommodation (where indicated), but not hotel meals; all necessary transfers; internal UK flights. Not included: shipboard drinks and shore excursions. Single accommodation in standard double staterooms may be offered, says Royal Viking, at a premium of 50-100 per cent on the per-person cruise-only fare. The fare for a third adult in a double suite is the minimum package fare for that cruise. Early bookers enjoy a 5 per cent discount. Six of the Queen's cruises before August 22, start or finish in London (eg: starting July 25, 14 days, London-Copenhagen). After that, jaunts this year include: October 9, 10 days, Venice-Istanbul, Pounds 4,399-Pounds 8,079 per person; November 13, 11 days, Mombasa-Capetown, Pounds 6,093-Pounds 8,262; December 20, 17 days, Singapore-Sydney, Pounds 8,056-Pounds 11,739. The last word on the Royal Viking Queen can be left to her architect, Norway's Bjorn Storbraaten. 'When we started designing the ship,' he says, 'we decided to make it without a lot of gold, diamonds and fancy things. We decided to make a ship that was very friendly, very intimate.' Nevertheless, he reckons he has created a luxury cruise ship without peer. Me, I haven't got Dollars 500,000 to rub together, net or gross. Royal Viking Line is at Brook House, 229-243 Shepherds Bush Rd, Hammersmith, London W6 7NL. Tel: reservations: 0800-181193 or 071-734-0773; administration: 071-493-6041.</p>

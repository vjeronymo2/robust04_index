So goes a saying along the Huaihe River flowing through  east China's Anhui Province.    However, the reality proves that the saying is getting old.    Just days after the Spring Festival, which fell on February  10 this year, this correspondent paid a visit to Fengyang County  in Anhui.    In 1978, 19 households of farmers of Xiaogang Village in  southeastern Fengyang divided the farmland between themselves  and initiated the now-renowned household contract system in  China. That pioneering contract, which carried the  finger-prints of the villagers, is now kept in the Chinese  Revolutionary Military Museum.    The mist of firecrackers still hung over the county. Farmers  could be seen watering and spreading fertilizers in the fields  which were turning green. Now and then vehicles carrying  fertilizer moved past on country roads. Farmers went to the  county for buying seeds and farm tools.    Early in the morning this correspondent arrived at Guangou  Township of the county. It has just dug seven pools and  transformed more than 100 ha of low-yield farmland.    More than 60 young men were studying at "green certificate"  classes, which teach agricultural knowledge. Party Secretary  Jin Xuejin and township Magistrate Hu Baoping were busy  distributing seeds imported from Japan and Taiwan.    In a village called Chenyu Village, old men and children  were  sitting in sunlight and few grown-ups were to be seen on the  streets.    This correspondent met 40-year-old villager Zhang Qiliang  near a school. He said excitedly that farmers of Fengyang had  tasted the sweetness of the market last year. Quality rice was  sold for a yuan per jin (500 g), which meant that every family  in the village earned some 1,000 yuan more last year.    With a few words, he said goodbye and went to plant  vegetables.    In Linhuai Township, a lad squatted by the roadside studying  a brand-new two-wheel tractor which he had just bought for 3,600  yuan. He contracted some land from those who have left the  village to work in larger cities and his cattle could not cope  with all the field work.    In Xiaogang Village, which was lauded as the birthplace of  the rural reform in China, party Secretary Yan Junchang said  that the majority of the villagers still cling to the land and  the market reform of agriculture and grain price increases  greatly heightened the people's initiatives.    In 1993, the village saw a per capita added income of over  300 yuan. The secretary's family collected some 25 tons of  grain last year.    Fengyang County was well-known as a poor place in history  and  it is now among the top 100 grain producing counties of China.  In 1993, the per capita income of farmers increased by 55  percent over the previous year.</p>

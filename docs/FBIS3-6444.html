			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Speaking at a news conference on 14 March, Shigeru  Hatakeyama, Defense Agency [DA] administrative vice minister,  referred to the issue of Japan's possible participation in the  U.S.- proposed theater missile defense (TMD) plan and said that  "if a technical and special study finds (TMD) to be needed, we  want to work positively for the plan," thus indicating a  positive attitude toward developing TMD.    Vice Minister Hatakeyama then said, "If the government plans  to formulate a new defense program outline, we want to add our  position on TMD to it." In this way, he hinted that whether  Japan should participate in the plan will be decided, it is  hoped, by end of this year because the new defense program  outline is scheduled to be formulated this year.    The TMD plan seeks to protect its allied members from being  attacked by the ballistic missiles of North Korea and other  nations which are suspected of developing nuclear weapons by  locating their missiles with reconnaissance satellites and the  airborne warning and control system (AWACS) and then  intercepting them with the theater high-altitude area defense  (THAAD) system and improved Patriot missiles.    The United States has been calling for Japan's participation  in TMD. In this connection, at the Japanese-U.S. Security  Consultative Committee talks held on 11 March, DA Director  General Kazuo Aichi said that "we are considering defining  (Japan's cooperation in developing the TMD) in the new defense  program outline," thus indicating a positive view on Japan's  possible participation in TMD.</p>

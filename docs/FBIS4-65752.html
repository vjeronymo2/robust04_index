			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ALN (ADB): "Chamber -- Neofascists in the </F> Italian Government: Vigilance"]    [Text] Brussels, 18 May (BELGA) -- On Wednesday afternoon  [18 May], the Chamber dedicated a long debate to the attitude  which the government must take regarding the entry of the  neofascists into the Italian Government of Silvio Berlusconi.  It was an opportunity for Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to  repeat what he had already said to the same audience last  Thursday.    The prime minister began by reaffirming that democracy is  like a fragile plant. "So it requires constant vigilance and an  effort on the part of each individual." Jean-Luc Dehaene also  reiterated that Italy is a democratic country. "The elections  took place there in full respect of the constitutional rules.  Consequently, the results must be accepted," he said, adding  that "the Italian Government had been formed in a legally  correct manner."    "Within the European Union," he went on, "Belgium will  reaffirm the democratic principles and continue to be highly  vigilant in ensuring that they are respected. Regarding direct  bilateral contacts with foreign colleagues, it is up to each  individual Belgian minister to decide on and regulate them  personally, naturally within the context of Belgian European  policy," the prime minister concluded. He was applauded by the  entire majority, including the PS [Walloon Socialist Party],  whose bureau had asked last Monday that the government adopt a  clear position.    At the end of the debate, the four majority parties tabled a  motion pure and simple.</p>

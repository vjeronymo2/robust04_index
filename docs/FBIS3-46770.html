The three-day visit,  scheduled for 12-14 January, will be the first visit to that  country by the prime minister.    Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa says that Thailand  has played a vital role in the reconstruction of Cambodia. The  government has provided economic assistance to Thai business  people who earlier concluded agreements with various Cambodian  factions. Mr. Aphisit says that the ongoing fighting between the  elected Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge will not affect  the visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Chuan. However, he  says, among the neighboring countries of Cambodia, Thailand will  be most affected by the fighting. He reaffirms that Thailand  has always complied with the United Nations resolutions on  Cambodia.</p>

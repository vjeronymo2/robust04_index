			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Australian Deputy Prime  Minister Brian Howe said here today that the relationship  between Australia and China is an important one, and that there  are mutual benefits.    Howe, who has been here on an official visit since June 10,  made the remarks at a press conference here this afternoon.    During his stay in Beijing, Howe has met with Chinese  Premier  Li Peng, held talks with Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji and signed a  memorandum of understanding on housing and urban development  with Chinese Minister of Construction Hou Jie.    Addressing the press conference, Howe said that the economic  and trade relations are an important part of bilateral  relations, adding that such relations are growing stronger, with  a very substantial growth in two-way trade in recent years and  growing investment in China by Australia.    The deputy prime minister regarded the Australia-China  memorandum of understanding on housing and urban development as  a "practical outcome" of his current China visit, saying that  the agreement sets in place an institutional framework for  closer cooperation between the two countries in this sector.    He said that Australia has technical expertise and  management  skills to make a contribution to China's reforms and economic  construction.    Howe is scheduled to leave here for Yantai, Shandong  Province, this evening, from there continuing on to Shanghai,  the largest industrial city in China. He will attend the  signing ceremony of a joint venture agreement between the  Shanghai Bao Feng Steel Structure Co. Ltd. and Australia's  National Building Frames in Shanghai on June 16.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In referring to bank secrecy and the tapping of  telephone conversations, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  stated in Sucre:    Nobody is thinking about lifting bank secrecy. There is no  plan to this end, and still less to (?violate) the specific  rights of Bolivian people living in democracy. An authorization  issued by a prosecutor or a judge is necessary to do this.    Speaking about the militarization of the Chapare zone, the  president said:    There is no intention of militarizing the struggle against  drug trafficking. I was never in favor of that when I was a  member of the opposition, and still less so now that I am in  government.</p>

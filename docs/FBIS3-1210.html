The new parliament met this afternoon at the Palais de Congres  under the supervision of their chairman. Adjoa Ayizouwa reports.    [Begin Ayizouwa recording] Today, no one contests the fact  that Togo has become a full member of the community of  democratic nations. After the democratic presidential election  of last 25 August, which was won by the candidate of the Rally  of the Togolese People, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, who assumed  office a month later, the new National Assembly democratically  elected in February met this afternoon. The 81 legislators,  elected for five-year terms, met in accordance with Article 52  of the Constitution which stipulates that the elected National  Assembly shall meet on the second Tuesday following the official  proclamation of the results.    The meeting was chaired by Ayetor Yentumi Kouassi, deputy  for  Wawa, who had by his side the youngest member of parliament,  Oyenga Aguta, deputy for Fante. The meeting began with the  parliamentarians observing a minute's silence in memory of those  who laid down their lives for the cause of democracy, in  particular, their colleague Ede Gaston, the slain deputy of the  Action Committee for Renewal. This was followed by the national  anthem and then the opening address made by Ayetor Yentumi  Kouassi. The Wawa deputy seized the opportunity to congratulate  his colleagues for the trust placed in them by the people. He  then spoke of the purpose of this afternoon's meeting. He said  the session was being held in accordance with constitutional  provisions with a view to enabling the members to become  familiar with each other.    He did not forget to thank all those who in one way or the  other contributed to this historic work, in particular, the head  of state, the government as a whole, the International  Monitoring Committee, the National Electoral Commission, the  Supreme Court, the military and civilian observers and Force 93.  Finally, he invited the new members to put themselves at the  service of the nation. He then introduced the members of  parliament and the meeting ended after a nine-member commission  was set up to draw up the draft rules of procedure of the  National Assembly. It is composed in principle of two members  of each party represented in Parliament. The next meeting of  parliament is slated for 29 March. [end recording]</p>

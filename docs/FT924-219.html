			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Brussels scuppers VAT dodge on yachts EUROPEAN customs officials have scuppered one of the most enterprising offshore tax devices of the rich - the wandering yacht. From Friday, value added tax will be levied on yachts in any European Community country at the time of sale, under an agreement reached by finance ministers in Brussels earlier this month. Until now, yacht owners have been able to escape VAT by keeping them harboured for no more than a few months a year in any one EC country. The existing rules allow yachts temporarily held in UK waters to remain exempt from VAT. They only become liable after six months and a day, when they are classified as imports. Similar rules apply in other EC states. That has led to a large avoidance industry, with British yacht owners who live on the south coast of England keeping their boats on the French coast and other EC residents taking advantage of favourable locations in the Mediterranean such as Cyprus. Now EC mariners will have to pay immediately the VAT rate applicable in the country where they buy their boat. Those from non-EC states will remain exempt as long as they export their yachts to non-EC waters. Prudent sailors will now have extra incentive to shop around for the lowest VAT rates, which range from 14 per cent in Germany to 38 per cent on luxury goods in Italy. Transitional arrangements for the next six months will allow existing yachts in EC countries to remain as temporary imports. After that, they will be treated as imports and VAT will normally be levied. No additional VAT will be charged if the tax has already been paid in the EC or the boat is more than eight years old. There will be no VAT levied in the UK if the value of the vessel is less than Pounds 4,000. HM Customs and Excise has set up a special unit - the Dover Customs Yacht Team - to deal with questions arising from the new arrangements. There is still an escape clause. Those who moor their yachts in permanently anchored offshore tax havens such as Jersey, Gibraltar or Malta will remain exempt.</p>

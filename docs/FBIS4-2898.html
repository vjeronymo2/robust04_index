			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton warned today that the Serbs would make a mistake to  treat the U.N. and NATO forces as enemies.    Clinton told reporters at a news conference that "that is  not  what we are doing. We are trying to get them to honor their  word, and they would be making a mistake to do that."    American warplanes, under U.N. and NATO direction, carried  out air strikes against Serbian positions near the besieged  Muslim enclave of Gorazde this week.    But Clinton reminded the Serbs that the U.S. had taken no  action through NATO to try to win a military victory for their  adversaries.    "What we have done is taken military action in Bosnia  through  NATO with the approval of the United Nations to get them to  honor the U.N. rules and to encourage them to do what they say  they wish to, which is to engage in negotiations," Clinton noted.    He said that "the Serbs would be making a mistake to start  treating the United Nations and NATO forces as adverse  combatants."    Clinton also said he was encouraged by news reports  suggesting that the Serbs are willing to cease their offensive  against Gorazde and to return to negotiating table.</p>

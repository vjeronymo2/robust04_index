			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / John Sculley quits Spectrum and starts legal action Mr John Sculley, who last year was ousted from Apple Computer, yesterday resigned as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information Technologies, the small wireless data communications technology company he joined in October. 'Certain aspects of Spectrum's business are not what they were represented to be when I joined the company,' Mr Sculley said yesterday. In a Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) lawsuit filed against Mr Peter Caserta, president of Spectrum, Mr Sculley charged that he was induced to join the company by 'fraudulent misrepresentation and omissions regarding Spectrum's financial affairs, legal and regulatory prob lems and its technical and human resources'. Mr Sculley's move to Spectrum, four days after he resigned as Apple's chairman, shocked observers. He had sought the top post at IBM earlier last year and was a potential candidate for chairman of Eastman Kodak. Instead, he chose Spectrum, a Dollars 100m little-known New York state company that has not reported a profit in its 10-year life and has a history of disputes with investors and competitors. Spectrum's stock price soared 46 per cent on Mr Sculley's appointment to Dollars 11.50. According to Mr Sculley's lawsuit, Mr Caserta and other Spectrum officials then made huge profits on their stock options. Mr Sculley, granted extensive stock options when he joined Spectrum, stood to make a paper profit of Dollars 73m. Mr Sculley said he had not exercised any of his stock options, and had surrendered all options to acquire Spectrum stock. Yesterday Spectrum's stock plummeted to Dollars before closing at Dollars 2 1/4 , down from Friday's close of Dollars 5 9/16 . Mr Sculley charges he was not informed by Mr Caserta that the company was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and he was deliberately misinformed about the company's accounting practices. But Spectrum claims that 'prior to and during his term at Spectrum, Mr Sculley was fully aware of the circumstances he now cites as his reasons for departing'. Spectrum further alleges that Mr Sculley's resignation 'is clearly in violation of his employment agreement. . . and disregards his responsibilities to its (Spectrum) shareholders'.</p>

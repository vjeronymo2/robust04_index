			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Oriental's hopes ride on the Eastern Express: An English-language daily hits Hong Kong's streets today Along with the morning's delivery of newspapers and magazines Hong Kong's band of newspaper hawkers have been receiving an unexpected visit. Mr Ma Ching Kwan, chairman of the Oriental Press Group, publisher of the Chinese-language Oriental Daily News - Hong Kong's biggest selling daily newspaper - and Mr Herman Hui, an executive director, have been rising early over the past few weeks to meet the people who sell their paper on the streets. Both are there to tell the hawkers about Oriental's latest publishing venture, a daily English-language newspaper called the Eastern Express, and to ask them to give it prominent display on their stands. Eastern Express begins publication today after an 11-day delay due to technical difficulties with its computer system. It is the first English-language daily to be launched in Hong Kong since 1949, when the Hongkong Standard was started by the Sing Tao newspaper group. Mr Ma's early-morning chats are more than just a beguiling example of oriental politesse. English-language newspaper publishing in Hong Kong can be extremely profitable if you get it right. The South China Morning Post, controlled until recently by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and now by Malaysian financier Mr Robert Kuok, has the highest operating margins of any listed newspaper in the world. In the six months to the end of December 1993, the Post's HKDollars 312m (Pounds 27m) income before tax was equal to 53 per cent of its turnover; its after-tax margin was 44 per cent. It is this margin and the change in the Post's management (Mr Kuok is seen as a 'pro-Beijing' proprietor who will turn his newspaper into the 'People's Post') which finally prompted Mr Ma to dust off a two-year-old proposal to bring out a competitor to the Post. 'I don't think I can smash the Post overnight,' says Mr Hui. 'But I believe the fittest survive.' He appears equally confident in the face of questioning about press freedom after Hong Kong's transfer to China in 1997. 'I do not think a free press should be afraid of the Communist party. A newspaper should not exist according to the political weather.' The Oriental group has a mixture of pride and corporate strategy riding on the Eastern Express. First is the company's unblemished record in Hong Kong of succeeding in every publishing venture that it has embarked on. Second is the desire of Mr Ma to spread his wings beyond Hong Kong by publishing the Eastern Express for predominately Hong Kong Chinese populations in Australia and on the west coast of the US. That said, the start-up cost has not been large. According to Mr Hui, the company has invested some HKDollars 20m in the newspaper, mainly in its editorial system, and staff. Other costs are limited because the paper is printed on existing presses. Distribution costs will also be minimal, although coverage of Hong Kong will be comprehensive, because the Eastern Express will be distributed along with the Oriental Daily News. Mr Hui says that with a circulation of 60,000 the Eastern Express should break even within a year. The newspaper has been designed by Mr David Hillman, the man responsible for the controversial redesign of the Guardian in Britain in the late 1980s. He has crafted a three-section newspaper - news, views and business - which would sit happily on the newsstands of London. In its pre-launch phase the Eastern Express has billed itself as 'the paper you can trust'. Its editor, Mr Stephen Vines, former Hong Kong correspondent for the Observer and the Guardian, promises an independent newspaper containing more analysis of daily events than readers have been used to in Hong Kong. 'The thinking behind this newspaper is that we are entering a period of intense interest in news, with a demand for an independent source of information,' Mr Vines says. 'Non-aligned publications will become fewer and fewer as time goes by.' This is a dig at the Post, at present the dominant English-language newspaper in Hong Kong. It sells 110,000 copies a day. This compares with 40,000 for the Standard, a paper whose frequent redesigns and relaunches have made it seem unsure of itself. Both papers have responded to the coming competition with changes in layout and the addition of new features sections and, in the case of the Standard, another redesign. Mr David Armstrong, the Post's editor, says the Eastern Express is founded on the false premise that the change in the Post's ownership means a change in its editorial policy away from Governor Chris Patten towards China. 'Well, the expected change in editorial policy hasn't happened, and it won't,' says Mr Armstrong. He adds: 'I'm confident that we can deal with anything they might throw at us. The Post is a well-established newspaper in Hong Kong with strong reader loyalty.' If, however, success could be ordained, the Eastern Express would have it immediately. Hong Kong's advertising industry, bridling at what it sees as monopolistic pricing behaviour by the Post, seems keen for the Eastern Express to knock the Post off its perch. According to Mr Garry Brown, managing director of Leo Burnett in Hong Kong: 'It's not as if there are that many people who feel they owe the Post any favours.'</p>

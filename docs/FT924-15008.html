			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: EC monetary and economic committee PROTESTS about the failure of Mr Lamont to meet the European parliament's monetary and economic committee are expected to erupt when the group meets today, Ralph Atkins writes. Socialist MEPs are calling for Mr Lamont to stand down as head of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers (Ecofin) after refusing to meet the committee last week to report on Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Alan Donnelly, Labour MEP for Tyne and Wear, said the chancellor was giving 'no direction or guidance' to Ecofin. The parliament has no direct authority over the finance ministers' council, but the EC presidency, now held by Britain, is expected to report on its deliberations to MEPs.</p>

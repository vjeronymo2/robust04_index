			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: L'Oreal lifts sales by 12% to FFr37bn L'OREAL, the French company that is the world's largest cosmetics group, saw sales increase by 12.3 per cent to FFr37.57bn (Dollars 7bn) last year and estimated that net profits grew at a faster rate. The global market for cosmetics came under pressure last year because of the economic squeeze in important markets, notably the US, Germany, France and Italy. However, L'Oreal has strong positions in a number of sectors, notably sun products (with Ambre Solaire) and make-up (through Lancome). L'Oreal, which made net profits of FFr2.15bn in 1991, has also pursued an active product development programme. Gio, the new Giorgio Armani fragrance, was one of the most successful perfume launches in Europe last year and is now being introduced in the US. Gio took a record Dollars 25,000 in its first three days on sale at Saks Fifth Avenue, the New York department store.</p>

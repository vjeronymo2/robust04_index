			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Travel: High jinks on a voyage of sails and whales - Michael J Woods takes to the seas on a traditional tall ship IT SEEMED a long way up from the deck to the yard when I climbed the ratlines. And once up on the yard, it looked even further back down to the deck. I remember how warm and reassuring the honey-coloured wood of the lower yard felt to my bare feet as I leaned over its higher counterpart in order to remove the gaskets from the heavy square topsail. I also remember how little there was to hang on to as the ship lifted on the gentle swell of an Atlantic sheltered by the Canary Islands. But it was satisfying when the sail fell free and, safely back on deck, we heaved and sweated on appropriate ropes until the sail filled with wind and the throb of the diesel engine was stilled. Such gymnastics are not compulsory for passengers but it seemed to me that if I was going to sail a tall ship, even a little tall ship like the Anna Kristina, I ought to try at least once. Anna Kristina is a Norwegian topsail ketch and was rescued by her present owner, Hans Van De Vooren, when she was almost beyond repair. He already owned her sister ship, Anna Rosa, having given up his farm in his native Holland and moved to Norway in order to rebuild her. Anna Kristina was one of a number of similar ships originally built by the farmers of Hardanger Fjord in order to eke out a living in winter by carrying fish south along the coast and bringing goods home in return. Most of the ship was taken up by the cargo hold, with a small living area for crew fore and aft. The hold has been converted into the main saloon with a combined galley and living area centred around a table constructed to Hans' design and made from the ship's former hatch cover. There are small cabins off the saloon and bunks let into the saloon walls so, with a full complement below decks, the ship can get crowded and stuffy in tropical waters. At night, a pleasant alternative is to sleep on deck, watching the clouds scud across a sliver of moon. Not all nights were spent at anchor, and more than once we sailed through the darkness, riding foam-capped waves with a steady breeze filling the sails. Down below the old ship creaked and groaned as the waves passed beneath her; on deck we watched distant lights slide away while new ones appeared as we tacked from Tenerife towards Gran Canaria. Enjoyable as it was, we were not here just to sail a century-old tall ship. We had come to look for whales, and the irony of doing so in a Norwegian craft escaped none of us. There is a resident group of pilot whales around the Canaries together with various dolphin species. A number of other cetaceans pass through, so the chance of seeing something is high. We encountered our first pilot whales within hours of joining the ship at Santa Cruz, their rounded, slightly flaccid dorsal fins betraying their presence. Quickly, half-a-dozen of us were in the inflatable Zodiac heading towards these 15ft mammals. One of our number, Graham, was passionate about whales, and along with mask and fins he had brought a wet-suit. Almost as soon as we drew alongside the whales, he slid into the sea and finned quietly away, diving occasionally to watch them more closely. He had hardly left the boat when a bottle-nosed dolphin flew clear of the water and splashed down close to the inflatable. Graham surfaced to tell us that there were many more whales under the water than there were fins on the surface, before sliding out of sight once more. Lorenzo and Manuel, a pair of local marine biologists also on board, explained that some 200 individual pilot whales had been identified around the Canaries by using photo-identification of their distinctive dorsal fins. Inspired by Graham's enthusiasm I was keen to experience swimming with whales, but had to wait for several days until we found another pod. We had hardly spotted the animals when a high-speed launch on a commercial whale-watching trip came cutting through the sea towards them. Andy, our normally taciturn skipper, who had previously worked with Greenpeace, responded indignantly. 'That's how collisions occur. These would not be the first whales to die from being hit by a boat', he said. There is no apparent policing here, and the whales seemed remarkably tolerant of these cowboys of the sea whose sole intention appeared to be to push others aside in order to give their clients a glimpse of a dorsal fin. For Lorenzo and Manuel the answer lies in requiring all whale-watching boats to have a naturalist aboard, not only to explain the wildlife to the passengers but to control the excesses of the skippers. At least the sun was shining as I slipped over the side of the dinghy and looked down through the ocean at a mother whale with her baby close to her flank. They were moving leisurely, almost loafing in the water, but then I noticed that they were rising, coming slowly up to the surface. They broke through and breathed before going down in a single motion, arching their backs and sliding gracefully away. A week whale watching and exploring the Canary Islands aboard Anna Kristina costs approximately Pounds 360 per person plus flights. Bookings can be made through Twickers World in London, tel: 081-892-7606. Be prepared to live closely alongside other people so take a sleeping bag.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (10): Bibulous appeal of fine design - Wine SLOVENIA produces too little wine to make much impact in a world of wine lakes and over-production. But pouring drinkable wines into beautifully designed bottles is one of the ways the tiny Alpine country is trying to sell its products on foreign markets. Slovenia produces about 521,000 hectolitres of wine a year. Teran from the western Karst region and rieslings from the northern Stajersko are among the most famous. A few years ago private vintners started to market their wares in bottles designed by industrial artists and architects. The trend caught on as the larger state-owned vineyards followed suit. Gently sloping smoky grey bottles or odalisque flasks with elongated necks make a beautiful addition to any wine cellar or dinner-table. Mr Oskar Kogoj, a noted local artist, has designed a wide range of bottles. They and his other graceful creations can be seen in Regent Street, London from April 19 to May 5 at the Liberty's show on Slovene industrial design.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV'S 'SOUTH AFRICA NOW'  </P> <P> I was saddened to read Howard Rosenberg's Oct. 26 column on KCET's decision  (later rescinded) to cancel "South Africa Now."  </P> <P> When I discovered "South Africa Now" on Channel 28 I was pleased to see, for a  change, TV journalism that told not only the efforts made by South Africa's  government to dissolve apartheid but also the events that directly affect black  South Africans.  </P> <P> The series has been fair and has reported very well the atrocities that have  plagued the indigenous people as well as the country's descendants of  Europeans. So far as I am aware, this depth of coverage is unavailable  elsewhere.  </P> <P> I applaud KCET manager Stephen Kulczycki and president William Kobin for  subsequently deciding (at least temporarily) to keep the program despite  pressure from the Committee on Media Integrity and its chairman, David  Horowitz. Not allowing the perspectives of "South Africa Now" to be aired would  be political and moral cowardice.  </P> <P> RANDOLPH E. GLYMPH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

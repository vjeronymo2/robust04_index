			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The gray wolf historically occurred in the northern Rocky Mountains, including mountainous portions of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. The great reduction in the distribution and abundance of this species in North America was directly related to human activities, especially elimination of native ungulates, conversion of wildland into agricultural lands, and extensive predator control efforts by private, State, and Federal agencies. When most wolves in the conterminous United States were eradicated, the natural history of wolves was poorly understood. As were other large predators, it was considered a nuisance and a threat to humans. Today, the gray wolf's role as an important and necessary part of natural ecosystems is better appreciated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wolf reproduction was not detected in the Rocky Mountain portion of the United States for a period of about 50 years prior to 1986. At that time, a wolf den was discovered near the Canadian border in Glacier National Park. This event was presumably due to the southern expansion of Canadian wolf populations, and the wolf population in Glacier National Park has steadily expanded to an estimated size of about 65 wolves that now occupy northwestern Montana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reproducing wolf populations are not known to occur in Idaho or Wyoming. Wolves occasionally have been sighted in these states, but populations as defined by wolf experts (Service 1994) have not been established. Historical reports suggest that wolves may have produced young there several times in the past. However, based on extensive surveys and interagency monitoring efforts (Service 1994), no wolf population has persisted in these States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Wolf Recovery Efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the 1970s, the state of Montana led an interagency recovery team, established by the Service, that developed a recovery plan for the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. That 1980 plan recommended a combination of natural recovery and reintroduction be used to recover wolf populations in the area around Yellowstone National Park (Park) north to the Canadian border, including central Idaho.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A revised recovery plan was approved by the Service in 1987 (Service 1987). It identified a recovered wolf population as being at least 10 breeding pairs of wolves, for 3 consecutive years, in each of 3 recovery areas (northwestern Montana, central Idaho and the Yellowstone area). A population of this size would comprise approximately 300 wolves. The plan recommended natural recovery in Montana and Idaho, and using the experimental-population authority of section 10(j) of the Act to quickly reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park and to conduct liberal management to address local concerns about their potential negative impacts. If 2 wolf packs did not become established in central Idaho within 5 years, the plan recommended that conservation measures other than natural recovery be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512), Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of 3 Federal, 3 State and 4 interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration to Yellowstone and central Idaho. That Committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park, and possibly central Idaho, as a special nonessential experimental population with particularly flexible management by agencies and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates under that plan would be intensively managed by the States with Federal funding and thus implementation costs were estimated to be high. Congress took no action on the Committee's recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service and Forest Service, to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), that considered a broad range of alternatives on wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated that the preferred alternative should be consistent with existing law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. In addition to the National Park Service and Forest Service, the States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, USDA Animal Damage Control, and the Wind River and Nez Perce Tribes participated. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, nearly 2,500 groups or individuals that had previously expressed an interest in wolves were directly contacted and the EIS program was widely publicized by the news media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho and 7 more in other locations throughout the U.S. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people and thousands of brochures were distributed. Nearly 4,000 people provided their thoughts on issues they felt should be addressed in the EIS. A report describing the public's comments was mailed to 16,000 people in July 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August 1992, another series of 27 ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 hearings were held in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Three other hearings were held in Seattle, WA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Washington D.C. In addition, a copy of the alternative scoping brochure was inserted into a Sunday edition of the two major newspapers in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000). Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings and nearly 5,000 comments were received about different ways that wolf recovery might be managed. Public comments reflected the strong polarization that has typified management of wolves. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the EIS, provided factual information about wolves, and requested the public to report observations of wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 people that had requested information, residing in all 50 states and over 40 foreign countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

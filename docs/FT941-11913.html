			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Trade News: France in Saudi defence modernisation contracts France yesterday said it had signed contracts with Saudi Arabia worth FFr9bn (Pounds 1.01bn) to modernise four Saudi frigates, two tanker supply ships and a range of ground-to-air missiles. Saudi Arabia's cash flow problem had long delayed conclusion of the contracts, and the breakthrough only came last month when Prime Minister Edouard Balladur visited Riyadh and agreed that France would accept staggered payment for the work to be carried out by DCN, the state shipyard at Toulon, and by Thomson-CSF, Matra, Giat and other French contractors. Work on Saudi ships and missiles will start 'on payment of the first instalment' by Saudi Arabia, the French Defence Ministry said yesterday. This is due by September.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Governor. Whose ad?: Dianne Feinstein.  </P> <P> Democrat Dianne Feinstein begins running a 30-second TV commercial today that  responds to an ad that began airing in mid-July by Republican Sen. Pete Wilson.  In his ad, Wilson charged that Feinstein would use a quota system for the  appointment of women and racial minorities in state jobs and ignore whether the  appointees are qualified. Feinstein has denied both allegations.  </P> <P>  Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times political writer Bill Stall:  </P> <P> Ad: With the word "Why?" appearing on the screen, and then a San Francisco  Chronicle article headlined "Mayor (Feinstein) Opposes Charter Quotas," the  spot opens with an announcer declaring that "Dianne Feinstein opposes hiring  quotas. She's always opposed quotas. And Pete Wilson knows it."  </P> <P> Analysis: Feinstein is attempting to show that when she was mayor of San  Francisco, she opposed job quotas and she is questioning why her stand has been  presented otherwise by Wilson.  </P> <P> The question of quotas stems from a campaign appearance before a black audience  in Los Angeles last May, when Feinstein promised to have "an open and  accessible Administration" that would "appoint women in proportion to their  parity of the population -- 50%. To appoint people of color in proportion to  their parity of the population." Her statement was widely interpreted as  amounting to a quota system, although she never used that term. Since then,  Feinstein has described the proposal as a goal to be achieved over time.  </P> <P> Ad: A Chronicle article headlined "Wilson Also Vulnerable on Job Quotas" shows  on the screen as the announcer asks, "So why is Pete Wilson deliberately  deceiving you? Because by Pete Wilson's own definition, he has a record in  favor of quotas. That's right, as senator, Pete Wilson votes for government  quotas and as mayor of San Diego, Pete Wilson signed a plan to enforce rigid  hiring percentages based only on sex and race and not merit."  </P> <P> Analysis: As San Diego's mayor, Wilson set five-year goals for the hiring of  women and minorities in city government, and for the promotion of those already  in government. The Feinstein campaign produced San Diego city  affirmative-action documents that did not refer to merit, but Wilson aides  provided a statement from then-Mayor Wilson saying that the policy was intended  to "reinforce the merit principle in public employment" and was not to be  interpreted as granting preferential treatment to specific population.  </P> <P> The Feinstein ad also refers to Senate votes for programs that provide that  certain percentages of federal contracts be set aside for minority-run  businesses. These are not direct hirings by the government. Set-aside  contracting has long been a common practice in the federal government.  </P></p>

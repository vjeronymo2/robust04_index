			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION TO ALLOW LOGGING IN OWL COUNTRY  </P> <P> So, our "Environmental President" has given the green light to the logging  industry to bulldoze the spotted owl into extinction ("Logging in Owl Country  Will Proceed," front page, June 27). Only, of course, until a new task force  can devise a plan to "balance" the needs of nature with those of profit.  </P> <P> Hah! Who does he think he's kidding? The needs of profit will always tip the  scales in the end.  </P> <P> In the name of "profit" we have fouled the air and water that sustain us. We  have stripped the land and sent thousands of species into extinction. By thus  condemning the Earth and its creatures we, in the end, condemn ourselves. Where  is the profit in that?  </P> <P> HARLENE GOODRICH  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Observer: Swiss society For months, le tout Geneve has been aflutter over the succession at Societe Generale de Surveillance, the city's premier industrial company. Some speculated that the chairman, the formidable Elisabeth Salina Amorini, would herself take the chief executive's chair, soon to be vacated by a retiring Claude Goldberg. Others feared she might bring in one of her British friends from her days at Warburgs in London. Such speculation has proved inaccurate. Salina has found someone who is not British and not herself to run the group, which provides inspection services and quality control tests for governments and companies around the world. Nevertheless, her choice, Thierry Chereau, a Frenchman, at first sight looks a bit odd. Chereau comes from Source Perrier, which had a rather large quality control problem of its own a couple of years ago. But it turns out that he was part of the solution to that problem rather than its cause, having joined Perrier as chairman only a year ago. But he suddenly found himself redundant after the Swiss food group, Nestle, took over Perrier last summer. Now he will get to know the Swiss after all.</p>

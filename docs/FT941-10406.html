			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Charts send gold and silver prices down further - Market Report The main precious metals prices extended this week's falls yesterday as charts pointed to tests of the bottom ends of their recent ranges. The GOLD price closed Dollars 4.30 down at Dollars 380.40 a troy ounce while silver was off 11 cents at Dollars 5.23 1/2 an ounce. On trader suggested gold could test support at Dollars 375. 'It will be an almighty battle to stop it falling further,' he added. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA prices both ended the day in the plus columns after coffee steadied itself late in the session following a slide prompted by selling in New York. Dealers said coffee's initial weakness had been inspired by a classic case of 'buy the rumour, sell the fact' as the New York market fell after confirmation of a sharp fall in certified stocks.

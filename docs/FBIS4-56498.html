			<p>BFN     [Text] PANPRA [National Progressive Revolutionary Party of  Haiti], led by Serge Gilles, has recommended realistic  compromises on a series of democratic stakes to assure social  peace and the country's governability. PANPRA in its monthly  bulletin calls on democratic forces to create an historic,  centrist, pluralist bloc and a legitimate constitutional  transitional government of broad concord to fight political  violence.    The socialist organization points out that all of the  conservative forces have mobilized into a paramilitary  organization with declared political ambitions, FRAPH  [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti].  Enjoying great impunity, this organization has imposed a  nationwide campaign of intimidation, backed by blind, monstrous,  indiscriminate violence. PANPRA adds that the poorest supporters  of the president-in-exile often must choose between enrolling in  FRAPH or being unbearably harassed.    PANPRA further criticizes the attitude of the international  community, which is showing its true colors by playing the  humanitarian samaritan while reinforcing the embargo. It can be  assured that if President Aristide ever returns, all that will  be left for him to govern will be zombis, piles of garbage, and  a desert country.</p>

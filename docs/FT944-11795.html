			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / CBI appeals for reinforcements on the green front: A catalogue of complaints from business leaders about the cost analysis of environmental regulations British businesses are starting to chafe under the weight of environmental regulation. They feel the government is creating laws without sufficiently balancing the costs and benefits. They also wish the government would make up its mind about environmental issues. These concerns will be reflected in a document which the Confederation of British Industry will publish at its annual conference next week. Many of the points in the report challenge the line taken by government on environmental issues and are likely to provoke a response from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who will be addressing the conference. The CBI says there is little evidence for the government's claim that environmental legislation makes business more competitive by creating pressure for greater efficiency. The CBI says this 'has not been justified by a full analysis of the costs and benefits of legislation across affected sectors'. Nor, in the CBI's view, are new environmental initiatives providing 'massive new opportunities for products and services' along the lines much-touted by ministers. Where these initiatives go with the grain of the market, they do help strengthen innovative businesses. But where they do not, they add unnecessarily to the cost burden. 'At present, too many businesses are falling foul of the pitfalls rather than seizing the opportunities,' the CBI says. A further problem is the effect of regulation on international competitiveness. A quarter of respondents to a CBI poll said they were experiencing difficulties gaining access to foreign markets, mainly because of eco-labelling schemes in other countries. Thirty per cent said that they suffered specific British disadvantages because of standards imposed domestically, and the stricter enforcement of EU legislation in the UK. Although the CBI accepts that some businesses may not be responding to opportunities, it lays much of the blame at the government's door. Among the criticisms it makes are: The government does not pay enough attention to the effect that environmental regulation has on competitiveness. It cites the fact that the white paper on competitiveness issued earlier this year has only one page on the environment but 20 pages on education and training. Government needs to provide a more supportive policy framework where the benefits outweigh the costs of action by business. Environmental regulators are not sufficiently sensitive to the costs they impose. The CBI thinks regulators could take a leaf out of the book of the Health and Safety Executive, which has a longer record of dealing with business. The government should create more regulatory certainty by establishing policy on key issues, particularly who pays for contaminated land. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said that industry was keen to get into a 'win-win' situation where well-planned regulation brought benefits to both business and the environment. 'This is not a report which says 'We can't afford all this environmental regulation.' But it does reflect frustration over a lot of wasted effort.' He thought that there were promising signs in the government's proposal for a new environmental agency which would draw together the functions of pollution and water regulators. He welcomed the clause in the draft bill for the agency which would instruct it to balance the costs and benefits of regulation. The CBI document is not entirely about what the government should do, however. It also lays out an agenda for business. Among its recommendations are that business should give greater stress to environmental issues in its board and company policy, and that it should identify the opportunities created by the environment ahead of regulatory developments.

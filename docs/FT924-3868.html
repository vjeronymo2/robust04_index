			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Miscarriage risk from microchips WOMEN working in semiconductor chip production facilities have a 40 per cent higher risk of miscarriage than those whose jobs in the industry are outside the production area, according to a study conducted by independent researchers on behalf of the US semiconductor industry, Louise Kehoe writes from San Francisco. The results of the study into health risks of semiconductor production work, the largest and most comprehensive to date, confirm concerns raised by earlier, smaller-scale research efforts that pregnant women working in semiconductor production facilities have a higher risk of miscarriage caused by exposure to chemicals used in the plants. The study results are expected to lead to significant changes in the chemicals used by chip makers and to efforts to reduce worker exposure to certain chemicals. The research team, based at the University of California at Davis, said that their findings suggested exposure to photo-resist-developer solvents, including glycol ethers, might be responsible for the higher rate of miscarriage.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ATTORNEY CALLS KEATING PAUPER  </P> <P> Lawyers asked a judge today to reduce the $5-million bail for Charles H.  Keating Jr., a central figure in the nation's saving and loan scandal,  characterizing him as a pauper who won't flee.  </P> <P> The former American Continental Corp. chairman sat in Superior Court with three  co-defendants as attorneys argued that he would have trouble financing his  defense against numerous cases stemming from the $2-billion collapse of Irvine,  Calif.  </P> <P> -based Lincoln Savings.  </P> <P> The 66-year-old Arizona developer surrendered to Los Angeles County prosecutors  Tuesday to face a 42-count grand jury indictment, and Judge Gary Klausner  surprised even prosecutors by setting the bail at $5 million.  </P> <P> The bail reduction hearing also sought cuts in the $1-million bails set for  co-defendants Judy E. Wischer, Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. Symes.  </P> <P> Klausner took no immediate action on the defendants' requests.  </P></p>

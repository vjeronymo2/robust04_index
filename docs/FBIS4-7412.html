			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] North Korea is undisguisedly trying to solve  everything with its last nuclear card. During yesterday's  working-level contact with the United States, North Korea  proposed a peace agreement in exchange of the conditional  acceptance of additional inspections. The United States did not  accept the proposal. The following is a report by Chon Yo-ok:    [Begin recording] [Chon] In its attempt to provide a  breakthrough in the relations with the United States blocked by  the nuclear issue, North Korea suddenly proposed to replace the  current Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement at  yesterday's working-level contact.    The U.S. State Department plainly refused North Korea's  proposal judging that it was intended to directly deal with the  U.S. military representatives instead of the Military Armistice  Commission.    After the contact, North Korea invited all foreign  correspondents based in the PRC, except the ROK press corps, and  held a news conference at the North Korean Embassy in China  today strongly denouncing the United States.    [Pae Yong-chae, acting North Korean ambassador to China,  identified by caption] The United States has unilaterally  abrogated what was agreed upon in the Korean Armistice Agreement  since it was signed in July 1953, and has introduced modern  weapons, including over 1,000 nuclear weapons, into South Korea.    [Chon] [passage omitted] The appeasement gesture made by Pak  Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, saying  that Pyongyang is ready to exceptionally allow additional  inspections, was aimed at having a direct dialogue with the  United States by proposing a peace agreement. North Korea's  sudden change of attitude clearly reflects the limit of its  unreasonable diplomatic policy in trying to solve everything  with the only card -- the nuclear issue. [end recording]</p>

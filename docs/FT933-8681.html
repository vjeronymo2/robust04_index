			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Portugal-Brazil strategic telecoms alliance formed THE international tele-communications companies of Portugal and Brazil have formed a strategic alliance which plans to invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) in upgrading services and promoting joint ventures in third countries. The non-exclusive alliance between Marconi of Portugal and Embratel of Brazil is the latest in a series of international telecommunications deals aimed at expanding the market for multinationals and exploiting opportunities in developing regions. With joint annual turnover of Dollars 1.7bn last year, the companies will form one of the smaller of the new alliances. It builds on existing commercial and technical co-operation between the companies. Mr Sequeira Braga, president of Marconi, said: 'To survive as international operators we have to establish alliances to compete.' He said the initial focus of the alliance would be on service improvements and co-operative marketing. The Portuguese-Brazilian link partially mirrors a strong advance by the Spanish telecoms monopoly, Telefonica, into the telecoms market in former Spanish colonies in Latin America. Telefonica has bought control of operating companies in Argentina and Chile in the past three years. The alliance also indicates Marconi's determination to assert itself in the run-up to privatisation. The Portuguese government holds just over 50 per cent of the company and it is assumed that Portugal's three telephone operators will at some stage be drawn into the government's wide-ranging privatisation programme. Lisbon has had most success so far in privatising the banking sector, and the telephone company said yesterday no concrete plans yet existed to sell stakes in Marconi or the other two companies, TLP, which operates in Lisbon and Oporto, and Telecom Portugal, both fully owned by the state.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> WATER-SAVING PLAN ADOPTED  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday adopted a three-phase water conservation plan,  effective immediately.  </P> <P> In the first, voluntary phase, residents are urged to follow a number of  water-saving measures.  </P> <P> The second phase makes those measures mandatory. The third is a rationing  phase, which requires that residents cut water use by a percentage based on the  severity of the drought.  </P> <P> Water-saving measures include not hosing sidewalks and driveways, not serving  drinking water in public places, watering lawns only during the evening and  night, repairing leaky faucets and sprinkler systems, and not filling swimming  pools, spas and hot tubs.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Terry L. James said the city is in the first phase and  will proceed to the mandatory phase if the water table in the San Gabriel Basin  doesn't rise by September or October.  </P></p>

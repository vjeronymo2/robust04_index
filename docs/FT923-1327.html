			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Tarmac falls to Pounds 15m first-half loss TARMAC, Britain's biggest housebuilder, is to cut the number of homes it builds by up to a fifth after one of the worst trading periods in its history. The company also intends to pull out of commercial property development and to raise cash to reduce debts by selling more of its business. The group, unveiling its proposals yesterday, said it had incurred a Pounds 15.1m pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year against an Pounds 18.2m pre-tax profit during last year's first half. Tarmac's shares rose 8p to 78p after the company said it planned to pay an unchanged interim dividend of 3p. It also expected to pay a maintained final dividend resulting in a total payment of 5.5p this year. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, welcomed yesterday's decision to reduce British base rates by one percentage point but warned this would not be enough to stimulate a UK housing market recovery. The company intends to cut the number of homes it builds to between 7,000 and 7,500 next year from about 8,500 this year and 9,300 homes last year. Tarmac, which would still be Britain's biggest housebuilder, expects to free about Pounds 100m from capital employed next year by reducing its building programme. The company also plans to run down its commercial property division and to increase sales of non-core businesses. Disposals have raised Pounds 100m this year and could reach Pounds 200m by the end of this year depending on the sale for about Pounds 80m of Econowaste, the group's waste disposal business. Further disposals from the company's industrial products division could raise Pounds 100m next year, says Tarmac. This might indicate it is willing to sell its Ruberoid roofing business acquired for Pounds 141m in 1988. Mr Simms said disposals were expected to reduce gearing to less than 40 per cent by the year-end. This compared with gearing approaching 60 per cent at the end of June when net debt stood at Pounds 744m. Three of the group's seven divisions incurred losses in the first half. Commercial property lost Pounds 6.2m, Tarmac America lost Pounds 1.5m and building materials excluding quarry products lost Pounds 2.7m. Quarry profits fell from Pounds 24m to Pounds 13.5m; housing profits slipped from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 7m; contracting profits fell from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 9.3m.

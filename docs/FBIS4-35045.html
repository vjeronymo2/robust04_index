			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified NA "special correspondent"] </F>   [Text] Washington, 23 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  announced on 23 June that U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor will travel to Argentina in the upoming days in order to  find a definite solution to the controversial issue of medicine  patents.    According to Menem, the issue of a law on patents demanded  by  the United States was not broached during his talk with his U.S.  counterpart, Bill Clinton. However, U.S. Ambassador to  Argentina James Cheek hinted to the contrary.    "Ask your president," responded Cheek, when the NOTICIAS  ARGENTINAS NEWS AGENCY special correspondent asked him about the  subject. He nonetheless hastened to add: "I would not say that  this subject was not discussed."    Menem told journalists that negotiations "are developing  along normal lines and dialogue is under way."    When asked whether pressure was being applied to have the  issue settled by 30 June, Menem underscored: "There are neither  threats nor anything remotely similar."    The deadline the U.S. Government established for Argentina  to  enact the new law on medicine patents so as not to be on the  list of countries liable for commercial sanctions expires on 30  June.    U.S. pharmaceutical companies have for a long time been  requesting that their Argentine counterparts acknowledge  intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of medicines.    The Argentine executive branch has sent a patents bill to  Congress, but it has not been discussed yet because several  sectors involved have seriously questioned some of its points.    The first deadline for the passing of the patents law had  been established for 30 April. On that day, Kantor was to  appear before the U.S. Congress to charge Argentina with not  doing things by the book in commercial matters and to recommend  sanctions against it.    Nevertheless, Kantor finally relented and decided to let  things ride until the end of June.    Concurrent with this latent threat, several U.S. officials  have visited Argentina recently -- including Vice President  Albert Gore -- and they all invariably spoke of the need for the  enactment of the patents law.    When U.S. Trade Secretary Ronald Brown arrives in Argentina  on 28 June, he will prove to be no exception. He already has  announced that the protection of patents and rights to  intellectual property is "one of the most important  considerations that likely investors take into account to  determine a country's investment climate."    Kantor himself discussed this issue with Menem personally  when both met in Chile for President Eduardo Frei's inauguration.    Now, when everything led to a surmise that the issue of  patents would be on the agenda of the meeting between Clinton  and Menem, the latter took pains to deny it.    "We did not talk about that subject with President Clinton.  I would like to tell you that there is good news for the  Argentine Republic concerning that subject and rightly before  the established date, but no questions, please," he stressed.    To conclude, the head of state looked at the journalists and  asked them to bring up the subject "after 30 June."</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / EC hitch ahead of Earth Summit THE European Community's prospects of taking a robust programme on global warming to next week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro dimmed yesterday, because of delays in finalising the details of the energy tax the European Commission approved two weeks ago. EC environment ministers meeting in Brussels today had been expected to give provisional endorsement to the tax. But it became clear yesterday that the draft directive on combatting carbon dioxide emissions is not yet ready. This largely technical hold-up puts Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, in a delicate position. The commissioner has repeatedly said he will go to Rio only if he has a firm EC position to defend. Such a position would have to include, Mr Ripa di Meana has said, support from the Twelve for the Commission's energy tax; EC commitment to a near doubling of development aid within the Climate Change convention due to be signed in Rio; and resolution of the EC's two-year wrangle on where to locate the European Environment Agency. It is not clear ministers can resolve any of these issues today. Member states such as the UK, while prepared to examine the case for a tax to cut emissions, are unwilling to make a commitment until they see the detailed implications. Spain, however, is concerned that an energy tax could slow its industrial development. But some northern states, led by Germany, support the tax and are angry the Commission has made its proposal dependent on US and Japanese willingness to adopt a similar anti-emissions strategy.

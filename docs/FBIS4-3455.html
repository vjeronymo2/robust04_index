			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (CNS) -- Young economic expert  and chief economist of the State Statistical Bureau, Mr. Qiu  Xiaohua, said in an interview with this agency that China should  stabilize prices by maintaining appropriate economic growth in  the country.    Mr. Qiu said that judging from the operation of the national  economy in the first quarter this year in China, the  macro-economic situation in the country showed a "combination of  euphoria and worry". Economic growth had nearly dropped to the  goal set for macro-control; the economy was operating within an  appropriate range; the investment environment had improved to a  certain extent; fiscal revenue and spending, credit and foreign  exchange income and expenditure had all struck a balance or even  showed a surplus; the "bottleneck problem" of energy, raw and  finished materials and transportation had been somewhat  alleviated; the main consumer goods except for some agricultural  products were supplied in an adequate way; the actual income of  both urban and rural residents was rising; bank savings deposits  were greatly increasing and reform measures of various kinds  were being carried out in a comparatively smooth way.    According to the economist, outstanding contradictions  appearing in the economic operations could not be overlooked.  First, prices were continuously growing on the basis of last  year's inflation with the highest growth of prices seen in  grain, meat, aquatic products, vegetables, clothing and service  items, posing an adverse affect on the living of some residents.  Second, the difficulties facing the operation of state-owned  enterprises have been deteriorating, production growth was  dropping sharply with enterprises suffering from the stockpiling  of their products, delays in each other's debts and an obvious  decline of their economic efficiency.    Mr. Qiu held that China was now facing two big problems. If  prices are controlled within ten percent and the money supply is  still kept tight, this will lead to a gloomy market which will  in return result in an overly big drop in economic growth,  greater difficulties to state-owned enterprises and the further  deterioration of financial difficulties and employment problems.  If the money supply is conducted in a more relaxed way,  inflation will further worsen.    Mr. Qiu believed that at present, on the one hand, control  of  the overly fast growth of prices cannot be realized through  strict control of the money demand, while on the other hand,  help to state-owned enterprises cannot be made through putting  too much money into them. The central government's  macro-control policies should pay much attention to both price  stability and economic growth and sustaining appropriate  economic growth to sustain the stability of prices in the  country.    He further pointed out that the country should control  inflation by legal and necessary administrative means as well as  through tackling market transaction disorder which cultivates  the rampant rise of prices and illegal profit-making activities.  At the same time, risk funds and reserve system for key  materials and commodities and the protection system for low  income earners must be established as soon as possible.    Mr. Qiu held that provided macro-control and regulation are  handled well, the growth of the GDP value in the country will be  about ten percent, that of investment in fixed assets by 35  percent to 40 percent and that of retail prices by 16 percent to  18 percent.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Private car clampers may be banned CLAMPING vehicles on private land in England and Wales may be outlawed by the government as one of six options to tackle cowboy operators outlined yesterday. The others are good practice guidelines and self-regulation of the wheel-clamping industry; clarification of the civil law; statutory regulation of the wheel-clamping industry; statutory licensing of wheel-clamp operators; and statutory licensing of land on which wheel-clamps may be used. The paper comes as pressure increases to tackle the methods used by cowboy operators. These include: Parking decoy cars to attract unsuspecting motorists. Charging up to Pounds 240 to have a clamp removed. Clamping cars while the engine is still running. Clamping disabled motorists' cars. Mr Michael Jack, home office minister, said: 'Any case for intervention must strike the right balance between the interests of motorists and landowners. This will be difficult to achieve as it involves both matters of public interest and controls on essentially private transactions.' The RAC described the consultation paper as an 'overdue' first step in curbing excesses, while the AA echoed the need to strike a balance between the rights of landowners and motorists. Mr John Spellar, Labour MP for Warley West, whose 10-minute rule bill to outlaw private car clampers in England and Wales is due for its second reading on Friday, welcomed the paper. He said: 'It's taken a long while . . . but it's a good document. It fairly deals with the options and, although I would have a preference for a complete banning, nearly all the options will spell the end of the cowboy clampers.'</p>

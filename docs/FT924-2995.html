			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Act on racism, Rabin urges EC Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday urged the European Community to take more effective action against racist and anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, Sheila Jones writes. Mr Rabin raised the issue in talks with Mr John Major, the British premier, yesterday, during a three-day visit to the UK. The Israeli premier asked Mr Major, in his role as EC president, to press for an EC-wide policy to be mapped out at the Edinburgh summit this weekend. EC officials have also pressed for EC Community action on racial violence in Europe, although the issue is not formally on the summit agenda. Mr Rabin said in Italy on Sunday that the rise of racial violence and anti-Semitism in Europe had rekindled memories of the Nazi holocaust.</p>

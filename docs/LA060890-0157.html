At South Coast Community Church in  Irvine that night, MACY awards went to Southland high school students for  excellence in the musical productions.  </P> <P> More than 1,500 people showed up for 20th annual ceremony for the awards,  formally known as Music and Art Commendation for Youth. In all, 150 trophies  and scholarships were presented, for overall production and for individual  performances.  </P> <P> Irvine High School was the biggest winner, receiving its accolades for a  production of "Little Shop of Horrors." Among the prizes was the night's most  prestigious award, for best overall production.  </P> <P> Other schools recognized for best overall production were Newport Harbor High  School in Newport Beach for "Man of La Mancha" and Rancho Buena Vista High  School in Vista for "Fiddler on the Roof."  </P> <P> The award program was begun 20 years ago by Corona del Mar residents Lee and  John Childress.  </P> <P> "We started this program to give recognition to all this wonderful talent,"  said Lee Childress, a former actress and publicist. "This is our gift to the  youths who devote all of their time and energy to these musicals."  </P> <P> John Childress, a former school administrator, calls the MACYs a "labor of  love." The couple spent more than $5,000 producing this year's show.  </P> <P> Highlights of student productions of such popular musicals as "Grease," "Guys  and Dolls," "The Wiz" and "Annie" were performed during the show.  </P> <P> "What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness."  </P> <P>  -- Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

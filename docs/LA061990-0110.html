			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWER PLANT DEAL CALLED LARGEST SALE-LEASEBACK  </P> <P> CMS Energy Corp. said Monday that its Midland Cogeneration Venture power plant  has been sold for $2.3 billion in what is believed to be the largest  sale-leaseback deal in U.S. history.  </P> <P> Paul Knopick, a CMS spokesman, said 65% of the plant -- built as a nuclear  facility but later converted to a gas-fired cogeneration plant -- was bought by  a group of major companies that did not want to be identified.  </P> <P> The remaining 35% was bought by a CMS subsidiary, with the plant leased back to  the original partnership that converted it into a gas-fired facility. The deal  is for 25 years.  </P> <P> The original partnership included CMS, Dow Chemical Co. and Michigan's largest  utility, Consumers Power Co., a CMS subsidiary.  </P> <P> The partnership halted construction of the plant in 1984 after spending $4.2  billion. It was 85% complete when the facility became mired in financing and  regulatory wrangles.  </P></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE strong rally in stock index futures recorded on Tuesday petered out following overnight falls in Tokyo and the lack of news on a cut in interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. June opened around 2,605, well down from Tuesday's close but at a premium to cash of about 2. But it was sent into retreat by selling mainly from independent traders and had fallen to 2,592, below the cash market level, by 9am. After a bout of sideways trading, June recovered due to support at the lower levels coupled with the release of two sets of UK economic data. One showed a rise in manufacturing in April and another a slight increase in high street sales, all of which sent the contract climbing back to 2,609. With little in the way of features in the afternoon, June drifted lower, while the poor opening on Wall Street ensured that any attempts at a rally were kept in check. June closed at 2,599, down 21 on the previous close but just ahead of the underlying cash market. Turnover at 6,810 was poor. Traded options remained dull with turnover reaching a mere 25,939 lots, of which 11,476 was recorded in the FT-SE 100 option. GEC was the most actively traded stock option. It traded 1,620 contracts, with the February 240 calls the busiest series.</p>

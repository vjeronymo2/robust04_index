			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, on Knin Television on 23 March -- recorded]    [Text] Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian  Krajina [RSK], today addressed RSK citizens and deputies of the  RSK Assembly via Knin Television. Here is Milan Martic's  statement that we received from Knin:    [Begin Martic recording] Citizens of the RSK, the current  work of the republican parliament, which is primarily  characterized by some political divisions and a one-sided  imposition of the coalitions' stands, is leading the state into  total chaos and anarchy.    As president of the RSK, I will not allow this. In these  exceptionally difficult times for our state, when, in addition  to all the other pressures and difficulties, we are achieving  significant results on the international political scene, we are  encountering obstacles that are exclusively the consequence of  such work by the assembly. As president of the republic and the  supreme commander of the armed forces, I will not allow the RSK  to become a (?battlefield) for political showdowns between  political parties [word indistinct].    Citizens of the RSK, fighters, workers, and pensioners, I  demand that you raise your voice to remove the obstacles caused  by the work of the parliament, to reexamine the mandate you have  loaned to some deputies, and to call them to account.    The respected deputies must know that they have been elected  by you and that they are only accountable to you and not the  political leaders whose dictates they are now implementing.</p>

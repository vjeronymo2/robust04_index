			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Drug cuts transfer of HIV virus to babies Wellcome, the British pharmaceutical company, said yesterday that a new study found that its drug AZT cut by two-thirds the transmission of the HIV virus from pregnant mothers to their babies, Reuter reports from New York and London. The transmission rate was 8.3 per cent when mothers and babies both received AZT, marketed by Wellcome as Retrovir. The rate was 25.5 per cent among mothers and babies receiving placebos. Wellcome said the US study had been halted and investigators were now offering Retrovir to all pregnant women and babies who were participating in the study. The company plans to submit a package to the US Food and Drug Administration this week seeking approval for the use of the drug in reducing mother-to-baby transmission. It will also pass the data on to regulators in other countries. Each year in the US an estimated 7,000 women infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) give birth. About 25 per cent of their babies are infected with the virus. The study was sponsored by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale of France. Wellcome said investigators found that both mothers and babies tolerated the drug well, with no significant short-term side effects apart from reversible mild anaemia in some infants. Dr Harold Jaffe, an epidemiologist and HIV specialist at the US government's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, told the New York Times the study was 'the first indication that mother-to-child transmission of HIV can be at least decreased, if not prevented'.</p>

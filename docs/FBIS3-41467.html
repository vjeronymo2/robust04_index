			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alyaksandr Alfonsavich Matsyasovich, head of </F> the Information and Public Relations Department within the State  Committee for Ecological Issues, by Alyaksandr Hyerasimaw; place  and date not given: ``Nature Cannot Wait'' -- first paragraph is  CHYRVONAYA ZMENA introduction]    [Text] Within our everyday problems and sore issues, we do  not notice the situation in which our environment has found  itself lately. Sometimes, nature surrounding us can cause us --  tired and nervous with everyday complexities -- to become wild,  and then we claim that protection of nature is not our affair.  Our correspondent queried Alyaksandr Matsyasovich, head of the  Information and Public Relations Department within the State  Committee for Ecological Issues, on the pressing ecology issues  in Belarus.    Matsyasovich: At the start, I would like to note  that our Republic is characterized by an irrational use of  natural resources. Before, we connected this fact with  domineering economic relations: Energy and natural resources had  to be used most effectively and no one was interested in the  effectiveness of production [as published]. Low quality  production brought about a lot of waste which was not processed.  For example, yearly, around 4.5 tonnes of domestic and  industrial waste (per capita!) is being produced in Belarus.  Only two enterprises in Belarus -- in Minsk and Mogilev -- are  dealing with the partial processing of waste. A powerful Minsk  factory is processing barely 30 percent of this waste. The  unprocessed waste is being dumped. Officially, our dumps occupy  an area of more than 10,000 hectares. However, no one has ever  calculated the area occupied by unofficial dumps....    A second problem is the large-scale intrusion into nature.  Many types of plants, animals, and insects have disappeared.    We are currently living in a situation where former wet  regions of Polesye are suffering from lack of water, especially,  in Gomel Oblast.    Hyerasimaw: Alyaksandr Alfonsavich, could you  please remind us what natural resources we are rich in and how  we are using them?    Matsyasovich: First, our water resources. Almost  all our cities have more or less effective purifying stations.  However, purifying stations in some of our regions are  overloaded and overutilized. Minsk purifying stations are in  the latter category.    We cannot drink water from our rivers. Due to the improper  use of fertilizers and insecticides, the agricultural sector of  Belarus presents the greatest danger to our rivers. However, it  is because of the improper behavior of people that nature  suffers most of all. The main polluter of our rivers is ... oil!  If in southern Belarus -- where oil lies close to the surface  -- the outer surface is polluted due to the oil's outlet to the  surface, the oil pollution of our remaining areas is caused by  the improper use of oil resources.    Our water purity records usually exceed normal levels from  one- two to 40 points, like in Soligorsk. Verkhnedvinskiy,  Nesvizhskiy Rayons, and some rayons of Brest and Grodno Oblasts  suffer from a high level of water pollution as well.    Further, some 3 million tonnes of polluted substances are  discharged in the air. This equals the amount of toxic  substances polluting the air of Zaporozhie and Krivoy Rog taken  together. Maybe this is not much, but Belarus, located in a  specific geographical zone, is to a greater extent polluted by  transferred air masses from other territories. If we are to  believe West European experts, the Belarusian atmosphere is  polluted in 18-20 percent by its own sources and in 80-82  percent -- by someone else's.    From all the Belarusian cities, Novopolotsk is in an  extremely serious ecological situation. However, in 1993, air  pollution in Novopolotsk was decreased by 22 percent. This  time, it is connected not to the upgrading of the production  capacity, but to the fall of the economy.    The Kuybyshev factory in Mogilev is very harmful from an  ecological standpoint. To my regret, we cannot do anything to  improve the situation because this factory is located in the  center of the city. We cannot move people, or this enterprise,  or close this dangerous giant producing one of the most  poisonous chemical substances. In addition, there is not enough  room to build effective purifying stations.    Many years ago, Belarus signed a range of international  agreements, one of which stipulates specific amounts of nitrogen  oxides discharged into the air. These agreements hamper the  development of our power industry. These agreements do not  allow operating the new electric power plant No. 5 which was  built in Minsk. At the same time, the Republic badly needs  electric energy. We cannot afford to buy a good purifying  installation from Japan or Germany. Power engineering in  Belarus is going to ask the international community for  permission to temporarily sidestep the above-mentioned  agreements until the Republic stabilizes the work of power  engineering. Recently, Portugal has received such permission.  By the way, Portugal, Poland, Rumania, and Malta are leading  polluters in the world.    Hyerasimaw: Our Republic should have an effective  legal footing and appropriate state institutions and  organizations to resolve ecology issues. Are we moving forward  in this direction?    Matsyasovich: First of all, responsibility for the  protection of nature should be carried out by environmental  users themselves. We have the ``Law on Nature Protection.''  Therefore, any enterprise, including small ones, should keep to  existing norms. It is difficult because they lack proper  technologies and purifying equipment. Our State Committee for  Ecological Issues controls the implementation of ecological  laws. Violation of these laws brings about financial and  administrative penalties. We can even close enterprises that  violate these laws. Yes, this issue is not properly organized  in our Republic. In my opinion, hereditary factors of the old  administrative system still affect our actions.    [Matsyasovich continues] Anyway, we could improve  the entire ecological situation, especially our specific  institutions dealing with Chernobyl issues and following their  own programs. We require perspective, and a scientifically  grounded ecological policy. We require systematic monitoring,  scientific vision, etc. We have a relatively high research  potential. Already in the 1970's, Belarusian researchers  conducted a scientific prognosis for the next 20 years, and they  had prognosticated much of what we are experiencing today.  However, nobody wanted to listen to them then. We have  interesting research projects. It is essential to find such  economic levers that could make our producers use natural  resources rationally. It sounds incredible, but our legislation  has no notion of the so-called ``ecological crime.'' Following  is one of many examples. In Novopolotsk, around 90,000 tonnes  of high toxic substances have been spilled into the Dvina river.  Later, they reached the Baltic Sea and caused the death of  fish. The operator and the security engineer were tried for  violation of security rules but not for any serious ``ecological  crime.''    Violators of ecological laws are fined for polluting water  or  for poaching. So, what about the land and air? Currently, an  ecological code of laws including 16 laws is being drafted. We  have adopted the ``Law on the Protection of the Environment,''  ``On Ecological Examination,'' ``On Ecological Taxation,'' ``On  Waste.'' The laws ``On Protected Territories,'' ``On  Ecological Education,'' and ``On Regulation of the State Control  System'' are being drafted.    We should create a single system of state control. Just at  the moment, the state control system is split. The State  Committee for Protection of the Environment, the State Committee  for Land Reform, the Ministry of Forestry controlling the use  and protection of forests, the Chief Department of Belarusian  Fish Industry, the Chief Committee for Water, Meteorology  [Belhidramet], and various sanitary services do not cooperate.  None of these institutions has enough powers.    We should also speak about the examination of projects by  state experts, the system for the ecological education of  experts, the ecological culture of the population, and the use  of international experience.    Hyerasimaw: Yes, there are a lot of problems.  However, can we hope that they will be resolved?    Matsyasovich: In my opinion, we will be able to  resolve them. In the spring of 1993, the Belarusian Cabinet of  Ministers adopted a decree stipulating the upgrading of the  monitoring system. This decree will be implemented in 1994-95.  The decree on the introduction of regular land surveys has also  been adopted. This means that the use of all natural resources  will be strictly controlled, and the natural resources will be  subject to normative use. If we consider forestry, I can say  the following. The corresponding laws that had been adopted are  being currently implemented in this sphere. Felling does not  exceed the growth of forests. You know, after the 1941-45 war,  the greatest part of our forests was destroyed. Only 2.5  percent of the mature forest is left. Currently, a third of  Belarus is covered by forests. In other words, the program of  use and restoration of forests is being implemented. First of  all, we require a protection system for all our natural  resources. Of course, if new laws are adopted they will be  implemented and we will make progress.    Hyerasimaw: I wish you success. Thank you for the  interview.</p>

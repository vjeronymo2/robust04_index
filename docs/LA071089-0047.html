			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gas Prices Edge Downward: Gasoline prices fell nearly two cents per gallon in  June, defying the historical trend toward higher prices during the summer, but  still registering 18 cents more than at the first of the year. A survey of  12,000 gasoline stations across the country found the nationwide average for  all grades of gasoline with taxes included was $1.1676 per gallon, said Trilby  Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Letter, an industry trade publication. The  average price of $1.1676 was a drop of about two-thirds of a cent from the last  survey two weeks earlier.  </P></p>

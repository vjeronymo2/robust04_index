			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: ITT takes Dollars 612m restructure charge ITT, the US conglomerate, is to take a Dollars 612m fourth-quarter after-tax charge to cover a restructuring of ITT Financial, its finance subsidiary, including large loss provisions in its domestic unsecured consumer loan portfolio. The move was portrayed by the company as a positive step to eliminate problems and concentrate the finance company's energies on its more profitable businesses, which range from consumer home equity loans to capital finance. On Wall Street, ITT's share price rose Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 71 1/2 . Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, affirmed ITT's rating, but downgraded the outlook to negative because of 'ongoing disappointing earnings'. Moody's placed its ratings under review for possible downgrading, while Fitch affirmed its ratings. ITT Financial will take pre-tax charges of Dollars 928m (Dollars 612m after tax), including a Dollars 693m provision for unsecured consumer loan losses as it runs off its existing portfolio; Dollars 103m for restructuring, as it consolidates its loan branches from 600 to 400 and cuts its workforce of 5,400 people by about 1,400; and Dollars 132m for losses in its commercial property portfolio. To preserve ITT Financial's capital ratios, the parent company is to contribute Dollars 612m to the subsidiary, including shares in Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial group which ITT acquired last year. Last October, ITT took a Dollars 582m charge to strengthen reserves at its Hartford insurance subsidiary. It added Dollars 680m of capital to the insurance unit, including Dollars 380m of Alcatel Alsthom stock. The Hartford and the financial subsidiary together provide more than half of the group's operating profits. The restructuring of the finance arm follows a review by Mr Frank Schultz, chairman of the subsidiary, who said the size and quality of the unsecured consumer small loan business had been diminishing because of the rapid growth of credit card and home equity loans. ITT said it would also take a Dollars 53m pre-tax restructuring charge at its defence and electronic components businesses, a Dollars 45m charge for troubled assets at its Sheraton hotels group and Dollars 45m pre-tax charge for an accounting change.</p>

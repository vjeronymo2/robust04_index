			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Leopard skin king must walk a tightrope: Heavy is Londoner's crown THE LEOPARD skin had definitely seen better days. Now, splayed under the throne of the future king of Buganda, the tired carcass was stubbornly refusing to bare its fangs. As the crown prince approached, hoisted on the shoulders of his subjects, the court attendants abandoned their struggle with the leopard's jaws and rushed to prostrate themselves before Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, formerly of Shoreditch, London, who on Saturday was crowned the 36th Kabaka (king) of Buganda. For a one-time double-glazing salesman who lived most of his life in Britain, Ronnie was bearing up well to the rituals of his ancient African kingdom. After visiting his father's mummified umbilical cord, and leading his army into battle before dawn, the Kabaka was bathed in the seclusion of a hut of papyrus reeds. Then, propelled by thousands of delirious subjects, Ronnie was carried up the slopes of Buddo hill to a spot marked by the gnarled roots of a sacred tree, where his ancestors had been crowned for the past 600 years. As Queen Elizabeth II could have warned him, the duties of a monarch can be onerous. So, too, were the offerings now hoisted upon the Kabaka under the sweltering morning sun. Over his white tunic went four togas made of bark cloth. A cow hide on his back would ensure food for his people. A leopard skin on his chest would give him valour. Two spears and a shield for those troublesome little wars and a calabash of water to quench his thirst. The royal paraphernalia was topped by a sequined crown, which appeared to double as a fly-whisk. At 9.55am, Ronnie rose to beat a sonorous royal drum. The crowd went wild. His reign had begun. The 4m Baganda, Uganda's largest tribe, are celebrating the restoration of their monarchy after a 27-year ban as the event of the century. Ronnie's father, Muteesa II, who was also independent Uganda's first president, was forced into exile in 1966 by Milton Obote, the ambitious prime minister who became Uganda's uncrowned dictator. Muteesa II, known as King Freddie to his friends, died in alcoholic penury in Britain three years later. 'Since then,' says Wasswa Birigwa, a coffee trader who is the royal chief of protocol, 'we have been like children lost in a forest.' But he explains: 'We Baganda are rediscovering our traditions. The Kabakaship is our cultural reservoir.' President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, agreed to restore the Kabaka and Uganda's three other tribal kingdoms after long negotiations which carefully circumscribed the role of kings to cultural and ceremonial functions. But many in the royal entourage are already suffering from delusions of grandeur. Birigwa, the protocol chief, sees the establishment of a permanent royal court and an executive office staffed by 'managers, financiers and lawyers' that would execute the king's policies. The Kabaka, he points out, will soon come into hundreds of acres of royal land and buildings that were confiscated under Obote's rule. The Kabaka's income, he says, could be used to spearhead national self-help and development as well as the standard royal favourites: charities, widows and orphans. King Ronnie, however, will be walking a political tightrope. There are many nostalgic Baganda who would like to use the Kabaka as a rallying figure for a secessionist movement. Diplomatically, the king says he has no wish to interfere in politics. President Museveni was the guest of honour amid the hundreds of invited dignitaries, African princes, scarlet-robed bishops and minor British nobility that made up Saturday's colourful medieval pageant. He watched the proceedings in silence. Some believe Museveni consented to the restoration of the Kabakaship to placate the Baganda, many of whom fought alongside his guerrillas in the bush war that ousted Obote. A contented Baganda, the sceptics argue, are less likely to clamour for multi-party democracy. But the jubilation on Saturday was genuine. As princesses ululated and shimmied to the beat of royal drums, and a cheering crowd carried Mutebi II away, one clan elder remembered the silent president. 'Museveni,' he hailed at the top of his voice, 'without you we would never have had our kingdom back. May you rule 100 years.' It was the first time the president smiled.</p>

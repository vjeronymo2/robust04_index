			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Swiss propose carbon fuel tax The Swiss government yesterday said it planned to introduce a tax from 1996 on fuels that emit carbon dioxide. If approved by parliament the tax on heating oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, coal and petrol would be introduced in stages and bring in an annual SFr1.3bn (Pounds 607m) by the year 2000. The government said at least two-thirds of the money raised would be pumped back into the economy, but details of how this would be done have not yet been fixed. The carbon tax would add 8.3 Swiss centimes to the cost of a litre of petrol. Lead-free petrol, the most popular variety, costs about SFr1.16 a litre. The aim of the tax would be to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions and overall consumption of fossil fuels in Switzerland at their 1990 level and subsequently to reduce them, the government said.</p>

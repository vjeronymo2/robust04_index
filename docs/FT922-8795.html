			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (16): Resilience despite hardship - Benguela / Farming and manufacturing THE six-hour drive from Luanda to Benguela was instructive. The route, too dangerous to travel before the ceasefire, is now becoming popular - despite occasional banditry on some sections of the journey. Teams of road menders repaired long-neglected potholes and fresh fish was for sale on stretches where the road hugs Angola's picturesque coast: small but important signs that peace has returned to Benguela province. But the main objective was to visit the factories and farms in and around the towns of Benguela and Lobito, 500km south of Luanda and commercial hub of a province stretching across 32,000 sq km. What emerged were tales of hardship and deprivation, stark images of sad, squalid shanty towns, gangs of pitiful urchins roaming the city streets. But what also became clear from tours of the factory floor and talks to farmers was an extraordinary resilience, and a capacity to improvise. It is Angola's second most important manufacturing region, as well as an important centre for agriculture and fisheries. And while less badly hit by the war than other provinces, it suffered considerably from the collapse of the Benguela railway which used to run across the country from Lobito, the province's main port, to the border with Zaire. At independence, Lobito port handled more than 2m tonnes of cargo a year. Today, the only activity is provided by occasional imports of food and consumer goods. Its warehouses are empty or shelter neatly lined-up fork-lift trucks, and its reduced workforce is idle. Outside the two cities, factories are running at a fraction of capacity and others are not working. A big cement factory once owned by Secil, a Portuguese company that was nationalised when Portugal's own revolution took a turn to the left in 1975, is derelict. Farming has suffered from the war and prolonged drought and although conditions have improved recently, agricultural production of basic foods is expected to cover only 51 per cent of the province's needs this year, according to official statistics. There is much anxiety about the outcome of next September's election but for the time being, it is business as usual. This means self-reliance, improvisation and a lot of patience to cope with inadequate equipment and supplies, scant finance, bureaucracy, erratic telecommunications - lines with Luanda can suddenly go down - and poor but improving transport. Ten months of peace have brought a modest but welcome renewal of activity and increased orders. Mr Manuel Carmo, technical director at Robbialac, a paint manufacturer and subsidiary of Jenson &amp; Nicholson, says business is picking up with two recent orders for 650 tonnes of paint. The factory, located on the outskirts of Lobito, was established in 1972. It employs 63 workers and produces about 500 tonnes of paint a year although it is equipped to produce 7,000 tonnes. Mr Carmo says the biggest problem is lack of materials. 'Sometimes we might just miss one crucial product and we can't produce.' Production was at a standstill in October and November. All materials are imported from Europe and paid for in dollars. Imports have to be officially approved and lack of foreign currency causes delays. 'We're told foreign exchange is available and all we need to do is go to the bank to get approval for our imports, but when we go there, the bank doesn't have any money.' The company was recently allowed to remit profits covering the 1975-88 period and it is looking to expand its activities in Angola. Mr Alberto Lima, production director at Empresa de Assistencia Technica Industrial, a state-owned company that produces water pumps and hammer mills which are used to ground seeds, says his company also wants to expand but this will depend on receiving financial aid. The plant was established 60 years ago and was nationalised in 1976. It produces about 1,400 pumps a year on mainly Bulgarian-made machinery, much of which is only two years old. Mr Lima says, however, that he would like more up-to-date equipment. 'We're going to need more modern machines as we expand.' Lupral, an engineering company that makes tools, pipes and other industrial and agricultural equipment, has one of the largest speciality foundries in Angola, says Mr Carlos Castro, general director. Run under management from the Eternit group in Belgium, it employs 700 workers. The group also has a factory in Huambo. This was built in 1977 but never used. The company hopes to start production there later this year. Demand for agricultural tools and equipment has risen strongly, Mr Castro says. Africa Textil is one of the biggest employers in the region with about 1,500 workers. It is a 97.2 per cent state-owned joint venture with Tritex of the UK, which holds the remaining 2.8 per cent. Purpose-built in the late 1970s to produce high quality cotton cloth, plant installations are in good order. But last year, it was operating at a fraction of capacity because of supply and foreign exchange problems. Angolan cotton production collapsed after 1975 and what is produced domestically is not of good enough quality, says Mr Manuel Lopes Henriques, the manager. All cotton has to be imported from Tanzania. Chemicals come from Europe. The company has a five-year investment plan under which it has already bought new machinery. 'We need to modernise. Some of our machines are of a past generation,' says Mr Lopes Henriques. More foreign investment and know-how would be welcome but, he says, the government must protect local industries from foreign competition. Foreign investment could play an important part in the province's revival but most investors are waiting for the elections - and the uncertainty is encouraging trade and speculation rather than investment. Benguela faces very much the same problems as other provinces although its economy was particularly hard hit by the closure of the railway. A resumption of domestic, if not international traffic, would be a boost, and there is international interest in helping to rehabilitate the line. Mr Paulo Jorge, the provincial governor, is confident Benguela can prosper again. 'We can be a kind of rear-guard for other provinces. Benguela has the port and it has the railway, and they will play a big role in transporting goods to and from Huambo, Bie and Moxico provinces.'</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Imperial Oil falls sharply to CDollars 40m IMPERIAL OIL, Canada's largest integrated oil company, reported a sharp fall in first-quarter net profit to CDollars 40m (USDollars 33.9m), or 21 cents a share, down from Dollars 196m, or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 2.07bn, against Dollars 2.4bn. The latest period included a Dollars 14m after-tax loss on divestments, against a gain of Dollars 64m a year earlier. Imperial, 70 per cent-owned by Exxon, said it was putting its PVC plastics business up for sale, but would invest further in its polyethylene and ethylene businesses. The company has been re-structuring and reducing its downstream operations since its Dollars 5bn takeover of Texaco Canada two years ago. In 1992, it plans to eliminate 1,700 jobs, shut 1,000 service stations and reduce refining capacity. Nova, the Calgary gas transmission and petrochemicals group, earned CDollars 32m in the first quarter, against Dollars 26m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12 per cent to Dollars 746m.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE eases rules for foreign company listings The Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday announced a series of measures designed to make Japan's lacklustre stock market more attractive to foreign companies. Mr Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, president of the exchange, said the proposed new rules, which could take effect as early as next January, were aimed at removing the principal obstacles to a Tokyo listing, especially for Asian companies. During the last year a succession of Chinese enterprises have listed on the Hong Kong and New York stock markets where the rules are much less rigid. The Tokyo reforms are aimed specifically at private, former state enterprises of China and other Asian countries. Mr Yamaguchi said he expected the changes to pave the way for more than 200 Chinese and east Asian companies to join the exchange in the next few years. The easing of listing requirements means the current stipulation that companies must be listed on their own national stock exchange before receiving a Japanese listing will be scrapped, as will the rule requiring a minimum one-year moratorium after a privatisation. The minimum asset requirement for companies wishing to have their shares traded in Tokyo will be cut to Y10bn (Dollars 102.6m) from Y100bn. Also, a stipulation that companies have at least three years' annual profits of Y20m is being changed to a requirement of profits averaging Y2m over the three years before a listing. Companies will also no longer have to have a minimum of 10,000 shareholders. The new rules are expected to be approved by the exchange's governing body next month, and could be in place by January. Foreign companies in Tokyo yesterday welcomed the measures. 'There is no question that privatised businesses in emerging markets desperately need access to a highly liquid market if they are to realise their potential growth,' the chief executive of one large financial institution said. 'These measures will facilitate that.' However, the changes are not expected to improve prospects much for companies already listed in Tokyo. In the last year, at least seven overseas companies, including most recently, British Gas, have announced plans to delist from the TSE. The total number of foreign shares listed on the exchange has fallen from 127 in 1991 to fewer than 100 today. Most companies that have left Tokyo in the last year have complained of the collapse in share-trading volumes and exorbitant trading commissions.</p>

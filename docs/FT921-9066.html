			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Solchaga claims inflation success FOR THE past two weeks Spain's veteran finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, has been telling the country that inflation for January of anything less than 2 per cent would be a great success. Yesterday, he seemed to have engineered himself a victory with a figure of 1.5 per cent, even though it was still one of the strongest monthly rises in the past three years, taking year-on-year inflation to 5.9 per cent and clearly breaking with the downward trend since last summer. Spain ended 1991 with inflation of 5.5 per cent. The Madrid stock market reacted happily to the news, rising slightly, and the government, naturally, trumpetedits success. January's inflation figure was always going to be bad since average VAT rates have risen from 12 per cent to 13 per cent this year. The January inflation figure did not include an annual revision of house price increase. Analysts say this implies the figures are understated by 0.4 percentage points. The inflation figurefollows interest rate cuts of half a point by Spain's two most aggressive commercial banks, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco Santander, and a sharp rise in car sales in January, putting the country in a quietly confident mood. It also seems clear that the spring wage round, which is getting into its stride with a series of predictable public transport strikes in Madrid and Barcelona, will see salary rises of about one percentage point less than last year. For the moment, Mr Solchaga is sticking to an inflation 'target' of around 5 per cent for the year. It is assumed that February and March price rises could take inflation to close to 7 per cent a year, but the government is obviously having some success in slowing down the economy. Mr Solchaga is also preparing to present Spain's Convergence Plan to his European Community colleagues next month and it promises rigorously to attack public spending. His problem is in implementation, and whether he can win support from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, and the socialist party hierarchy. Mr Jorge Hay, chief economist at Banco Central Hispanoamericano, insists that 1992 inflation of between 5.5 and 6.0 per cent is probable and that the commercial bank interest rate cuts are not necessarily based on healthy projections for domestic inflation. Rather, he and other analysts agree that the strains being placed on the peseta by the weakness of the pound sterling in the exchange rate mechanism of the the European Monetary System could force cuts in official Spanish rates. Certainly, if UK interest rates are cut before a general election, the Spanish are unlikely to try to resist a corresponding cut themselves.</p>

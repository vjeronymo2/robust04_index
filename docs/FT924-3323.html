			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Vega improves 22% in first results since flotation A SERIES of new contracts helped Vega Group, the space engineering specialist, report a 22 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 631,000 in the company's first set of figures since its flotation in June. Turnover for the six months to October 31 was Pounds 3.62m (Pounds 2.76m) and earnings per share were 2.9p (2.5p). The interim dividend is 0.87p. 'The company remains relatively unaffected by the current economic recession,' said Mr John Rigg, chairman. During the period, the company won contracts worth about Pounds 3m which were in excess of the Pounds 15m of contracts included in the placing document. Customers include the Ministry of Defence, the European Commission and the European Space Agency. Current trading was strong, said Mr Rigg. 'We have no borrowing and we expect to continue to generate cash.' He did not rule out the possibility of acquisitions and had looked at takeover targets in the UK and the rest of Europe. No takeover talks were yet under way. The shares lost 2p to 122p.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / TGWU likely to keep political fund The Transport and General Workers' Union, the largest union affiliated to the Labour party, is expected to announce an emphatic vote in favour of retaining a political fund, which allows it to finance political activities. All unions with political funds have to ballot every 10 years on whether to keep them. Almost all unions have already won endorsement for their political funds in a first round of elections.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DAILY NEWS SUES UNIONS OVER VIOLENCE  </P> <P> The Daily News has sued its striking unions on charges they have used violence  to disrupt the publication and sale of the newspaper.  </P> <P> The News on Monday, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,  accused the unions of violating federal labor law.  </P> <P> It was the second lawsuit brought by the newspaper against the unions since the  strike began Oct. 25.  </P> <P> The first lawsuit, brought Nov. 29 under the civil racketeering statute,  accused the nine striking unions of coordinating a violent conspiracy to force  a favorable labor settlement or the sale of the newspaper.  </P> <P> The new complaint claims that the unions violated the Labor-Management  Relations Act, which prohibits unions from interfering with the business of  parties not involved in a labor dispute, in this case News' dealers and  advertisers.  </P> <P> The lawsuit asks for more than $50 million in losses the News claims it  incurred as a result of the campaign, which it said included "many hundreds" of  incidents of arson, assault, vandalism, threats and harassment.  </P> <P> Theodore Kheel, a labor attorney and adviser to the unions, denied the  allegations. He cited recent testimony by senior police officials who said  investigations found that the violence was committed by individuals and was not  part of a coordinated conspiracy.  </P></p>

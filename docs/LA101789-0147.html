			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NRBQ GETTING BACK ON TRACK AFTER 6-YEAR RECORD LOCKOUT;  </P> <P> JAZZ: TWO YEARS AFTER THE LEGAL WRANGLING FINALLY ENDED, THE BAND IS TOURING  WITH R.E.M. AND WILL BE IN COSTA MESA WEDNESDAY.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we look at each other and have to laugh," keyboardist Terry Adams  says of his band mates in NRBQ, "and think that it's great that we're getting  away with what we're doing, and even getting paid for it."  </P> <P> Adams and bassist Joey Spampinato founded the New Rhythm and Blues Quartet 21  years ago, with guitarist Al Anderson and drummer Tom Ardolino rounding out the  lineup for the last 16 years.  </P> <P> In that time the band has pursued a gleeful, border-less mix of American  musical styles -- they call it "omni-pop" -- that ranges from free jazz to  straight-ahead rock to country, bouncing off all points in between, with Adams'  keyboard style often described as a cross between Thelonious Monk and Jerry Lee  Lewis.  </P> <P> That facility has found them equally at home at the Berlin Jazz Festival, on  the Grand Ole Opry stage, on Hal Wilner's eclectic collections of Monk and  Disney tunes, on "The Care Bears Movie" sound track, and, as they are presently  engaged, opening for R.E.M. on its current tour. (The two bands perform  Wednesday at Costa Mesa's Pacific Amphitheatre, after NRBQ squeezes in a club  gig tonight at the Strand in Redondo Beach.)  </P> <P> The R.E.M. tour and a new album "Wild Weekend" on Virgin Records are hopeful  signs of change of fortune, but NRBQ's commercial career hasn't been a thing  that would cause many musicians to smile.  </P> <P> The band's fans include R.E.M., Bonnie Raitt, Keith Richards (who used  Spampinato on his solo album and in his dream band for the "Chuck Berry, Hail!  Hail! Rock 'n' Roll" film), Pat Metheny, Elvis Costello and others.  </P> <P> But outside the music community, NRBQ has remained very much a cult quantity.  That status was reinforced by a legal wrangle with a former label that  prevented the group from recording for six years.  </P> <P> Though Adams is well-versed in budget dining -- a vegetarian, he recommends  Taco Bell's 40-cent lard-free refried beans -- he remains unguardedly  optimistic about the band's fortunes.  </P> <P> Of the six-year lockout, he only says, "We saved up a lot of good songs that  way." Once their legal problems were resolved two years ago, within days the  band had recorded a pair of live albums. Now, with Virgin behind the band, he  thinks that the "Wild Weekend" studio album will find new fans.  </P> <P> "People have never really rejected the music; they just have never heard it. I  really think that's the reason why it hasn't taken off or been as huge as we  may think it should be. And with a major label now and the R.E.M. tour, we're  getting heard more all the time."  </P> <P> "Wild Weekend" may well be the finest of the group's 17 albums, bristling with  some of the best pop hooks since Brian Wilson's heyday, performed with a  playground zeal coupled with a musicianship so good they make it seem  effortless. Their lyrical topics range from ideal romantic love, to car love  (Adams' "Little Floater," with the line "I love you, zoom, zoom, zoom") to a  loopy tribute to zydeco accordionist Boozoo Chavis.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want lyric sheets in our records," Adams said, "It always bothers  me when people start reading along to a record instead of listening."  </P> <P> While it has caused the band to be dismissed by some critics, the lack of  heavy-handed messages in the NRBQ's lyrics serves to focus on the music, where,  like the best of ululant early rock, a sense of commitment to life is more than  implicit.  </P> <P> "I don't really think music should be anything other than what can make people  feel good," Adams said. "I like to get a good feeling from anything, whether  it's listening to jazz or country or what. If you don't watch it, you can come  in with lyrics that are depressing and come up with songs where you wonder what  you're listening to it for."  </P> <P> Active in Greenpeace and animal rights for years, Adams is encouraged to see  those and sundry movements gaining momentum. "It's great to see the response  Greenpeace is getting on this tour (the organization has representatives at the  shows). When we and R.E.M. are off stage, we've got lots to talk about because  some of us are vegetarians and we've been Greenpeace supporters for years.  We're getting to be pretty good friends now."  </P> <P> The group also has been making friends while on stage, if the several encore  calls they've gotten so far on the tour are an indication. Adams prefers that  reaction to some of the band's experiences in years past opening for other  acts, which have included an ill-fated slot with Deep Purple and a stint with  Charlie Daniels and the Outlaws, where the band was booed off after responding  to the cowboy-hat fever of the day by wearing Indian headbands on stage.  </P> <P> Adams said the current tour shows are more organized than the average NRBQ  appearance, where the group is legend for flying without a set list and  sometime tackling songs by the Chipmunks or the Carpenters.  </P> <P> "We have the same amount we want to say, but in a shorter space, so it's a  little bit more structured than usual. But we still haven't played the same  show twice on the tour."  </P> <P> That level of musical confidence and trust stems in part from the friendship  shared by the band members. "We wouldn't have been able to stay together this  long without that. I know if you were to try to replace any one guy in the band  it would mess everything up.  </P> <P> "I think each guy is in his own world, but those worlds collide in the right  way. I think maybe when we were growing up we all had open minds, and now are  able to express ourselves together in a way that no one else can, in any way  that we want to. I've been free, fortunate and gifted enough that I've been  able to do this and never had to do anything else, and never had anyone tell me  how to do it or what to do with it."  </P> <P> Now 42, Adams doesn't expect that commercial success, or a continued lack of  it, will change the band.  </P> <P> "We've already done 20 years; we might as well keep going. I wouldn't have  wanted to spend that 20 any other way. I really feel lucky to have been able to  do this, so I owe something back to that. A lot of times you feel off of (some)  music that somebody's only concerned with their own success and not with  anything relating to life itself.  </P> <P> "Musicians owe it to life, to get that life into their music. I know I've got  that from others, from (iconoclastic jazzman) Sun Ra and the Beatles.  </P> <P> "You know, Piano Red used to say, 'Music is medicine, and if you don't leave  this place feeling better than you came in, you can have your money back.' I  don't really feel that I have the ability to express what we try to get across  with anything other than music. There's no putting it in words."  </P> <P>  NRBQ plays tonight at 8 at the Strand, 1700 Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo  Beach. Tickets: $15. Information: (213) 594-8975.

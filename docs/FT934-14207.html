			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Ecu Bonds: Yields fall on German court ruling LAST Tuesday's ruling on the Maastricht treaty by Germany's constitutional court breathed new life into the Ecu market, causing it to outperform all significant European bond markets last week. Although it attached some conditions to the ruling, the court judged the Maastricht treaty for European monetary union to be consistent with Germany's basic law. While the verdict 'does not accelerate the progress to monetary union, it does remove an important factor which could have derailed it,' said Mr Adrian James, a bond analyst with NatWest Markets. After the ruling, the yield on the benchmark 8 per cent Ecu OAT due 2003 fell some 25 basis points to 6.40 per cent on Friday. The Ecu bond's yield gap over the 6.5 per cent 10-year German bund narrowed to 49 from 69 basis points. However, in spite of their sharp rises, Ecu bonds are expected to post further gains as investors return to the market after a protracted absence. 'With the last legal hurdle out of the way, we've seen keen demand from international investors,' said Mr Hans Knol ten Bensel, Ecu analyst with Kredietbank NV. Borrowers, too, are expected to flock back to the Ecu sector, adding depth to a market which was becoming increasingly illiquid amid the uncertainty following the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty in a referendum in June 1992. Following the German court ruling, the European Community was the first to tap pent-up demand for Ecu bonds last week with its Ecu1bn of 6 per cent 7-year Eurobonds. According to Mr Knol ten Bensel, 'there is great demand for current-coupon issues,' as many older bonds with higher coupons trade at a large premium to their par value, which deters many investors. The coming months will see more supply, the bulk of which is likely to be issued by EC bodies and sovereigns. Among the sovereigns, France and the UK have been regular Ecu borrowers, but Belgium is also said to be considering a programme of Ecu-denominated OLOs, or linear Treasury bonds. The next Ecu issue will be the UK Treasury's Ecu500bn 8 per cent notes due 1996, to be auctioned tomorrow. The notes are expected to meet with a warm welcome at a time when many investors are shifting back into shorter maturities in anticipation of near-term European rate cuts. 'The issue is almost perfectly timed,' said Mr Bob Tyley, head of bond analysis at Paribas Capital Markets. 'The best value is towards the shorter end,' says Mr Steven Major, senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. As he sees it, Europe's bond markets have now reached a turning point, and yield curves are set to steepen as central-bank easing resumes. Investors are also expected to take comfort from the freezing of the Ecu when the Maastricht treaty takes effect on November 1. In the past, the basket has undergone regular five-yearly revisions, and the freezing of the Ecu's composition will remove another source of uncertainty for investors, according to analysts. Meanwhile, Ecu bonds offer an interesing opportunity for French franc investors, Mr Major points out. Switching into Ecu out of francs substantially reduces currency risk, while the bonds offer a yield pick-up of some 50 basis points over 10-year OATs, he says. Another indicator of Ecu bonds' value is the relationship between actual and their theoretical yields (calculated according to the bond yields of the Ecu's component currencies). On Friday, the actual yield was some 14 basis points below the theoretical yield, indicating that the bonds are expensive relative to their theoretical value. However, many expect that spread to widen further; Mr Tyley at Paribas says the actual yield could move as much as 20 - 25 basis points below its theoretical counterpart.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: British Gas downgraded due to regulatory fears BRITISH Gas yesterday lost its triple-A debt rating, prompting speculation that the credit quality of the UK's privatised utilities may be on a downward slide, due to a stricter regulatory environment. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, lowered the credit rating of British Gas's Dollars 5.2bn of long-term debt to double-A plus, citing 'growing regulatory pressures on the company's core UK gas business' as well as the risks of diversification into gas and oil exploration and production. The company's triple-A debt rating from Moody's, the other leading rating agency, was placed under review for possible downgrade in May. S&amp;P said the regulatory protection afforded to British Gas's national monopoly has diminished since privatisation in 1986. Yesterday's downgrade raised concern among dealers that similar action could be taken against other privatised UK utilities. An official at S&amp;P said the agency was 'following the regulatory situation very closely in all the utility sectors'. S&amp;P is about to conduct its regular annual review of British Telecom's triple-A debt rating, and will focus on the implications of a stricter regulatory environment on the telecommunications industry. Secondary market prices in British Gas Eurobonds suffered in the wake of the downgrade. The yield spread of the company's Pounds 350m issue of Eurobonds due 2001 widened by three basis points to 17 basis points, relative to the comparable UK gilt.</p>

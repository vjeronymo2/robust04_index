			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Feb 02, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima  (parliament) Foreign Affairs' Committee approved the historic  motivation of a draft document on the occupation and annexation  of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1940.    The Saeima decided Jan. 27 that this document should be  submitted to the United Nations together with a request to  officially recognize that Latvia was occupied in 1940.    The adoption of the document does not solve the Russian  troop  withdrawal problem but it is still important as an instrument to  press on Russia, said Indulis Berzins, of the Latvia's Way.    If the United Nations approves of the document, Latvia would  become aware of the attitude of the world community toward the  occupation, Berzins said.    The United Nations, however, may reject or ignore the  statement if Latvia has not duly prepared its presentation, said  Janis Jurkans, another speaker at the committee meeting.    Democratic Party's Ilga Grava suggested that Lithuanian and  Estonian parliaments should be invited to draft a common  statement on occupation.    The preliminary coordination of that declaration could take  place during the Baltic-Nordic seminar, scheduled for Feb. 4-5  in Riga.    Estonia has prepared a similar statement.    The committee wants to consult Russian parliamentarians to  clarify Russia's official stance on the acknowledgement of  Latvia's occupation.    The Foreign Affairs Committee will also contact the Latvian  envoy to the United Nations, Aivars Baumanis, to find out the  anticipated reaction of this international organization to the  Latvian application.</p>

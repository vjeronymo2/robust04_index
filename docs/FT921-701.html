			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Cosmic contest - Ballot Box John Major has a new challenger. Charles Seaton Cockell is standing against him in his constituency of Huntingdon as the sole candidate of the Forward to Mars Party. Do not mock. Cockell convinced the FT in a telephone interview yesterday that he is serious. Now 24, he led the first officially recognised British expedition to Mongolia in 1990 and discovered a new species of black widow spider which now resides in the Natural History Museum. 'It is a false black widow,' Cockell says. 'It doesn't sting.' Then he went off to the former Soviet Union and, in co-operation with Leningrad zoologists, extracted the genetic code from the extinct woolly mammoth. 'The animal is bigger than an elephant,' he explains. Having started at Bristol, Cockell is doing his PhD at Oxford on genetic blood- clotting. His real subject is exobiology, which means the study of extra-terrestrial life. It can't be done properly without space research: hence his interest in the mission to Mars and its potential evidence of early molecules. Cockell says he will be happy to win 200 votes and hopes that people, including John Major, will notice his programme. When his PhD is complete, he has an offer of a job with Nasa, the American space agency, working on the Mars programme - provided it is not abandoned.</p>

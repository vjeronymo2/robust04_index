			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Political Notebook: Sharing out the protest vote The discordant din from Mr John Major's government may have obscured the fact, but the warring factions in the Tory party are not the only participants in the European elections. One or two other parties will field candidates on June 9. Remember the Greens? They won a startling 15 per cent of the vote in 1989. Mainstream politicians woke up horrified to discover that environmental fears had spread beyond long-haired folk in sandals. The Green party is still around. It intends to contest again all the 84 seats available to British members of the Strasbourg assembly. But there is no chance of another triumph for the little people. Their best ideas were stolen by ministers and supermarket chains. Voters anyway lose interest in saving the planet when they are struggling with economic recession. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats expect to fare rather better this time round. The party has no seats in Strasbourg at present. In 1989 it was on the verge of extinction after the break-up of the old Liberal/SDP alliance. After its recent success in the local elections, the party should win anything up to a dozen seats in a swathe of southern England stretching eastwards from Cornwall. The Liberal Democrats are fervent pro-Europeans - unashamed federalists, though in the German rather than the corrupted English sense of the word. Mr Ashdown is committed to a single European currency, and his party wants a stronger European parliament. It believes that majority voting in the council of ministers should be the rule. It wants an end to the 'pillared' struc-ture of intergovernmental co-operation established at Maastricht. Foreign and defence policies should be treated, like the single market, as responsibilities of the Union. On the face of it that is a fairly clear agenda. But there is a snag. The Liberal Democrats need votes from disaffected Tories. The opinion polls are clear that however fed up they are with Mr Major, those voters are not keen on transferring more powers to Europe. Hence Mr Ashdown's pledge of a referendum on the next stage of European integration. At a stroke the Liberal Democrat message was conveniently blurred. We may be federalists, those Tory voters will be told, but don't worry, you can always vote against us in a referendum. The move was opposed by several of Mr Ashdown's senior colleagues. But politics is about votes. Mr Ashdown prevailed. Then there is Mr John Smith's Labour party. Divining its stance is not easy. So far it has preferred to say as little as possible. The best one member of the shadow cabinet could offer was that it was 'pro-European'. Pressed, he said the phrase spoke for itself. There is another starting point. Labour has signed up to the platform of the Socialist Group, the most powerful multinational force in the Strasbourg assembly. The group's manifesto is as integrationist as any that can be found. It wants a single currency, majority voting as the rule in the council, much-extended social legislation, tax harmonisation and much more. But it is not quite as simple as that. Mr Smith has obscured the extent to which the manifesto commits his party. Like Mr Ashdown, he senses a chauvinistic mood in the country. Labour is unequivocal in its backing for extension to Britain of Maastricht's social chapter. But it has refused to endorse more detailed pledges on, for example, mandatory restrictions of working hours. The party is for a single currency if it comes - but does not want to sound enthusiastic about getting rid of sterling. Mr Smith's stance on an eventual referendum is indistinguishable from that of Mr Major. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, insists that Labour would not get rid of the national veto. For many in the Labour party (and one must exclude from this the party's diminished but still vocal band of anti-marketeers led by Mr Peter Shore) it is enough to be called pro-European. The isolationism of the wilderness years of the early 1980s has been replaced by the mantra that if something is good enough for France or Germany it is good enough for Britain. Never mind that our partners occasionally get it wrong. So the Labour manifesto will be 'safe' above all. Much better to let the Tories tear themselves apart and pick up the anti-Major protest vote than risk the media spotlight being turned on a distinctive opposition policy. Perhaps the Greens will not do so badly after all.</p>

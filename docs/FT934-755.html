			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Lecturers threaten strike on contracts Talks between principals of further education colleges and the Natfhe lecturers' union over new contracts broke up yesterday, John Authers writes. Natfhe said it would ballot members on holding a national strike in the new year. Mr Geoff Woolf, general secretary, said proposals over the length of the working year had proved the sticking point. Under draft contracts from the employers annual holiday leave would be halved. The College Employers' Forum said it was willing to continue negotiations before December 31, but only if Natfhe changed its position on the working year. Mr Gordon Scott, forum chairman, said that under the terms of the colleges' budget Pounds 50m in grant would be withheld if flexible contracts were not introduced. Natfhe's proposals were not sufficiently flexible to gain the extra grant.</p>

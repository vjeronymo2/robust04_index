			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of Russian </F> President Yeltsin for former Yugoslavia, to Snezana Rodic in  Belgrade on 14 March; all questions and answers in English with  superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian -- recorded]    [Text] [Rodic] How do you assess the talks with President  Milosevic?    [Churkin] I believe that this was a very interesting  conversation in which all the problems in the former Yugoslavia  were thoroughly examined. This was not a meeting at which  decisions would be taken. We need further contacts before we  can report some progress.    What I have detected is that at least in this phase, when,  as  is my understanding, the Serbs are in the initial stage of  examining the confederation concept and other elements connected  to it, President Milosevic has a rather flexible attitude. I am  particularly encouraged by this and convinced that this  initiative and the Muslim-Croatian arrangement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina could be incorporated in the search for an  overall political solution to the problems.    [Rodic] Did you bring any new proposals?    [Churkin] I offered some thoughts and impressions after the  talks that I have held in the last few days; however, this is  part of a continuous process. I am travelling to Zagreb today.  I believe that the attitude of President Milosevic toward these  issues is very flexible and constructive and I am satisfied that  he is also thinking about ways not to reject the new ideas but  to examine all possibilities that will contribute toward the  overall political solution, bearing in mind also the idea of  confederation.</p>

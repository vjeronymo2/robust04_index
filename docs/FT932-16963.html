			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Buba disappoints over rates cut ONCE AGAIN, there was apparent disappointment among bourses that the Bundesbank made no further cuts in key interest rates yesterday. The feeling seemed more acute in Paris than in Germany itself, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS may have had additional reasons. Apart from the lack of an interest rate move, either from the Bundesbank or from the Bank of France, brokers in Paris were saying that the market was overbought while Nomura, in London, reduced its weighting in French equities to zero. The CAC-40 index ended 25.49, or 1.25 per cent lower at 2,005.89 and turnover, on an estimate, fell from FFr4.1bn to FFr2.2bn. Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials group, fell FFr35, or 6.6 per cent to FFr498 as its chairman forecast lower 1993 profits. Euro Disney dropped FFr4.90 to FFr91.80 on profit-taking and LVMH, the luxury goods combine, lost FFr81 at FFr3,660 for the same reason. Schneider, in electrical engineering and construction, continued its slide, losing FFr25 to FFr675 as its parent, SPEP, climbed FFr24 to FFr463, arbitrage between the two exploring the possibility of a merger. FRANKFURT closed barely above its lows with the DAX index down 12.63 at 1,671.58, heavily influenced by falls in Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Hoechst. Turnover fell from DM5.8bn to DM4.6bn. The downturn in the DAX also marked the start of a new quarter after the window-dressing seen on Monday and Tuesday, when the index gained 23 points. Allianz fell DM37 to DM2,173 and Deutsche Bank by DM7 to DM706.50. Brokers said that the financials may have reacted to the Bundesbank decision, as well as to the ongoing correction on the domestic bond market. Hoechst lost DM4.80 to DM251.60. It now has the lowest dividend of the big three chemical stocks, and has suffered lately from a string of accidents involving spills, embarrassment and a threat to the costs of the sector. ZURICH edged back from the record closing levels of the previous two sessions. The SMI index eased 1.9 to 2,188.4, with continuing strength in blue chip issues preventing a sharper downturn. Roche certificates dipped SFr40 in immediate response to results but picked up to end unchanged at SFr4,170. A 29 per cent rise in group profit compared with estimates that had ranged from 15 to 40 per cent, but one analyst noted that the figures had been depressed by an unexpected SFr208m provision to cover employee health care costs in the US. CS Holding saw strong demand as several 'buy' recommendations were issued after the IBCA rating agency assigned an AA long-term rating to the company. CS Holding registered, SFr8 higher at SFr450, was the most active stock. Jelmoli bearers, which had been suspended on Wednesday pending results, fell SFr150 or 10.7 per cent to SFr1,250. The retailer said that it would buy out minority shareholders in its subsidiaries by offering Jelmoli shares. Movenpick, the restaurants and hotels group, saw its registered shares fall SFr41 or 5.5 per cent to SFr700 in response to this week's appointment of the third chief executive in two years. MILAN trading slowed down after a firm opening as increasingly nervous investors surveyed a government in political limbo. The Comit index finished 4.72 higher at 479.73. The construction and cement sectors put in a strong performance on expectations that the government planned agreements with individual regions to re-start public building contracts, held up by investiations in the political corruption scandal. Premafin, the building development company, slid L170 to fix at L4,630 but then soared to L5,150 after-hours, a 7 per cent rise on the day. Italmobiliare rose L800 to L40,500 and Italcementi rose L283 to L11,276. Gemina, a financial holding company with links to Fiat SpA, rallied L39 or 3.7 per cent to L1,105 in response to Wednesday's 80 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits. AMSTERDAM was quiet for much of the day before late selling left the CBS Tendency index 0.90 lower at 106.80. Aegon, the insurer, slid Fl 1.40 to Fl 87.40 ahead of results. After the bourse closed, these showed a 10 per cent rise in operating net profit, at the upper end of analysts' expectations. Nedlloyd, the shipping group, fell throughout the day, ending Fl 2.20 or 7 per cent lower at Fl 28.90. The shares had risen earlier in the week on rumours of large investors building stakes but these have now been discounted. STOCKHOLM, waiting to see what support the government would receive in a key parliamentary vote today, turned in an unexpectedly strong performance and the Affarsvarlden index rose 4.7 to 999.2. Ericsson B added SKr9 to SKr278 on news of a SKr2.2bn order from China. VIENNA dropped another 1.2 per cent in thin trade, the ATX index ending 9.21 lower at 769.49. ISTANBUL, on the other hand, climbed another 3.5 per cent, the market index rising 206.69 to 6,070.86 for a four day gain of 7.3 per cent .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 1                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1149.48    1149.44    1148.60    1148.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1222.24    1220.76    1220.71    1220.87  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1146.36    1146.33    1144.65    1144.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1220.27    1219.44    1218.99    1219.86  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 31    Mar 30    Mar 29    Mar 26    Mar 25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1149.13   1152.62   1148.76   1147.31   1133.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1220.16   1219.87   1213.37   1213.80   1200.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1149.90; 200 - 1223.37 Low/day: 100 - 1144.33 200 - 1217.68.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Roche unconcerned about US health reforms Dr Henri Meier, finance director at Roche, the Swiss healthcare group, yesterday said: 'We are not concerned at all about the forthcoming reforms. They certainly won't have a big impact on our bottom line.' Roche generated about 25 per cent of its sales in the US last year, and holds a significant position in the US hospital market. Mr Jan Leschley, of Anglo-American healthcare group SmithKline Beecham, yesterday said: 'The main transformation has nothing to do with the Clintons. It's the growth of managed care. Five years ago, it represented 5 per cent of our sales. Now it's 40 per cent. In five years it'll be 60 to 70 per cent.' Intense competition from generic drugs was a change more significant than the reforms. 'There is no need for government intervention through price controls. Prices are already controlled through competition,' he said.</p>

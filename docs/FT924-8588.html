			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather makes a hash of UK potato forecasts - Rain-soaked fields will almost certainly not produce the crop surplus that had been expected earlier / Farmer's viewpoint THE UK potato crop this year is one of the biggest ever. Total potential yield is estimated by the Potato Marketing Board at about 7m tonnes. Weather conditions during the growing season have been ideal and there is hardly a grower in the country who has produced a poor yield. But I met a specialist potato farmer the other day, a man who grew about 1,400 acres, mainly on other farmers' land which he rented for the purpose, who admitted that he expected to lose Pounds 250,000 on this year's activities. Such is the paradox of potatoes. To make a real killing from the crop it is necessary for there to be a shortage. This year there is a perceived surplus. I use the word perceived because, for various reasons, mostly to do with the wet autumn, the apparent 1m tonne excess of supply over demand will almost certainly not materialise. Domestic demand for home grown potatoes is normally around 6m tonnes. Lower home sale prices, although these are seldom passed on in full to consumers, could well lead to an increase in consumption to perhaps 6.3m tonnes., The glut on the market during the main lifting period caused ex-farm prices to collapse a few weeks ago, triggering the mechanism that allows the Potato Marketing Board to buy limited quantities of potatoes in order to take them off the domestic and processing markets. The price the board has paid - Pounds 33 a tonne - leaves no profit for the grower but the objective is to firm the price of the rest of the crop. The board has in fact intervened in the market twice in recent weeks and well in excess of 500,000 tonnes has been offered to it by growers, not all of which may be accepted. That which is accepted will be sold back to farmers, for a fraction of what the board paid for it, to be used as animal feed. The operation, although modestly underwritten by the Ministry of Agriculture, is mainly funded by growers through a system of levies paid to the board on every acre of potatoes grown. The greatest uncertainty, however, concerns the very high proportion of the crop that has still not been harvested. A week ago the board estimated that some 21 per cent of the area planted, containing about 1.5m tonnes, was still in the ground. There have been a few dry days since these figures were issued and doubtless the unharvested acreage will now be a little smaller. After double the normal rainfall in some of the main potato areas over the last three months the problems of lifting in muddy conditions have been immense. Comparative figures for recent years indicate the extent of this year's delay in potato harvesting. In 1991 at the end of October 7 per cent of the crop was left in the ground; in 1990, just 5 per cent. And the longer the delay lasts into the winter the more difficult it is to lift the crop from increasingly waterlogged soil. Furthermore it is likely that the cold weather that has accompanied the rain will have damaged a proportion of the unlifted tubers; for once soil temperatures drop below about 8 deg C (46 F), the sugar content in the starch of potatoes rises, making them unsuitable for processing and unlikely to keep well in store through the winter. Also, most potatoes lifted in present soil conditions have mud stuck to them, which also affects storability by inhibiting under-floor ventilation. This in turn can lead to the development in store of latent diseases, which could make significant tonnages unmarketable for human consumption. Some potato pundits have, in fact, predicted that national losses as a result of this combination of factors could be between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes. If they are right, and with most of the questionable potatoes still in the soil they are guessing at present, it is clear that the surplus may be more apparent than real. So, increased consumption, wastage, and the sizeable tonnage taken off the market may have created a virtual balance between supply and demand. The marketing board presumably thinks so too because last Friday afternoon the latest support buying scheme was closed. Growers now hope that there will be a firmer undertone to the market and that buyers will be prepared to pay them more than the 2p per lb most have received this season. Moreover most growers believe that in a year like 1992 the UK's potato marketing board, unique in the EC, will really justify itself. Its statutory powers enable it to control the acreage grown as well as help to manipulate the market. There is little doubt, in fact, that its activities help bring some stability to a volatile sector and that is valued very highly by the majority of potato farmers. They are upset, therefore, that, along with the marketing boards for milk and wool, the potato board, or at least its statutory powers, are set to disappear. Indeed enabling Bills to effect the changes are scheduled to be debated in the House of Lords within the next few weeks. It is all part of legislation required to bring about the European Community's single market. Hostility to the removal of the statutory powers in order to replace them with a so-called 'light' community regime is based on the failure of most other EC measures to stabilise commodity prices in an acceptable way in the long term and to the ruinous potato prices suffered by other potato growers in a year like this. In Holland and Belgium, for instance, growers are at present receiving as little as half the price paid in the UK. No European farmer, growers argue, even the ultra efficient ones in the low countries, can survive for long at such prices. UK growers also point to the apparent anomaly of a CAP reform package that seeks to control production by limiting the cropped area of commodities in surplus and compensating farmers for so doing, while at the same time insisting on the removal of a system that is already achieving such control at a minimal cost to the taxpayer. Mr John Gummer, the UK minister of agriculture, does not appear to agree. He told a group of East Anglian potato growers last week that it could not be right to restrict the acreage of potatoes grown in the UK and risk a domestic shortage which would suck in imports from other EC countries. He claimed that he did not know the details of what Brussels would shortly propose to replace the present system. It is highly unlikely, however, that the imminent proposal will include statutory powers, which are at the heart of present UK arrangements. If they do not, many UK potato growers fear a volatile future that will drive more of them out of business and suck in more imports in any case. They are fighting a probably futile rear-guard action to try to keep their tried and tested system. For they are well aware that neither they nor UK consumers would gain from a change. The only beneficiaries of a totally free market would be the processors and the supermarkets.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Money Markets: Variable rate repo THERE WAS slightly duller sentiment in European futures markets yesterday after the Bundesbank announced a variable rate repurchase agreement in its weekly money market operations, writes James Blitz. The lowest accepted interest rate in today's operation could be a few basis points below last week's rate of 8.11 per cent. But some dealers had expected the Bundesbank to bring down the cost of lending money to commercial banks through a fixed rate repo, and there was disappointment that this did not happen. This now means that there is little chance of the Bundesbank lowering the discount rate at its council meeting tomorrow, as this is so far below the repo rate level. However, there are expect-ations of a cut in the inter-nationally sensitive Lombard rate, currently at 9.0 per cent. The announcement caused a slight setback in Euromark contracts. One dealer added that there was disappointment that the figure for Germany's M3 money supply for March had not come through. Dealers are anticipating a low figure that will encourage the German central bank to ease policy. Another factor that may have suppressed sentiment was the expectation that the forthcoming inflation figures for March would show a slight rise. This would reduce any willingness by the Bundesbank to ease policy. The June Euromark contract declined to a close of 92.70 from a previous finish of 92.74. There was an even heavier setback in the September contract, which fell 8 basis points to end at 93.56. At these levels, futures dealers are still looking for quite a lot of easing by the Bundesbank. The contracts price 60 basis points off three-month money by the summer and 146 basis points off the period rate by September this year. Sterling futures markets lost some of their early strength after the figures for the government's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement were a good deal worse than the market had expected. The PSBR showed borrowing of Pounds 9.5bn last month, the highest monthly requirement on record. The June short sterling contract fell back to a close of 93.95 after earlier peaking at 93.99. Three-month sterling cash finished unchanged at around 6 per cent.</p>

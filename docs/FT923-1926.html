			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: British Euro-sceptics claim a moral victory - Growing hostility to the treaty BRITAIN'S so-called Euro-sceptics last night brushed aside Paris's projections of a narrow Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht, insisting that the closeness of the outcome vindicated their view that the treaty was no longer viable. A leading parliamentary campaigner against the treaty, Mr Michael Spicer, said last night: 'This remarkable result shows that the French have great concern about this. However, we in Britain have got our own choice to make.' Other Tory opponents of the treaty pointed out that the French vote did nothing to reverse the Danish rejection of the accord. Denmark would not be 'bullied' into a re-run simply because pro-marketeers did not like the original result, they said. The swift reaction of the Euro-sceptics to the referendum result came as their campaign to pressure Prime Minister John Major to adopt a more combative stance on European issues was given a substantial fillip by two polls showing a marked shift against the Maastricht Treaty. Their findings will fuel pressure on the government to grant a British referendum on the accord - a move Mr Major's administration and the opposition Labour party have repeatedly rejected. As polling began in France, a survey in the Independent on Sunday newspaper showed a similar plebiscite in the UK would deliver a 47 per cent No vote, with 24 per cent saying Yes and 29 per cent undecided. Before last week's sterling crisis, opinion polls had shown narrow majorities in favour of the treaty. Opposition is now shown to be strongest among Conservative voters, though the NOP poll and soundings taken by Mori for the Sunday Times indicate that majorities do not believe that Mr Major or Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, should resign as a result of the exchange rate debacle. Conservative MPs in London have been absorbing the details of the polls and the impact of a blunt speech by the former prime minister, Baroness Thatcher, in the US capital on Saturday. Welcoming Britain's withdrawal from the ERM, she urged Mr Major to press ahead with interest rate cuts and to drop his commitment to an eventual return to the ERM. Pressing home her implicit criticism of the government's policy of seeking to be 'at the heart of Europe', she argued there would be 'chaos and resentment' if the government continued to pursue the goals of the Maastricht Treaty. 'It is high time to make as complete a reversal of policy on Maastricht as has been done on the ERM,' she said. 'If the divergence between European economies is so great that even the ERM cannot contain them, how would they react to a single European currency?' Lord Parkinson, a former Conservative party chairman, yesterday added his voice to the lobby opposing return to the ERM. Describing the currency system as 'a dead duck', he conceded the recession had been more prolonged as a result of interest rates linked to those of the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Major is poised to win Commons vote on EU cash: Rightwing Tories launch late drive to force challenge to leadership Mr John Major, the prime minister, appeared certain last night of victory in today's parliamentary vote on the European Union budget as rightwing opponents on the Tory back benches launched a last-minute drive to force a challenge to his leadership. In spite of threats by a hard core of Eurosceptics to risk suspension from the parliamentary party by abstaining in tonight's vote on the EU finance bill, senior ministers said the government would secure a comfortable majority. Mr Major has warned that defeat would be followed by the government's resignation and a general election. Mr Major has a Commons majority of 14, but is assured of the votes of up to 10 unionist MPs from Ulster. The vote, however, will coincide with signs that the prime minister will seek to ease the tensions over Europe by conceding a referendum on any further significant moves towards integration. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, publicly disassociated himself from the attempts by rightwing MPs to force a contest for the Tory leadership before the deadline for any such move on Wednesday. He said on BBC television he had 'no intention' of participating in a contest. Leading rightwing figures behind the attempt to raise the 34 signatures from Tory MPs necessary to allow a challenge admitted that they were still about 10 short of that number. But they said they were now seeking backing for the move from dissidents on the left of the party. Leftwing MPs known to be unhappy with Mr Major's leadership were being told that a challenge might pave the way for his replacement with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, or Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Major's opponents voiced confidence that if they secured the signatures and could demonstrate cross-party support for a contest, then Mr Lamont would change his mind. The former chancellor appeared to leave himself some room for manoeuvre when he said that he could not 'envisage the circumstances' in which he would stand against Mr Major. Earlier Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had warned Mr Lamont that he would 'cut an absolutely ridiculous figure' if he attempted to topple the prime minister. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury secretary, said any contest would be 'deeply destructive and debilitating'. Mr Lamont's comments came as senior ministers indicated that Mr Major might promise a referendum on further transfers of power to Brussels. The prime minister was said to be acutely aware of the rising tide of opinion on the back benches in favour of a referendum before Britain considered joining a single European currency. Mr Aitken, a cabinet sceptic, reinforced that impression by describing economic and monetary union as 'an epic constitutional decision'. The issue is not expected to arise before the next general election, but rightwing ministers have joined Tory MPs in pressing for the referendum pledge to form a central plank of the party's election manifesto. Senior ministers hope that today's Commons vote on legislation to allow higher British contributions to the EU budget will allow the party to halt the latest bout of infighting. A hard core of back bench Eurosceptics was last night still threatening to abstain in the vote on the Commons legislation. The Fresh Start group of rebel MPs will meet today to agree voting tactics. The hard-line sceptics said Mr Major could not carry out the threat to suspend them if, say, 15 rebels abstained.

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALASKANS SQUARE OFF OVER HUNTING, FISHING PRIVILEGES;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE: NATIVE ORGANIZATIONS ARGUE THAT PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE CITIES  DESERVE SPECIAL RIGHTS. LAWMAKERS ARE MEETING TO UNTANGLE THE ISSUE.  </P> <P> Luke Sampson, an Inupiat Eskimo from the arctic coastal village of Kotzebue,  would have preferred to be home this week, hunting beluga whales from an open  boat in the Chukchi Sea. Instead, he has been spending his days 1,000 miles  away in the state Capitol, sitting through legislative hearings and patroling  statehouse hallways.  </P> <P> "They need to know how important our way of life is," said Sampson, a part-time  local government bureaucrat. Like many people in rural Alaska, he supports his  family through a mixture of cash jobs and living off the land and water --  everything from whale, caribou and salmon to berries picked by the bushel from  the tundra.  </P> <P> "It's how people in the villages survive," he said.  </P> <P> Sampson is one of many voices being heard here this week as the state  Legislature debates a question that has split Alaskans for the past three  decades -- should some residents have more hunting and fishing rights than  others?  </P> <P> In a state where thousands of far-flung residents head off into wilderness the  way many Americans go to the grocery store, and where cities are filled with  recreational hunters and fishermen, the debate has been loud and passionate.  </P> <P> On one side are the state's largest native organizations, representing Alaska's  80,000 Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts. They argue that people living outside  Alaska's cities, particularly natives, deserve special subsistence hunting and  fishing rights, including longer seasons, higher bag limits and first crack at  fish and game in times of shortages.  </P> <P> "It's the core of these people's existence," said Julie Kitka, president of the  Alaska Federation of Natives.  </P> <P> On the other side are the National Rifle Assn. and a variety of statewide  hunting and fishing organizations, who argue that city dwellers should have the  same access to fish and game and people in villages.  </P> <P> "The story in Alaska is that everybody else has won -- big oil, big money, big  environmental groups -- and the sportsmen have taken it in the pants," said  Rupe Andrews, the Alaska field representative of the NRA. He and others believe  the state could change laws to give people in cities equal access to natural  resources without hurting those in the villages who depend on fish and game.  </P> <P> The Legislature was called into special session this week by Gov. Steve Cowper  to try to untangle an increasingly complicated web of court decisions and  mandates from the federal government on the issue.  </P> <P> Until last year, state law had a system of allowing people in rural areas to  have special rights. But a group of Anchorage-area sport hunters filed a  lawsuit contending the law denied them the chance to live subsistence  lifestyles, and the state Supreme Court agreed, ruling the law was  unconstitutional because it discriminated against city residents.  </P> <P> Cowper, a Democrat, supports special rural rights and wants to amend the state  constitution to allow them.  </P> <P> "It's the right thing to do," Cowper said. "That's one of the values in Alaska  that we treasure, that if you opt to live in the rural areas of Alaska, then by  all rights, since you're not living in the cash economy, that you should have  the first cut at the resources out there."  </P> <P> But opposition has been fierce, especially from legislators representing  Anchorage, Fairbanks and other communities with large numbers of sport hunters.  The outdoors groups insist they are not trying to deny anyone the opportunity  to live off the land, only that everyone should have the same chance.  </P> <P> There have not been many direct conflicts between sportsmen and natives, but  the number of clashes has been growing. Last year, a federal court gave natives  the right to put a subsistence net in the Kenai River, which attracts sport  fishermen from throughout the world hoping to hook giant king salmon.  </P> <P> A group of sport fishermen, afraid the net would cut into their fishery,  cruised by the net waving rods and nets in the air in protest. A group of  native commercial fishermen were arrested last summer for allegedly threatening  a group of out-of-state sport fishermen at gunpoint, claiming they were taking  fish to which natives were entitled.  </P> <P> Clouding the whole matter is the fact that more than 60% of Alaska is federal  land -- representing half of all the federally owned land in the nation. And  federal law requires special subsistence rights for rural residents in Alaska,  and the takeover of fish and game management on federal lands if the state  doesn't guarantee it.  </P> <P> The Department of Interior is scheduled to take over game management on all  federal land here on Sunday, creating two separate sets of hunting rules. At  first, federal policy will not be appreciably different from the state, and  Washington is leaving fish management in state hands for the time being. But  Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has said an entirely new management scheme  will eventually be developed, one that the governor and the state's  congressional delegation believe will be far more restrictive for everyone  involved.  </P> <P> The sport hunting groups, meanwhile, filed another lawsuit last week,  contending the federal law discriminates against them, and they want the state  to sue, too. Legislators representing rural areas say such a suit would be an  insult to natives, and lawmakers have been fighting about the issue all week.  </P> <P> By Thursday, an unusual coalition was emerging, with at least two oil companies  and other powerful industries here -- who often work in partnership with  native-owned corporations -- joining natives such as Sampson in lobbying in  favor of the rural preference. They're supported by the state's Republican  congressional delegation.  </P></p>

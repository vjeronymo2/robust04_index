			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia will spend 32 million Australian dollars  [A$] over four years to develop telecommunications and  environmental protection in ASEAN countries.    The spending, or eight million dollars a year, is part of  the  ASEAN-Australia Economic Cooperation Program and will be  channelled through the Australia International Development  Assistant Bureau (AIDAB).    Australia has outlined six projects for development in  ASEAN:    -- Coastal Zone Development and Resource Management.    -- Waste Water Treatment Technology Transfer and Cleaners  Production Demonstration.    -- Environmentally-sound Energy Production and Waste  Disposal from Biomass/Waste Supplemented by Fossil Fuels.    -- ASEAN-Australia Forum Telecommunication Cooperation in  Training which may be implemented with Information and  Communication Technology for Sustainable Development.    -- Electricity and the Environment: A Framework for  Decision Making in the ASEAN Region.    -- Development of Food Safety and Quality Assurance  Systems for Marketing and Distribution of Fresh and Processed  Horticultural Products in ASEAN.    AIDAB's Regional Programme Officer in Bangkok, Julie Angela  Kaeowaen, said the projects are part of phase three of the  cooperation program. Phase one was conducted during 1984-89 and  phase two during 1989-94.    In each project, four consultants from Australia and ASEAN  will visit every ASEAN member to conduct a feasibility study and  come up with an implementation plan that suits the development  of that particular project.    The feasibility study has been conducted already for the  coastal zone environment and waste water projects, and the  consultant team arrives in Bangkok today to do the  environmentally-sound energy production project.    The team to deal with the telecommunications project is  expected to be here in late July. Eighteen participants from  six ASEAN members will participate in each course under the  project, which will include a training course in Australia that  varies from ten days to ten weeks depending on the course.    Miss Kaeowaen said 25 courses will be conducted under the  telecommunication project, three courses will concentrate on  policy and regulations, eight courses on economics and  management and the rest on technology.    The participants will include academics, company executives  and government officials, who will be selected by the Thai  Foreign Ministry.    Australia also launched a project under the Linkages Stream  for one year, granting A$25,000-250,000 to applicants who seek  funds to support a technical and investment feasibility study  aimed at encouraging investment exchanges between ASEAN and  Australia, mutually beneficial trade, investment promotion and  related projects.    Thailand has had the most response to this project, with 260  applications for the funds.</p>

During this meeting, Jiang emphatically repeated: "Even  if China continues to grow and becomes powerful in the future,  it will never become a military threat." He thus refuted  growing warnings by China's neighbors, who are now alarmed by  its sharp increase in military spending, that the country will  become a threat to them. Jiang also indicated he was looking  forward to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China  starting on 19 March, and said: "I want to discuss various  issues with Prime Minister Hosokawa, too."</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SCANDAL TO THE POOR';  </P> <P> $26.9-MILLION CHURCH OFFICES DRAW PROTEST  </P> <P> A dedication ceremony for the U.S. Catholic bishops' $26.9-million headquarters  building this week was joined by demonstrators, who charged that the costly and  impressive new structure reflects insensitivity to the poor.  </P> <P> As church and government dignitaries gathered for the dedication, more than two  dozen Catholic activists sang hymns such as "The Lord Hears the Cry of the  Poor" and displayed a banner admonishing the bishops to "Make Room at Your Inn,  for Christ's Sake."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing for Homeless Urged  </P> <P> "This building is a scandal to the poor," said Michael Kirwin of the Catholic  Worker house in Washington. Most of the protesters who showed up Tuesday were  from the Catholic Worker movement, which runs "houses of hospitality" for the  homeless around the country.  </P> <P> The demonstrators, who met earlier in the day with the church leaders inside  the elegant five-story structure near the campus of Catholic University, said  the money used to erect the building should have gone to help the poor and  homeless. They called on the bishops to allow a few homeless families to live  in the new headquarters during off-hours as a symbol to encourage churches,  convents and seminaries to do the same.  </P> <P> Father Kenneth Doyle, a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic  Bishops, said the church agency would "explore the possibilities" proposed by  the Catholic Workers in the meeting with several officials, including Auxiliary  Bishop Joseph Sullivan of Brooklyn, who heads the bishops' committee on poverty  issues.  </P> <P> But Kirwin said the Catholic Workers were "not at all satisfied" with the  meeting and that they were told that sheltering the homeless would be an  inappropriate use of the building.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the formal dedication, which was not disrupted by the demonstration,  drew more than 200 people, seated in rows of chairs around the building's front  door entrance that was flanked by the flags of the United States and the  Vatican.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bishops' Work Praised  </P> <P> On hand at the dedication were several members of Congress and about 60  bishops. Reps. Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.), Lindy Boggs (D-La.) and James L.  Oberstar (D-Minn.) all praised the bishops for their work on behalf of the  powerless and vulnerable.  </P> <P> Susan DeConcini, the wife of Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), declared that the  Catholic Church and the U.S. government "have the same philosophy -- that every  American counts."  </P> <P> In June, the bishops moved their headquarters to the northeast Washington  neighborhood after 47 years in a downtown building that had fallen into  disrepair.  </P></p>

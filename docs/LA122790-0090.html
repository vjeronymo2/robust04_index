			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> YOU ARE HERE;  </P> <P> SMALL STORES APPEAR TO REAP BIG REWARDS  </P> <P> Catherine McLean says her idea of a good shopping trip is an outing at the  Shops at Palos Verdes in Rolling Hills Estates.  </P> <P> Sitting on a bench inside the mall one day last week with her daughter, the  Palos Verdes Peninsula resident said that she avoids traveling to the massive  Del Almo Fashion Center in Torrance, especially during the crush of the holiday  season.  </P> <P> Too many hassles with traffic and crowds, she said.  </P> <P> But at the Shops at Palos Verdes, the atmosphere is different, McLean said. For  one thing, the sales people are helpful, she said. For another, "it's quiet."  </P> <P> Originally called the Courtyard Mall when it opened in 1981, the center  underwent a $3-million face lift last year aimed at attracting more shoppers --  and making the mall less quiet.  </P> <P> The strategy was to shed the mall's image as a miniature version of the South  Bay's other regional shopping centers and re-create it with specialty stores  appealing to the buttoned-down, middle- and upper-middle-class people living on  the peninsula.  </P> <P> "The people here really are conservative," said Mary Harris, the mall's  director of marketing. "That's why they moved here. . . . We kind of compare it  to a Connecticut or New England."  </P> <P> Davis said the mall, which is next to the 60-store, open-air Peninsula Center,  tried to create a "whole new image" by bringing in small stores that sold  quality merchandise. No Rodeo Drive chichi was allowed. No shops touting  trendy, costly, here-today, gone-tomorrow goods. In came merchants such as  Eddie Bauer, Williams-Sonoma, The Nature Co., The Bombay Co. and Talbots.  </P> <P> Judging from last year's sales figures, the new stores have rejuvenated the  mall, Harris said. Mall figures indicate Christmas sales in 1989 were up 40%  from the previous year.  </P> <P> Of course, only time will tell if the make over will prove successful over the  long haul. Harris concedes that the Shops at Palos Verdes are still in  competition with upscale merchandisers situated in malls such as Del Almo and  the South Bay Galleria.  </P> <P> And on the peninsula, the center may face another challenge -- the so-called  Hamburger Hill syndrome. The phrase refers to those people who move to the area  because of its fine schools and semi-rural life style, but then wind up with  little disposable income because of the area's high cost of housing.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, shopper Victor Carbone, who has lived in Rancho Palos Verdes for  35 years, said he has already noticed a big change. He said he used to call the  mall "disaster alley" because so few people were seen there.  </P> <P> But judging from the number of shoppers there one recent Tuesday afternoon,  those days may be over, he said. "Just look around. I've never seen this much  traffic." SHOPS AT PALOS VERDES, ROLLING HILLS ESTATES Year opened: 1981 Retail  square footage: 385,000 Anchor stores: I Magnin, May Co.

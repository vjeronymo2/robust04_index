			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Sweden to reform welfare system SWEDEN'S centre-right coalition government is preparing a far-reaching programme to transform the country's famous cradle-to-grave welfare state by exposing it to market forces and reducing the financial burden on the taxpayer. Mr Carl Bildt, the country's conservative prime minister, said he wanted to create a 'welfare market'. Full details of the wide-ranging plans are expected later next month as part of a government 'convergence' strategy designed to bring Sweden in line with the standards of the European Community, which it hopes to join at the start of 1995. The drive for greater freedom of choice in public services through an extension of private initiatives will be extended across the entire Swedish public sector. Mr Bildt is extremely worried about the growing size of the government's budget deficit, set to rise to around 10 per cent of Sweden's gross national product by 1994. Nearly half the government's spending goes on its welfare programmes. Around 60 per cent of the country's gross national product is devoted to public expenditure, the highest proportion of any country in the world. This will be reduced in stages closer to the current EC average of around 46 per cent. The sweeping plans can be expected to arouse considerable resistance inside Sweden's huge public services sector, especially from the trade unions. However, a consensus has been developing across the political spectrum that accepts the need to break-up the traditional bureaucratic system and introduce greater efficiency with more choice for people and the contracting out to the private sector - often in the form of co-operatives - of some services.</p>

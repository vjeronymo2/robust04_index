			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Parts suppliers warned on Japan Britain's motor component makers were warned yesterday that their Japanese rivals were improving quality and productivity at more than twice the average rate in the UK. They were told at a seminar backed by the Department of Trade and Industry as part of a two-year initiative that most British suppliers would never catch up with the Japanese unless they made 'fundamental changes' to their business practices. The companies have been taking part in a DTI 'learning from Japan' initiative. Under the scheme teams of senior executives from the components sector have spent weeks in Japan studying the work practices of suppliers to the Japanese assembly lines of Nissan, Toyota and Honda. As part of the DTI initiative the relative performances of the Japanese and British components sectors are being benchmarked by Andersen Consulting. Ms Betty Thayer of Andersen Consulting told the suppliers: 'On average, world-class Japanese suppliers are improving their performance by more than 50 per cent a year compared to less than 25 per cent on average (for the UK industry).' Andersen is preparing a second benchmarking report on the two industries. Two years ago an initial benchmarking exercise comparing Japanese and UK suppliers, which was undertaken by Andersen, Cardiff Business School and Cambridge University, found a two-to-one gap in productivity and a 100-to-one gap in quality performance between the suppliers, with only Unipart matching Japanese suppliers on quality. Companies taking part in the initiative appear to have been shaken by their experience of the Japanese. Mr John Horsler, managing director of Luton-based Cardale Engineering, said: 'It's no good saying we are going to improve quality by 5 per cent a year. We have got to go for 70 per cent to 80 per cent annual improvements to achieve our goal in a reasonable time.' Unipart Industries, an expanding supplier to both Honda and Toyota, stressed yesterday that the DTI was not scaremongering. Mr John Neill, group chief executive, said: 'I don't think people in the UK in general have any idea just how big the gap is between the Japanese and the British. Suppliers think they're good here - but they've really got to confront the facts.' The aim of the initiative, which started earlier this year and is backed by Rover Group and Inchcape, is to upgrade the quality of nearly 10,000 smaller British manufacturers of components. Component makers form one of the biggest elements in the manufacturing economy, with turnover estimated at Pounds 15bn a year, nearly 150,000 employees and exports of Pounds 3bn.</p>

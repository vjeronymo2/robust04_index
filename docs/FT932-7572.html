			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Markets: Exclusive, the last episode of Cheers - London MUSIC: Wouldn't you like to get away, where everybody knows your na-a-ame, where you're always glad you ca-a-ame . . . (Norman enters, jauntily) All: Norm] Norman: No beer today, Woody, gimme a bottle of cheap champagne. Cliff: Celebrating, huh, Norm? Norman: You know like in those movie car chases where the bad guy is right on the tail of the good guy? Then the good guy yanks the wheel and the bad guy goes straight on, over the edge of the canyon, splat, boom, kerpow] Woody: You been taking driving lessons again, Mr Lamont? Norman: The office, Woody] This Portillo guy, supposed to work for me but all the time his fan-club is trying to push me out and him in. Cliff: Some kind of Spanish hotshot, huh? You know, your second generation immigrants, they got a success drive . . . Norman (interrupts): No successful driving for him. Crashed and burned, total write-off. Frasier: Norman, I'm very concerned by this display of Schadenfreude. Woody: Bless you] Frasier: It's not healthy taking malicious pleasure when misfortune strikes out of the blue. Norman: Whaddaya mean, out of the blue? You think there wasn't some planning here? Carla: Great, a stab in the back, I love it. What did you do, Normie, boobytrap his desk? Bug his bedroom? Itching powder in his shorts? Norman: Nothing so crude, Carla. I gave him the chance to make his name by tackling the issue of the decade. Woody: What issue's that, Mr Lamont? Norman: You know this government deficit crisis thing me and the boss stumbled into? Carla: Yeah, yeah, you bored us with that already. Norman: Well, I said to this Portillo kid, I'll raise the taxes, you cut the spending, fair's fair, right? Radical thinking, blank sheet of paper, that kinda stuff. Frasier (awestruck): You told him to be brave? Norman: You got it. Cliff: So then what happened? Norman: What always happens, Cliffie: someone found out. Carla: His wife, right? You did bug the bedroom] Norman: Worse: the gila monsters got him. Woody: Slimy, creepy things with a vicious temper that live in a sewer? Norman: That's it, Woody: journalists. All (revolted): Eeurrghh] Cliff: Poor guy. Guess there wasn't much left when they'd finished with him? Norman: Not enough to pay prescription charges, Cliff. * * * Rebecca: Forget it, Sam. I'm not that desperate. Sam: Still hung up on that Robin guy, the English banker, huh? What's he got that I haven't? Rebecca: A way with words, Sam. You think metonomy is a gang-bang with the opera. Sam: Oh yeah? If he's so good, gimme a f'rinstance. Rebecca: Here are the last words he sent. Sam: He writes you letters? Rebecca: Kind of a quarterly bulletin. (Reads) 'On balance, the changes since the last inflation report have lowered slightly both the expected inflation rate and the probability of breaching the 4 per cent limit during the course of the year.' Stylish, huh? Sam: Gimme that. This guy can't make up his mind about anything. How about this: 'The impact next year of the Budget measures, together with the uncertainties surrounding the rate at which the output gap is likely to narrow, suggest that the probability of breaching the target next year may be a little greater than previously envisaged, but the Bank's central expectation still is that the target will be met.' Rebecca: I call it a very balanced judgment. Sam: Sure, sure. But this economist I met at the races said the Brits will have a nasty shock when they realise your pal Robin's hinting there's a chance underlying inflation could be getting on for 5 per cent next year. Maybe that's why he wants the crummy pound a bit stronger. Rebecca: He's scribbled a personal message at the end: April RPI: 1.3 per cent. Sweet] Sam: You want numbers? How's this for a number: 9 1/2 per cent. That's what my economist buddy says long gilts will be yielding next year, compared with 8 1/2 now. Put that in your market valuations. Rebecca: Sam, I preferred it when you stuck to baseball. * * * Cliff: Remember those Saatchi guys, the two brothers, used to come in here all the time trying to buy up the pictures? Carla: Yeah, one time they paid Dollars 500,000 in stock for Woody's dishcloth Cliff: Well, I ran into one of them today, said he was back for a fund-raiser. (Phone rings) Woody (answering). Hey, Mr Saatchi] Yes, I've still got the stock, is it worth anything? Only one-thirtieth of what it was in 1987? Gee, that's too bad. And now you want me to pay you some money? Ten for every 27? What kind of a deal d'you call that? A rights issue? Hey, I'm not that dumb. Frasier: Very sensible, Woody. Woody: Me and the guys at the Scottish Providential, we're kinda short at the moment. Blew our wads last year on a few of those sure-thing rights issues. Now we've got to stump up for the phone company and help ol' Norm out of a hole. Norman: That reminds me, Woody - put another Pounds 3bn on the slate. I'll pay you back next century. Can I use the phone? Woody: Why not? You and the rights issue guys are already into me for all my spare cash. Norman (on phone): Hey Ken, have you thought about turning the police force over to Group 4? Great] (Hangs up.) Woody: More champagne? Norman: Make it a jeroboam. You ever have days when everything seems to go right?</p>

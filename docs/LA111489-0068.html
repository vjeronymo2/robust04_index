			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUCTION OF BILLY WILDER'S ART FETCHES $32.6 MILLION  </P> <P> A $32.6-million auction of film maker Billy Wilder's collection Monday night at  Christie's kicked off a heady week of Impressionist and modern art sales.  </P> <P> Enormous prices are on the agenda this week and Christie's and Sotheby's are  predicting record sales, but the Wilder affair got off to a shaky start.  Several pieces brought less than their low estimates and a few others failed to  sell. The auction soon gathered steam, however, and eventually exceeded  Christie's most optimistic estimate by more than $1 million.  </P> <P> The 83-year-old collector kept his wit during the fray. "It was less  nerve-wracking than a film preview," Wilder said, and proclaimed himself  pleased with the results amid a crowd of friends and fans.  </P> <P> "Head of a Woman," a 1921 classical pastel portrait by Pablo Picasso, brought  the auction's top price of $4.8 million but less than Christie's low estimate  of $5 million.  </P> <P> Two works by Joan Miro more than made up for the Picasso. A sprightly 1936  gouache, "The Farmer and His Wife," valued at $1.5 million to $2 million,  brought $2.7 million from an unidentified American dealer. "The Star," a 1927  oil inspired by a dream, commanded $2.6 million -- significantly more than  Christie's high estimate of $1.6 million.  </P> <P> Seven works sold for more than $1 million each, including Picasso's "Two Nude  Women and Head of a Woman" ($1.98 million) and Alberto Giacometti's painted  bronze sculpture "Standing Woman II" ($1.1 million).  </P> <P> Records were set for 12 artists. Balthus' painting of a teen-age nude, "La  Toilette," sold to a European dealer for a record $2 million. Ernst Ludwig  Kirchner's painting "Two Nudes on a Blue Sofa" brought $1.5 million, a high for  the German Expressionist.  </P> <P> The auction also set records for Joseph Cornell ($495,000), Nicolas de Stael  ($638,000) and Mario Marini ($671,000).  </P> <P> Wilder, who was born in Austria and worked in Berlin as a young man, moved to  Hollywood in 1934. He acquired most of his modern art in the late '40s, '50s  and early '60s. Those were his prime film-making years, when he directed the  Academy Award winners "The Lost Weekend," "Sunset Boulevard" and "The  Apartment," as well as "The Seven Year Itch" and "Some Like It Hot."  </P> <P> Although Wilder lacked the means to buy major paintings by renowned artists, he  snapped up high-quality works on paper and small sculptures and developed a  sharp eye for new talent.  </P> <P> The works sold at Christie's range from figurative to abstract and cover nearly  100 years, but they reflect a fondness for Expressionist nudes, literary twists  and spicy wit.  </P> <P> Wilder's modern art covered the walls of his former home in Beverly Hills and  his present apartment on Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles contingent including his wife, Audrey, actresses Claudette  Colbert and Angie Dickinson and writer Dominick Dunne watched the auction from  Christie's boardroom, but Wilder joined the crowd in the sale room.  </P> <P> He has not revealed what he plans to do with his millions.  </P> <P> Impressionist and modern art auctions will continue tonight with a big-ticket  sale at Christie's, including 14 works from the Paul Mellon collection valued  at $85.5 million to $90 million. Drawings and watercolors will go on the block  Wednesday morning at Christie's, followed by relatively low-priced paintings  and sculptures in the afternoon.  </P> <P> The auction crowd will move to Sotheby's on Wednesday night for the season's  most highly publicized event -- the sale of Picasso's "Au Lapin Agile."  Sotheby's officials have predicted that this 1905 cafe scene depicting the  artist as a harlequin may break Picasso's record of $47.9 million and possibly  bring more than the $53.9 million paid for Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the  world's most expensive artwork.  </P></p>

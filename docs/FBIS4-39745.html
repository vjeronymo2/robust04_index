			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Shalnev: "More Important Than </F> Generals. Yuriy Baturin on the Inside of the Kremlin"]    [Text] When Boris Yeltsin sets off for his regular  vacation this summer -- or fall -- Yuriy Baturin, the  president's national security adviser, will be left "in charge"  of the Kremlin apparatus. One aide always remains in the  Kremlin during the vacation period, while the others all take  the opportunity to take a breather while the president is away  from Moscow.    Why Baturin exactly? Because the job description of his  post, which was created at the end of last year, could not be  better suited to the problems which almost traditionally arise  when Yeltsin is on vacation.    Baturin, if I am not mistaken, has never yet publicly  outlined the range of his functions and the duties which the  president has imposed on him.    Conversations in the Kremlin and in a number of government  and nongovernmental organizations and departments, however, now  permit us to form a definite impression of what the national  security adviser does.    Parallels with the United States, where national security  advisers have automatically belonged for many decades now to  what we call the presidential staff, would in this case be  considerably strained.    For at least two reasons. In the United States the status of  such aides is enshrined in law. In our country neither Baturin  nor any other other presidential aide has such a status.  Though, as it turns out, work on a Statute on Aides, which will  subsequently be formulated as a presidential edict -- but once  again without legislative ratification -- has been going on for  several months now. True, the scheduled deadline for the  preparation of the draft statute, it is said, has already  passed, but in point of fact there is no special reason for  haste. Everyone knows anyway that, as one high-ranking official  told me, "the president forms his apparatus as he sees fit, and  he is fully entitled to do so" and that, in addition, the leader  of each department and each level of authority understands that  the aides are the president's right-hand men, and, if anyone  refuses to fulfill a request or requirement from an aide, "he  will be in hot water the next day."    And second: Unlike the United States, where threats to  national security, whether real or potential, stem mostly, if  not 100-percent from without, danger to Russia's national  interests is bounded by quite different parameters -- internal  or peripheral.    Hence Baturin -- who has not, incidentally, been relieved of  the duties linked with his previous position of adviser on legal  questions, from which he was transferred to national security --  is concerned first and foremost with internal situations.  Naturally, conflict and potentially explosive situations,  whether it be the situation in, say, Tajikistan, or the latest  hostage crisis in Ossetia.    His sphere of influence is the power structures. True,  Baturin himself is categorically against his post being seen as,  let alone being called, that of coordinator of the power  ministries and departments. He prefers another term -- adviser  [pomoshchnik]. An adviser to these structures on their contacts  with the president, and -- not without importance -- on  resolving the problems which these structures encounter.    Relations with the power structures are various. With some  -- particularly with the Federal Counterintelligence Service,  the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Border Guards, and the  government communications service -- contacts are very close and  productive.    Contacts with other departments are marked by problems. None  of those with whom I spoke went into detail, still less spoke  about the difficulties in such a way as to make it possible to  give a direct reference to the source afterward.    But without direct quotations I will remark that the lack of  enthusiasm over the creation of the post of national security  adviser which was initially typical of all power structure  workers, virtually without exception, and which Baturin managed  to overcome in his relations with some of them, still remains in  his work with the defense minister and, in particular, with the  foreign minister.    Both these ministers, as is well known, are very close to  the  president and are accustomed to direct access to Yeltsin.  According to certain information, Boris Yeltsin, clearly  understanding the delicacy of the situation, is himself not  inclined to accelerate Baturin's transformation into a broker in  his contacts with Kozyrev and Grachev. Baturin, according to  the comments of people who are well acquainted with his style  and methods, is also not keen on the idea, preferring to operate  gradually, step by step, not throwing his weight around but  simply giving others the chance to see that he is really useful  and necessary precisely as a connecting link with the president,  as a man vested with the powers to resolve many questions --  including extremely problematic questions -- independently,  without pestering Yeltsin.    Are there exceptions to these powers? Of course. The  exceptions are situations requiring a political solution, or  when two or three directly contradictory opinions are expressed  on the same question. Then recourse to the president is  inevitable; these polar options are placed on his desk and he,  and only he, chooses the one which he considers correct and  acceptable.    As if illustrating the delicacy of his relationship with the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baturin refused outright to name  even one foreign country whose problems -- in particular  problems connected with these countries' relations with Russia  -- the president has instructed him to tackle directly. To a  certain extent, understandably, the same delicacy characterizes  relations within the presidential apparatus itself, where, as is  well known, the post of foreign affairs adviser, occupied by  Dmitriy Ryurik, has existed for a long time.    Nevertheless, the geographical or strategic range of  Baturin's "foreign" functions can be calculated approximately  from the fact that, for example, the national security adviser,  who often accompanies the president on foreign trips so as to  "avoid confusion," intends to go with Yeltsin to Naples in July  for the meeting of G-7 heads of state and government.    Continuing the theme of the difficulties which can be  explained by purely personal factors and the traditions of  interdepartmental bureaucratic friction, it is impossible not to  touch on the situation, in some ways paradoxical, whereby  alongside the president's adviser tackling national security  problems and endowed with a small, but nevertheless his own  staff of assistants a similar structure operates in parallel --  the legislatively enshrined Security Council, headed in everyday  practical functions by Oleg Lobov and having, naturally, its own  apparatus.    Relations between these two structures -- and no one has  sought to deny this -- are strained. Lobov, considered by some  as "Yeltsin's man," found out about Baturin's appointment, it is  said, only from newspaper reports. However, the appointment was  so sudden that the Security Council secretary was not the only  one left in ignorance until the last minute.    But the problem, it seems to me, is not so much in possible  personal grievances and suspicions that someone wants to  undermine someone else. The problem is different; genetic,  perhaps. A situation has arisen whereby two structures handling  in principle the same questions and to some extent duplicating  one another are forced to coexist. Competition, and all that  competition entails, cannot be avoided.    For example, competition over such an apparently banal  question as who has what access to the president. Baturin meets  Yeltsin almost every day, Lobov -- once a week; saying, it is  true, that such meetings are sufficient, but at once adding: "I  would like to meet more often."    Or the problem of keeping informed. Baturin, all the reports  suggest, possesses far more information possibilities than the  Security Council, even though in theory the sources are the same  for both. But I was told that departments and ministries share  information, mostly of an operational nature, with the  president's adviser even in cases when he does not specifically  request it. The Security Council, however, informed people  testify, mainly receives information in response to requests,  and sometimes in the form of weighty analytical documents. But  clear and succinct information is needed -- there is no dispute  here -- bearing in mind in particular that the president prefers  to deal with documents numbering two or three pages, and  frequently just one page.    Incidentally: According to sources, Baturin intends to  institute the preparation of a daily report for the president --  a kind of "list of threats to Russia's national security." It  will be exactly one page in length with, it is true, more  lengthy fact sheets appended, so that the president, if  necessary or if he so desires, can turn to them for details.  Relevant places in the fact sheets will be underlined and  highlighted in advance.    Kremlin sources intimate that the Security Council sometimes  looks "an unwieldy, not very resourceful organization akin to an  academic scientific research institute, preparing rather too  facile documents from which -- as was the case, for example,  with Russia's military doctrine -- it is difficult to calculate  practical tasks and, for instance, budgetary directives." The  sources do not rule out that the same could happen with national  security strategy, which is currently being elaborated and  "whose adequacy cannot be vouched for."    Sources which, I would say, reflect the opposite side's  opinion do not hide the fact that, if certain problems and  situations had been passed through the Security Council and its  apparatus, it would have been possible to avoid certain major  blunders and miscalculations of recent times, as was the case --  I am quoting the sources -- with the release of the Lefortovo  prisoners, or the furor that arose over the Russian military  bases in the Baltic. "The decisions in that case might have been  different," they told me.    Can the problem of the collaboration between these two  structures, so similar in their functions but intrinsically  different in their methods and the nature of their activity, be  solved? I confess, I felt no confidence in my interlocutors'  answers that, without radical interference from the president to  clearly divide rights, duties, and functions between the  Security Council and his national security adviser, spelling  them out in detail, their coexistence will not continue to be  marked by behind-the-scenes friction and mutual reproaches,  which, whichever way you look at it, reflect on the efficiency  and impact of the performance of common tasks.    An almost ideal option is probably the American set-up, in  which the president's national security adviser and the National  Security Council are an integral unit, with a single apparatus  and combined functions.    Let us return, however, to Baturin's daily activity. Apart  from everything else, this includes questions of the arms trade  and, at the same time, weapons destruction laid down in  international agreements and accords; questions of the  development and consolidation of the production of those high  technologies in which, the president's aide says, "we must in no  event concede primacy, since otherwise we will be left  hopelessly behind"; and problems of the defense sector.    Finally there is the elaboration of the doctrine, strategy,  and concept of Russia's national security. As far as I was able  to understand it, Baturin will finish the preliminary work at  least by the end of the year and -- it is not ruled out -- will  share its results with the public, in the form of a newspaper  article, for instance.    In principle Baturin does not believe that the concept  should  be formulated in the form of some sort of signed document,  referring, sources say, to the fact that Britain gets by  perfectly well without a written constitution. But the  definition and recognition of what the aide calls "Russia's  permanent interests," which can be outlined, agreed, and  officially recorded at a closed session of the Security Council  and to which future generations of Russian statesmen can refer,  is essential.    What are these interests? From conversations with people who  are well acquainted with the president's aide's theoretical  "kitchen," two areas can be seen clearly enough: "Closely  binding together Ukraine, Belorussia [Belarus], Russia, and in  the remote long-term Kazakhstan,"; and second, "Russia must not  leave Central Asia; otherwise serious threats to Russia's  security could arise there."    These are the elements of the basis on which strategy for  the  next 10 to 30 years is to be elaborated, with definitions, in  particular, of the methods and means of achieving set tasks, and  also the doctrine of national security for the next 50 years,  including intelligence, military, counterintelligence, and other  doctrines.    ...June 2nd was the first anniversary of Baturin's  appointment as the president's adviser on legal questions. He  hardly suspected then what he would be involved in by this  anniversary, or that he would be left "in charge" during the  president's regular vacation, since "all sorts of unpleasant  things begin" precisely at such a time. These things are now,  it appears, his main speciality.</p>

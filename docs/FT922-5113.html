			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (9): Institution wields a big stick - Profile of Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec THE CAISSE de depot et placement du Quebec has long prided itself on speaking softly but carrying a big stick. However, as the resources at its disposal grow, the institution which manages Quebec's government pension and insurance funds is starting to turn up the volume, and wield its stick a little more forcefully. The caisse's widening influence is visible both in Quebec and far beyond the province's borders. At home, it has taken a leading role over the past year in refinancing and reorganising Domtar, the Montreal-based pulp and paper producer in which it and another Quebec government agency have a combined 42 per cent stake. Well aware that it contributes more than a tenth of all transactions on the Montreal stock exchange, the caisse is nudging up its slice of the business to securities firms which track Quebec-based companies. However, its most ambitious thrust is on the international front. More than 16 per cent of the caisse's assets, totalling CDollars 41bn, is invested in foreign bonds and equities. This proportion is likely to grow in coming years. Mr Jean-Claude Delorme, the caisse's chairman, says that the caisse wants to build on the contacts it has gained around the world. 'If we were to stop there, I don't think we'd be getting the full benefit of our connections,' Mr Delorme says. 'We should use the leverage that the caisse can muster to bring foreign industrial groups to consider Quebec as an area to invest.' The leverage is being wielded in a number of ways. First, the caisse is moving beyond passive portfolio investments abroad. For example, last April it spent over CDollars 30m on a 2 per cent interest in Compagnie Belge de Participations Paribas (Cobepa), a Belgian industrial and financial holding company. The caisse has a seat on Cobepa's board, which may help open opportunities in Europe as well as identify European partners for investment in Quebec. Cobepa is a minority shareholder in Power Corporation, one of the most influential players in Quebec business. It has interests in several other Quebec companies, including DMR, a data processing group; Unigesco, a food distributor; and United Auto Parts. At the same time, the caisse is thrusting deeper into the international property market. It has forged links in the past few months with a number of foreign institutions which are likely to lead to new investments. The caisse's growing interests outside Quebec enable it to make a virtue out of necessity. As Quebec's and Canada's biggest investor, the pressure to diversify is strong on both commercial and political grounds. Continuing to find profitable new outlets at home for a rising inflow of funds has become increasingly difficult. Not much happens in Canadian business without the caisse knowing. It has equity stakes in about 350 Canadian companies. Most are minority shareholdings of less than 10 per cent but in some cases - such as Domtar, printing and publishing group Quebecor, cable-TV operator Videotron and a host of small businesses - the caisse's shareholding is large enough to give it a decisive say. The bigger it gets in Canada, the more exposed the caisse becomes to political criticism. Even some of its admirers wonder whether it isn't time to think of splitting it into a number of smaller units. Being a shareholder in various companies which compete in the same sector and in the same country has raised questions about conflicts of interest. Concerns on this score could grow as the caisse, like other institutional shareholders, takes a more active interest in the management of companies in which it invests. Mr Delorme, an articulate lawyer who headed Canada's overseas telephone company prior to joining the caisse two years ago, has no qualms about size. Measured internationally, he says, the caisse is not large. Where there is a threat of conflicts of interest, investments are divided up among different portfolio managers. The caisse, Mr Delorme insists, is usually trying to do no more than 'assist companies to do what they think is good for their own future'. Nonetheless, Mr Delorme believes there is room for closer liaison between shareholders and corporate management. Although he eschews the kind of shareholder activism recently seen in the US, he sees the caisse as more than a passive investors. The best way to solve a company's problems, he notes, is not necessarily to sell the shares.</p>

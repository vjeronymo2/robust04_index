			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Tighter pension fund law planned in next two weeks THE GOVERNMENT is to bring in legislation in the next fortnight to tighten the law on the use of pension funds by employers for investment in their own or related companies. The measures on self-investment are being hastened through in the face of mounting pressure from MPs and a number of pensions organisations after the disclosures that as much as Pounds 400m may have been plundered from six Maxwell company pension funds. The regulations, which will become effective by the end of next month at the latest, will reduce self-investment to 5 per cent of a pension fund's resources. Schemes currently above the 5 per cent limit will be required to cut their level of self-investment, but only for certain types of investment. Two years will be allowed to unload loans and equities listed on the stock exchange and five years for equities traded on the unlisted securities market. Most small self-administered schemes and individual insured schemes will be exempted from the regulations in cases where written agreement by all the members is provided to each act of self-investment. Where schemes currently have holdings of property or equity in private companies, they will not be required to take action to disinvest, but no further self-investment will be allowed. The property exemption from divestment is designed to avoid further damage to the depressed property market. While the new restrictions will be welcomed, they are certain to mean that Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, is pressed to bring in broader controls to strengthen pensions and trust law. Some organisations representing employees have argued that government concern in recent years has been weighted on the side of employers seeking ways to utilise surpluses in pension funds. The surpluses accumulated during the '80s in a strong investment market while possible beneficiaries were diluted by redundancies. Mr Newton faced calls yesterday from Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, to safeguard the pension funds of companies in liquidation by using their assets to protect their pension funds. There are also likely to be renewed demands for action from the all-party social security committee of MPs. The Department of Social Security is already considering a proposal put by Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the committee, in a letter to Mr Newton, to initiate a system of self-regulation of pension funds. In addition the National Association of Pension Funds is lobbying for equal representation between employers and employees on funds with independent trustees in some cases.</p>

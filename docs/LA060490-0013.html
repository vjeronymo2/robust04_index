Tim  Peters.  </P> <P> No one was injured.  </P> <P> The son, Saul Holguin of Canyon Country, had accompanied his mother, Ramona  Holguin, to a mini-mart in the 16300 block of Sierra Highway. She left the keys  in the ignition of her 1986 Cougar and the thief got in the car and drove off,  Peters said.  </P> <P> Saul Holguin chased him north on Sierra Highway. Holguin swerved when the thief  tried to ram his truck, but the vehicles sideswiped each other. As sheriff's  patrol cars joined in the chase, the stolen car stalled.  </P></p>

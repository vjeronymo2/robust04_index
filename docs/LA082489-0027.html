			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEWIS LEADS 800 RELAY TEAM TO WORLD RECORD;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA TRACK CLUB CLOCKS 1:19.38 TO BREAK MARK SET BY USC TEAM IN '78  </P> <P> Carl Lewis teamed with three Santa Monica Track Club sprinters Wednesday to  break the world record in the 800-meter relay at the Koblenz international  track and field meet.  </P> <P> Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, and teammates Danny Everett, LeRoy  Burrell and Floyd Heard finished in 1 minute 19.38 seconds, besting the mark of  1:20.26 set in 1978 by a team from USC.  </P> <P> Their record came despite a sloppy exchange between Heard and Lewis and  highlighted a banner day for U.S. athletes, who won six men's and three women's  events.  </P> <P> Everett took a big lead as the starter, and Burrell maintained it during his  second leg. Heard, running third, lost some ground to the Santa Monica Track  Club II team.  </P> <P> But Lewis, cheered on by 15,000, accelerated during the final 200 meters after  taking the baton, far ahead of Mark Witherspoon of Santa Monica II.  </P> <P> The Americans entered the meet with the intention of establishing a world  record.  </P> <P> Julius Kariuki of Kenya, an Olympic champion, won the 3,000-meter steeplechase  in 8:12.18, but failed to break the world record set last month by countryman  Peter Koech with a time of 8:05.35.  </P> <P> In a duel in the men's 100, Witherspoon finished 0.01 of a second ahead of  second-place Robson Da Silva of Brazil, winning in 10.16.  </P> <P> Johnny Gray won the 800 in 1:43.98. Mark Rowe took the 400 in 45.44 and fellow  American Kevin Young won the 400 hurdles in 47.94. The United States also won  the women's 400 relay in 43.43.  </P> <P> Pauline Davis of the Bahamas won the women's 100 in 11.15, followed by Mary  Onyali of Nigeria in 11.25.  </P> <P> Grace Jackson of Jamaica won the women's 400 in 50.93; Angela Chalmers of  Canada won the 3,000 in 8:46.64, and France's Monique Ewanje Epee took the 100  hurdles in 12.77.  </P> <P> Susi Faver of the United States battled with Britain's Lorraine Bakker to win  the 800 in 2:00.56. Larry Myricks of the United States won the long jump in 27  feet 8 inches, and American Jan Wohlschlag won the women's high jump with a 6-4  1/2.  </P></p>

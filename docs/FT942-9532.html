			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: Acceptable face of patronage - David Murray meets a celebrated private sponsor of the arts For a start, of course, you need to be fairly rich. Mrs Jackie Rosenfeld, a passionate music-lover since her early years in ballet, is very rich; but she is also a passionate, practical organiser of fund-raising musical events. On Tuesday, a few months after she received the OBE for her services to music, the London Philharmonic Orchestra made her their first Honorary Life Member. As well they might: long before her second husband, the Hatton Garden jeweller Ben Rosenfeld, died 13 years ago, she was planning all their galas, and over the years she has raised more than Pounds 7m for the LPO. Recent reports about the straitened circumstances of the Arts Council, and the consequent starving of some artistic endeavours, have generally assumed that only corporate sponsorship can take up the slack. The familiar worries are rehearsed: will big sponsors be leery of innovation if it isn't sexy? Will they interfere with artistic policy, when their motives have less to do with excellence than with maximal commercial exposure? Private patrons of public music are less exigent. In programme-books they get recognition in small print. Why do they do it? I went to ask Mrs Rosenfeld, whose involvement with music is generous and comprehensive. Her grand flat in St. James's Place, overlooking Green Park, accommodates any amount of music-business. The phone and the fax-machine are constantly busy, for beyond her LPO commitments she is or has been governor or director of the South Bank itself, of the Royal College of Music, the Israel Philharmonic, the Music Therapy Charity, the Mondsee Festival in Austria, the near-legendary Prussia Cove Seminars for budding virtuosi. She personally sponsors single concerts and chamber-music series too. Why? 'To me, it's a great privilege to be involved in something which you love. It's a lot of work; but you see, I've nothing to do] I'm not a shopper, I'm not a luncher.' In London, how many patrons operate on a scale like hers: maybe three or four others? 'I think there must be a dozen; I've never really added them up . . .' She admits to tapping the same people pretty often for support; that has made her very sensitive to what they will enjoy hearing. For fund-raising galas, 'bottoms on seats' is the bottom line. I wondered whether that makes her a conservative brake on programming. She has persuaded the violist Nobuko Imai to leaven her forthcoming Hindemith series with Brahms (for which relief much thanks). What about new music? 'It's not a great interest, but I like Berio, and I like Harry Birtwistle.' Later she remembers to mention George Benjamin too; we agree that he is a complete musician, and ought to be more prolific than he is. Apart from galas, does she claim a say in planning the LPO's regular seasons? 'Yes, I do: a little bit, to a certain extent, not very much. And there's no reason for them to take any notice of me]' (That cannot be quite true.) 'But - I do have a little say. Because sometimes I get feedback from our audience: 'we don't like this, we'd prefer that'. And one should listen; they're our public, and they've been loyal to us for many years, and if we didn't listen it would be very foolish.' How does Mrs Rosenfeld rate Arts Council support against private patronage? 'The Arts Council made a terrible fiasco last year (the abortive run-off between the major London bands). Very sad, because that money would have gone to the orchestras, which they desperately needed. It was a complete waste of time and money.' Still, it cannot be exciting for private patrons to find themselves just filling the gaps in state funding? 'But if they pick up the tab of a concert, they then can take their 200 tickets and do what they like with them. They can fund-raise for their pet charity, which is what I do again and again (Bosnian children are her current concern). They're becoming a sponsor, they're helping the arts and they're helping a charity] It actually works very well.' Besides, you could always fund an orchestral chair, guaranteeing (say) the first bassoon's salary for many years to come: a boon and a relief for any beleaguered orchestra. 'It's rather nice, because then you choose the instrument that you prefer. I love the cello, so I funded the cellist; a great friend of mine funded the violin. I think it's a nice idea.' Among the plutocrats, Mrs Rosenfeld must be a great, sweetly reasonable force for the good.</p>

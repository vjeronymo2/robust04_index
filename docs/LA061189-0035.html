			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREPAREDNESS MAY PAY  </P> <P> Industry officials take some pride in their readiness to cope with an oil spill  off the California coast. One consortium maintains three oil-spill response  ships with booms to control the spreading oil and skimmers to scoop up the goo  before it can foul California beaches. But recent studies by local, state and  federal agencies demonstrate that most of the state's 1,200-mile coastline is  virtually defenseless against a major spill. Even where ships are available, an  accident easily could overwhelm any containment and cleanup effort.  </P> <P> California's first defense is to make certain that such an accident does not  happen. But even in the aftermath of the Alaskan spill, the actions of federal  officials who control the sea lanes are not confidence-inspiring. The U.S.  Coast Guard recently proposed creation of a 5-mile-wide ship corridor in  federal waters between San Francisco and Los Angeles that would be free of  obstructions such as offshore oil rigs. But the Interior Department objected  that such a "fairway" would interfere with the department's plans for leasing  offshore tracts for oil and gas development.  </P> <P> So now the Coast Guard is considering an alternate plan of two 1-mile-wide  fairways separated by a 2-mile-wide median in which platforms could be built.  Thus, oil supertankers that take miles to stop or turn sharply would have to  thread their way north and south via one-mile wide lanes flanked on either side  by oil platforms. A Coast Guard official in Washington has told The Times that  a 5-mile, ship-traffic corridor would be overkill.  </P> <P> But if it takes overkill to err on the side of caution, so be it. Consider the  alternative: A 10-million-gallon spill from a tanker aground on Pt. Arena would  reach San Francisco Bay in a week, Monterey in 20 days and Morro Bay in a  month. One at Pt. Conception would put crude oil on the beaches of Malibu  within 10 days.  </P> <P> Stringent traffic control is the simplest and most-quickly obtainable defense  against a collision and spill. Radar and satellite-navigation systems to  control ship movements are readily available. There is no excuse for failing to  implement such a program immediately.  </P></p>

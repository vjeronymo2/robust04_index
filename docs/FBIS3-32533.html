The French official also said he was "convinced that once  Mexico concludes the process of joining" the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE), "it will become an  active member."    Shortly before beginning a three-day official visit to  Mexico, Jupp affirmed that France "is happy" the OCDE decided,  in June, "to take into consideration Mexico's candidacy given  Mexico's significant economic progress in past years."    The European minister denied the crisis in the southern  Chiapas state would hinder Mexico's integration into the OCDE.  Jupp said: "Mexico will know how to resolve the State of  Chiapas conflict through dialogue; this is not an obstacle to it  becoming an OCDE member."    Alain Jupp denied the Chiapas conflict could adversely  affect  investments in Mexico while he expressed assurance that France  wants these to increase thereby contributing to the nation's  development. "It is through development that events like those  that occurred are avoided," he noted.    Jupp said his visit, "30 years after General Charles De  Gaulle's historic visit," is an expression of "the continuation  of France's policy toward Mexico, and our willingness to develop  a privileged relationship" with that Latin American nation. "One  of the main reasons for my trip is to stress France's wish to  become the bridge between the EU and Mexico," he assured.    Jupp indicated that NAFTA will favor international trade and  will contribute to Mexico's modernization, nevertheless, he  warned against the increase of discriminatory measures against  third nations.    "France is pleased with the benefits NAFTA may contribute to  Mexico and with everything else that could stimulate the  economy's vitality. This strengthens the possibilities between  both nations as long as the agreement does not adopt  discriminatory measures against third nations," he noted.    Jupp denied that the trilateral agreement, which was  implemented on 1 January, is "a trade block; rather, it is a  free trade zone" and "its creation should contribute to the  development of international trade," he added.    "French companies are aware of all the benefits they can  obtain from an agreement that will continue fostering Mexico's  modernization in all sectors, including that of environmental  protection," the foreign minister remarked.    "I am certain Mexico will gladly accept France's  technological capabilities in favor of the ongoing  liberalization, to which the trade agreement should contribute,"  Jupp indicated.    "Mexico's economic vitality, together with its rich cultural  tradition, justify Mexico to be France's privileged associate in  Latin America, and we intend to continue developing this  relationship," assured the high-ranking French official.    "We seek to give a new thrust to the relationship between  both nations through the development of economic ties. The  reforms adopted by President Salinas de Gortari have allowed  France's presence to be stepped up in Mexico," Jupp assured.    For France, Mexico is "an important political and economic  associate," the head of French diplomacy indicated.    Regarding the possibility of Mexico becoming a UN Security  Council member, Jupp said that "in France's opinion, the  evolution of the international situation makes it necessary to  enlarge the UN Security Council."    Other nations besides France and Mexico have expressed  interest in enlarging the UN Security council. To analyze this  possibility, a work group at the UN General Assembly was  appointed, the foreign minister indicated. "We believe that the  aspirations of the nations willing to assume greater  responsibilities in the international field should be taken into  account," the foreign minister noted. "It is necessary to guard  the Security Council's efficiency and assure the developing  nations a just representation in this essential body of the UN  system," Jupp commented.    The foreign minister also said his government will initiated  new policies of rapprochement with Latin America in an effort to  support social and political development in the region's  nations. "Latin America has reaffirmed political pluralism and  its economic vitality has turned it into a region of constant  development, leaving behind the crisis of the 80's," he assured.    Alain Jupp added that "France wants a new type of  relationship in association with Latin America, adopted to the  new realities." The governments that respect the state of law  will be favored "in the strategies taken into consideration to  strengthen the Franco-Latin American ties." Likewise, he added  those nations that "combat terrorism and drug trafficking to  assure their institutions' stability," will be given priority.    The French Government will promote "the establishment of  French companies in Latin America" while scientific and  technical cooperation will be jointly implemented so the  economic projects benefit the region and France.    Jupp indicated that "France must adapt its cooperation to  the different nations on the continent and maintain its aid to  the less developed regions while modernizing its cooperation  with others."    France represents 20 percent of the EU's cooperation in  Latin  America. "It is the French Government's duty to motivate its  associates in this cooperation and to spell out new, concrete,  and lasting actions," he indicated.    The French foreign minister encouraged the Cuban Government  to democratize. He commented that the economic reforms "are  interesting but will not serve to replace the political liberty  the Cuban people expect."</p>

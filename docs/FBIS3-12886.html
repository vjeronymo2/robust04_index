The Babil newspaper, run by President Saddam Husayn's eldest  son 'Uday, said it was "desirable for the leaders of Iraq, Libya  and Sudan to hold a summit meeting ... and adopt a common  stance" to meet the challenges facing Arabs in the wake of the  February 25 massacre, when a Jewish settler gunned down dozens  of Moslem worshippers.    Such an alliance was "necessary ... due to the complete  inertia of the Arab League and its subservience to the wishes of  traitors among the Arab leaders."    Babil said "only armed struggle can lead to freedom," and  called on "all those concerned about the future of Palestine to  declare that the Palestinian autonomy accord died in Hebron."    Arab-Israeli peace talks were suspended after the massacre.    The PLO has demanded that the United Nations guarantee  protection for Palestinians in the occupied territories and that  Israeli settlers be disarmed.    The newspaper also called on the ruling Baath party to hold  a  congress of Arab forces to "form an anti-colonialist and  anti-Zionist front."    Meanwhile, the official Iraqi news agency INA Saturday  expressed the hope that contacts between Iraqi and French  officials would help toward the lifting of an international  embargo imposed on Baghdad after its troops invaded Kuwait in  August 1990.    "The Franco-Iraqi meetings in Paris, at the invitation of  France, indicate that French diplomats will take steps aimed at  lifting the embargo," INA said.    A senior Iraqi foreign ministry official, Riyad al-Qaysi,  held talks with his French counterparts in Paris Friday.    The meetings were a sign of "France's willingness to resume  relations with Iraq," INA said.    Al-Qaysi's visit came less than a week after one by a senior  official of Baghdad's oil ministry, as a guest of the French oil  companies Total and Elf-Aquitaine.    The companies are negotiating concessions to exploit  petroleum deposits in southern Iraq once the UN embargo has been  lifted.    Iraqi newspapers said al-Qaysi's talks in Paris were part of  a diplomatic drive to get the embargo lifted, and he would also  visit China. He went to Russia on February 22.    Under the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions the oil embargo  may be lifted once Iraq has fulfilled UN demands for the  dismantling of its weapons programmes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov by </F> unnamed STANDART NEWS correspondent; place and date not given:  "Stable Macedonia Can Be a Guarantor Against War Spreading in  the Balkans"]    [Text] [STANDART NEWS] Mr. President, various sources,  both newspapermen and political figures, claim that cases of  violating the sanctions against Yugoslavia have occurred at the  border with Bulgaria. Is it true?    [Gligorov] Bulgaria is a neighbor country with which we have  an open border and free traffic. Both we and the Bulgarians are  observing the sanctions, which does not mean that cases of  busting the Yugo-embargo do not occasionally occur.  Nevertheless, Macedonia, being an UN member, respects the  sanctions.    [STANDART NEWS] After the recognition of the Republic of  Macedonia, what will be the next steps on the international  scene?    [Gligorov] Recognition is of great importance to us. After  Macedonia was admitted to the UN, our country officially  established its identity as an independent state recognized by  the international organizations and participating legitimately  in international life. We shall pursue our efforts to establish  diplomatic relations with all countries.    We welcome the initiative of integrating the countries of  Central and Eastern Europe with the "Partnership for Peace"  initiative. We sent a letter to the Brussels summit in which we  declared our intention of participating in the relevant meeting.    [STANDART NEWS] Do you have a clear concept on solving the  problem with Greece?    [Gligorov] As far as we are concerned, the problem could be  easily resolved as long as we discuss it, as long as we take the  peace and stability of the Balkans into consideration, and as  long as we behave like sensible people who can settle all their  controversial problems as good neighbors should.    Actually, we have no great controversies and territorial  claims [regarding Greece]. The borders are determined and  recognized by both sides. The other problems are rather based  on emotional and historical motivations and should not even be  on the agenda.    It is our wish to pursue our diplomatic negotiations with  Greece.    [STANDART NEWS] Macedonia is not a member of the Council of  Europe as yet. What is being done to speed up its admission?    [Gligorov] We have the status of a country specially invited  by the European Council of Ministers, which, only a few days  ago, decided to start the procedure of admitting Macedonia as a  full member to the organization.    Macedonia is a member of the Central European Initiative,  which includes Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia,  and Austria.    [STANDART NEWS] Do you think that there is any danger  involved in connection with Serbia's claims toward Macedonia?    [Gligorov] Serbia should prove whether it has any claims  regarding Macedonia or not by recognizing our country. As long  as this has not occurred, we should be cautious and take into  account the fact that political forces insisting on Macedonia  not being an independent state still exist in Serbia. Macedonia  is in favor of cooperation with all former Yugoslav republics  and with all Balkan countries, but it is not inclined to join  any closer alliance with Serbia, under the form of a  confederation or under any other form of integration. The war  has been going on too long in that part, too much blood has been  shed, and one can hardly expect any form of political  integration with that state, after Macedonia waged such a long  and hard struggle for its own independence.    We would like to build our country as an independent,  sovereign, democratic, and rule-of-law state.    [STANDART NEWS] What about Albania?    [Gligorov] Basically, I do not see any danger stemming from  that country. However, assuming that the armed conflict is  likely to continue for some time, possible unrest in Kosovo  cannot be excluded, since the problems of that area are still  unresolved. Hence, we should be aware of what might happen in  the future.    [STANDART NEWS] Is it possible that Serbia might stimulate a  threat from the Albanian side in the purpose of forcing Skopje  to apply for Serbia's "protection."    [Gligorov] I see no reason for Macedonia to seek an alliance  with Serbia against Albania.    Albanians who live in our country are Macedonians by Law. We  saw what the ideas of greater Serbia, greater Albania, and  greater Croatia have produced. We should live like peaceful  neighbors. Albanians live in Macedonia, but Macedonians exist in  Albania as well. Let them all exist as they did before, while  the borders should be open and people be able to move freely  from one country to the other.    [STANDART NEWS] How do you accept the presence of U.S.  soldiers in Macedonia?    [Gligorov] Our relations with the United States are  friendly. They are interested in peaceful relations with the  Balkans. I assess the fact that they chose to station their  military units in Macedonia as a preventive peace action. A  peaceful and stable Macedonia is an obstacle to the expansion of  the military conflict.</p>

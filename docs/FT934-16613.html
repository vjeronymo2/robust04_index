			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow uncertain over Russian developments Wall Street US share prices were mixed in light trading yesterday as investors attempted to digest the implications for financial markets of the political crisis in Russia, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.35 at 3,577.76. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.06 higher at 461.34, while the Amex composite finished 0.03 at 461.56, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.60 at 764.83. Trading volume on the NYSE was 227m shares. Traders and investors arrived at work yesterday morning in a nervous mood, unsure of how the world's financial markets would react to the political turmoil in Russia, where President Boris Yeltsin's battle with anti-reform hardliners appeared to be reaching a violent and dramatic conclusion. Traditionally, this kind of political crisis unsettles equity market investors, but boost US bond prices, which are seen as a safe haven in times of trouble. As expected, bonds firmed at the opening yesterday morning, but demand was not that strong, and by late afternoon Treasury prices were flat-to-lower. Equity investors, meanwhile, were reassured by the confidence of overseas markets, which were mostly firmer overnight. The modest reaction from the US bond market also appeared to underline the view of most financial analysts - that the turmoil in Russia would not have any serious economic or political impact outside that country's borders. Once it was clear by mid-morning in the US that army forces loyal to Mr Yeltsin had regained control of the Parliament building in Moscow, and that the rebels had surrendered, investors were able to devote some attention to domestic matters. As it was, the day's main economic news - a 1.1 per cent decline in August construction orders - was bearish for stocks, and contributed to some of the day's declines. Among individual issues, HCA-Hospital jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 29 in a volume of 5.8m shares after the company agreed to be taken over by Columbia Healthcare in a stock swap which values the deal at Dollars 5.7bn. Columbia fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 in volume of 3m shares on the news. In other merger-related movements, KeyCorp fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 37 1/2 and Society Corp ended steady at Dollars 32 1/2 after the two regional banking groups agreed to join forces in a Dollars 3.9bn stock swap. The technology sector was in strong demand. Compaq rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 , Motorola firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 101, Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 69 1/8 , IBM added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 44 1/4 , and Digital Equipment rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 . Canada TORONTO prices closed broadly mixed in relatively light trading, as a surge by gold issues helped lift the 300 composite index to 4,002.3 at the close, according to preliminary data. The TSE-300 composite index rose 13.81 points, or 0.35 per cent. Volume was 38.43m shares, compared with 41.36m last Friday. Industrial products rose 1 per cent.</p>

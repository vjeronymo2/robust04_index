			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat held a  meeting with some members of the group entrusted with  administering the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho in Tunis this  evening.    Palestinian sources said that more than ten members of the  group participated in the unofficial meeting, and that the other  18 members concerned would arrive tomorrow in Tunis to take part  in the first official meeting of the group during which they  were expected to be sworn in and prepare the group's working  program for the forthcoming period.    Palestinian sources had previously announced that tomorrow's  meeting would also be distinguished by announcing the names of  the remaining members of the self-rule administration group; the  Cairo agreement on implementing self-rule stipulated that it  would comprise 24 members.</p>

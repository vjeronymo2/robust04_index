			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Japanese parent injects Pounds 65m of new funds into Guinness Mahon GUINNESS MAHON, the merchant bank which is wholly owned by the Bank of Yokohama, has received a new injection of Pounds 65m from its Japanese parent as part of a restructuring of its operations. Much of the money will support a new subsidiary called Guinness Mahon Loan Recoveries, which will hold provisions against loan losses and a contingency fund to cover future losses totalling nearly Pounds 50m. Mr David Potter, chief executive of Guinness Mahon, yesterday denied that a crisis had caused the new funding, which brings total injections by Bank of Yokohama to nearly Pounds 200m since it first bought a stake in the company in 1989. He said that the money - which was approved at a quarterly board meeting last Tuesday - was part of a financing package agreed 15 months ago and had been conditional on the management meeting a series of targets to restructure its operations. 'There is no crisis,' he said. 'This was part of a long and carefully planned process and was nothing sudden.' He stressed that Guinness Mahon's credit rating had been recently upgraded, and that new, high quality executives had joined the company recently. But he admitted that the provisions against bad loans - all of which were the responsibility of Guinness Mahon &amp; Company, the merchant banking subsidiary - had been increased in the past few months. Guinness Mahon suffered from a series of poor loans in leasing, property and general commercial areas made during the 1980s. Last year it lost its listing on the Stock Exchange when Yokohama pushed up its shareholding to 100 per cent. Its last publicly announced pre-tax losses were Pounds 35.5m in the six months to March 31 1991, including bad debt provisions of Pounds 30m. Mr Potter said that in the following nine months losses were about Pounds 20m. Part of the new funding has been earmarked for future development, particularly in the asset management and stockbroking businesses. A senior executive also said that Guinness Mahon's contract with Mr Geoffrey Bell, its chairman for the past four years, is unlikely to be renewed when it expires early next year.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DURAN SAYS HE THINKS HE WON;  </P> <P> FIGHT: HIS EXCUSE THIS TIME IS THAT REFEREE REFUSED TO LET HIM GET IN CLOSE AND  THAT 'EVERYBODY' WAS AGAINST HIM.  </P> <P> It was nine years between humiliating defeats to Sugar Ray Leonard for Roberto  Duran, nine years between excuses.  </P> <P> In 1980, Roberto claimed stomach cramps made him say "No Mas'' in the eighth  round.  </P> <P> Thursday night, he said he lost a 12-round decision because a country and a  referee conspired against him.  </P> <P> "I was fighting against the United States, the referee, everybody," Duran said  through an interperter in the press room at the Mirage hotel.  </P> <P> "Leonard came here to clown around. He didn't beat me. But the referee (Richard  Steele) didn't let me fight. He pulled me away from Leonard every time we got  in close.  </P> <P> "Still, I was able to hit Leonard as the rounds went on. Yes, I think I won the  fight."  </P> <P> Among those disagreeing with the erstwhile Hands of Stone were the three judges  who awarded the quicker, smarter and seemingly even hungrier Leonard the  decision by margins of 10, 10 and five points.  </P> <P> The winner found no fault with that math.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased with my performance," Leonard said. "My legs are still good.  They saved me. They got me in and out. Speed was the key."  </P> <P> That old-time speed that had deserted him his last fight in the desert against  Thomas Hearns couldn't keep him away from one damaging punch in the 11th round,  though.  </P> <P> Sugar Ray wore dark glasses at the news conference to cover the cut over a left  eye that once was operated on for a detached retina.  </P> <P> "I tried to accommodate the public in the 11th round," he said. "They wanted to  see a brawl. I was cut by a right hand."  </P> <P> And that was one of Duran's few acts of aggression nine years after the  embarrassment that was New Orleans.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it," said television commentator Gil Clancy. "I've never  seen a guy who looked less motivated than Duran tonight."  </P> <P> Promoter Bob Arum, who analyzed the fight a lot better after it than before it,  thought this was simply a matter of styles.  </P> <P> "These guys have the personalities to mesh, but not the styles," Arum said.  </P> <P> "It's been all Leonard since the 13th round of the first fight. We shouldn't  have expected anything different this time. Leonard is just too quick for  Duran."  </P> <P> Among those listening to the promoter was Wilfred Benitez, a former champion.  </P> <P> "Use me," Benitez pleaded. "I'm only 31."  </P></p>

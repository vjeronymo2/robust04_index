			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Strong rebound in trading profits lifts JP Morgan JP MORGAN yesterday reported strong first-quarter earnings as a rebound in trading profits and healthy underwriting revenues helped the New York banking group recover from a disappointing final three months of 1992. The bank earned Dollars 432m in the January-to-March period, although that was reduced to net income of Dollars 295m after a previously-announced after-tax charge of Dollars 137m related to the adoption of new standards for the accounting of post-retirement benefits. First-quarter profits were well up on a year ago, when the bank reported earnings of Dollars 264m (although that was later restated as net income of Dollars 716m to reflect changes in the bank's accounting of income taxes), and on the final quarter of last year, when poor trading results depressed earnings to Dollars 298m. The biggest contribution to the improvement came from the bank's trading business, where revenues totalled Dollars 469m, ahead of the same quarter a year ago and the last quarter of 1992. Both of those quarters were affected by losses on the trading of mortgage-backed securities. In this term, however, the results were boosted by successes in the trading of swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, and global (especially European) debt securities. In a rare move for a US bank, JP Morgan chose not to make any loan-loss provisions in the quarter. The ratio of reserves to non-performing loans stands at about four-to-one (Dollars 1,202m to Dollars 299m), the highest of any leading US bank. The corporate finance division also put in a good performance, with revenues rising 23 per cent to Dollars 119m following strong demand for the bank's debt and equity underwriting services, both in the US and overseas. JP Morgan is one of only a handful of US banks allowed to underwrite securities in the domestic markets. First-quarter profits were also buoyed by gains of Dollars 74m from the sale of Brazilian interest bonds, which boosted net interest revenues to Dollars 432m, and Dollars 95m from the sale of foreign government and US Treasury investment securities. Among other revenue sources, credit-related fees rose to Dollars 54m, investment management earnings climbed to Dollars 113m and operational service fees for custody, clearing and brokerage activities increased to Dollars 116m. Operating expenses rose sharply to Dollars 809m, primarily because of higher performance-related employee compensation payments.</p>

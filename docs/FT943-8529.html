			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Strong expansion in Mexico: Public spending rises in run-up to presidential election Mexico's finance ministry has announced, in the run-up to the presidential election on Sunday, that the economy grew by a stronger than expected 3.8 per cent in the second quarter, compared to the equivalent period last year. This was the fastest quarterly growth by Mexico for two years. The figures are likely to be taken by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, favoured to win the election, as firm evidence the economic difficulties of the past year are over. Mexico's economy grew by just 0.4 per cent last year, and contracted in the second part of the year. The expansion in the second quarter this year brings growth for the first half to 2.2 per cent, compared to the equivalent period last year. The industrial sector grew by 2.3 per cent in the first six months, with manufacturing up by 1.2 per cent, the first increase in more than a year. Agriculture grew by a robust 5.1 per cent, and services by 2 per cent. A government official said he now expected growth of 2.5 to 3 per cent this year. The consensus private-sector forecast for economic growth was between 1 and 2 per cent before the latest figures. The government separately announced a large increase in public spending in the first half, which contributed to the pick-up in the economy. Public spending reached 148.6bn pesos (Dollars 43.8bn) in the first half, an increase of 11.4 per cent on the equivalent period in 1993. Social spending rose by 8.8 per cent, while public investment climbed by 27.6 per cent, partly thanks to new federal government public works projects. The public sector is expected by the finance ministry to show a balanced budget this year, as was originally forecast. However, the increased spending cut the public sector's budgetary surplus in the first half to 5.42bn pesos, less than half the surplus of a year ago. Economic growth was further lifted by expansion of manufacturing exports and investment. Gross investment increased by 5.9 per cent in the four months to April, while manufacturing exports grew by 25 per cent to May. Despite the growth in manufacturing exports, at the end of May the trade deficit reached Dollars 7.242bn - 26 per cent more than the equivalent period last year. Unlike last year, the rate of growth of imports (19.3 per cent) exceeded overall growth in exports (17.3 per cent). The faster economic growth appears to have played a part in the deterioration in the trade position.</p>

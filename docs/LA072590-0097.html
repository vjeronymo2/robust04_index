			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALMANAC: AEROSPACE EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK;  </P> <P> FUNDING CUTS HIT DEFENSE INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Signs of the decline in federal dollars for defense are showing up in  employment levels in Orange County's high-tech industries.  </P> <P> After 10 years of continuous real growth, peaking in 1985, increases in defense  spending have hovered around zero since 1988.  </P> <P> Since then, employment levels in key defense-related industries have fallen as  much as 14%.  </P> <P> A recent study by the Chapman Center for Economic Research predicts further  cuts in defense spending: 3% to 4% in 1990, 5% to 10% in 1991, and 5.5% to  11.5% in 1992. The study's authors estimate that the country could lose as many  as 6,000 aerospace industry jobs by 1992.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING: PAST AND FUTURE  </P> <P> After years of lagging behind a mounting inflation rate in the 1970s, defense  spending entered an era of real growth that lasted for more than a decade. The  future looks bleak, however, according to forecasts issued by the Chapman  College Center for Economic Research. The chart below shows two scenarios: One  anticipates moderate cuts in defense spending and the other, sharp cuts.  </P> <P> Source:Chapman College Center for Economic Research  </P> <P> </P> <P> AEROSPACE EMPLOYMENT  </P> <P> The number of jobs in Orange County's aerospace industry declined in only three  of the 17 years from 1972 to 1988 -- all during recessions.  </P> <P> '72: 53,400  </P> <P> '88: 96,900  </P> <P> Source: California Employment Development Department  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 EMPLOYMENT CUTBACKS  </P> <P> In 1989, employment levels declined for a total net loss of 3,800 jobs.  </P> <P> In percentage change between 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P>  Computers &amp; Office Equipment: -2.7%  </P> <P>  Com.

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> AS 'CONCEPT' STOCKS GO, URCARCO VEERING WRONG WAY  </P> <P> If someone you don't know tries to sell you a used car for $6,000, you don't  just smile, say "thank you" and hand over 6,000 bucks. You're skeptical. You  want to kick the tires, you want to bargain, you might want to have your own  mechanic check the car out.  </P> <P> But when it comes to shelling out $600 million to buy a used-car company,  investors seem to be suspending all skepticism. Welcome to the wonderful world  of Urcarco Inc., the latest example of how Wall Street can go bonkers when it  sells itself on a "concept stock."  </P> <P> Urcarco, for those of you who aren't trendy, is one of the market's hottest  stocks. Its stock, which recently sold for about $20, has almost tripled since  November, when the company sold shares for $7.34 (adjusted for a stock split)  in its initial public offering. Counting the 5.75 million shares that Urcarco  sold last week to raise new cash, the company now has 31.4 million outstanding.  </P> <P> So a $20 stock price means the market is valuing Urcarco at more than $600  million -- 31.4 million times $20. Not exactly chump change.  </P> <P> What makes Urcarco worth all this money? Certainly not anything visible on the  financial statements. The company, based in Ft. Worth, operates 17 used-car  lots in Ft. Worth, Houston and Austin, Tex., and owned $84 million of its  customers' promissory notes as of March 30.  </P> <P> Except for Urcarco's delightful stock symbol -- CARS -- there are no hidden  assets in this company. No car lots sitting on valuable downtown real estate or  atop oil fields or diamond mines. No secret stash of antique used cars.  </P> <P> What you are really paying for here is a concept. To wit, the concept that  Urcarco is bringing professional management to the used-car business. Or, as  the company's supporters say, "to the $40-billion used-car business." The idea  is that Urcarco will be to used cars what Toys R Us is to toys: a company that  will become the dominant factor in a fragmented business.  </P> <P> Good luck.  </P> <P> All it takes is a cursory look at Urcarco's cash flow numbers to see that the  company has a major problem: The more cars it sells, the more cash it loses.  This, even though the more cars it sells, the more money it reports as profit.  </P> <P> Reported profits have risen from $248,000 in the year ended June 30, 1988, to  $2.9 million in 1989 to $10.1 million in the nine months ended March 30. At the  same time, by my calculations, the company's basic business ran a cash deficit  of $4.2 million in 1988, $19 million in 1989 and $48.7 million in the nine  months ended March 30.  </P> <P> Urcarco closes its cash gap by borrowing money or selling new shares. In fact,  the company is up front about saying that it constantly needs infusions of  cash. In documents it issued in May as part of last week's stock sale, Urcarco  says its cash shortfall runs from $6 million to $8 million a month. But after I  asked some detailed questions about why debt had risen by $10.2 million in  April, the company conceded that $6 million to $10 million a month is the range  now.  </P> <P> In other words, last week's stock sale, which produced something over $100  million after investment banker fees and other expenses, will probably carry  the company for less than a year. Without that sale, Urcarco would have been  bumping up against its $45-million bank borrowing limit before summer was over.  </P> <P> The disparity between the glowing reported earnings and the insatiable need for  cash has attracted short-sellers, one of Wall Street's feared predator species.  These creatures, who make money if a stock's price falls, borrow shares of the  target company and sell them, hoping to ultimately replace the borrowed shares  with stock purchased at a cheaper price.  </P> <P> As you might suspect, I looked into Urcarco at the suggestion of short-sellers.  However, this article is based on my own research and analysis, plus  information provided by the company, which answered my questions but didn't  want to talk while its latest stock offering was pending.  </P> <P> To be blunt about it, there is less to Urcarco than meets the eye. This company  isn't about selling used cars; it's about trying to collect money from people  who are going to have trouble paying it.  </P> <P> It's obvious that Urcarco, which runs what it calls "we finance" lots, is  charging customers more than they would pay elsewhere for the same car; but  elsewhere, the customers wouldn't be able to buy the car because they lack the  necessary down payment and credit standing.  </P> <P> Urcarco accepts down payments of 5% to 15%, much less than most other used-car  dealers. Urcarco lends the customer the balance of the purchase price, will  finance the insurance and sometimes even give the customer a 30-day loan for  the sales tax. In return for this generosity, Urcarco charges not only high  prices, but also the maximum interest rate allowed by the state of Texas: 18%  to 24% a year.  </P> <P> Forget any question of the morality of selling expensive merchandise to  marginal buyers -- at least for now. The problem with Urcarco, from an  investor's point of view, is that you can't figure out if the company is ahead  or behind.  </P> <P> Most used-car dealers make sure the down payment covers most or all of their  costs, so whatever the dealer collects on buyers' promissory notes is profit.  Urcarco pays cash for the cars it buys at wholesale and for its other expenses,  but it collects almost no cash when it sells cars. Urcarco's real profit, if  any, comes not when it moves the car off the lot, but when it collects on the  customer's note. If it collects.  </P> <P> The company argues that it's being financially conservative by assuming that  the paper it gets from customers is worth only 82 cents on the dollar. The  company implies that this works out to a repossession rate of about 38% of the  cars it sells. Is that enough? Who knows?  </P> <P> The company says it doesn't know how the value of the cars on which it holds  customers' notes compares to the value of the paper.  </P> <P> Urcarco may, in fact, some day become the Toys R Us of used cardom. But until  (and unless) that happy day dawns, the cash deficit makes the company  vulnerable. If a stock offering can't be completed, if a lender gets nervous or  if anything else untoward happens, Urcarco can be in big trouble in almost no  time at all. If you want to buy this stock -- or any "concept" stock -- for  more than a short-term trade, you had better go out and kick some tires instead  of just buying a fancy story.  </P></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Railway privatisation RAILWAY privatisation will lead to the publication of dozens of different Passenger's Charters as each train operator draws up its own version of the existing British Rail charter, it emerged yesterday. The government said that franchisees operating state-subsidised services would continue to compensate passengers for punctuality and reliability in much the same way as BR does now. Operators of unsubsidised services will be under no such obligation.</p>

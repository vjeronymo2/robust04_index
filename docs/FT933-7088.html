			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Observer: Bullish influence No wonder former countries of the Soviet Union are keen to hear from Pope John Paul II. The mere mention of a papal visit seems to work miracles for the exchange rate of the country in question, judging by Lithuania's experience. Ever since word leaked out that the Pope was planning to visit the Baltic state in September, Lithuanian's currency, the litas, has soared. Last month, the rate was five to the dollar; now the going rate is 2.8 litas to the dollar. Demand for the currency is based on expectations that foreign visitors flocking to Lithuania to see His Holiness will lead to a glut of hard currency. If this scenario proves correct, then the Vatican can expect an early call from the Ukraine. According to Morgan Stanley, Ukraine's karbovanetz has fallen by 90 per cent against the dollar since December.</p>

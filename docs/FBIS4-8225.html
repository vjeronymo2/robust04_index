			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement by Kiro Gligorov, president of The </F> Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; no date given:  "Cooperation With Greece -- Our Constant Course"]    [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  has issued a statement on the EU Commission's decision to take  the Greek embargo against the Republic of Macedonia to the  European Court of Justice.    There follows the text of the statement:    ``The EU Commission has decided to take the Greek embargo  against the Republic of Macedonia to the European Court of  Justice.    ``On this occasion, I would once again like to reassert the  constant course and interest of the Republic of Macedonia to  achieve an overall development of relations and cooperation with  the neighboring Republic of Greece. We therefore firmly believe  that the lifting of the embargo against our country by the  Republic of Greece would represent a substantial step toward the  renewal of negotiations between our two countries, and an  important contribution to the stability of the region in which  we live.    ``The lifting of the embargo would normalize the situation  on  the Macedonian-Greek border regarding the free flow of people  and goods, which is of mutual benefit for both countries, for  their economies and citizens.    ``As a measure, the lifting of the embargo would have a  significant impact on the intensification of mutual confidence  and good will for the continuation of the Macedonian-Greek  negotiations within the framework of the United Nations.    ``We reiterate our commitment to continue the dialogue, on  an  equal basis, about mutual relations in disagreement, including  the ones pointed out by the EU Commission of 6 April this year.  We are convinced that only negotiations in good will and with  mutual respect can lead to appropriate and mutually acceptable  solutions for all questions.    ``Therefore, we firmly believe that the lifting of the  embargo is essential for the benefit of both countries and for  stability in the region. Ultimately, bearing in mind the  serious nature of these issues and our responsibility for our  respective countries, we are called upon to do our best in a  principled way and on an equal basis, to achieve normalization  in our mutual relations, to intensify peace and stability in the  Balkans.''</p>

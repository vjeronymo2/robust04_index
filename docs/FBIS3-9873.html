			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Lech Walesa has until midnight to sign  the law on wages in enterprises, which replaces the so-called  excess wage increase tax [popiwek] law that is in force until  the end of March. According to information from the  Presidential Chancellery, Walesa will make a decision on this  matter this afternoon.    Asked about the situation if the president refuses to sign  the law, director Zbigniew Boniuszko, of the Finance Ministry,  said it would be more dangerous for the economy than not signing  the budget law. [passage omitted]    In an interview for PAP granted this morning, President  Walesa was asked if he would sign the budget. He answered:    [Begin Walesa recording] Apart from everything else, I  regard  myself as a responsible politician, and I do everything to make  sure that the prosperity of the country is a priority. Assuming  I do not sign the budget, I would not sign it knowing that the  coalition would pull it through. Someone could say, you are  irresponsible, what are all these games for, you are not serious  enough for the president.    I want to draw attention and initiate a discussion. From now  on, I want society to be taken seriously, to think differently,  even about the budget. The budget is only for one year. To  start with, it is clear it will be amended. There is no doubt  about it; everyone is saying so. What is more important--this  budget, the purpose of which is to start certain economic  processes in Poland, or the nation? [end recording]</p>

The head of the regime's interests section in Cairo has  admitted that the regime has stopped granting entry visas to  Egyptians because of the lack of job opportunities and the  deteriorating economic conditions in Iraq.    In another development, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry has  instructed its mission in Baghdad to prepare an urgent report on  the number of Egyptians being held prisoner in Iraq. A  spokesman for the ministry has said that the number of Egyptian  prisoners is not less than 500, sentenced to serve between two  years and life imprisonment at hard labor.</p>

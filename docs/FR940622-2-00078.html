Continued plant operation would be permitted until the first time the plant is required to be brought to COLD SHUTDOWN after July 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.1 requires that systems capable of monitoring unidentified reactor coolant system leakage rates remain operable. Rector coolant system leakage that falls on the drywell floors is channeled through the floor drains and enters the drywell floor drain sump. Prior to entering the floor drain sump, water passes through the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring instrumentation where the instantaneous flow rates and total integrated flow are measured. The flow monitoring instrumentation consists of a V-notch weir box containing a capacitance probe. Water flows through a V-notch water level which is directly proportional to the flow through the weir box. Thus, flow through the V-notch is equal to the sump inlet flow rate. The capacitance probe is calibrated to correspond to the incoming flow rate and provides a continuous control room indication of the unidentified reactor coolant system leakage rate. An alarm is generated when the technical specification limit of 5 gpm of unidentified leakage occurs. The V-notch weir box instrumentation meets the accuracy and sensitivity requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.45 for drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee began to observe questionable readings from the indicated drywell floor drain sump inlet flow and subsequently declared the drywell floor drain sump monitoring instrumentation inoperable on June 10, 1994. Technical Specification 3.4.3.1 permits 30 days of continuous plant operation provided the drywell floor drain sump flow rate is monitored and determined by alternative means at least once every 8 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All efforts by the licensee to restore the drywell sump inlet flow monitoring instrumentation to operable status have been unsuccessful. The instrument loop has been recalibrated and equipment external to the drywell has been verified to be operating properly. The only option remaining for the licensee is to enter the drywell in order to examine the V-notch weir box and associated capacitance probe. However, the V-notch weir box is located in a keyway beneath the reactor vessel and inside the biological shield wall. Due to the high radiation and temperatures in this location, a plant shutdown would be required before personnel would be able to reach the instrumentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated June 20, 1994, the licensee requested that this amendment application be treated as an emergency because unless approved, technical specifications would require a plant shutdown. The licensee stated that such action would be necessary to preclude an unnecessary plant transient and related plant risk associated with a plant shutdown. Due to time constraints, sufficient time is not available to permit the customary public notices in advance of this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

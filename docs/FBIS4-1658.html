			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Earnestly Study Volume 3 of the Selected </F> Works of Deng Xiaoping column by Su Xing (5685 2502):  "Upholding Public Ownership As the Mainstay Is the Basic  Principle of Socialism"]    [Text] I.    In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Socialism  has two very important aspects. First, it takes public  ownership as the mainstay. Second, it does not pursue  polarization." He said: "Our reform adheres to public  ownership as the mainstay while seeing to it that it does not  lead to polarization. This is to adhere to socialism." At the  same time, he also said: "In reform, we adhere to two  fundamental principles from beginning to end: One is that we  take the socialist public-owned economy as the mainstay. The  other is that we pursue common prosperity. The utilization of  foreign capital in a planned way and the development of some  individual economies are subjected to the general demand of the  developing socialist economy. The fact that we encourage a  number of places and a number of people to get rich first is  also intended to enable more and more people to get rich and  attain the goal of common prosperity." These remarks tell us  very clearly that upholding socialism is to uphold the  public-owned economy as the mainstay, pursue no polarization,  and attain common prosperity.    Although Deng Xiaoping did not say that public  ownership was the mainstay in his important remarks about the  essence of socialism, which he made during his tour of southern  China, in fact, they contain this fundamental principle.  First, speaking on the essence of socialism, he said: "The  essence of socialism is to liberate productive forces, develop  productive forces, eliminate exploitation, eliminate  polarization, and ultimately attain common prosperity." Here he  really did not say that public ownership was the mainstay. But  it is impossible to eliminate exploitation and eliminate  polarization unless public ownership as the mainstay is taken as  a precondition. Public ownership should be what was meant in  the remarks. Second, speaking on the special economic zones, he  said: "The special economic zones are socialist, not  capitalist." Judging from the situation of Shenzhen, public  ownership is the mainstay and foreign investment only accounts  for one quarter. Moreover, we can profit from foreign investment  in such areas as tax income and labor service!" The important  proof he based his statement that the special economic zones are  socialist, not capitalist, is that public ownership is the  mainstay.    Public ownership as the mainstay is the economic  foundation of socialism. There is no denying that public  ownership also exists in other societies, but we must make a  concrete analysis of public ownership as we do private ownership  because there are different natures of private ownership, as  well as different natures of public ownership. Karl Marx  once criticized bourgeois economics for equating two totally  different types of private ownership, saying: The first type is  based on the producer's own labor, and the other is based on the  exploitation of others' labor. The latter has grown out of the  grave of the former. Public ownership can also be based on the  laborer's own labor and on the exploitation of others' labor.  The public ownership of capitalist countries can be public  ownership as well, but it has not changed the capitalist nature  and still belongs to the entire bourgeoisie class. The  public ownership of socialist countries is based on the labor of  the laborers themselves. Ownership by the whole people is that  which belongs to the laboring people as a whole (since the state  is the representative of the whole people, this type of  ownership can be called state ownership), and collective  ownership is that which belongs to some of the laboring masses.  These two types of public ownership have eliminated the  exploitation system. Therefore, by saying that pubic ownership  is the mainstay, we not only refer to ownership by the whole  people, but also collective ownership.    Taking public ownership as the mainstay is different  from the unitary public ownership pursued in the past.  Practice proves that, at least at the initial stage of  socialism, pursuing the unitary system of public ownership will  hinder the development of productive forces. Our present  principle is that we take public ownership as the mainstay,  while simultaneously developing a diversity of economic sectors.  At the same time, we are also opposed to privatization.  In the experience since China's reform, small state-owned  enterprises can be sold to private owners and shareholding  state-owned enterprises can have their shares sold to  individuals, but the privatization of all or most state-owned  assets is out of the question. Today, there is a wave of  privatization across the world. In this wave, there are two  different natures of privatization. In capitalist countries,  both private ownership and state ownership are capitalist  private ownership forms, so privatization will not shake  capitalism to its foundation, but rather, it may possibly  consolidate this foundation. This is not true of socialist  countries, where privatization is in fact the exploitation of  all the property owned by the laboring people, and will surely  shake and disintegrate the socialist economic foundation.  Therefore, in upholding socialism, we must uphold public  ownership as the mainstay.  <H5>  II. </H5>   Public ownership comprises ownership by the whole people and  collective ownership.    Large and medium-sized state enterprises, which are owned  by the whole people, are the pillar of the national economy and  take a leading role in economic development.    At present, large and medium-sized state enterprises are  encountering many difficulties in production and management,  such as decreasing profit margins, the slow turnover of  circulating funds, escalating costs, the persistently large  losses....There is no consensus about how these difficulties are  caused. Some say they are caused by the economic structure.  Others say they are caused by the system of ownership. I am  more inclined to agree with the former argument.    No one denies that at one time, large and medium-sized state  enterprises played a great role in the process of China's  socialist construction and had glorious years. But since reform  and opening up, faced with a new situation in which a diversity  of economic sectors coexist and market competition arises, they  have appeared to be rigid and to be lacking in vitality. What  is the problem? In my opinion, the management mechanism that  originally suited the planned economic structure no longer suits  the market economic environment. For a while, many enterprises  find it very difficult to produce in keeping with market needs,  as they are used to producing in keeping with plans. In the  process of the changeover from the old structure to a new one,  state-owned enterprises lag behind in changing their management  mechanisms and encounter many new difficulties. For example,  given the coexistence of planned prices and market prices, some  products are produced by state-owned enterprises in keeping with  mandatory plans and are sold at planned prices, while energy  resources and raw and processed materials are fixed at market  prices. Some raw and processed materials are sold at planned  prices and their product prices are, in fact, regulated by the  market. In this way, enterprises are bound to suffer losses  whether these materials are "bought at high prices and sold at  medium prices" or whether they are "bought at medium prices and  sold at low prices." This difficulty is not present in other  economic sectors, however.    The main weakness in the planned economic structure is that  planning has control over enterprises. This produces two  consequences: First, enterprises are rigidly controlled.  Second, a huge economic management machinery is formed. There  are 70 to 80, or even 100 organizations in charge of projects,  finance, and materials in each of our provinces. While such  organizations exist in higher-level authorities, they also exist  in lower-level ones as a must. The key to changing the  management mechanism of state-owned enterprises is to change  government functions, separate government and enterprise  functions, and ensure that enterprises have their own  decisionmaking power. But is it easy to ensure that enterprises  have their own decisionmaking power? Since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's urban reform  has begun with the expansion of the decisionmaking power of  state-owned enterprises. By having enterprises assume complete  responsibility for profits, replacing profit taking by taxes,  using contracted responsibilities systems, and experimenting  with the shareholding system, the decisionmaking power of  enterprises has expanded to varying degrees. In this way, many  enterprises in the coastal areas have been revitalized and a  number of revitalized large and medium- sized enterprises have  also appeared in the hinterland. Approximately one third of  China's enterprises have comparatively good performance. But  the management mechanism of most state-owned enterprises has not  really been changed. There are many reasons it has not been  changed. The main reason is that the change of government  functions has proceeded slowly, government and enterprise  functions are not separated, and interference in enterprises is  too great. In the circumstances, it is very difficult to ensure  that enterprises have their own decisionmaking power. A  comprehensive analysis of 16 key enterprises in 11 provinces and  municipalities made by relevant quarters in the first six months  of 1993 shows that, of the 14 powers provided for in the  "Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," only five are basically  ensured, namely, making decisions about management, purchasing  materials and supplies, selling products, distributing wages and  bonuses, and amalgamations and mergers. Six others are  partially ensured, and the remaining three are not ensured at  all. Therefore, in order to revitalize large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, it is first necessary to change  government functions so that enterprises can operate  independently. The 14th CPC National Congress report points  out: "This is a big question regarding the superstructure  suiting the economic foundation and promoting economic  development. If no substantive progress is made in this  respect, it is difficult for reform to deepen and it is  difficult to establish the socialist market economic structure."    For a long time, the profits and taxes turned over by  state-owned enterprises have been the main source of the state's  revenue (in 1991, the taxes and profits turned over by  state-owned enterprises within the budget accounted for 65  percent of the domestic revenue in the same period). Under the  planned economic structure, there was no big problem with the  unitary system of public ownership and with unified state  control over the revenues and expenditures of enterprises.  Since reform, the problem has become salient now that  enterprises have to operate independently, assume sole  responsibility for profits and losses, accumulate their own  profits, and expand on their own. Accumulation and expansion on  their own is intended to make enterprises the mainstay of  investment so they are able to carry out reproduction on an  extended scale. But before tax reform, the tax rate for  state-owned enterprises was higher than that for other economic  sectors. For a period of time, they even had to turn over the  "two types of funds [liang jin 0357 6855]" with the result that  profits they could retain gradually decrease. In 1990, the  actual profits retained by state-owned enterprises across the  country within the budget only accounted for 8.9 percent of the  profits they made. With such little funds, reproduction on an  extended scale was totally out of the question. Moreover, with  the low depreciation rate of fixed assets and the rising prices  of procuring new ones, some enterprises found it difficult even  to maintain simple reproduction.    With their equipment seriously outdated and without the  money to acquire new technology, how can these enterprises be  competitive?    Furthermore, the old distribution structure has created a  heavy social burden on state-owned enterprises. In market  competition, non-state enterprises can easily compete while  state-owned enterprises enter the market with a burden and  cannot develop smoothly.    Of course, the backward management of state-owned  enterprises  is another important reason that causes difficulties.    In short, the reasons causing difficulties for  state-owned enterprises are very complex. Some inevitably occur  in the process of changing the economic structure. Some have  been left over from the old structure and have not been resolved  quickly. Some are caused by the failure of specific measures in  the course of reform. Others are related to the quality of  enterprises themselves and should not be simply summed up as  ownership problems. Moreover, is it not true that many  other state-owned enterprises obtain very good returns and are  competitive?    At present, the external environment for state-owned  enterprises is improving. The "Enterprise Law" and the  "Regulations" are being implemented, the income tax rate has  lowered, and the "two types of funds" have been canceled. We  should, in keeping with the direction affirmed at the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, continue to  change the management mechanism of state- owned enterprises and  gradually establish a modern enterprise system which meets the  requirements of the market economy, which clearly defines  property rights, whose rights and responsibilities are clear,  which separates the functions of the government from those of  the enterprise, and which is scientific in management. This is  the only right path.  <H5>  III. </H5>   When establishing a modern enterprise system, we must  clearly  define the property rights relationship. The CPC Central  Committee's "Decision on Issues Concerning the Establishment of  a Socialist Market Economic Structure" points out: The  ownership of state-owned assets in the enterprises belongs to  the state; the enterprises, as legal entities, possess all  rights over the asset formulated by investments from various  sources including the state, and become legal entities that  enjoy rights and shoulder responsibilities under civil law.  Simply speaking, the state is the owner of state-owned assets  and has ownership over them, and enterprises, as legal entities,  have rights over assets. This both guarantees that state-owned  assets are owned by the whole people and clearly defines the  rights of enterprises over assets as legal entities. The  realization of state ownership in the economic field is that  enterprises have to turn over profits and shareholding  enterprises have to turn over dividends and bonus dividends. As  for enterprise management, shareholding enterprises can select  and appoint directors and solely funded enterprises can choose,  hire, and appoint managers. The right to use and manage  state-owned assets belongs to enterprises. Enterprises have  independent controlling right over the assets of legal entities,  namely, they can renew, amalgamate, sell, or transfer them on  the precondition of maintaining and increasing their value.    The major form of a modern enterprise system is the  shareholding system or the corporate system. By pursuing the  shareholding system, state-owned enterprises will not have its  public ownership nature changed. As an enterprise  organizational pattern, the shareholding system can accept  different types of ownership, and by holding shares, enterprises  can maintain public ownership as the mainstay. According to a  survey of listed companies in Shenzhen, Hainan, Shanghai, and  Sichuan conducted by the State Commission for Economic  Restructuring and other units in 1993, through straightening out  the property rights relationships, these companies got out of  the burdens of their traditional subordination to the  government, achieved the separation of government and enterprise  functions, and were able to operate independently. This is  mainly reflected by the fact that they have straightened out the  interest relationships with the government and changed from  being responsible to their supervisory organs to being  responsible to all shareholders. They now turn over taxes to  the state and profits to their owners, thus achieving the  separation of profits and taxes, and enterprises have complete  right over the use of assets. The previous practice that  enterprise leaders were appointed by the government has now been  changed to appointment by the board of directors. Regarding an  enterprise's investment and project development, the board of  directors put forward investment proposals to the general  meeting of shareholders for it to make decisions, so the  enterprise has both the decisionmaking power and the money at  its disposal. Managers of the listed companies maintained that,  of the 14 powers to be delegated to enterprises as provided for  in the "Regulations," all powers have been obtained by these  enterprises except for the power to refuse exaction of fees.  The majority of these companies, of course, have not succeeded  in obtaining these powers, however. Some of these enterprises  are unclear about the objective of adopting the corporate  system, which is to change their management mechanism, and often  are enthusiastic about having their shares traded on the market,  pooling funds, setting up new businesses, and even setting up  "renamed companies," taking to the beaten track with new shoes.  Therefore, we must not agree that changing the name of a  company is the same as making it a modern enterprise.    After state-owned enterprises have practiced the  shareholding system, there can be state shares and personal  shares. That is, some are owned by individuals and others are  owned by the state, but this is not to reinstate individual  ownership. The individual ownership Karl Marx talked about in  chapter 24, volume 1 of Das Kapital refers to  the fact that consumer goods are owned by individuals on the  foundation of the public ownership of the means of production,  and does not refer to the means of production. Engels, in  Anti-Duhring, clarified this question when he  criticized Duhring for imposing a future society on Marx, which  is a nebulous world owned both by individuals and by the public.    Engels said it was not Marx, but Duhring who was in this  nebulous world. He clearly pointed out: "The state of things  brought about by the expropriation of the expropriators is  therefore characterized as the reestablishment of individual  property, but on the basis of the social ownership of the land  and of the means of production produced by labor itself. To  anyone who understands plain language, this means that social  ownership extends to land and the other means of production and  individual ownership to the products, that is, to articles of  consumption." I think this is an important principle of  Marxism. In a socialist society, or even a future communist  society, the means of production are owned by the public, but  individual consumer goods are owned by individuals. Many  utopian socialists argue that, in a socialist society or a  future society, the means of production are owned by the public,  and so are the means of consumption. This view has also  influenced some Marxists. In the process of agricultural  collectivization in the Soviet Union, it happened that not only  were the means of production publicly owned, but they also were  consumer goods. In 1958, when the "wind of communism"  prevailed, we also wanted to make consumer goods publicly owned.  All this conflicted with Marxist principles. Engels also made a  statement about Marx's use of negation as a negation. He said:  "Marx shows in a simple historical way that, just as formerly  petty industry, by its very development, necessarily created the  conditions for its own annihilation, so now the capitalist mode  of production has itself created the material conditions which  will necessarily make it perish. The process is a historical  one, and if it is at the same time a dialectical one, it is  negation of the negation." He did not view the reinstating of  individual ownership as the negation of the negation.    Marx was still alive when Engels wrote the  Anti-Duhring. Chapter 10 on the history of political  economy in its second part was written by Marx. Therefore, we  can maintain that Engels' explanation reflects Marx's viewpoints.    Finally, we should point out that public ownership is the  direction for the reform of the state-owned enterprise system.  But it is impossible to change all of China's state-owned  enterprises into shareholding companies. Only some of the  enterprises of capitalist countries use the shareholding system,  while the remainder are solely funded or in partnership. Of  state-owned enterprises, large and medium-sized enterprises are  suited for the shareholding system and should be gradually built  into corporations according to law. Medium and small  enterprises can be leased out, have its management contracted  on, and changed into the cooperative shares system, or sold to  private owners. This will not change the principle of taking  public ownership as the mainstay.</p>

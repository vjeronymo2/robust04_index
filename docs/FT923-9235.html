			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Savings grace Are building society leaders becoming the Arthur Scargills of the 1990s? Three weeks ago the explicit threat of a rise in the mortgage rate forced the government to cut the return on a key National Savings product by half a point. Last night, however, they scored an even bigger victory when fresh mutterings of the need for higher borrowing costs were answered by the news that rates on a wide range of other National Savings instruments will now be reduced. Lenders, to be sure, are in a pickle. The net outflow of funds from societies last month was probably at least as great as the net Pounds 314m which went out of their doors in June. The government has certainly been partly to blame, being a more aggressive bidder for retail funds at the moment than at any time since the early 1980s. At the same time the alternative for the societies of tapping the wholesale market has been largely closed off because most of the big ones are knocking up against limits imposed by the regulator. Given the advancing tide of repossessions, moreover, this is arguably no time to be narrowing margins. Insurance companies have picked up most of the bad debts so far under mortgage indemnity schemes - but house prices have now fallen to such an extent in the south-east that a significant proportion of losses has to be borne by the lender. This said, it is curious that the government - given its own pressing financial needs - should have rolled over so easily a second time. Desperation to avoid an increase in the mortgage rate is understandable  - but then the societies would surely have thought long and hard about a course of action which would also jeopardise the quality of their own lending. On the face of it, they are still making tidy profits and are better capitalised than they were four years ago.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bangkok Land profits disappoint Bangkok Land, Thailand's biggest property company which is controlled by the Sino-Thai Kanjanapas family, reported a disappointing 3 per cent rise in consolidated net profits to Bt5.028bn (Dollars 199m) for the year to end-March. Profits fell to Bt763m in the last quarter from Bt1.354bn in the third quarter. Sales for the year are likely to be down by some 30 per cent to around Bt11.5bn, compared with Bt16.8bn in 1993, according to Bangkok property analysts. Earnings per share rose to Bt8.38 from Bt8.11. 'Either Land was struggling in the last quarter or it was saving profits to buttress next year's profits, when new accounting rules could squeeze the profits of many property companies,' said Mr Neil Semple, research manager at HG Asia in Bangkok. The new rules will force property companies to set aside 20 per cent before they start to book profits, compared with the current 10 per cent. Tanayong, Bangkok Land's sister company, which is also controlled by the Kanjanapas family, reported a 31 per cent fall in unconsolidated net profit to Bt434.4m for the year, compared with Bt647.4m.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Tokyo admits it backed wrong horse The move to review Japan's policy on high definition TV is a stunning admission by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry that the 30-year experiment in advanced television has been a dismal failure. The development over 30 years by NHK of Hi-Vision had become something of a national project supported both by the ministry and the consumer electronics industry. In recent years the industry was desperately hoping to turn HDTV into its next blockbuster hit and stimulate flagging consumer demand for electronic goods. However, in the time that it took NHK to develop and market Hi-Vision and equipment makers to bring the price of television sets down to affordable levels, advances in digital technology have opened the way to bringing the benefits of the computer, which uses digital technology, to the TV, which currently uses analogue technology. The industry expects computers and televisions gradually to converge so that intelligent functions that have hitherto only been possible on computers, particularly the manipulation of data, are expected to be increasingly possible on the TV set as well. With the advent of multi-media interactive television, which brings together the functions of telecommunications, computers and consumer electronics, the likelihood of TVs going down the digital route is even greater, since digital technology would provide the common language to link the three industries. Rapid moves in the US towards building an information superhighway have also raised concerns, even at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, that Japan may be left behind in the move to interactive television. The ministry recently announced its intention of speeding up investment in advanced telecommunications to pave the way for interactive multi-media entertainment in Japan. A similar step in broadcasting to build the right environment for digital TV would complement its move in the telecommunications field. Meanwhile, Japan's analogue HDTV project has not fared well in the current economic climate. Private broadcasters have been reluctant to invest in the system, resulting in a lack of programming, and consumers have been discouraged from buying the Y1m (Pounds 6,300) TV sets. Although NHK boasts superior picture quality for Hi-Vision, many consumers feel the improvement in picture quality does not justify the high price. Consumers are also aware that TV technology is likely to turn digital and do not see any compelling need to take the transitional step to analogue HDTV, points out Mr Koichiro Chiwata, industry analyst at Solomon Brothers. While the development of digital TV still has some way to go, the expectation, supported by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's latest stance, that eventually TVs will become digital, will put a further damper on the sale of analogue HDTV systems. The industry, which is placed in the awkward position of having sold equipment which could be outdated relatively soon is furious with the ministry for undermining the prospects of Hi-Vision. The ministry itself, having long been a champion of Hi-Vision, is likely to be deeply divided over what policy it should adopt. As a result the likely scenario is for the ministry not to abandon Hi-Vision entirely but to continue with experimental Hi-Vision broadcasts as it promotes the development of a digital system. The next question is whether Japan opts for a digital system of its own, or adopts the system being developed in the US which, given the European Union's leanings in that direction, could pave the way for a worldwide digital TV standard.</p>

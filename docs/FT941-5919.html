			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Israel faces protection demands: Rabin holds talks with far-right party on extending coalition Israel came under renewed international pressure yesterday to meet demands for greater protection of Palestinians living under military occupation. In an effort to calm Palestinian outrage after last Friday's massacre in Hebron, Israel began freeing 400 more Arab prisoners yesterday, bringing this week's total to nearly 1,000. But the Palestine Liberation Organisation reiterated that the move was insufficient to allow a resumption of peace talks. Efforts to resume the peace process are focusing on the PLO's demands for the deployment of an international presence in the occupied territories to safeguard Palestinians, the disarming of the 120,000 Jewish settlers, and the dismantling or 'realignment' of some political or ideological settlements. Israel has rejected the PLO's demands. However, Mr Karolos Papoulias, the Greek foreign minister, who is touring the Middle East representing the European Union, lent his support to the demands during a visit to Amman. Russia, a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process with the US, has also backed the PLO position. Officials in Israel also said that the US, which generally supports the Israeli government, would welcome more credible measures to assuage Palestinian fears. The US is awaiting the arrival of Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior PLO official, who is due in Washington today to explain the organisation's stance and to try to win backing for a strong UN Security Council resolution on the massacre. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said in London yesterday after meeting Mr Shaath that the UK would be willing to send international observers to the occupied territories. 'I am thinking of individuals and civilians rather than armed units,' he said. Britain was determined that the massacre should not derail the peace process, he added. Meanwhile, the Israeli government sought to strengthen its position in parliament, where it has only a one-seat majority, by bringing Tsomet, a far-right-wing party, into the Labour-led coalition, a move that ignited fierce protest from Arab and left-wing government supporters. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has had lengthy negotiations with Tsomet, which has five members in the 120-strong Knesset (parliament). Tsomet favours expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and is opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state. Mr Rafael Eitan, the leader of Tsomet, who once compared Arabs to cockroaches, said yesterday the basis for coalition negotiations with Labour had been created by recent events and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the PLO-Israel outline peace accord. The Knesset's two Arab parties, with five parliamentary seats, said they would withdraw their support from the government if Tsomet joined the coalition. The left-wing Meretz party, Mr Rabin's most important coalition partner, also said it was opposed to the move, warning that it would send a negative message to Palestinians and jeopardise peace talks. Mr Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, said the contacts with Tsomet 'cast a deep shadow' over the peace process.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] officers will no  longer have U.S.-oriented education, and they will have to study  somewhere else. Where will they receive their training?  "Australia," said one source at the ABRI headquarters.  "Australia is not only closer, but it also offers more areas of  studies," added the source.    The efforts to shift the officers' education to the  continent  of kangaroos are made in anticipation of the U.S. Congress'  move. Last month, the U.S. Congress endorsed a clause in its  Foreign Assistance bill stipulating that ABRI officers will not  be allowed to attend U.S. military academies. This means that  if the bill becomes law, ABRI officers will no longer be allowed  to study in the country with the most powerful armed forces in  the world. The ABRI has sent its officers to the United States  since the 1950's.    The trouble started with the outbreak of the 12 November  1991  Dili incident. Following the incident, the U.S. Government  decided to stop the International Military Education and  Training [five preceding words in English] program for  Indonesia. Before that, the U.S. Government spent 4.5 billion  rupiah annually to pay the scholarships for ABRI officers  studying there. [passage omitted]    Navy Commodore Yuswaji, chief of the Defense and Security  Department's Public Relations and Foreign Relations Bureau, said  that there are alternative countries to send ABRI officers for  training. "If we cannot study in the United States, there are  other countries like Australia and Britain," he said.    Is military training in the United States better? A  high-ranking officer said military training in Australia is  adequate because overseas training is basically aimed at  widening one's horizon and doing comparative studies. "The pure  military science taught in the United States is hard to be  applied here because they use sophisticated military equipment,"  said the officer, who has studied in the United States several  times.</p>

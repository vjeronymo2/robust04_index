			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's warns on Latin America Moody's Investors Service, the international rating agency, warns in a report on sovereign risk that old vices are surfacing once again in Latin America. Although Moody's has recognised the fiscal improvement and the success of economic reform in Latin America through some rating upgrades, it nevertheless believes that these countries remain highly indebted and structurally biased towards consumption. National debt is rising again noticeably and the fiscal balance has deteriorated in some cases, notably Venezuela, it adds. Although the potential for growth has improved, the risk of running into debt service problems remains high. 'After a decade of economic crisis, growth rates have been only moderately high and the income distribution of these countries has not improved significantly,' Moody's says. It forecasts problems arising from the reversal in the rapid inflow of capital in recent years (in Argentina and Mexico) and says the considerable potential for political change adds a further degree of uncertainty to the future of the region. The report, which assesses the credit quality outlook for 45 sovereign nations, highlights negative factors which could harm the low-risk credit ratings of advanced industrial nations. These developments, such as high fiscal deficits, the rapid accumulation of public debt, slow economic growth and declining international competitiveness will force painful economic adjustment but in most cases, the adjustment is not expected not be severe enough to move them into the medium-risk rating categories. By contrast, Moody's is positive about the outlook for Asian nations, citing credit strengths, strong export-driven economic growth, high savings and investment rates and moderate indebtedness in proportion to prospects for continued strong export earnings. However, upgrades into the low-risk rating categories will be constrained by the possibility of political instability and regional conflict and the potential for disruptive social change as social demands rise.</p>

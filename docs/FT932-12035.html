			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / G7 pledges closer policy co-ordination THE Group of Seven leading industrial countries yesterday broadened the scope of international economic co-operation with the aim of creating sustained non-inflationary growth in the world economy. In a communique notable for its plain language, they agreed that they should work together to resolve long-term structural issues as well as short-term problems. At the end of the meeting of the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, participants agreed that the gathering had been harmonious and constructive  -in contrast to some recent meetings. Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, Japanese finance minister, said the countries 'reached a common understanding' about a range of issues. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said the meeting helped 'lay the basis for further actions to meet the challenges ahead. We can do more and we should, and I am optimistic that we will.' Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the G7 nations had agreed a 'global strategy for growth' and a 'mutually reinforcing effort for recovery.' He hailed a significant change in attitude compared with a G7 meeting last September when, he said, all countries blamed each other for the world's economic problems. The communique commited the G7 countries to implementing already announced policies to promote growth and deal with problems such as excessive fiscal deficits. The ministers agreed that by the time of the World Economic summit in Tokyo in July they would produce a report discussing structural measures to be taken in their countries. These would include: the reform of labour markets; ways to increase savings and investment; better focused spending on infrastructure and education; action to cut spiralling health care costs and ways of coping with the economic problems of ageing populations. They said that co-operative action and sound economic policies at home, together with such structural reform and further efforts to liberalise trade would help create conditions in foreign exchange markets that were in line with the economic fundamentals of the main industrial countries. They agreed exchange rate volatility was 'undesirable', although participants said relatively little time was spent on the exchange rate issue. In a passage designed to assuage Japanese concerns about the recent sharp rise of the yen against the dollar, they restated their continued commitment to close co-operation in foreign exchange markets. Mr Bentsen said he was optimistic that there would be further interest rate reductions in Europe and that Japan's fiscal stimulus package would help reduce its trade imbalance. Both Mr Hayashi and Mr Bentsen said the prospects were good for further lowering of European interest rates, but refused to comment on the need for early cuts in German rates. 'That is a matter for the German authorities,' he said. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, said there was plenty of room for lower German interest rates but said France would not seek to drive rates down and would follow the market. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the German Bundesbank president, said there was no demand that it give up its cautious easing of interest rates. The ministers welcomed the results of the Russian referendum. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German finance ministry, said that IMF support under the new systemic transformation facility could flow to Russia as soon as next month. The atmosphere of the gathering was improved by Germany's decision this week to lower its market interest rates, a step that may ease the way to lower interest rates across Europe. The intervention by the US Federal Reserve to curb the rapid rise of the yen on foreign exchange markets also drew the teeth from potential controversy by easing Japan's worries about the threat to its export competitiveness.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / US Money and Credit: Period of uncertainty over policy shape THE LOW level of US inflation pleased the Treasury bond market late last week. But the market is in for a period of uncertainty until the Clinton administration's economic policies take more concrete shape. On Friday, when fresh data for December showed the consumer price index was just 2.9 per cent for the whole of 1992, investors responded by boosting by  5/8 the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue, bringing the yield down to 7.34 per cent from 7.39 per cent the day before. While on the one hand the inflation numbers imply more space for fiscal stimuli if Mr Clinton goes ahead with his campaign pledge to bolster the US recovery, the levels of both wholesale and retail inflation were encouraging to bond investors since they were lower than the market expected. As such they might provide more room for manoeuvre on the fiscal front if the danger of significant reflation resulting from stimuli is deemed to be not so great after all. In addition, the market took heart as incoming Clinton administration officials, led by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new treasury secretary, and Mr Leon Panetta, the new director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that cutting the deficit was a top priority. Mr Panetta, however, told Congress that President-elect Bill Clinton would not be presenting a detailed budget plan until March. This suggests that despite the fairly bullish tone of the market, uncertainty will result from the tug-of-war between the deficit-cutting advocates on the Clinton team and those favouring a fiscal stimulus spending package. Those who say a fiscal stimulus package is the priority, despite evidence that the US economy is beginning to recover from recession and stagnation, make the plausible case that the relative strength of the recovery is being overestimated. These advocates also note that employment growth is still lagging behind the rise in output, and is likely to continue to do so in the absence of some job creation policies. The pro-stimulus camp also claims that a fiscal boost could help cure some of the more structural problems of the US economy and thus be more than a short-term measure. A more realistic and powerful explanation for the Clinton camp's enthusiasm for a fiscal stimulus package was offered by the market-watchers at Nomura last week, who said it was 'simply political'. It is of course true that Mr Clinton, who takes office this week with a mandate to do something about the state of the US economy, will be keen to show himself to be taking action. But there are signs that the new administration could also launch a fairly modest package that meets its political requirements, but falls well short of the kinds of expectations raised by last year's election campaign. Back on the deficit front, there will equally be a bonus for the Clinton administration if it has the courage to increase taxes, perhaps on some consumer goods or petrol. But the applause for such a move could be louder on Wall Street than in mainstream America. SG Warburg reckons that an announcement of such a tax, or even of plans to study one, could knock as much as 50 basis points off the long bond's yield, which at present levels would bring it beneath the 7 per cent mark. Quite how the Fed's stance on interest rates will be affected by Mr Clinton's economic policies is hard to say. While this week's presidential inauguration will dominate headlines, the bond market will be just as keen to see what Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has to say about monetary policy when he appears next week before the Joint Economic Committee.</p>

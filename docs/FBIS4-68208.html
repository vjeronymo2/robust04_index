Rusinov] </F>   [Text] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an absolute theocratic  monarchy, occupies a large part of the Arabian Peninsula. It  formed within existing boundaries in 1932 by the unification of  several principalities. Possessing significant oil resources and  finances, Saudi Arabia attempts to play the predominant role  among the Muslim and especially Arab countries. Its leadership  was the main initiator of the formation of the Cooperation  Council for the Arab States of the Gulf[.sup]1[/] in 1981,  bending great efforts to transform it into a military-political  alliance.    The development of the military-political situation in the  Near East and Persian Gulf in the last three years has shown  that the United States and its western allies attach special  importance to Saudi Arabia, giving it considerable aid in Armed  Forces organizational development and technical outfitting. This  is explained above all by the country's important  military-strategic position, enormous oil reserves and leading  role in the regional organization of monarchic Arab states.    While maintaining close cooperation with the United States  in  all areas for a long time, the country's leadership declined  American demands to present its territory for building foreign  military bases. But the appearance of Iraqi troops on the Saudi  border as a result of Kuwait's occupation in August 1990 forced  King Fahd, the head of state, to decide to present the country's  territory for the first time for deployment of a grouping of  armed forces of other states, above all the United States. As a  result, the territory of Saudi Arabia was a springboard for  delivering the multinational forces' attack on Iraq.    Considering the instability of the Near Eastern situation  and  danger of the outbreak of new armed conflicts, the leaders of  Saudi Arabia activated measures for developing and upgrading the  national Armed Forces in the post-crisis period. Special  attention was given to reoutfitting the army with new kinds of  weapons and military equipment by purchases abroad, above all in  the United States, Great Britain and France; upgrading the  troops' organizational structure and combat training; and  increasing their numbers sharply. Thus, while the numerical  strength of personnel of all branches was 67,500 and that of the  National Guard 35,000 in 1990, it reached 102,000 and 55,000  respectively in 1993.    Supreme military command and control entities  (Fig. 1). The King is supreme commander of the Armed Forces. He  exercises overall leadership of them through the Minister of  Defense and Civil Aviation as well as through the Chief of the  General Staff. The consultative body is the Defense Council,  which includes the King, Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation,  ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance and National  Economy, and Communications, Chief of the General Staff and  Commander of the National Guard.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-004L-05A>      Fig. 1. Saudi Arabian Armed </FIG>     The Minister of Defense and Civil Aviation directs the Armed  Forces via the General Staff. He is responsible for their  status, combat readiness and organizational development.    The General Staff is an operational leadership entity which  includes four directorates (operations and combat training,  intelligence, personnel, logistics), a Finance Service and a  Medical Service.    Leadership of the Armed Forces is wholly in the hands of the  royal family. The posts of Minister of Defense and Civil  Aviation, commander of the National Guard, their deputies and  even commanders of individual subunits are held by the King's  relatives.    The Armed Forces organizationally consist of the Army, Air  Force, Air Defense Force, Navy and National Guard.    The Army (69,000) is the principal and largest  branch of the Armed Forces. Its order of battle includes two  armored brigades, five mechanized brigades, one airborne  brigade, a Royal Guard regiment, two motorized infantry brigades  and four infantry brigades of the National Guard, and five  separate artillery battalions. The brigade is the highest  tactical unit.    The armored brigade has three tank battalions, an artillery  battalion, AAA battalion, and logistic support subunits. It has  over 100 tanks and other weapons and military equipment in the  inventory.    The mechanized brigade includes three motorized infantry  battalions, a tank battalion, artillery battalion, AAA  battalion, antitank battalion, and support and service subunits.  It has up to 40 tanks, over 40 field artillery pieces and  mortars, ATGM launchers, air defense weapons, APC's and motor  vehicles in the inventory.    An infantry brigade consists of three infantry battalions,  an  artillery battalion, antitank battery, AAA battery, and logistic  support subunits. There are field artillery pieces, mortars, air  defense weapons (including shoulder-fired SAM systems), APC's  and motor vehicles in the inventory.    The airborne brigade includes airborne battalions, artillery  and mortar subunits, and antitank weapons.    The Army has a total of around 700 tanks (up to 400 M60A3  and  300 AMX-30), 235 combat reconnaissance vehicles, around 700  IFV's, 1,700 APC's (including vehicles of their own production,  Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), up to 400 field artillery  pieces (105-mm, 155-mm and 203.2-mm), 70 MLRS, around 400  mortars (81-mm and 106.7-mm), around 800 antitank weapons (TOW,  Dragon, HOT and Vigilant ATGM's and also 90-mm and 106-mm  recoilless guns), over 500 air defense weapons (Redeye and  Stinger shoulder-fired SAM systems and Vulcan self-propelled AA  guns), and around 30 army aviation helicopters.    The Air Force (18,000) has combat (fighter and  fighter-bomber) and auxiliary aviation in its makeup. The  squadron is the main organizational unit. The Air Force has a  total of 19 squadrons: six fighter-bomber (52 F-5E and 45  Tornado aircraft, Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]), five  fighter-interceptor (78 F-15 and 24 Tornado aircraft), three  transport (40 C-130E and H, 35 C-212), three training (BAC-167,  Hawk, Cessna) and two helicopter squadrons (AB-205, -206 and  -212).    For basing aircraft Saudi Arabia has bases and airfields  whose overall capacity, in the assessment of foreign  specialists, fully satisfies the needs of the national Air  Force. The main bases and airfields are Riyadh, Dhahran, Jiddah,  Taif, Tabuk and Khamis Mushayat.    The Air Defense Force (4,000) was removed from the  Air Force as an independent branch of the Armed Forces in late  1986. It has 16 Improved Hawk SAM batteries (128 launchers) and  17 Crotale (Shahine) SAM batteries (68 launchers).    The Navy (11,000) organizationally consists of two  commands, Western (Red Sea) and Eastern (Persian Gulf). The Navy  has around 60 ships and craft of various types, of which there  are 4 corvettes equipped with Harpoon antiship missiles, 4  frigates with Otomat antiship missiles, 9 missile craft (Fig. 4  [figure not reproduced]), 3 torpedo boats, 20 patrol craft, 6  minesweeper/hunters, and 8 landing craft. The Navy also includes  a Marine regiment (1,500 persons) and 24 Dauphin 2 helicopters.    The main naval bases and basing facilities are Jiddah, Al  Jubayl, Ras Tanura, Dammam, Yanbu, Qatif and Ras al Mishab.    The National Guard (55,000), established in 1958,  is an independent force element and holds a special place in the  Armed Forces system. Its basic purpose is to protect members of  the royal family, government establishments, oil fields and so  on. It has two motorized infantry brigades (four battalions  each), four infantry brigades, a ceremonial squadron and support  subunits in its makeup. Its inventory includes around 1,100  Commando APC's, 30 105-mm howitzers, mortars, TOW ATGM's,  recoilless guns and Vulcan self-propelled AA guns.    Armed Forces manpower acquisition is accomplished  by the volunteer enlistment principle. Basic military training  of the rank and file is conducted at training centers and that  of NCO's and specialists in military schools of branches of the  Armed Forces. Training of officer cadres is conducted in Saudi  Arabian military colleges and that of higher officer personnel  and of equipment and armament operation and maintenance  specialists is done abroad, chiefly in the United States, Great  Britain, France and other countries.

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: The flame of modernism still burns in St Ives - William Packer admires the work of Patrick Heron and Terry Frost The far western tip of Cornwall in the 1950s was deemed to be the very epicentre of English modernism, with Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth the presiding geniuses and, around them, any number of bright young things, a true community of painters and sculptors of all kinds. Well, art history never comes quite so simple and pat as that. While it was true that artists were there and active in numbers enough to constitute a distinctive school, there were so many more elsewhere, and no less significant and distinguished. And of course the moment passed. The school of St Ives, such as it was as a major force in British art, dispersed: some of the artists moved away, some died, and the little town soon resumed its status as an artists' colony of the quainter sort. But one or two artists remained to keep the flame of modernism alive. Barbara Hepworth stayed on until her death in 1975, and there, on their respective hilltops to the north and south, two of the principal and truly representative artists of the school still are - Patrick Heron at Eagle's Nest, high above Zennor to the west of St Ives: Terry Frost on his hill above Newlyn, looking out over the bay to Saint Michael's Mount. By coincidence they both have exhibitions concurrent in London - Frost, indeed, has several. The new works by Heron constitute a remarkable testament to his continuing vigour as a painter at 74, for they were all done this year and some are extremely big. And to see them shown to such advantage in Camden's large and splendid galleries is to have borne in on one the force of the old truth, that all abstract painting is a kind of landscape. In this, Heron indeed consciously echoes le bourgeois gentilhomme himself, in declaring at last that he has been a landscape painter all the time. This, from an artist as committed as any in his time to the painterly purism of the colour, field and the integrity of the surface, one of the first to reduce his work to terms of the simplest gestural stripe, is a nice twist. And we can see what he means. For from his Eagle's Nest he looks down on the world as upon a map, alike to the nearer world of the garden with its borders, beds and terraces, and further to the ancient patchwork and tracery of the Iron-Age fields and hedges far below, and the sea beyond. Suddenly the familiar eccentric curves and filled-in blobs and blocks of his later work take on extra and unsuspected meaning and resonance. But now the filling-in has gone, and the colour shifted from the spread mass of paint to the actual line, and a line that is now febrile, edgy, nervous. Close-up we see only the stuff of the paint and the mark and stroke of the brush: stand back, and we discover again the spidery, taut drawing of Heron's work of more than 40 years ago, before abstraction. Thus the circle of a true career completes itself. Terry Frost, by contrast, makes the same connection, but by open demonstration rather than by implication, showing the new and the old together. And he has always openly admitted, indeed celebrated, the initiating stimulus of the visible world, whatever his apparent commitment to abstraction. He too over the years - he is now 79 - has developed his own vocabulary of image and symbol, a personal heraldry of sun and moon, crescent and spiral, registered ever more clearly in unmoderated reds and blacks, blues and yellows. To see his newest work beside that of the 1950s and early 60s, is to be reminded both of the sources of its imagery, and of its evolutionary nature. For though the colour was more muted and earthy then, the colours, as it were, of that whiff of fish and seaweed that catches the throat at the quay-side, there still are the bright boats rocking in the harbour or beached higgledy-piggledy as the tide goes out, the seaweed on the sea wall, and the cables running out across the sand. But such things are not described in any documentary sense, but rather hinted at, teased out of the imagination by inference and oblique suggestion, conjured out of simple shapes set in rhythmical conjuction. It is good to see such impressive work again, after so long. Patrick Heron: Big Paintings 1994: Camden Arts Centre, Arkwright Road NW3, until November 13.

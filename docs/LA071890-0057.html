			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAVIS (STRAINED BACK) JOINS JOYNER ON ANGEL'S CROWDED DISABLED LIST  </P> <P> The Angels placed outfielder Chili Davis on the 15-day disabled list with a  strained lower back Tuesday, one day after placing Wally Joyner on the disabled  list.  </P> <P> The move leaves the Angels without their second- and third-best run-producers.  </P> <P> Lance Parrish leads the team in runs batted in with 44. Joyner is second with  41 RBIs, and Davis third with 40.  </P> <P> "The people who will be under (any) strain will be the people who haven't been  producing very well for us this year," Manager Doug Rader said. "It's up to  them to pick up some of the slack."  </P> <P> The Angels' .247 team batting average is last in the American League. They are  batting .216 with runners in scoring position.  </P> <P> Davis, 30, has been bothered by his back since July 2 and had not played in the  past three games. He was put on the list retroactive to Saturday. The move  marked the 11th time this season the Angels have placed a player on the DL,  surpassing last season's total of nine.  </P> <P> The Angels recalled catcher Ron Tingley from triple-A Edmonton to replace  Davis, who plays outfield and designated hitter and is batting .272 with 10  home runs.  </P> <P> Tingley, 31, appeared in four games with the Angels during the final month of  last season. He was batting .267 with five home runs and 23 RBIs in 54 games  with Edmonton.  </P> <P> The Angels also transferred pitcher Greg Minton from the 15-day list to the  21-day list to make room for Davis.

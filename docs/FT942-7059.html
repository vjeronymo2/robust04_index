			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Shakespeare festival at Barbican The first large-scale international Shakespeare festival in the UK is to be held at the Barbican Centre, London, from October 25 to November 20. The festival is being planned by the Royal Shakespeare Company, which is resident at the Barbican. It would be the most ambitious event there and draw on all the arts complex's resources. Among directors taking part will be the American Peter Sellars, with an updated version of The Merchant of Venice; Karin Beler from Germany with a controversial Romeo and Juliet; and the Japanese director Tadashi Suzuki, with King Lear. There will also be companies from Georgia and Israel. Music will include the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra giving the concert premiere of Sibelius' music for The Tempest, with highlights from the play. The Barbican cinemas and exhibition spaces will also be given over to Shakespeare. The Pounds 1.25m festival is supported by a Pounds 500,000 grant from the City of London.</p>

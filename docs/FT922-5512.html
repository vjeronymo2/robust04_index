			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Telecoms The mooted Dollars 2.8bn merger of Centel, a US cellular telephone company, and Sprint, a long-distance operator, raises important questions for the world telecommunications industry, and for the UK market in particular. On the face of it, Sprint stands to merge at a valuation significantly below the market's assumed worth of Centel - hence the 25 per cent drop in the latter's share price when the deal was announced this week. The chief implication is that equity markets have been seduced by the cellular operators into seeing their subscribers as intrinsically more valuable than those of fixed-line operators. While there was an evident shortage of capacity, cellular licences probably were worth a premium. Arguably, that is no longer the case. The UK market provides a telling example. On a rough calculation, Vodafone's Pounds 3.8bn market capitalisation values each of its subscribers at more than Pounds 5,000. By contrast, BT's fixed-line customers are worth a mere Pounds 850 apiece. Logic suggests that the recent proliferation of ways to access a dialling tone - from cable television to PCN - will cause convergence of prices and, ultimately, market valuations. Thanks in part to regulation, it will increase significantly. But Vodafone's 60 per cent return on capital was never likely to survive increasing competition. The implications for the company's shares are obvious, not least that the risk of hostile takeover is greatly diminished. After all, if the above thesis is correct, its Pounds 3.8bn market worth would be much better spent starting a new company.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUWA RULING POSES CHALLENGE TO WAY BUSINESS IS DONE IN JAPAN  </P> <P> A Japanese real estate giant with substantial holdings in the United States has  rattled the corporate establishment at home, challenging an entrenched system  of crossed share holdings in a hostile takeover bid that may help open Japan's  financial markets to foreign investors.  </P> <P> Shuwa Corp., which owns Arco Plaza in Los Angeles and more than 30 other  buildings in the United States, has caused a minor sensation here by  accumulating large stakes in two regional supermarket chains and talking boldly  about combining their operations into one large and efficient retailing concern  -- against the wishes of the companies' managers.  </P> <P> Such a gambit might seem commonplace in the United States, but in Japan most  companies guard against hostile takeovers by placing blocks of stock in the  hands of friendly, "stable" investors. The game of mergers and acquisitions is  usually played in the shadows by unsavory characters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shareholders as Owners  </P> <P> When takeover activity does come out into the open, it invariably involves some  form of "greenmail" -- the practice in which a takeover target pays a potential  acquirer, usually by buying back acquired shares at a premium, in return for  the other's promise not to pursue the takeover bid.  </P> <P> Shuwa's high-profile bid for controlling interests in Chujitsuya Co. and  Inageya Co. was given a boost Tuesday by the Tokyo District Court, which  prohibited the two retailers from swapping new issues of heavily discounted  stock in a takeover defense intended to dilute Shuwa's holdings.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear what kind of legal precedent the ruling would set,  or whether it might contribute to Japan's industrial restructuring and help  reform the rigid and exclusive web of corporate cross-holdings, a system that  has its origins in the pre-World War II zaibatsu conglomerates.  </P> <P> But by ruling that the companies should have obtained approval at general  shareholder meetings before planning the stock swap, the court backed Shuwa's  contention that shareholders are the ultimate owners of publicly held  companies. Traditionally, ordinary shareholders wield little or no influence  over management activities in Japan's corporate culture.  </P> <P> T. Boone Pickens Jr., an American corporate raider, said the court's decision  "represents a strong step toward breaking down the anti-investment barriers  erected by Japan's cartels."  </P> <P> Pickens is battling for representation on the board of a Tokyo company -- which  makes automobile headlights and other parts -- in which he purchased a 20%  stake earlier this year.  </P> <P> "Even the Japanese courts are now deciding that Japan Inc. cannot ignore the  rights of its shareholders," Pickens said in a statement issued at the  Amarillo, Tex., office of his Boone Co. investment partnership. "This ruling is  an important step in our efforts to remove barriers and open up Japan to  shareholder rights and foreign investment."  </P> <P> Kanji Ishizumi, a Tokyo lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions, said  the judgment "backs up what Mr. Pickens has been saying" about shareholder  democracy.  </P> <P> "Things will definitely change from now; they have to," Ishizumi said.  "Japanese can buy U.S. companies freely, but the reverse isn't true because  cross-holdings among friendly shareholders in Japan make it impossible to  acquire a majority."  </P> <P> Shigeru Kobayashi, Shuwa's president, assembled holdings of 33% and 21%,  respectively, in Chujitsuya and Inageya, buying shares on the open market over  a two-year period to become the top shareholder in each of the family  controlled companies. He also obtained stock in three other retailers,  including one run by an old friend with whom he planned to cooperate in merging  and operating the business once the acquisitions were complete.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Streamlining the System  </P> <P> Kobayashi, whose aggressive real estate acquisitions in the United States  coincided with rising uneasiness over Japanese "investment friction," then  adopted a cause seemingly designed to generate good will. He said he wanted to  do his part to streamline the complicated and inefficient distribution system,  which has been widely blamed in recent years for restricting imports.  </P> <P> "We plan to restructure the general merchandise distribution industry,"  Kobayashi said. "People will see that what we are doing is right, after seeing  the results."  </P> <P> On the advice of Nomura Wasserstein Perella Co., a Tokyo-based joint venture  between Japan's largest brokerage and a New York investment bank, Chujitsuya  and Inageya announced July 10 a plan to expand their cross-holdings to 19.5% by  trading issues of new stock, discounted by as much as 78% below market prices.  </P> <P> Kobayashi sued for a court injunction against the offering, and this led to  Tuesday's ruling.  </P> <P> The two supermarket chains "won't fight beyond this" for the stock swap, said  Mitsuo Goto, president of Nomura Wasserstein. "But they will pursue business  ties between the two companies and oppose any outside interference in the  management."  </P> <P> Although Kobayashi has hinted at the possibility of selling off his shares to  major national retail chains, such as Seibu/Saison Group or Daiei Inc., his  strategy from now on is not clear, nor is it certain that he can continue to  buy shares on the open market.  </P> <P> "Regardless of who is the winner or loser, I think that the Shuwa case will be  a positive factor in vitalizing the Japanese securities market," Rinichi  Kanzaki, an investment consultant, said in a television interview. "Japanese  companies cannot live in an environment of peace and quiet forever."  </P> <P> SHUWA HOLDINGS  </P> <P> Shuwa Investments Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of Shuwa Corp. of Tokyo, owns 35  properties in the United States valued at $2.7 billion. Some of the key  properties are:Arco Plaza, Los Angeles  </P> <P> 1900 Avenue of the Stars, Century City  </P> <P> Chase Plaza, Los Angeles  </P> <P> 19000 MacArthur Building, Irvine  </P> <P> Taco Bell Building, New York  </P> <P> ABC Building, New York  </P> <P> Mellon Financial Center, New York  </P> <P> U.S. News &amp; World Report Building, Washington D.C.  </P> <P> Embassy Suites Hotel, Washington D.C.  </P> <P> Paine Webber Building, Boston  </P> <P> Quaker Tower, Chicago  </P> <P> Source: Shuwa Investments Corp.  </P></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Control Secs will not pay bond interest CONTROL Securities, the UK property and leisure group suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange since October, said yesterday it would not pay interest on a Swiss franc bond issue, writes Simon London. In a brief announcement after the close of trading in London, it said a SFr7.5m (Dollars 5.7m) interest payment due on July 27 would not be met. A meeting of bondholders would be convened 'to consider resolutions to be proposed'. Control has two Swiss bond issues outstanding: a SFr100m issue maturing 1994 and a SFr100m 8 7/8 per cent issue maturing 1997. Both were lead-managed by Warburg Soditic, a subsidiary of the UK merchant banking group. Control Securities' shares were suspended following raids on its offices by the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Nazmudin Virani, former chairman and chief executive, faces conspiracy charges relating to the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.</p>

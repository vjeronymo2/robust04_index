			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Perot rejoins race for US presidency to sort out 'mess' ROSS PEROT yesterday afternoon rejoined the race for the US presidency, ending the suspense that has surrounded his intentions. The Texan billionaire announced in Dallas that he would run as an independent candidate in response to the call of his volunteers 'to put our financial house back in order'. Without mentioning President George Bush or Governor Bill Clinton by name, he said he had withdrawn his prospective effort in July to give the two main parties a chance to address the real economic issues worrying the country. 'They didn't do it,' he declared. Mr Perot's statement was followed by a few words from his running mate, retired Admiral James Stockdale, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam and now at Stanford University in California. Mr Stockdale said he was running for the veterans of America, but conceded, as Mr Perot did not, that they started as underdogs. The magnitude of the struggle was immediately provided by a CNN/USA Today poll taken this week, after a Perot candidacy became increasingly probable. It gave Mr Clinton 52 per cent, President Bush 35 per cent and Mr Perot a meagre 7 per cent. His negative ratings, at 66 per cent, far exceeded those of Mr Clinton (38 per cent) and Mr Bush (56 per cent.) His statement, delivered in the presence of his large family and the Stockdales, was vintage Perot, containing many of the refrains from the heady days of late spring when he briefly topped some public opinion polls. He was a product of the American dream, he said, meaning that 'nobody else could be so obligated to serve'. The American people are 'good' but government 'is a mess', and so was politics, which, he went on, should not attract 'ego-driven, power-hungry people' - a description often applied by his critics to Mr Perot. Perhaps aware of a flood of new accusations about his penchant for launching private investigations, including some of his own 'volunteers', he declared. 'I will not spend one minute of my time answering questions not directly related to the concerns of the American people.' It remains to be seen what attitudes the Bush and Clinton campaigns, hitherto solicitous towards him, take towards Mr Perot now that he has come out in the open. It is also not clear if he will be given a place at the debating table with the two leading candidates, assuming such confrontations are arranged. Both camps were still negotiating terms in Washington yesterday. Both have previously said that if Mr Perot were in the race it would be hard to exclude him. Texas cool towards native son, Page 8</p>

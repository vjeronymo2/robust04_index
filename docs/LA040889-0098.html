			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TRIED AND TRUE  </P> <P> I don't understand Robert Hilburn's April 4 review of the Morton Downey Jr.  album: He neglected to compare Downey's work with that of Springsteen, U2, REM  or Dylan. He also never said whether the songwriting was "compelling."  </P> <P> So, did Bob like the album or not? Please tell Hilburn to stick to the formula  we've all grown to know and love.  </P> <P> M. WIDENER  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China will have a  labor law to protect the legal rights of employees in the  country.    A draft labor law submitted today by the State Council to  the  country's legislature for deliberation stipulates that all  laborers are entitled to rights to choose jobs, to be paid, to  rest, to have job protection and to receive job training.    Laborers' rights should be equal, irrespective of  differences  in nationality, race, sex and religious belief, the draft said.    The law will also authorize employers to fire employees  within certain limits, when the enterprises are in true  difficulties.    "An enterprise on the brink of bankruptcy or in grave  difficulty may reduce working staff, provided that the decision  is agreed upon by the trade union organization in the enterprise  or after consultation with all the staff members," the draft  said.    Li Boyong, minister of labor, explained the draft to the  legislators at the Sixth Session of the Standing Committee of  the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which started today.    "The rights of enterprises to dismiss employees for reasons  other than employees' faults will guarantee the legal rights of  employers to run businesses independently and will give  enterprises a certain edge in market competition," Li Boyong  told the meeting.    However, the limits set for job reductions are "necessary  for  China's social stability," he said.    Because China has far more laborers than required, and such  a  disparity cannot be changed in a short time, massive job  reductions would lead to social chaos, he added.    The current session will conduct a preliminary review of the  draft law.    The draft law also rules that the contract system will be  the  fundamental form in shaping China's labor relations between  employers and employees, in both private and publicly owned  enterprises.    "This is based on China's experiments in implementing the  systems and experiences of other market economies," Li Boyong  said.    There are already 25 million contract laborers in China, Li  said.    The draft also accepts in principle the form of "collective  agreement" -- which is reached by the trade union organization  and the enterprise on matters of payment, working conditions and  welfare for the employees.    This system will be mainly implemented in private  enterprises. Publicly-owned ones may follow the steps after  property rights are cleared and operation improved, Li said.    The minister of labor said that the primary reasons to make  the law are "to protect the legal rights of laborers, establish  and maintain stable and harmonious ties between employers and  employees, and promote China's labor system in line with the  establishment of the socialist market economy."    He said that without a systematic legal system to protect  working people's rights, China has in recent years witnessed  quite a few labor disputes in enterprises, and some "major and  grave" labor accidents, especially in private enterprises.    He said workers have been forced to work long hours, or  their  pay cut without reason in some private enterprises.    Some workers have even been humiliated or beaten by bosses  from outside China's mainland, he said.    Li said the draft has been revised more than 30 times since  its first version in 1978. The provisions have all been tried  out and accepted by all regions, industries, and enterprises of  different forms of ownership.    International labor conventions and common practices in  market economies have also been referred to in the drafting, Li  said.</p>

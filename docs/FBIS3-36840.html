			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chechen Foreign Minister Shamseddin Yusef has called  on Russia to pursue a policy of compromise in relationships with  his republic. In an interview with Interfax he said that if  today the Chechen leadership had wished, under Moscow pressure,  to re-enter the Russian Federation, the "Chechen people would  not have understood it."    If Moscow recognizes Chechnya's right to independence which  it proclaimed two and a half years ago, "we shall remain good  friends with Russia," said Yusef.    He believes that economics may be the basis for any  political  dialogue, including between Groznyy and Moscow. He said that  the prospects for a political dialogue must lead to such  dialogue.    Yusef said that the need for the earliest settlement of  relations with Russia was the reason for the Chechen president's  refusal to visit the United States "at the invitation of the  American side." The minister did not specify who precisely  invited Dudayev.</p>

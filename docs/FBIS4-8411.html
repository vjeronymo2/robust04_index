			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- The government of the  Srpska republic today expressed indignation at the United  Nation's effective involvement in the civil war in  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and its siding with the Muslim side, the  ministry for information of the Srpska republic has stated.    The government draws attention to the already looming risk  of  this act leading to the very brink of a conflict of cataclysmic  proportions and maintains that there is no need to emphasize the  fact that the United Nations has undermined the relatively  reasonable logic of the hitherto peace process by taking this  action.    Apart from the necessary measures, derived from its powers  and taken in keeping with the latest situation, the government  has also decided to acquaint in detail the international public  with the consequences of the bombardment of the Serb positions  around Gorazde.    In this context, the ministry for foreign affairs of the  Srpska republic will inform Russia, Germany, China, Japan, and  India in particular about the NATO aggression and demand of  these countries to condemn this aggression and support the peace  process.    Taking into account all the elements of the civil war, a  formula for peace in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina must recognize the  right to self- determination of all three peoples, including  their right to have their own state, the lifting of sanctions  against Yugoslavia and the Serbian people in general, a lasting  cessation of hostilities, the disengagement of the warring  parties under the supervision of the United Nations and  territorial demarcation, the statement says.</p>

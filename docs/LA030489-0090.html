			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SADDLEBACK, MILLIKAN MEET IN 5-AA TITLE GAME TONIGHT  </P> <P> Santa Ana Saddleback and Long Beach Millikan, two well-balanced teams that like  to fast break, will meet tonight at 8:15 for the high school boys' Southern  Section 5-AA Division basketball title as part of a five-game package at the  Sports Arena. Saddleback is 27-1, Millikan 24-6.  </P> <P> In the late morning-early afternoon session, Oxnard Santa Clara (22-3) plays  Orange Lutheran (23-3) at 10:30 a.m. in the 2-A Division final; Whittier  Christian (21-6) meets Banning (21-4) at 12:30 p.m. in the 2-AA championship  game, and Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills (21-6) plays Corona del Mar (19-9) at  2:30 p.m. in the 3-A final.  </P> <P> In the evening session, Irvine (25-5) and Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley  (23-4) play for the 5-A title at 6:30, before the Saddleback-Millikan game.  </P> <P> Millikan is the third Moore League team that Saddleback will meet in the  playoffs, having previously beaten league champion Lakewood, 65-61, and  third-place finisher Long Beach Jordan, 81-59. Millikan also knocked off  second-seeded Santa Monica St. Monica, 83-80, and third-seeded Loyola, 85-84,  in getting to the final.  </P> <P> Malru Dottin, a 6-foot-7 center averaging 16.8 points and 9.3 rebounds, leads  Saddleback in both categories. Guards Terry Hilliard, averaging 14.6 points a  game, and Jeep Jensen, averaging 13.5, are the offensive leaders for Millikan.  </P> <P> Before meeting in the 5-A final, Irvine and Capistrano Valley played twice in  the South Coast League, Capistrano Valley winning first at home, 57-56, and  then at Irvine, 66-43. This will be Irvine Coach Steve Keith's third title game  in nine years. He won titles with Glendale in 1981 and 1985.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley's offense revolves around guards Scott McCorkle, who is  averaging 25 points a game, and Chris Kostoff, who is averaging 21. Irvine is  also led in scoring by a guard, Bryan Allred, who is averaging 16 points, but  the play of the Molle brothers, 6-5 senior Raphael and 6-6 sophomore John,  could be the deciding factor.  </P></p>

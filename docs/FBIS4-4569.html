			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Iwao Nakatani, professor at the Hitotsubashi </F> University: "Partial Relaxation of Regulations Under the  Large-Scale Retail Store Law"]    [Text] Now that the government has recently taken steps to  relax regulations under the Large-Scale Retail Store Law,  large-scale retail stores are able to set up new branches,  provided each outlet has a floor area of less than 1,000 square  meters. As the Hiraiwa Report stresses, the abolishment of such  regulations is a trump card to revitalize the current state of  the Japanese economy and narrow price differentials between  Japan and other nations. It is very regrettable that the  government has reached a half-formed resolution on relaxing the  regulations.    Primary reasons for the government drawing up such a  half-formed resolution include: first, medium- and small-scale  retailers have strongly reacted against completely abolishing  the regulations, and their reaction has led the government to  fear political risks in taking such action; and second, the  government has concluded that even if the conventional  regulations are left unrelaxed, large-scale stores can open new  branches of their retail stores anyway.    When the Large-Scale Retail Store Law was enacted 20 years  ago, large-scale stores could freely open new branches, provided  each had a floor area of less than 1,500 square meters. The  government then restricted the area of new retail store outlets  to 500 square meters by strengthening the regulations. This  time, the government has somewhat relaxed the regulations, but  the deregulation has fallen short of reaching the size available  20 years ago. The United States has pressed Japan to open its  markets and has asked Japan to set numerical targets, because in  many instances, Japan has agreed in general to relax its  regulations; however, Japan has yielded to pressure from  interest groups whenever it has planned to take concrete steps  to relax its regulations.    Political pressure exists in all nations. Politicians should  make a firm decision on whether to yield to pressure or adhere  to their principles and push for reforms to the last. Voters  will decide whether such decisions are right or wrong when they  cast ballots in elections. This is part of the democratic  process. At present, however, government-led consultative  councils submit reports to the government and policies are  actually formulated based on the conclusions of such reports.  This is not a healthy process. The present situation is such  that the collusive relationship between the government and the  private sector is hard to break, and bureaucrats, whose  decisions are not mandated by voters in elections, have taken  the initiative in deciding to keep the Large-Scale Retail Store  Law in effect. This situation clearly runs counter to the  principles of democracy.    There is a "logic of adults" [otonanoronri] behind  Japanese-style decisionmaking; such logic is villainous. The  government's idea is that, "since large-scale stores can still  open new retail outlets under the Large-Scale Retail Store Law,  it is desirable to reap the benefits of keeping the law in  force." It appears that the "logic of adults" has been behind  the government's recent decision to keep the Large-Scale Retail  Store Law intact. We must not forget that the "logic of adults"  has prevented transparency in Japanese decisionmaking. The  government's decision to keep the law intact clearly will be  advantageous to major Japanese firms that have already  consolidated their business foundations in the distribution  industry, but will be disadvantageous to foreign firms that have  yet to firmly establish themselves in the Japanese market.    The Large-Scale Retail Store Law does not exist in the  United  States. The nonexistence of such a law has constantly  revolutionized the distribution system and kept prices low in  that country. Wal-Mart, a discount store in the United States,  is well-known worldwide for its innovative management. Wal-Mart  is a fast-growing, high-profit firm that has posted the world's  top retail sales over the past few years. The characteristic  feature of the company's strategy is to open retail outlets in  small towns with populations around 30,000. Major supermarkets  are reluctant to open retail outlets in such small towns. Many  conventional retail stores are small, while the prices of goods  sold at such stores are high.    Wal-Mart has focused on opening retail outlets in rural  towns. The American firm has tried hard to purchase goods from  all over the world at the lowest prices, and this has made it  possible for its retail stores to sell goods at lower prices.  As a result, townspeople have rushed to Wal-Mart to buy goods,  leaving rival conventional stores bankrupt.    To be sure, the bankruptcy of conventional small retail  stores has resulted in great pain for such firms. However, the  living standards of townspeople have greatly improved. Their  real purchasing power has grown and existing business has become  brisk in order to meet fresh demand. In addition, one new  business after another has emerged. People who have lost their  jobs in conventional small retail stores have found new jobs in  Wal-Mart, and some of them have started new businesses. The  arrival of Wal-Mart has substantially revitalized towns and  improved the livelihood of people in the towns.    The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters headed by  the prime minister will create today (28 March) a "panel on  import promotion, market opening, and distribution." I hope  that as a trump card to drastically narrow the price  differentials between Japan and other nations, the prime  minister will make a political decision on the repeal of the  Large-Scale Retail Store Law.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / EC court to clarify pensions THE European Court of Justice heard arguments yesterday in a case that should clarify how far employers must go to equalise men's and women's pensions, Reuter reports from Luxembourg. A key question is whether the court's landmark May 17, 1990 ruling ordering equal pension rights in the European Community applies to benefits earned before the judgment was issued. The court will hear detailed arguments over the next few months. The Advocate General is then expected to issue a report. A final judgment is expected around mid-year. The new case joins suits from four parties in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. One involves pensioners from Britain's Coloroll Group, which has gone into receivership. In the 1990 judgment, Barber vs Guardian Royal Exchange, the court ruled that a provision of the Treaty of Rome outlawing sex discrimination in pay schemes applied to pensions. It limited the degree to which the ruling could be retroactive, but in technical language that was not clear. EC leaders tried to clarify the situation by adding a protocol to the Maastricht treaty saying the Barber ruling would apply only to benefits tied to an employee's service after May 17, 1990.</p>

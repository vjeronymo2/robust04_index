			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Ionescu Quintus, president of the </F> National Liberal Party, by Andrei Costa; place and date not  given: "The Unification of the Liberal Movement Is a Must for  Romania"]    [Excerpts] [Costa] Mr. President, when did you first get  come into contact with the liberal movement?    [Quintus] In April 1936, when I was still a student. My  father, who died shortly before that date, had been the chairman  of the liberal organization in Prahova County. [passage  omitted] My actual involvement took place at the end of 1945,  with the Soviet troops still in the country. I and a group of  colleagues and friends decided to join the National Liberal  Party [PNL] "Bratianu." We set up a very strong youth  organization and I was elected its chairman. Therefore, I  occupied this post from the end of 1945 until the spring of  1947, when the political parties were outlawed. I was also a  member of the Liberal Youth Central Committee, where I became  acquainted with a part of the present leadership of the party.  Some of my former colleagues are no longer alive.    [Costa] Did you suffer political persecution in the period  of communist dictatorship?    [Quintus] Of course, I was lucky to suffer less than the  others, since I remained in the Collegium of Lawyers, whose  chairman was a man with whom I did military service and who  overlooked my political past. [passage omitted] Nevertheless,  I was once briefly arrested in 1945 and then, for a longer time  in 1952, when I was sent to the Canal [the first Danube-Black  Sea Canal project, where political prisoners were sent to do  hard labor] until 1954, because of my former position in the  liberal youth movement. Likewise, in 1956 and 1957 I was  submitted to tough interrogations by the Securitate. [passage  omitted]    [Costa] What are the present prospects of the liberal trend  at the international level?    [Quintus] I believe that the strongest liberal movement  right now is in Japan. [passage omitted] Without trying to  show local patriotism, I would say that some of the strongest  liberal parties -- I am sorry to have to use the plural here --  are in Romania. Nowhere in the countries with liberal parties is  the liberal governing alternative as possible as in our country,  if we were to manage to achieve the most important thing for the  country, namely the unification of the liberal movement.  [passage omitted]    [Costa] With what liberal parties abroad does the PNL  maintain relations of cooperation?    [Quintus] We are cooperating with various parties of a  liberal orientation from Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany,  Switzerland, and Belgium. In Sweden, there is also a liberal  party with which we have been in touch. However, this  cooperation has been pretty timid, since we have to pay more  attention to PNL internal problems and stability. [passage  omitted]    [Costa] Regarding the local public administration, how do  the PNL representatives in the territory act to solve problems  in the spheres they are in charge of? Please tell us how do you  cooperate with the other opposition parties in this respect.    [Quintus] Personally, I know the situation in many counties,  where our councillors cooperate perfectly well with the  councillors of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)  [PD(FSN]) and the Democratic Convention [CDR]. I would like to  point out that the letters of intent we have recently signed  with the PD(FSN) and the Civic Alliance Party [PAC] proved to be  very inspired and were very well received in the territory,  where, I repeat, there is a perfect cooperation among us. This  cooperation strives hard to thwart the constant attempts of the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] to also lay hold of the  power in the local administration, where the CDR and PD(FSN)  have scored very good results in the local elections. This  common front is necessary to thwart this dangerous intention of  those in power.    [Costa] If it were given a mandate to govern the country,  under what conditions would the PNL accept it?    [Quintus] This is a hypothetical question, which I will  consequently treat as such. First of all, the liberals could  only assume the responsibility of government if they were united  in a single large party and not in the mess they are right now.  For the coming months, up to a year for now, I believe that the  country can only be ruled by a coalition of parties that can put  together a parliamentary majority. As for us, the PNL has a  single representative in Parliament, namely Mr. Caius Dragomir,  who, if he is appointed ambassador abroad, will have to give up  his post as senator and the quality member of our party. A  party that has no parliamentary support cannot fulfill its  program in government. However, I believe that, in the current  circumstances, only a coalition between the opposition and one  of the important forces of the power can assume such a  responsibility. If, by some absurdity, I were to be given the  mandate to govern, I would refuse it because it would be  preposterous for a party that is not even represented in  Parliament to think of the possibility of governing. However, I  repeat, even if we were represented in Parliament, only a  coalition of powerful forces could run public affairs in the  current very difficult economic and social conditions of the  country and try to implement the reform and revitalize our  production and economy.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Kohl Holds Out Prospects of </F> Cooperation Agreement With the European Union for Yeltsin"]    [Text] Bonn, 12 May -- Germany intends to help Russia  become an equal member of European and international  institutions. President Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor  Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) agreed during  their meeting in Bonn to bring about a cooperation agreement  between the European Union (EU) and Russia under the German EU  Presidency beginning early in July, which would help Russia in  the economic area. Yeltsin announced that Russia would join the  Partnership for Peace with NATO, if Russia's particularities  were first considered in a protocol. Kohl and Yeltsin agreed to  honor the withdrawal of the last Soviet troops from Germany on  31 August with a ceremony in Berlin and not, as originally  planned, in Weimar. Kohl and Yeltsin were in the Palatinate on  12 May; earlier, Yeltsin met with Social Democratic Party [SPD]  Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Bonn.    Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party -- FDP)  played tennis with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, on  13 May and then made an excursion to Cologne. They also took  part in a ceremony in Aachen, in which Norwegian Prime Minister  Gro Harlem Brundtland was awarded the Charlemagne Peace Prize.  Kinkel will hold talks with Yeltsin in Bonn this Friday [13  May], he will then go to Stuttgart to conclude his visit.  Kinkel and Kozyrev will jointly fly to Geneva to take part in  the meeting of the contact group of several foreign ministers  dealing with the war in Bosnia. Yeltsin, Kozyrev, Economics  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  had negotiated with Kohl and other German government members on  11 May; Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (CDU) did not take part in  these negotiations because he was in the island of Ruegen where  he met with the Danish and Polish defense ministers. State  Secretary Schoenbohm stood in for Ruehe in Bonn and held a  separate discussion with Grachev on 12 May.    Yeltsin demanded "access to all European organizations" and  to the international trade forum, GATT, for Russia. People  should not forget that "we are a European country." Kohl  promised he would work to allow Russia to take part in the world  economic summit of the seven major industrial nations (G7)  without any restrictions in the future. He said that this could  not be expected for Naples in July where Russia would only take  part in the political talks. However, the desire for Russia to  cope with the transition problems made it necessary for the G7  to allow Russia, in the foreseeable future, to take part in  economic discussions: "Developments are tending to go in this  direction." Yeltsin and Kohl described Russia and Germany as  the most important mutual partners in Europe.    Kohl confirmed Germany's interest in Russia developing into  a  democratic, economically stable country: "Within the scope of  our possibilities, we will support Russia in word and deed  wherever Russia considers this desirable." According to the  chancellor, this holds true for its inclusion in the work of the  World Bank, the IMF, and the EU. "We are betting on and fully  support President Yeltsin's reform effort." Russia's full  membership in the EU "is not of current interest." First of all,  we must energetically "pursue association." Yeltsin voiced the  hope that within a month, agreement could be reached with  Brussels on quotas and access to the market. Being a European  country, Russia should also be a member of the Council of  Europe, he said.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) and his  counterpart,  Aleksandr Shokhin, agreed on an order worth 500 million German  marks for the German railroad wagon company, Deutsche Waggonbau,  in Halle this year. To guarantee this project financially,  Germany will again grant special conditions. In 1995, smaller  orders will follow. This cooperation is intended to lead to the  joint development of Russian railroad wagon capacities.    The German and Russian government members said relations  between the two countries were free from burdens and troubles.  A commission of historians was instituted which will begin, at  the end of June at the latest, to utilize the sources that have  now become accessible for evaluation of recent history. By the  middle of June, the next meeting of the German-Russian  commission on the return of artistic items, which so far has  been unsuccessful, will take place. Kohl insisted that the  cultural agreement should form the legal basis for the return of  such items. Now "concrete results" must be achieved: "Several  problems have yet to be clarified." Yeltsin said that he and  Kohl would agree on a schedule for further commission meetings  before the end of this year. The negotiations on the opening of  a consulate-general in Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) have not made  progress.    Yeltsin linked his wish for Russia's participation in the  world economic summits with Moscow's cooperation within the  Partnership for Peace and said that both were elements of "the  all-round integration processes of Russia for the preservation  of peace and security." Russia's "great role" must be taken  into account, he said. In return, Russia supported Germany "as  a worthy candidate" for a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council. Because Germany was the second largest country in  Europe after Russia, the close relations with Bonn were making  it easier for Moscow to find a place in Europe's security  system, said Yeltsin. "However, without a special protocol, we  cannot sign the document on Partnership for Peace, with which we  basically agree." Yeltsin said that what had to be considered  as distinctive was the fact that Russia has an Army of 3 million  men and equipment that is not in accordance with NATO standards.  "Russia will start work with NATO in May to formulate the  protocol." Yeltsin said: "Following the signing of the  protocol -- and I do not think there will be any major problems  -- Russia will also sign the Partnership for Peace document."    Yeltsin was satisfied that following the differences over  the  farewell ceremonies for the Russian troops, Kohl "has seen the  mood of the people and their president." Referring to the  military's annoyance with the original plan for a civilian  ceremony in Weimar, Yeltsin said: "One cannot proceed in such a  way that the situation in Russia is destabilized." "Therefore,  the federal chancellor quickly agreed to hold the ceremony in  Berlin, but without the allies." Kohl said it was his "wish to  see off the soldiers in a dignified and respectful manner and in  a friendly spirit." He added that he and Yeltsin would  "personally deal" with the details of the "entire ceremony in  Berlin, in order to meet our responsibilities."    Kohl indicated that he would like to see Russia bring its  influence to bear on the Serbs, and said that both sides were in  agreement that a solution for Bosnia was urgent. Yeltsin  reiterated his suggestion of a "summit meeting" in Moscow of  Russia, the United States, the Eu, and the parties involved in  the Bosnian war: "However, at first we must be sure that the  problem will be solved." That is why the meeting must be well  prepared: "The foreign ministers have started work." He said  that nationalism had also provoked wars in some CIS republics of  the former Soviet Union: "We in Russia have shed no blood for  such reasons." Yeltsin said he was not afraid of Zhirinovskiy  and his nationalists: "No, no, we are not afraid of him; he has  no substance." Yeltsin added: "Russia, which suffered in the  war from 1941 to 1945, knows what nationalism means."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A final rule will not be published prior to the April 1, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date in the Leland Act. The Department has made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions on requests for a delay of the effective date based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the policy set out in the previous notifications to the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reflected in the following paragraphs of this section of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble. Comments on the proposed policy are welcomed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the previous paragraph, a State agency which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes it meets the above criteria for a delay of the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date was instructed to submit its request to FNS by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 31, 1993 to allow for adequate time for FNS to review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the request prior to the April 1, 1994 effective date. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department required that the request contain the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Documentation showing that the State legislature meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only biennially;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Documentation showing that the State legislature does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not meet in calendar year 1994;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Certification by the State's chief legal officer, along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any supporting documentation, that there is no mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the State constitution and laws for appropriating funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the next regular legislative session;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Information as to when the next regular legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> session is scheduled to start and, if available, is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issue of whether a State's laws permit the appropriation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds prior to the next regular legislative session is a legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question. State agencies must provide supporting documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where appropriate such as specific provisions of law dealing with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the State legislature is scheduled to meet in a regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> session, and with the appropriation process. The wording of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leland Act essentially requires State agencies to provide proof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that something does not exist_that no mechanism for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriating funds prior to the next regular legislative session  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists under the State's constitution and laws. However, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be too burdensome for FNS to require that a State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide FNS a complete set of its laws as proof that no such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in all cases, FNS needs some assurance that a thorough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accurate review of State law has been made. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department proposes that a signed statement from the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chief legal officer_the Attorney General or equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official_certifying that no such mechanism exists with brief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting documentation, if any, should suffice in most cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes it is appropriate and necessary for State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to provide such a certification regarding the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

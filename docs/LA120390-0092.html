			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOCCER REMAINS A CONSTANT IN HIS LIFE;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL: KATELLA'S ORIZABA HAS FOUND A HOME ON THE FIELD DESPITE SEVERAL  CHANGES OFF IT.  </P> <P> Armando Orizaba waited to hear his name. . . . and waited.  </P> <P> It was last spring during Spanish class at Katella High School, and the 1990  All-Empire League soccer team was being announced over the public-address  system. Orizaba felt his name would be called, but because the Knights had  finished fifth in league play, he wasn't expecting much.  </P> <P> "I thought maybe I would get first team," Orizaba said. "When all the teams had  been announced, my name had not been mentioned. I figured maybe next year."  </P> <P> Orizaba figured too soon. In another moment, his classmates were applauding,  patting him on the back and congratulating him on being named the league's most  valuable player.  </P> <P> It was a heady experience for Orizaba, whose childhood involved a good deal of  adjustment.  </P> <P> He was born in Mexico, but at the age of 6, he came with his family to the  United States, where he struggled to learn English and learned not to struggle  with gangs.  </P> <P> To avoid the wrong people, Orizaba played soccer, which he learned from his  father.  </P> <P> Now a senior, Orizaba already has had a successful high school career and is  looking at a future that includes college, soccer and, maybe, another Empire  League MVP award.  </P> <P> "Soccer is my life," said Orizaba, who is 5 feet 5, 140 pounds. "I want to play  in college and, if possible, I want to be a professional."  </P> <P> Given Orizaba's ability, those might be more than idle dreams.  </P> <P> In his first three seasons on the varsity, Orizaba scored 32 goals. He scored  16 last season even though he was constantly defended by two or more players.  Because the Knights were inexperienced, most opposing teams concentrated on  Orizaba, who had been a first-team all-league selection as a sophomore. But he  still was able to create opportunities.  </P> <P> Orizaba also is adept at scoring on direct kicks. He scored on six last season,  including the game-winner against Baldwin Park in the final of the Brea-Olinda  tournament.  </P> <P> "Most teams are lucky to score three or four goals on direct kicks, and Armando  had six," Katella Coach Ray Smith said. "He's an exceptional player."  </P> <P> Orizaba was born into soccer. His father, Armando Sr., and his five uncles  played for club teams in Mexico City.  </P> <P> Armando Sr. even tried out for America, a professional team in Mexico City, and  survived until the final cut. Five months later, he brought his family to Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> The change was tough for Armando Jr., who did not know English. Along with the  language problems, he was wary of his neighborhood, which he said was plagued  by gang activity.  </P> <P> "It was a bad area, but I tried to stay away from the people who were trouble,"  Orizaba said. "I really didn't have any problems, but you never knew in that  area."  </P> <P> Soccer was the one thing that made him feel comfortable. His father played  sweeper -- a defensive position -- for several club teams during the following  years. Every weekend, the family would watch.  </P> <P> "It was big family outing," Orizaba said. "I remember the time when they beat  this team from New York on penalty kicks. He played great that day."  </P> <P> Orizaba also was developing into a good player. He played in youth soccer  leagues in the Santa Ana area until he was 11, when he joined a club team for  players 18 and younger.  </P> <P> Orizaba received constant coaching from his father, which helped him develop  faster. After every game, Armando Sr. would give his son advice.  </P> <P> "My dad always joked with me that the day I could take him one-on-one, he would  quit soccer," Orizaba said. "It was always fun to play with him. We'd go to the  park and he'd defend against me."  </P> <P> Orizaba developed into a skilled offensive player. Although he was much smaller  than other players, he had good instincts and quickness, which made him  difficult to defend.  </P> <P> In fact, he became so good that by the time he was 13, he was playing on a club  team with his father and uncles.  </P> <P> "Armando has been playing against older players since he was very young," Smith  said. "That has made him a much better player. He's far more advanced than the  average high school player."  </P> <P> Still, Orizaba was going to give up the sport in 1987.  </P> <P> During that fall, his parents got jobs working for a shirt manufacturer in  Anaheim and moved the family to a neighborhood near Katella. Orizaba, who had  been attending Santa Ana Valley High School, was faced with another change.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, Smith put Orizaba on the varsity, where he felt more  isolated and intimidated.  </P> <P> "Everyone seemed so big," said Orizaba, who says he was 5-3 at the time. "I  didn't have any friends on the team at first. It was hard."  </P> <P> Orizaba didn't enjoy the sport any more and was uninterested in practice. His  grades also began to suffer.  </P> <P> What turned him around was Smith.  </P> <P> "I knew Armando wasn't happy," Smith said. "The older guys liked him, but they  used to tease him a lot. Armando kept asking me to put him on the frosh/soph  team.  </P> <P> "I was worried that he would fall in with the wrong people without soccer. I  knew it would be better to keep on the varsity, where I could help him more. I  told him we needed him to win the championship."  </P> <P> The Knights did win the 1988 league title, their first since 1982. Orizaba  scored two goals as a freshman.  </P> <P> After the season, Smith and Orizaba discussed what his goals should be for the  the rest of his high school career. Smith also worked out a class schedule that  included plenty of college prep classes.  </P> <P> "Coach Smith saved me," Orizaba said. "He's more than a coach; he's a good  friend."  </P> <P> Orizaba is finally at home and adjusted. He has even wandered outside the area  of soccer. This year he was the placekicker for the Katella football team.  </P> <P> "It's the first time in 20 years that I went after a student to play football,"  Katella Coach Larry Anderson said.  </P> <P> Orizaba made five of six field goals and 18 of 19 extra points. Both his misses  were the result of blocks.  </P> <P> He set a school record for longest field goal with a 48-yarder against Western  and earned a spot on the all-league team.  </P> <P> But the highlight of the season for Orizaba was his lone tackle.  </P> <P> "It was against El Dorado, and this guy breaks a kickoff up the sideline,"  Anderson said. "Armando was the last guy, and he made the play. Not only that,  but he got a mark on his helmet. The rest of the season, he would come up to me  and show me that mark. He was really proud of it."  </P> <P> Football was fun, but soccer remains Orizaba's love. He has received letters  from a few colleges, including UCLA.  </P> <P> If he doesn't get a scholarship to a four-year school, Orizaba said he would  play at a community college.  </P> <P> "I know I'm going to play somewhere," Orizaba said. "But right now I'm only  concerned about this season. I want to win the league championship."  </P> <P> And another MVP award will likely follow.  </P> <P> 1990 BOYS' SOCCER PREVIEW  </P> <P> Top teams: 1. Santa Ana, 2. Ocean View, 3. Orange, 4.

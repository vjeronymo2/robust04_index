This was announced by Zhirinovskiy after a  meeting with former U.S. President Richard Nixon which lasted  for about an hour and a half.    According to Zhirinovskiy, the former U.S. President "has  the  right understanding of the situation in the world and of our  problems."    "The main point that I wanted to make known to U.S.  President  Bill Clinton is that he must not be afraid of me," Zhirinovskiy  emphasized. He said Russia was moving towards a military regime  and the danger stemmed from those who had lost the elections,  from the so-called radical democrats.    Commenting on the chances of candidates running for  presidential elections "which may take place earlier than within  two years," Zhirinovskiy said his only real contender was former  Russian vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy. According to the LDP  leader, neither Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, nor Moscow Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov, neither Gaydar, Yavlinskiy and Shakhray, nor  candidates from "the Communist, pro-communist or patriotic  forces" could be his contenders.    Richard Nixon's advisor, Dmitri Simes, told the news  conference that Zhirinovskiy had told Nixon that Yeltsin was  "losing his influence." According to Symes, Nixon gave neither  personal comments nor assessments during their conversation.    Asked whether Nixon changed his opinion of Zhirinovskiy  after  their meeting, Simes said that Nixon had been "informed that Mr.  Zhirinovskiy could perform in different genres and in different  situations. I am confident that the way Mr. Zhirinovskiy spoke  today made due impression on President Nixon and he could place  it in a certain context, since he knew both the speeches and  political history of Mr. Zhirinovskiy."    Shortly after his meeting with Zhirinovskiy, Nixon received  the leader of the Democratic Party of Russia faction in the  State Duma, Nikolay Travkin. Their meeting lasted for 1 hour 20  minutes.    In an interview with Interfax, Travkin said the conversation  mainly focused on economic issues and prospects for equal  partnership between Russia and the U.S. According to Travkin,  he told Nixon that Russia would "not fall into coups and civil  wars," because Russia had everything needed to avoid it. The  only thing "lacking is political will, that of the president in  the first place. You seem the only optimist here," concluded  Nixon.</p>

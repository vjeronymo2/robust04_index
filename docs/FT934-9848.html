			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Accountants offer to fill tax returns by phone A SMALL Luton-based firm of chartered accountants has created a national network to process personal tax returns by telephone. Fryer &amp; Co has created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Direct Line Tax Service, which will offer to complete callers' annual tax returns for a fee of Pounds 150. It has no connection with Direct Line, the telephone insurance service owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. The move represents a shift towards the widespread use of tax consultants and high street advice centres such as H and R Block in the US. It comes when the Inland Revenue is planning a shift by 1996 towards self-assessment, which will require individuals to calculate how much tax they should pay and send a cheque with their annual return. Mr Ganesh Aiyer, a partner with Fryer &amp; Co, said 100 people had used the service since it opened at the start of November. He estimated he would have 2,000 customers by the end of the tax year in March. He said he could ultimately have a total capacity of 200,000 tax returns a year 'if the market is there', and that he was considering opening a series of high street tax shops. Direct Line Tax Service at present has four staff with plans to expand to 20. It uses a nationwide telephone number that charges calls at local rates. Mr Aiyer said the typical call would last 30 minutes. Mr Malcolm Gammie, president of the Institute of Taxation and a partner with lawyers Linklater &amp; Paine, said: 'Developments of this type of service will be a feature of the next few years.' Mr Peter Wyman, chairman of the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England, dismissed suggestions that the service would present a threat to existing accountancy firms.</p>

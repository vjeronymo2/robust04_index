			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> AID FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD  </P> <P> Pasadena Planned Parenthood will receive $50,000 from the city to help continue  its operations, which suffered a cut of $114,000 in state funds after Gov.  George Deukmejian lowered the state family planning budget by two-thirds.  </P> <P> The city money will be paid over two years. The board directed its Sacramento  legislative advocate to lobby for restoration of state funding so the money can  be repaid to the city.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood was one of three social service agencies with budget  shortfalls to receive special allocations. Day One, an anti-drug abuse program,  and the Armory Center for the Visual Arts were the others.  </P></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Monopolies body looks at condom market THE Pounds 45m a year condom market is to be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said changes in the market meant price controls introduced after an earlier MMC inquiry in 1982 needed to be reviewed. The supply of contraceptive sheaths in the UK is dominated by LRC Products, part of the London International Group, which has about 75 per cent of the market with its Durex brand. Mates - originally owned by the Virgin Group but sold three years ago to the Australian Ansell Corporation - is the second largest with about 20 per cent of the market. When the MMC last looked at the market it concluded that LRC's monopoly position with 90 per cent to 95 per cent of the market operated against the public interest and that its prices might be expected to become excessive. LRC gave undertakings to the Office of Fair Trading that it would limit growth in its average realised price (total UK turnover divided by total UK volume) to below 1.5 per cent below an index of costs close to the retail prices index. Sir Bryan said yesterday: 'Although the price control arrangements have restrained the rate of increase of average realised prices, I believe the market has changed and the price control arrangements now need to be reviewed.' He added he would be particularly interested in the MMC's views on the price control mechanism and whether it had damaged the prospect of successful competition from Mates and other suppliers. LIG yesterday welcomed the MMC reference. It said the business affected represented about Pounds 20m of sales, at wholesale prices, 5 per cent of group turnover. LIG's shares fell on the news but recovered to close unchanged at 220p. The company agreed circumstances had changed since 1983, citing the arrival of Mates as a strong competitor in the market and the Aids problem. LIG, which is a leading maker of condoms worldwide, said the UK was the only market where it faced price controls. With LIG as market leader competitors cannot charge more for their products. LIG is likely to argue to the MMC that price controls hinder competition, deterring competitors from entering the market. It may also argue that consumers are thought to put safety and reliability above price when making purchasing decisions. The commission has been given nine months to report. The MMC yesterday took the unusual step of issuing a statement to correct press reports that it has already reached conclusions on its investigation into the supply of national newspapers. The commission said it still hoped to report by the end of July.</p>

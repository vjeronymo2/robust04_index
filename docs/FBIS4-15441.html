			<p>BFN     [Text] The dialogue with Russia recently came to a halt and  all messages sent to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin remain without  reply, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told a news  conference today, describing relations between Lithuania and  Russia.    He criticized yesterday's statement by Boris Yeltsin on  Russia's military bases on the territory of other states.  Russia has started an aggressive economic policy toward the  Baltic states. The Lithuanian prime minister cited as an  example a 15 April decision to increase customs duties. Russia  is introducing strict limitations on the import of some goods.  Therefore, Adolfas Slezevicius said, we will be compelled to  discuss and adopt reciprocal measures.    Negotiations with Belarus on the delimitation of borders are  also at a standstill. The Lithuanian prime minister links this  with the political situation in Belarus. Sea borders with  Latvia have been agreed in principle, and coordination at  parliament level between the two countries is now taking place.  Describing the situation, the prime minister noted that the  establishment of sea borders both with Russia and with Latvia  will not be to Lithuania's advantage, but such is the  geographical situation of our republic.    The prime minister announced his forthcoming visit to Kuwait  this coming weekend. Two agreements are to be signed there --  on the protection of investments, and a document on a $50  million credit. A plan for using these funds already exists.  Adolfas Slezevicius called the small state of Kuwait one of the  largest donors in the financial world. If our first experience  of cooperation is successful, it is possible that we will  arrange a permanent credit line.    Describing documents adopted at a government meting on  Wednesday, the prime minister noted a decision which regulates  the mechanism of declaring especially expensive property items.  A decision was also adopted to double the taxation on wholesale  imports of alcohol to Lithuania. If in the past a wholesale  trade license cost 150,000 litas, now it will cost 300,000.</p>

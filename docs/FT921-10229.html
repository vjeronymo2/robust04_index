			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: KLM narrows losses to Fl 8.6m KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has substantially narrowed third-quarter losses, thanks to the combined influence of a higher load factor, lower fuel costs and improved productivity by its workforce. The Dutch national carrier said net losses in the quarter, ended December, 1991, fell to just Fl 8.6m (Dollars 4.8m) from Fl 213.9m a year earlier. Nine-month results showed a net profit of Fl 319.8m against a loss of Fl 129.8m in the same period of 1990/91. 'Taking the highly loss-making winter season in the air transport industry into account, we maintain our expectation to end-1991-92 with a modestly positive result,' the airline said. KLM, which is 38 per cent state-owned, gave no indication of whether it would restore dividend payments on this year's results, nor did it comment on the progress of partnership talks with British Airways. KLM was forced to omit its 1990-91 dividend after falling into heavy losses caused partly by provisions to cover a cost-cutting and reorganisation programme. In the most recent quarter, KLM's revenues rose by 21 per cent to Fl 1.99bn, outstripping an 8 per cent increase in costs to Fl 1.88bn. Both revenues and costs were boosted by 6 percentage points by the first-time consolidation of the charter airline Transavia. KLM's load factor, excluding the group's charter airline subsidiaries, rose to 71.7 per cent from 70.9 per cent a year earlier. At the same time, fuel costs fell by more than 20 per cent and productivity improved by 9 per cent. At the operating level, results swung into a profit of Fl 114.5m from a loss of Fl 99.3m a year earlier. However, overall results slipped into the red because of higher financing costs and because of KLM's share in losses generated by airlines such as Northwest of the US, in which it holds a minority stake. The quarterly figures also include extraordinary gains of Fl 30.6m.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo seeks to clarify options Five senior executives at the oil company, Lasmo, were granted options worth Pounds 590,000 the day before the Takeover Panel told rival explorer, Enterprise Oil, to clarify its bid intentions. Lasmo said yesterday the options had been planned long before bid speculation fuelled the recent sharp rise in the company's shares. The options would normally have been granted immediately after the annual results, on March 25, but had been delayed due to plans for the subsequent Pounds 219m rights issue. The executives were informed at the beginning of April that they would be granted options at the closing price on April 25. Some 401,991 options were granted to three board directors and two senior executives at 147p. Of the directors, Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, received 108,870; Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer, 61,530; and Mr Richard Smernoff, finance director, 100,000. Mr C Dawson, personnel manager, was granted 56,591 and Mr J Wedgwood, group secretary, received 75,000.</p>

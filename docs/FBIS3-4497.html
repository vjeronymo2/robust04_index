The province, with easy access to the sea through its  borders  with Russia and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea, is  now quickening its building of four routes leading to the  outside world.    The four routes, mainly railways and expressways, will link  up with China's two railways leading to Russia and Korea and  extended to port cities of Russia and Korea.    The province is also renovating its two airports and  increasing domestic and international flights and routes. So  far four air routes have been opened with irregular flights from  Changchun to Hong Kong and to cities of Russia, Japan, and the  Republic of Korea.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Banking on the new South Africa - Capital &amp; Credit During the dark days of apartheid, South Africa was shunned in the international capital markets. But with an all-race, democratically-elected government expected after this week's election, investment bankers are falling over each other to win business from South African borrowers. South Africans - including the Republic of South Africa, the Electricity Supply Commission, and the Department of Posts and Telecommunications - tapped the international capital markets with bonds issues in the first half of the 1980s. However, thoughts of new international borrowing disappeared as the country was forced to institute a debt standstill in 1985, after international institutions refused to roll over outstanding short-term loans. A final rescheduling agreement on all affected debt was negotiated last year. Competition is fierce among international investment banks to be appointed adviser to the new government. A report by Salomon Brothers concluded that on economic terms, the country 'should be placed squarely in the mid-investment grade category', although it cautions that the political risk factor might lower the rating. After the release of Mr Nelson Mandela in 1990, a handful of South African names successfully returned to the market, launching D-Mark-denominated international bond issues. The Republic of South Africa's DM400m five-year issue - launched by Deutsche Bank in September 1991 with a coupon of 10.5 per cent - yielded 175 basis points over the German government bond. Swiss Bank Corporation says the yield spread over German bunds has widened, from 243 basis points in mid-March to 321 basis points on April 21 1994. The moves reflect international investor concern over the political risk. The question now is whether the Republic of South Africa will tap the international bond market after the election. As yet, there is little indication of a desire to increase international borrowing significantly. The hesitancy is due to the continuing depreciation of the rand, which makes foreign currency commitments expensive, and the desire of the National Party and the African National Congress, the two parties likely to dominate the new government, to limit total debt burden. 'It would be foolish for South Africa to borrow for the sake of borrowing,' warns Mr Edward Osborne, chief economist at Nedbank. This sentiment is shared by ANC economics head Mr Trevor Manuel, who says South Africa should be 'extremely cautious' before trying to borrow more money abroad - although a portion of the ANC's proposed reconstruction bonds to fund black development projects will probably be floated abroad. Caution is also likely to be the watchword for non-government bond issuers. Escom, the state electricity company, may try a new Eurobond issue, but other companies are unlikely to follow close behind. For the moment, therefore, most analysts expect the focus to remain on the domestic market. Big bond issuers are the government and parastatals, such as Escom and Transnet, the transport, rail and ports authority. Some local companies have also dipped into the market, most notably blue-chip industrial South African Breweries. The bond market is capitalised at around R200bn and has an average monthly turnover of R63bn. There is substantial foreign ownership, and non-residents hold an estimated R40bn in South African capital market stock. These non-resident investors have tended to be Swiss or German, but bankers say some started to take profits last year. The new wave of foreign investment has largely come from the US. The most actively-traded bonds are government stock and Escom, with the two benchmarks being the R150 and the E168. The latter, in particular, is popular with foreigners, particularly continental Europeans, who hold almost half the outstanding Escom bonds. However, the markets are volatile and sensitive to domestic political factors. After heavy buying for much of last year, fears about election prospects meant that between February and mid-April foreigners were net sellers of gilts, helping push long bond rates from a low of 11.62 per cent to a high of 13.39 per cent. Over the past two weeks, however, they have returned, and yields have dipped below 13 per cent. The attractions for foreigners are twofold. First, interest rates are high. Second, the country's two-tier currency means the rate of return for foreign investors is significantly higher than for locals. Non-residents are allowed to buy bonds at the financial rand exchange rate but get returns paid at the commercial rand exchange rate. With the current discount between the two currencies around 25 per cent, this means a significantly higher yield for foreigners.</p>

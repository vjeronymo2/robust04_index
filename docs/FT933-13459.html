			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Emerging markets When the head of Morgan Stanley Asset Management is pictured in a scary bear costume on the front of a US business magazine, it is clear some investors are getting worried. With the exception of Japan, most of the world's mature stock markets have been lacklustre performers this year, though some European bourses have been a little perkier recently. Worries over a secular downtrend have spurred a renewed interest in emerging markets. In Latin America and the Pacific rim, in particular, economic growth rates remain strong. Moreover, these regions seem likely to increase their slice of global GDP significantly by the end of the decade. Fund managers are beginning to juggle their portfolios to reflect the new reality. Those stock markets showing the best returns in dollar terms in the first half of 1993 were: Turkey, up 129 per cent; Brazil, up 55 per cent; and Jordan, up 39 per cent. Still, it would not do to give up on the old world just yet. There is a touch of tulip bulb fever about the rise of some emerging markets. Their low liquidity accentuates their volatility and limits opportunities for investment on any scale. Nomura Investment Trust alone has some Dollars 360bn of funds under management, worth more than the capitalisation of the entire Paris bourse. Such funds have little option but to keep the vast bulk in secure markets in the developed world, where privatisation is likely to place increasing demands on them.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Consumers slow to put their hands in pockets: Louise Kehoe and Alan Cane report on the personal communicators market The vision of a multi-billion dollar market for pocket-sized 'personal communicators' that fired excitement throughout the computer industry a year ago has turned out to be a mirage. Among the companies that hoped to profit from the anticipated emergence of this new category of electronic product - handheld devices that combine some of the functions of a personal computer with those of a mobile telephone, pager or fax machine - there is now a consensus that it will be several years before sales take off. Disenchantment began to set in when Apple Computer's much heralded 'Newton', launched 12 months ago, failed to achieve its sales targets. Mr John Sculley, former Apple chairman, has been widely blamed for setting unrealistic expectations for the performance of what he called 'personal digital assistants'. Although Apple has not released sales figures since last December, fewer than 100,000 Newtons have been sold, according to analysts' estimates - a far cry from the millions that Apple had hoped for. Apple, however, is not alone in disappointing its customers and investors. Eo, a Silicon Valley venture that introduced its personal communicator last year, recently closed its doors after AT&amp;T, its biggest investor, refused additional funding. Last week Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company and the leading supplier of microprocessor chips for personal computers, ended a joint effort with VLSI Technology, another Silicon Valley semiconductor company, to develop chips for personal communicators. 'The market for handheld devices has developed more slowly and with dramatically lower volumes than the industry originally anticipated,' said Mr Donald Maulsby, VSLI vice-president. The company will cut its research and development spending on chips for personal communicators and Intel plans to sell its 15 per cent equity stake in VLSI (plus warrants to acquire an additional 7.5 per cent). Amid growing scepticism about the near-term prospects for personal communicators, the introduction of an IBM product called 'Simon' - a handheld cellular telephone-cum-computer - is behind schedule. IBM's plans to launch similar 'smart telephones' bearing its name are also believed to be on hold. Similarly, Compaq Computer has delayed indefinitely the introduction of its personal communicator and Motorola, the leading manufacturer of cellular telephones, has postponed shipment of its 'Envoy' personal wireless communicator until the end of the year for 'additional testing'. Despite the setbacks, most industry executives believe that eventually personal communicators will become a mass market product, but not in the near term. Mr David Potter, founder and chairman of the UK company Psion which makes a pocket communicator, is angered that the relative failure of Newton reflects badly on other handheld gadget manufacturers. He pointed out that Psion had been successful with a handheld computer which communicates via a Motorola radio system. Amstrad, the UK consumer electronics company, claimed to be the first to launch a personal digital assistant with its pen-based handheld computer in early 1993. Amstrad's PDA600 has consistently outsold the more expensive Newton in the UK, although numbers for both are small. In December, sales of Amstrad's PDA600s were about 1,800, against about 600 Newtons. Makers of the first generation of personal communicators were too ambitious, it now appears, in promising 'anytime, anywhere' voice and data communications services via today's cellular telephone networks. Yet advances in 'wireless' mobile communications are on the horizon. Nextel, for example, plans to build a North American mobile communications system that combines voice, paging and data messaging systems. And a week ago several companies and investment groups paid the US government a total of Dollars 833m (Pounds 537m) for radio spectrum rights assigned to advanced two-way paging systems. These are expected to enable users to send and receive short messages. Such services may be available within five years, according to analysts. In December, the US Federal Communications Commission is set to hold another airwaves auction for licences to operate 'pocket communication service' networks. PCS is expected to expand on today's cellular telephone services by adding data communications and perhaps even limited video capabilities to conventional voice transmission. However, the new networks may cost billions of dollars and take several years to build. That should give the computer industry plenty of time to overcome the shortcomings of the first generation of personal communicators. But it also suggests that manufacturers have a long time to wait before their dreams of a huge new market come true.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] St. Petersburg, 18 Apr (TASS) -- [passage  omitted] "The St. Petersburg meeting is a major and important  event. The fact itself that 4,000 to 5,000 business people will  arrive here to participate in the annual meeting of the EBRD  [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] is of a great  importance both for the city and for Russia. Seminars and  events organized by different countries, and other contacts  should promote mutual understanding and business opportunities.  I hope that after this week in St. Petersburg, the bank will  gain the very strong support of all its members", said EBRD  chairman Jacques de Larosiere on the eve of the meeting in an  exclusive ITAR-TASS interview.</p>

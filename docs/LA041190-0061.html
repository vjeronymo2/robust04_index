			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Willie Brown strikes again, exhibiting his contempt for the voters of  California. His comments in your article on the initiative process speaks to  that point.  </P> <P> For years, the Legislature, under his leadership, either failed to act or  passed wimpy legislation in the areas of insurance reform, campaign financing,  ethics, anti-smoking and environmental issues. At the same time, Willie and his  gang had very little problem taking money from any special-interest group that  could pay their price to pass laws suited to their fancy.  </P> <P> What will it take to convince Willie Brown and company that they work for and  are paid by the people of California and not industry trade associations?  </P> <P> What Brown doesn't understand is that a Constitution and initiative process  exist so that the people will be heard when elected officials refuse to listen  and act. It shocks me to think that deep down, the Speaker's only concern is  concentrating and maintaining absolute power over the legislative process, the  people be damned. The arrogance alone should be reason for expulsion from  public office.  </P> <P> BRUCE A. BRAUN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

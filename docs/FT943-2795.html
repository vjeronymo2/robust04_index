			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Japan savings bank in Pounds 9bn exchange loss Japan's postal ministry, custodian of the world's largest savings bank, has revealed foreign exchange losses of at least Y1,374bn (Pounds 9bn) caused by the rise in the Japanese currency. The shortfall, on the yen value of overseas bonds and shares bought by the postal savings bank and the postal life insurance up to the end of March, is unlikely to be turned into a cash loss because both institutions are long-term investors, over 15 to 20 years, say officials. By that time, they hope the yen will have weakened enough against the foreign currencies involved, mainly US and Canadian dollars and sterling, to yield a profit. Yet the speed at which the postal institutions' foreign currency losses have risen, by 36 per cent in the year to last March, has worsened the postal ministry's poor relations with the finance ministry. Postal officials are unhappy over being informally asked by the finance ministry to avoid selling foreign equities to help government efforts to curb the yen's rise. They have lobbied the finance ministry for permission to use derivatives to hedge foreign exchange exposure, but financial officials do not want state institutions to be seen using such instruments, blamed for creating volatility in Tokyo's capital markets. The yen's continued rise, from an average of Y107.8 to the dollar in March, when the postal funds closed their books, to around Y99 yesterday, suggests that losses on the yen value of foreign securities will have grown since then. Of the total deficit, Y910bn is attributable to the postal life insurer's Y4,222bn foreign exchange holdings, while the remaining Y464.2bn is from the postal savings bank's Y2,354bn foreign holdings. Postal fund managers will reduce purchases of foreign securities this year, said a postal life insurance official yesterday. 'We are now very very cautious about buying foreign holdings,' he said. Until now, the postal ministry has increased purchases of US and Canadian securities whenever private sector investors have sold the same paper, according to Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. 'At times, they provided, intentionally or otherwise, back-up for the Bank of Japan's foreign exchange information,' he wrote in NRI's latest monthly guide to Japanese investment. He expects the ministry's new caution to spread to other Japanese investors. The rise in the postal institutions' foreign exchange losses is unsurprising, since they bought overseas securities heavily in early 1993, when it looked as if the yen might stabilise at around Y120 to the dollar, said Mr Robert Feldman, director of economic research at Salomon Brothers Asia. However, in the long run, the postal institutions could well end up with a profit on their foreign holdings, he predicted.</p>

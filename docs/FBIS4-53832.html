			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon)  strongly urged the U.S. President to abandon the U.S. commitment  to providing its nuclear umbrella for South Korea and, at the  same time, to take measures to withdraw more than 1,000 pieces  of nuclear weapons from South Korea without delay and promptly  check the criminal nuclear arms development of the South Korean  authorities, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation  reported.    In a protest message to the U.S. President May 17 it charged  that the "White House" has been conniving at the nuclear arms  development in South Korea which has been stepped up under the  U.S. nuclear umbrella.    The message noted that spent nuclear fuel can be replaced  any  moment for the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) in Wolsong  and the multi-purpose research reactor at the Taedok complex in  South Korea while they are operating, that the 678,700 kilowatt  PHWR in Wolsong has yielded spent nuclear fuel including  plutonium enough to make more than 370 nuclear warheads up until  now and that the 30,000 kilowatt multi-purpose research reactor  in Taedok is one for nuclear development which is producing  plutonium more quickly than the PHWR.    While taking issue with the North over its 5 megawatt  experimental development reactor, the United States has not  called into question the Wolsong PHWR and Taedok multi-purpose  research reactor which put out plutonium several ten times  greater than that, the message said.    Calling attention to the fact that South Korea and Japan  have  maintained close relations of technical cooperation for their  own nuclear armament under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, it  stressed: Far from checking this dangerous conspiracy and tieup,  the United States put up South Korea and Japan as shock brigades  in the nuclear racket against the North, thus creating a grave  nuclear threat not only on the Korean peninsula but in the rest  of Asia.</p>

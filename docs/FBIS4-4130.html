			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At a provincial discussion on family planning  work, held on 16 April, Governor Tian Chengping, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out: The  population problem is a social, as well as an economic problem.  He added: Pursuing the population and family planning  goal-directed responsibility system is a key measure for  ensuring that principal party and government leaders grasp  family planning work in person, and that they are wholly  responsible for this work. Practice over the past years has  shown that such measures have played an important role in  enhancing the sense of responsibility of leaders at all levels  for family planning work, enabling them to grasp two kinds of  production simultaneously, and exercising control over  population growth. [passage omitted]    Tian Chengping emphasized: The focal point and difficulties  facing family planning work in our province lie in rural and  pastoral areas. From now on, we must gradually change the  previous practice of relying on administrative order, taking  remedial measures, and carrying out shock work to promote family  planning. We must guide and help the masses to take the road of  linking family planning with developing the rural commodity  economy, working hard to become rich and advance toward  small-scale prosperity, and establishing civilized and happy  families. Party and government leaders at all levels must make  great efforts to establish a service network for family  planning, and to do practical work for the family planning  drive. Financial departments at all levels must increase their  investment in family planning work so as to ensure the necessary  working conditions. It is necessary to establish a family  planning work contingent in rural areas as soon as possible so  as to ensure that work at the grass-roots level is taken care of  and grasped.    Tian Chengping stressed: Family planning work is a very  difficult job of a mass nature. It is impossible to do it well  simply by relying on family planning departments. He urged  various government departments and all of society to make  concerted efforts to participate in family planning work. He  also urged fully arousing and relying on the masses to carry out  family planning work in a deep-going, meticulous, and solid  manner.</p>

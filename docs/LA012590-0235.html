			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA MODEL IN HONG KONG MIGHT BE SEEKING ASYLUM  </P> <P> One of China's top fashion models has been reported missing from a Hong Kong  hotel, fueling speculation she is seeking political asylum in the British  colony, a Hong Kong newspaper said today.  </P> <P> The Chinese-language Sing Tao Wen Pao said Zhu Bei, 22, disappeared with all  her luggage from her hotel room just before she was due to return to China on  Monday.  </P> <P> The evening paper said Zhu had been seen around town on the arm of a prominent  Hong Kong television actor during her nine-day visit to the colony to take part  in a fashion promotion.  </P> <P> It said rumors were circulating that Zhu, who came here with 12 other models  from China, had defected.  </P> <P> "We have no information about the reports and we do not comment on individual  applications for asylum," a government spokesman said.  </P> <P> Sino-Hong Kong relations are only just recovering from a furor caused when Hong  Kong allowed a Chinese swimmer, Yang Yang, to leave the colony for the United  States last October.  </P> <P> Yang claimed asylum in Hong Kong on the grounds he had played a part in the  pro-democracy movement that rocked China in May and June and that he faced  punishment if he returned.  </P></p>

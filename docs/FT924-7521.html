			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: NZ forestry group rises 12.4% CARTER Holt Harvey (CHH), New Zealand's biggest forestry group, has reported a 12.4 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 112.4m (USDollars 61m) for the first half to September 30 from NZDollars 84.9m a year earlier, in spite of bitter and prolonged strikes at four of its forest products plants. Mr David Oskin - who manages CHH for International Paper, the leading US paper manufacturer, and Brierley Investments, the New Zealand holding company, which jointly own 32 per cent of the company - said the result was also achieved in spite of increasingly competitive markets. He said that all CHH's main operating sectors traded at or above expectations and all costs relating to the strikes had been included in the figures. He did not give a profit forecast for the year, saying this depended on international commodity prices. There were some good signs, but pulp and paper prices remained a concern. Mr Oskin said that during the past six months a new management team at CHH had continued to reorientate the company into a focused and strongly positioned forestry group. This work was near completion, and beginning to be reflected in earnings. Pre-tax profits rose 63 per cent to NZDollars 79.4m from NZDollars 48.8m. Copec, the group's Chilean offshoot, contributed NZDollars 37.3m, down from NZDollars 43.3m. Sales slipped to NZDollars 1.23bn from NZDollars 1.23bn. Mr Oskin said the forestry and wood product sector was showing better results. The falling availability of North American softwoods and tropical hardwoods was becoming apparent in the Pacific area leading to higher sales of the company's pine. The 4 cents a share interim dividend compared with 6 cents. CHH delayed for the second week running an announcement on the outcome of the NZDollars 400m sale of its Sealord fisheries division. There are two bidders: a consortium of Maori interests and Brierley Investments and a group led by Royal Greenland, a Danish fishing company.</p>

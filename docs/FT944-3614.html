			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / France, US urge tougher UN stance in Bosnia France and the US yesterday redoubled their support for the UN mission in Bosnia, and suggested reinforcing it with more men and weapons, or tougher rules of engagement. The Franco-American statement was in contrast to recent suggestions by several western countries that a UN pullout may only be weeks away because of the deteriorating situation on the ground. US officials have been dubious about the effectiveness of the UN's role in Bosnia, and the suggestion that the forces there be reinforced marks a clear change in the US line. The message from Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, and Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, was issued as contingency planning for a possible UN pullout gathered pace, and four Bangladeshi peacekeepers were injured in northern Bosnia. Mr Perry said after meeting Mr Leotard in Washington that both were agreed on 'the very valuable function' the 24,000-strong UN force was discharging. The UN should consider 'not only more troops and arms but new rules of engagement.' Mr Leotard suggested heavy protection for a 'humanitarian corridor' along which convoys could travel from the Adriatic to Sarajevo. In Brussels, senior military officers yesterday began a week of intensive discussions on how precisely a UN withdrawal from Bosnia would be organised, and protected from the warring parties, with the help of Nato ground troops. Mr Perry goes to Brussels today to meet his counterparts from the 14 countries which make up Nato's military wing. France belongs to Nato's political arm but not its military structure. Nato's plan for a UN withdrawal are expected to provide for temporary deployment of up to 25,000 extra combat troops in the war zone. Another 20,000 might be involved in providing logistical support, but no more than 5,000 of these would be deployed in Bosnia itself. The US has offered to provide about half the personnel needed to organise a pullout, but Mr Perry will be under strong pressure to give more details when he meets his opposite numbers in Brussels. UK officials have warmly welcomed US willingness to help, viewing it as a sign that America wants to avoid a repeat of last month's diplomatic spat over the abrupt US withdrawal from enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia. Diplomats said the US commitment to providing cover for a withdrawal would make the US administration more likely to support a continued UN presence. Bosnian Serbs yesterday for the first time in over three weeks allowed passage of a convoy carrying 30 tonnes of fuel for UN forces in Sarajevo. But a UN spokesman said this 'tiny amount' would not be sufficient for the UN to carry out its mandate.</p>

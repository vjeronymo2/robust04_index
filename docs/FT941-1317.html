			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Manganese Bronze leaps to Pounds 1.3m Manganese Bronze Holdings, the maker of black London taxi cabs, returned interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.27m, more than double last time's Pounds 577,000, helped by a reduction in interest charges from Pounds 223,000 to Pounds 35,000. Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said: 'Our businesses have maintained a good stream of profits throughout the recession and we are feeling positive that things will get even better over the next half year.' In the six months to January 31, overall turnover was down by 3 per cent from Pounds 37.8m to Pounds 36.6m. Operating profit was up by 63 per cent to Pounds 1.31m. Steep competition and weak markets continued to mean disappointing results for the components division, LTI Homer, the fuel tank business, and Fairway Nissan, the car dealership. However, this was offset by a strong performance from the vehicles division which continued to produce 36 taxis a week. Pre-tax profits here were Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 30,000) on turnover of Pounds 25m (Pounds 22.3m). It was a poor half year for the precision castings business due to unexpected cuts in demand; also a significant fall in the price of cobalt was partly responsible for a reduced turnover from the metal powders business. Mr Borwick said that more than Pounds 2m would be invested in the Ipswich plant, which manufactures sintered automotive components. An interim dividend of 1.5p (0.5p) was declared, payable from earnings per share of 5.01p (2.19p).</p>

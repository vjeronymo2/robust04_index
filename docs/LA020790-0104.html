			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PLO ASKS GORBACHEV TO HALT JEWISH EMIGRATION  </P> <P> The PLO's parliament in exile sent a memorandum to Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev on Tuesday, urging him to halt the emigration of Soviet Jews to the  Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> "In the name of human rights, we appeal to you to take speedy measures to stop  the emigration of Soviet Jews, which represents . . . Jewish raids on our land  and homeland," the Palestine National Council said in a five-page memorandum.  </P> <P> The PNC, considered to be the legislative arm and governing body of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, was the latest in a series of Arab  organizations to express concern over increasing Soviet Jewish emigration to  Israel.  </P> <P> An estimated 40,000 to 100,000 Soviet Jews are expected to go to Israel during  the next year because of a loosening of emigration requirements by Moscow and a  decision by Washington to restrict the number of Soviet Jews moving to the  United States.  </P></p>

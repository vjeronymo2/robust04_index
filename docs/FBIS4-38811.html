			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Elchin Suleyman: "Russian Parliamentarians' </F> Visit"]    [Text] "We have to lay our brick in the foundation of  friendship between the peoples of Azerbaijan and Russia," N.  Bezborodov, member of the Russian parliamentarians' group and a  deputy chairman of the State Duma's commission on defense and  security, said at the meeting with the president of Azerbaijan.  This group, which represents the Russian Way parliamentary  faction (leader S. Baburin) has been in Azerbaijan for several  days and is conducting active work. On the eve of the meeting  with the president, the group was received by the parliament  chairman, Rasul Guliyev. The group includes members of the  clergy, the military, and agrarian economists. Thus, it is not  surprising that economic issues were raised as well. In  particular, it was said that the economic potential of our  countries is not being fully utilized and "as a result, both  countries lose." Although not too long ago convoys of "gifts of  nature" were being sent to Moscow without encountering any  particular obstacles.    The guests were also interested in the situation of Russians  in Azerbaijan; in this connection the president said that after  the disintegration of the Union certain processes affecting  people's lives have indeed began. Russia is concerned about  Russians living in other countries. "Now the Russians live in  most normal conditions," said the head of state. "If some  problems do arise in the future, we are capable of dealing with  them."    It was probably the first time that journalists heard from  the mouth of Russian politicians the thesis of the unconditional  need for withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied  territories of Azerbaijan; N. Bezborodov made this statement:  "Armenia must withdraw troops from the occupied territories."    Russian parliamentarians agree that the mass media seriously  distort the situation in the region, "do not deliver objective  information, and suppress many things." The deputies assured the  president that the detailed information they have received here  will be presented to the mass media, to the parliament, and the  government of Russia--which, actually, was one of the main  purposes of their visit to Azerbaijan.</p>

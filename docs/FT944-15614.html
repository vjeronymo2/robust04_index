			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Canada's westerners flex their muscles: Economic growth gives them voice in separatist debate An unusual event in Canadian politics took place last month when Mr Ralph Klein, Alberta's unilingual premier, appeared as the guest speaker at a chamber of commerce function in Sherbrooke, Quebec. Thousands of miles and a huge cultural divide separate the French-speaking province from the prairies and mountains of Alberta and the rest of western Canada. Many westerners resent French signs at federal government offices in Vancouver, Calgary and Winnipeg. For their part, few Quebecois have been 'out west'. Mr Klein's trip to Quebec, however, was a sign of the critical role which the four western provinces are set to play in the intensifying debate over the francophone province's future place in Canada, leading up to the independence referendum which the newly elected separatist government in Quebec plans to hold next year. The run-up to the referendum could also make or break the reputations of several of the west's most prominent politicians. The western provinces - British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba  -have for years resented the influence wielded in national affairs by Ontario and Quebec, which are by far the most economically powerful provinces. Mr David Elton, president of the Canada West Foundation, a Calgary policy research group, observes that whenever a westerner hears about a new federal initiative, 'you may not know what it is, but you know you want to be sitting down when you hear it'. However, the west's clout has grown appreciably in recent years. Bank of Nova Scotia forecasts that British Columbia's economy, bolstered by a flood of immigrants and climbing pulp, paper and metal prices, will expand by 4.8 per cent this year, the strongest growth rate among Canada's 10 provinces. Alberta, which depends heavily on oil, natural gas and wheat, is expected to come in second with a 4.5 per cent growth rate. Alberta and Saskatchewan have made more progress than most other provinces in bringing down yawning budget deficits, to the point where Alberta is on track to balance its budget in 1996. On the political front, Conservative westerners gained a new voice in last year's general election when the Reform party, which is based in Calgary, won 52 seats in the House of Commons, all but one of them west of Ontario. Reform reaffirmed its opposition to official bilingualism at a convention last weekend. It is also opposed to any special concessions for Quebec. 'People want to hear tough talk from their politicians on the Quebec issue,' says Prof David Bercuson, a political scientist at the University of Calgary. Many westerners take a more conciliatory line. Mr Elton estimates only 25-30 per cent think that if Quebecois choose to leave Canada in the forthcoming referendum, nothing should be done to stop them. The west's distance from Ottawa and its increasingly close links with east Asia and with neighbouring US states belie a strong attachment to Canada. Periodic initiatives to bring western US states and Canadian provinces together in a 'Rocky Mountain Corridor' have so far been confined to commercial links. Mr Klein, who is by far the west's most popular politician at present, has given notice that he will be a voice of moderation in the national unity debate. 'Canada may not have succeeded in everyone's eyes,' he told his audience in Sherbrooke, 'but we have not failed. Our federal system of government has allowed both Alberta and Quebec to manage our own economies, and to protect our diverse culture, language, heritage and history.' Mr Klein's closest ally in national politics is Mr Jean Charest, the 36-year old Quebecois who took over the Progressive Conservative party after its near-annihilation in last year's election. The Conservatives, who ruled Canada from 1984 to 1993, lost all but two of their seats in parliament. Mr Klein believes that only Mr Charest, who is expected to emerge in coming months as one of most effective federalist voices within Quebec, can revive Conservative fortunes. The two men have recently indicated - without putting flesh on their ideas - that they favour a middle ground between Quebec breaking away and the status quo. Mr Elton agrees that 'a creative, third option will emerge'. But the risk remains quite high that the west could hasten rather than hinder a break-up. Mr Mike Harcourt British Columbia's premier, was widely seen as playing into the separatists' hands earlier this year with remarks that while Quebecois and westerners were the best of friends, they would become the worst of enemies if Quebec decided to go its own way. The new government in Quebec has an interest in provoking further such outbursts. After only a month in office, it has already raised hackles by turning a number of relatively minor irritants into evidence of the inability of French- and English-speaking Canada to live together. It would take a handful of western politicians to rise to the PQ's bait or the Reform Party to regain its stride for Mr Klein's optimistic scenario to start unravelling. On the other hand, if the separatist threat is defused, Mr Klein and Mr Charest could emerge as the saviours of Canada.</p>

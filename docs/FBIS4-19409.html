			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Renault President Louis Schweitzer by Annie </F> Kahn; place and date not given: "I Have Great Faith in the  Shareholder's Rationality"]    [Text] Despite the drop in the automobile and heavy truck  markets in France and Europe as a whole, Renault is showing a  net profit of some 1 billion francs on a turnover of  approximately 170 billion, a drop of 8 percent. The car  manufacturer is therefore in a good position from which to look  to a recovering 1994 market. In an interview with LE MONDE,  Renault President Louis Schweitzer outlines his strategy in  terms of alliances, cooperation, and international development.  His leadership could be challenged on 31 May, date of the next  Renault board of directors meeting, or at the time of  privatization (postponed until after the presidential election).  However, he has confidence in the "rationality" of his  shareholders, who he believes will reach their decision based on  industrial rather than political considerations.    [Kahn] In 1993, Renault continued to collect nearly 700  million francs from the AMC transfer to Chrysler in 1987.  Without that special revenue, would the automobile division  still have shown a profit?    [Schweitzer] Absolutely. In contrast, the heavy truck branch  was in the red. (Ed.'s Note: Renault Industrial Vehicles (RVI)  lost 1.4 billion francs in 1993.) Furthermore, the positive  balance sheet of the firm and the auto division includes  provisions for reorganizational costs.    [Kahn] The financial result exceeds 500 million francs,  while  the figures were slightly in the red in 1992. What are the  reasons behind that recovery?    [Schweitzer] It stems from the fact that we got out of debt,  took advantage of the drop in interest rates, and made a number  of positive transfers.    [Kahn] Did the Volvo sale impact the 1993 figures?    [Schweitzer] No. The Volvo operations took place in 1994.  For  the current fiscal year, the general outcome of the partnership,  meaning the cancellation of joint participation and the sale of  Volvo's shares in RVI for 4.5 billion, will have an impact on  our own funds. The transfer of AB Volvo shares will also have an  impact on our results.    [Kahn] There was an 8-percent drop in turnover in 1993. How  is the outlook for 1994?    [Schweitzer] Orders picked up significantly during the first  quarter, although turnover will not reflect it immediately  because of the gap between the time of the order and  manufacture. Nevertheless, there is a recovery thanks to the  government's measures in France, but also targeting other  European markets. We have a feeling of having hit bottom and are  now revising our estimates upward.    [Kahn] In 1993, Renault profited from additions to its line  with the Twingo, Safrane, and Laguna. Do you not risk being at a  disadvantage during the recovery while facing increased  competition from Citroen in the mid range and from PSA [Peugeot,  Inc.] and Fiat on the "monospace" market?    [Schweitzer] We have no inferiority complex. The Laguna,  which came out right after the Xantia, has exceeded our  expectations in France and the rest of Europe, even Germany,  where we are becoming a recognized builder over the entire range  rather than just for small cars. At the top of the line, we have  not yet convinced the Germans to "think French" when they want  to buy a luxury car.    [Kahn] If there is a recovery, do you expect to stop laying  off workers?    [Schweitzer] No. We are in it for the long haul. We want to  manage the company's productivity in a consistent manner. It is  better to avoid fits and starts so as not to disturb either the  social climate or the smooth operation of the company. Using  temporary workers, overtime, and partial layoffs give us  short-term flexibility.    [Kahn] But are you not afraid that social conflicts will  arise with the recovery?    [Schweitzer] Our men and women must be treated fairly. Since  1985, Renault has cut its full-time personnel every year. I do  not think that personnel cuts generate social movements. We see  no such signs, but I cannot say we are safe from them either.    [Kahn] How will the postponement of Renault's privatization  affect the company?    [Schweitzer] Renault's management will not change. Since  1985, we have managed as a competitive enterprise in the private  sector. We were ready for privatization and its postponement may  generate a feeling of being on hold. We must make sure that the  company concentrates on its business and its strategy, on what  it basically does. I think that is possible because  privatization is not a break. It is part of a process.    [Kahn] Renewal of your stewardship depends on two things:  the  next board of directors meeting on 31 May or privatization if  you make it through the first. Does this not confront the  company with yet another source of uncertainty?    [Schweitzer] This is absolutely typical of publicly-owned  firms and is a phenomenon that is understood fairly well outside  of France. I do not perceive any floating within the company.  The controls continue to work well.    [Kahn] Your name has been mentioned in connection with the  SNCF [French National Railroads].    [Schweitzer] I read that in the newspaper, but no one has  ever spoken to me about it! As a child, I loved electric trains,  but if you want to know whether I prefer cars or trains, I am  quite comfortable where I am!    I have great faith in the rationality of the shareholders.  Their concern is to have a well-managed, well-directed Renault  firm. They will judge the president of Renault on those criteria.    [Kahn] Imagine that you were in charge of privatization.  Would you favor Matra's participation in Renault's stock or even  absorption by Matra Automobile?    [Schweitzer] It is fitting and proper to have partners among  our shareholders. It would be natural for Matra to own stock  because we have a long and successful relationship with Matra  Automobile that we have confirmed for many years. However, that  relationship is all the better because Matra Automobile is  independent of Renault. Otherwise, the larger company could  bring the smaller one under its yoke. One great virtue of Matra  is its flexibility, its capacity for innovation. That must be  preserved.    [Kahn] Following the failure of the merger with Volvo, do  you  feel a need to look for another partner?    [Schweitzer] One must make a distinction between cooperation  and partnership. All automobile builders engage in cooperation  and it therefore seems obvious to me that Renault would maintain  and develop it.    As far as heavy trucks are concerned, Renault VI must  capitalize on the fact that along with Mercedes and Volvo, it is  one of the three major heavy truck builders whose presence is  felt across the Atlantic. Because of developments in engine  technology, it is possible to work together with our American  subsidiary Mack. It is the only builder of American trucks that  makes its own engines. RVI must also develop other forms of  cooperation. Should they lead to a partnership? That is an open  question.    In the automobile industry, a partner is not a vital need.  It  can be an opportunity, as when BMW took over Rover.    [Kahn] Do you regret not grabbing it?    [Schweitzer] No. There was nothing in it for us. What Rover  had to offer was British plants not even as good as Renault's  and a bunch of models whose ability to complement Renault would  be far from obvious! Nor would we have gained in technology  because theirs is Japanese. The idea never even occurred to me!    [Kahn] Has there been talk of an agreement with Fiat?    [Schweitzer] That is not on my agenda, either in the case of  cars or heavy trucks, in which case Iveco does not complement  RVI. However, never say never!    [Kahn] In other words, you do not think that mergers are  indispensable in the European auto industry?    [Schweitzer] I have always maintained that no such thing was  inevitable. In certain areas, there are large-scale savings; in  others, so-called losses. In the United States, GM has not  systematically beaten Chrysler! Our flexibility, capacity for  innovation, and organization mean that we can make the most of  our "lightness." And we can be present everywhere along the line  in market spots thanks to cooperation. If we wanted to build a  4X4, we would not do it alone!    [Kahn] Don't you think that European builders risk being  "sandwiched" in between the American and Japanese builders, who  are truly "world class," which is not the case of the Europeans  and particularly Renault?    [Schweitzer] I do not think that world-class cars are a  success because the market is not homogeneous. The surcosts of  the Mondeo (Ed.'s Note: Ford's international car) are greater  than the savings created. It is vital to be everywhere in  Europe, but it is not essential to have other support points,  even if a presence outside of Europe is a plus. However, Japan  and the United States are prohibitively expensive. We must try  to develop on the markets of the future: Southeast Asia, Latin  America, East Europe.    [Kahn] And yet, you have surrendered your majority  participation in Colombia and Argentina.    [Schweitzer] We concluded that a local partner was more  effective. One must deal with the unwieldiness inherent in big  business. Experience has shown that such transfers have improved  our sales and industrial operation locally.    [Kahn] What do you think the automobile industry will look  like in 15 years?    [Schweitzer] I have ordered precisely such a study. There  are  two main schools of thought: one utilitarian and the other  emotional. The former holds that in the long run, people will  look at price and inside accessories and that their choice will  be purely rational. Buying a car will be like buying a  refrigerator. The second group thinks that style, anything  having to do with the pleasure of buying an automobile, of  making one feel good inside, will play an important role. I fit  into the latter.</p>

The CSCE missions' mandate in Yugoslavia expired less than a  year ago and Belgrade has made its extension conditional upon  Yugoslavia's return to the CSCE. Yugoslavia was suspended from  the organization in July 1992 for its alleged involvement in war  in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The CSCE committee said in a written statement late on  Friday  [4 March] that the return of the missions should be  "unconditional."    Serbia's southern province of Kosovo, where the first  Serbian  state was created in the early Middle Ages, is mostly populated  by the ethnic Albanian minority. The northern province of  Vojvodina and the Sandzak region in the southwest are partly  populated by ethnic Hungarians and Moslems, respectively.    The CSCE committee did not accept an initiative launched by  a  group of CSCE member-states to form a permanent CSCE forum for  military stability and security in former Yugoslavia, which  would also work for disarmament and confidence building in the  area.    Slovenia and Croatia violently seceded from the former  Yugoslav six-member federation in mid-1991.    Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession early in 1992 triggered the  war which is still going on between its Moslem, Serb and Croat  communities.    The Former southernmost Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  followed suit so that Yugoslavia now consists of Serbia and  Montenegro.    The CSCE committee was divided over the establishment of a  military stability forum because Russia and Greece urged a  slower and more gradual approach, while Austria, Croatia,  Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which initiated the idea --  insisted that the body be formed without delay.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak advances to post earnings of Dollars 299m EASTMAN Kodak, the photo-graphic equipment company, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 299m, compared with a Dollars 400m loss a year ago, and forecast that its latest restructuring plan would produce a solid increase in 1993 operating earnings. The company, with a lacklustre profits record in recent years, has shown signs of a more aggressive approach to its problems in recent months, including the announcement of 2,000 redundancies. Mr Kay Whitmore, the chairman, reiterated the company's penitential tone yesterday when he declared that from now on Kodak would 'better align our structural costs with realistic volume projections. We will view the world as it is, and not as we might wish it to be. And our view will be fixed on increasing shareholder value.' The fourth-quarter earnings worked through at 92 cents a share and compared with a loss of Dollars 1.23 a share in the same period of 1991, when the company took after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 597m, or Dollars 1.84. Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.40bn from Dollars 5.08bn. For the full-year the company reported net earnings of Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 3.53 a share, compared with Dollars 17m, or 5 cents, a year ago. The 1991 figures were reduced by Dollars 1.03bn of after-tax charges, while in 1992 a Dollars 152m beneficial accounting change was almost offset by Dollars 141m of restructuring charges. However, Mr Whitmore acknowledged that 'with sluggish volume and cost inflation putting pressure on operating margins, the sale of certain investments was a large factor in the net earnings gain' for 1992. In the fourth quarter the imaging business produced earnings of Dollars 316m, compared with a 1991 loss of Dollars 189m, while the information business made a loss of Dollars 12m, down from a loss of Dollars 65m, excluding restructuring charges. The chemicals business made Dollars 110m, down 1 per cent on a year ago, while health operations made Dollars 123m, down from Dollars 151m, excluding restructuring charges. Polaroid, the US camera and films group, blamed a sharp fall in European film sales for a decline in fourth-quarter net profits, writes Our Financial Staff. Earnings for the three months to end-December totalled Dollars 29.6m, or 63 cents a share, compared with Dollars 58.5m, or Dollars 1.16, a year earlier, on sales 2 per cent higher at Dollars 649.2m against Dollars 633.4m. For the full year, net income was Dollars 99m, or Dollars 2.06, against Dollars 683.7m, or Dollars 12.54, in 1991, a figure boosted by a pre-tax gain of Dollars 925m as a result of a litigation settlement with Eastman Kodak. Sales for the year were Dollars 2.15bn against Dollars 2.07bn. Polaroid said that in the first quarter of 1993 it intends to take an undisclosed charge for its previously announced early retirement and severance programme.</p>

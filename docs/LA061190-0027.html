			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAPPLE'S SLALOM FALL GIVES OVERTON VICTORY  </P> <P> Having already accomplished the most difficult of her two tasks -- keeping  alive her streak of 37 consecutive women's water ski jumping victories -- Deena  Mapple was primed for her sixth double victory in seven weeks on the Michelob  Dry Pro Water Ski Tour.  </P> <P> All that stood between it was two buoys in the women's slalom event. Kristi  Overton, her competitor in the finals, had fallen going into her second buoy --  giving her a score of 1 1/2 buoys.  </P> <P> Mapple had probably negotiated two buoys with 40-feet of rope length a thousand  times. But Sunday's run on Mission Bay was different. Going into the first  buoy, Mapple overturned on her ski and fell -- giving Overton, 20, her first  slalom victory of the season and third in two years on the tour.  </P> <P> "I was taking my skis off and talking to myself, when I looked up and saw her  in the water," said Overton, a student at Central Florida College in Orlando.  "I was disappointed in my performance, but I was glad to win."  </P> <P> Though disappointed, Mapple took her upset loss in stride.  </P> <P> "It was definitely a mental lapse," she said. "I was thinking of the whole  course instead of the first buoy. I have more experience than to do something  like that. But that just proves you have to earn it."  </P> <P> Overton said Mapple's aggressive tactics surprised her.  </P> <P> "I was surprised she took (the first buoy) that hard," Overton said.  </P> <P> Still, it wasn't too bad of a day for the Mapple family. With Deena's victory  in the jump at 140 feet over Sherri Slone's 131 and husband Andy's victory in  the slalom over Lucky Lowe by a half buoy, the Mapple family walked away with  $9,500 in prize money.  </P> <P> Andy's slalom title was his seventh is seven attempts this season.  </P> <P> "It goes like that," he said. "You get on a roll and you start getting all the  breaks. I must say the way the things are going for Deena and I are better than  we ever expected."  </P> <P> Mapple, who won his event with 38 feet of rope length, beat Lowe five buoys to  4 1/2.  </P> <P> "I almost didn't get the fifth," he said. "I had a problem at four because of  the salt water. My foot came out of the binders and I was barely able to hold  on."  </P> <P> In the men's freestyle, Dave Reinhart of Defiance, Ohio won by setting a world  record in distance on one ski -- 77 feet. Reinhart finished with 1,945 points,  Mike Tolzmann was second with 1,427 points and Dotter was third with 1,407.  </P> <P> Australian Bruce Neville won his first tour event of the season with a jump of  193 feet, finishing ahead of his countryman, Geoff Carrington, who was second  at 192. Mike Kjellander took third at 174.  </P></p>

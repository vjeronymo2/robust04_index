			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: General Consolidated net assets rise 12.7% GENERAL Consolidated Investment Trust reported a net asset value of 155.6p at December 31 - an advance of 12.7 per cent over the previous year's 138p. Sir Mark Thomson, chairman of this split-level trust, said its underperformance against market indices reflected some 37 per cent of the portfolio being invested in companies with market capitalisations below Pounds 250m. Many had reduced or omitted dividend payments in an attempt to conserve cash resources, he said. Net revenue edged ahead to Pounds 4.76m (Pounds 4.7m), while earnings per income share emerged at 10.7p, a marginal rise on the previous year's 10.67p. As intimated in November, a final distribution of 2.75p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 10.41p. A dividend of 3.23p is recommended on the stepped preference shares.</p>

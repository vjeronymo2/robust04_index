			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments carried on Havana  radio and television in Spanish between 14 and 22 April.    Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 14 April reports that the El  Cobre  quarry has produced over 670 tons of product for export, out of  a planned 500 tons for the first quarter of 1993. El Cobre is  expected to meet its annual goal of 1,800 tons since the  copper-processing plant underwent extensive maintenance.    Reloj adds at 1940 GMT that Villa Clara Province has taken  in  500,000 pesos in self-employment license fees.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 15 April reports that this year  approximately 2,000 rooms in 15 installations dedicated to  international tourism will receive furniture worth more than $7  million produced by the light industry union. This contribution  will be supplemented by mattresses and lamps, which used to be  purchased abroad. The furniture factory commitment this year is  aimed at refurbishing the (Cohiba), Habana Libre, Guitart, and  El Viejo y el Mar hotels in Havana. The Cayo Guillermo Cabin in  Ciego de Avila and the Cuatro Vientos in Camaguey will also  receive furniture. Despite material limitations, this Ministry  of Light Industry factory produced 42,000 units last year to  furnish other important centers; the plant is also operating  jointly with Dominican capital to produce wicker furniture for  Cubanacan.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 15 April reports that in order  to conduct a vaccination campaign, the city of Buenos Aires,  Argentina, has purchased 500,000 doses of the meningitis vaccine  made by the Finlay Institute.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0000 GMT on 16 April report  that members of the Lazaro Pena contingent in Havana salute  workers day. In the past harvest, this contingent was able to do  only 25 percent of its task, because of damages caused by the  storm of the century. One year later they were able to harvest  56 caballerias of tobacco. According to specialists, this has  been a good year for crops and the workers have responded with  discipline and dedication.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 15 April reports that  Venezuelan  travel groups will bring more than 9,000 people to Cuba this  year. According to company officials, this is a 20-percent  increase over 1993.    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 18 April reports that national  egg production in the first quarter of 1994 was 130 million.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 18 April reports that in  Matanzas Province 500 tons of jute fiber have been processed  during the first quarter of 1994 -- 100 tons more than in the  first quarter of 1993. Jute planting at the Eladio Hernandez  Leon Complex is behind schedule because of a work force deficit.    Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 18 April reports that volunteer  cane cutters from the Cuban Workers Federation have fulfilled  their objectives during the current harvest and that they will  remain in the fields until the conclusion of operations in  Camaguey. The Jesus Suarez Gallol column, which groups these  volunteers, has cut 57 million arrobas of cane since the  beginning of the harvest. This column, with a brigade of  approximately 3,000 volunteers, is organized in 92 groups. After  Havana, Camaguey is the second province in the country declared  to have a millionaire status in manual cutting of sugarcane.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 20 April reports that Santiago  de Cuba has received directly from Malaga, Spain, a donation  from the Jose Marti solidarity group consisting of more than two  tons of diverse medical supplies and equipment, as well as a  donation of industrial oil sent by a Spanish coordinating group  for solidarity with Latin America.    Tele Rebelde Network at 0000 GMT on 21 April reports that in  Moa, Holguin, a 3.5-km-long oil pipeline built at a cost of $4  million is near completion. The 24-inch pipeline will make it  possible to off- load 55 tons of oil in 30 hours, thus  significantly reducing the nickel industry's oil freight costs.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 19 April reports that Matanzas  Province's spring planting goal is 507 caballerias in the first  half of the year. Currently, only 150 caballerias have been  planted.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 22 April reports that this  year's tobacco harvest in Pinar del Rio is already better than  last year -- 23 million poles have already been gathered. The  province is about to reach its 1994 goal of harvesting 300,000  quintals -- 25,000 quintals more than in 1993. The tobacco  industry provides $100 million to Cuba; 70 percent of the  tobacco comes from this province.    Radio Reloj at 1434 GMT on 22 April reports that in Granma  Province, at a quarry in Jiguani Municipality, a new type of  marble called "Rosado del Rio" with great sales potential is  being quarried and will be ready for marketing this month.    Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 22 April reports that the  Guanabo Industrial Complex in Havana produced 60 train-buses in  1993; this year's goal is to produce 200 of these 300-passenger  buses.</p>

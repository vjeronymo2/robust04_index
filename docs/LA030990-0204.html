			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE BOTTOM LINE  </P> <P> Authorities in Davenport, Iowa, have dropped an assault charge against  middleweight champion Michael Nunn in a neighborhood fracas, and the prosecutor  insists he treated Nunn just as he would any other defendant. Nunn, the  International Boxing Federation champion, was arrested Oct. 1 and charged with  simple assault after a neighborhood street brawl in which his mother and nephew  also were arrested. Earlier, Nunn said he was wrong to swear at a policeman but  that he was innocent of assault.  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Ripples of uncertainty disturb annuity market / A look at a controversy over the best way for pensioners to handle a potentially costly investment decision CONTROVERSY has hit the normally tranquil market for annuities, the products which convert capital into income for the elderly. The problems can be traced back to Black Wednesday, September 16, when sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism. The initial assumption of gilt traders was that inflation was likely to increase over the long-term. Prices of long term gilts fell (because their repayment values would be eaten away by inflation), and the redemption yields of such gilts rose. Annuities are almost totally dependent on the yields from medium and long-term gilts, so some impact on annuity rates seemed inevitable. But more than a month later, movements in rates, where they have occurred, have been downwards. Why is this? In spite of an effective devaluation, demand for gilts, usually strong in a recession, has been pushed up by the uncertainty of recent weeks, and by the cuts in short term interest rates. Long gilt prices reversed their original post-Black Wednesday decline, and yields have accordingly dropped. This trend has started to translate into lower annuity rates in the last week, with cuts in rates from competitive companies such as Pearl and Equitable Life. Canada Life and Generali, which also specialise in annuities, shaved their rates last week. The chart, provided by Sage Annuities, demonstrates the trend. Sage expects the trend in annuity rates to continue downwards for the coming months. But others disagree about the long-term. There are two schools of thought. Some believe the initial post-devaluation fears of rising inflation will return. Long gilt yields and thus annuity rates will rise. Others expect further base rate cuts, designed to boost the sluggish economy, will cause gilt yields (and annuity rates) to fall. Brian Hurl, of Norex Pensions, says: 'Annuity rates may edge down slightly in the short term. But comparing now with 12 months' time, I think we could see a slight rise.' In the light of all this confusion, what should those contemplating buying an annuity do? Remember that annuities come in two basic forms: Compulsory Purchase Annuities - which are purchased with the proceeds of a pension fund when you retire. By law, the bulk of the fund built up in a personal pension plan must be used to buy such an annuity. Because they are regarded as your main source of income, the tax position for these annuities is less favourable than for: Voluntary Annuities - which can, in general terms, be bought with any capital not directly derived from a pension fund. The rule here is usually to wait as long as possible until buying, because the older you are, the higher the annuity rate you will receive. In both cases, you will receive a fixed income until you die. If you die early, then the life office will keep the capital (unless you have arranged some form of guarantee, which will cost money), while if you live a long time, the office will be obliged to keep paying you the money. So you are effectively taking a punt on how long you will live. You are also taking a view on the rate of inflation for the rest of your life. It is possible to buy annuities which are linked to the retail prices index, or which escalate at 5 per cent per annum, but they will offer a lower starting level of income. According to Norex, Standard Life have left level and escalating annuities untouched since Black Wednesday, but RPI-linked annuities have been cut four times - a move which speaks volumes about what actuaries expect to happen to inflation. The orthodox view is that you should wait as long as possible before buying pension annuities so that your fund increases, and your extra age means a greater annuity. But if annuity rates are set to fall further, it might be best to lock in to current yields. So an early retirement might be tempting. Savers should think carefully before taking this step - particularly if they have a with-profits pension policy with penalties for early surrender, as this could damage the value of their retirement fund. A misjudgement in timing of a few months can make a big difference to the income you receive for the rest of your retirement. The vogue, inspired by uncertainty surrounding the gilts market, is for 'staggered vesting.' This takes advantage of the fact that you do not have to take all your pension at once. Instead, once you have reached retirement age, you can take a portion of your fund and buy an annuity with it (along with taking some tax-free cash), while leaving the rest of the fund to carrying on accumulating. Several advisers, such as Towry Law, accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, and stockbrokers Albert E Sharp offer plans for 'staggered vesting'. Mark Bolland of Chamberlain De Broe says it is a 'sensible way to hedge your bets', and suggests that it should be retained as an option even when markets are less uncertain. However, Billy Burrows, of Sage Annuities, says quotations usually assume that annuity rates are constant, when in practice they will rise or fall according to market conditions. If annuity rates fall the advantages of staggering could be wiped out, he warns. He says: 'Rather like currency mortgages, they look good on paper, but the trick is with ongoing advice and management of annuities. If the timing is wrong the client will lose out.' But this does not mean you should rush to retire early. The possibility of higher returns next year means that you should not bring forward your retirement drastically just to try to catch annuity rates while they remain high. Staggered vesting should enable you to avoid the worst of this dilemma - there is no need for the retirement annuity purchase to be a once-and-for-all decision.</p>

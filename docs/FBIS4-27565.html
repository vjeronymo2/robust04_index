			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan's business leaders  remain cautious about the future course of the domestic economy,  despite some signs of recovery, the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) said Thursday [2 June].    The organization, which polled 152 top executives of large  corporations in mid-May, said four out of five businessmen  expect business conditions to improve in the second half of the  current business year or later.    According to the results, 75.0 percent of those surveyed  said  the economy's future course is unpredictable, though they have  seen some signs of bottoming out.    Another 24.3 percent said the economy has not yet bottomed  out, while only 0.7 percent said the economy has already hit  bottom and prospects are bright.    As for the timing of recovery, 40.6 percent said they expect  it in the October-December period this year, while 39.9 percent  predicted the January-March period or later next year.    On corporate capital investment, many of the surveyed said  recovery will take a considerably long time because many  companies are slowly completing stock adjustment.    Some respondents also predicted that major corporations will  shift their investment from domestic to overseas markets to take  advantage of the higher yen.    They predicted investment will for a while center on  rationalizing equipment and renewing existing facilities as part  of their restructuring programs.    Corporate investment that will boost the economy will come  much later, they added.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (7): Knowledge is all - Computer data bases open new horizons THE ability of computers to store and permit the rapid retrieval of extensive amounts of information makes them ideal for gathering tax information. Even companies and their advisers who are engaged in purely domestic activities have a never-ending struggle to keep up with new developments. In the UK, for example, tax experts have to cope with an annual Finance Act of more than 100 pages, High Court decisions running to hundreds of pages, and more than 100 press releases and assorted statements each year. The amount of information to be dealt with multiplies by the number of countries concerned. In addition, the interaction between tax systems requires careful analysis. The vast majority of computer systems used by tax advisers are essentially databases. A number of companies such as Lexis operate substantial legal databases on line. Although their focus is domestic, they do give tax researchers access to material from a number of countries. In addition, countries' specific tax databases are available to aid in research. Most on-line databases need skilled researchers to extract the information efficiently. The charges for access to the databases ensure that their use is frequently limited to cataloguing materials such as judicial decisions on a particular point. The cost of retrieving a full text is often prohibitive. As a result, tax advisers still need to rely on hard copy. In reaction to this, a number of publishers, particularly in North America, such as CCH, Prentice Hall and others now offer tax databases on compact disks with read-only memories (CD-ROM). These are usually electronic versions of hard copy publications. On-line databases are often, therefore, used as support to provide for the most up-to-date information only. Such systems offer speed of access, ease of updating and mobility when combined with portable computers. In the international arena, choices are more limited. The only source entirely devoted to international issues is the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation, the non-profit publishing affiliate of the International Fiscal Association. It maintains CD-ROM databases on European and Latin American taxation, as well as one providing the full text in English of double tax treaties. These are supplemented by an on-line data service. Once the tax adviser has extracted the relevant information, its evaluation, interrelation and application is largely left in the hands of the adviser. The development of tax programs that actually use the data to assist in planning decisions has been slow. For several years, domestic tax programs have been available to assist planners manipulate data with what are effectively spreadsheet applications. Typically, tax computations are made and planning may be done through 'what if' analysis. Two forays into computerised international tax planning have been by major accounting firms KPMG and Price Waterhouse in the field of expatriate taxation. The KPMG Peat Marwick 'EXPATRIATE' program calculates tax and social security for proposed employee assignments overseas. It covers 40 countries, 26 Swiss cantons, the Canadian provinces and territories, five American states plus a generic American state for locations not on the system. The Price Waterhouse 'IAMF' program also calculates the cost of sending employees to particular locations. Its system covers 51 countries, plus American states and Canadian provinces, as well as some Swiss cantons. Both systems are available under licence. The only corporate international tax planning program that is available by licence is 'COMTAX' produced by Comtax AB. Again, the combination of database and spreadsheet evaluates the effect of transferring earnings from one country to another within a multinational group on the total after tax profits of the group. These planning programs help to generate possibilities that tax advisers or managers might not immediately think of, or eliminate possibilities that are simply unworkable. They also help to calculate the impact of taxes on existing corporate structures and suggest possibilities for reorganisation. They may make it easier to decide which company in a multinational group should be the vehicle for making an acquisition or for post-acquisition restructuring. None of these systems can make judgments as to whether particular tax rules are applicable or not. They merely calculate the result. Even though they are becoming indispensable in dealing with international tax problems, the human touch is still required and traditional legal skills are necessary.</p>

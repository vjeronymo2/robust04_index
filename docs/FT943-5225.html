			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo While the government's view on the domestic economy will be released later this week by the Economic Planning Agency's monthly report, bond prices seem to have discounted a large part of the recovery. The No 164 10-year benchmark bond closed up 5 basis points at 4.735 per cent last week in spite of positive news over the government's financing. Requests from ministries for the next business year have averaged increases of 4.8 per cent, while the ministry of finance indicated only a 1.25 per cent increase. Moreover, the three-party coalition government announced that there will no supplementary budget. The steepening of the yield curve only seems to confirm that many market participants expect a sharp jump in the economy, and a rise in inflation rather than a modest recovery and subdued inflation figures predicted by most analysts. 'The market is discounting recovery pretty far in advance,' says Mr Dick Beason, economist at James Capel in Tokyo. Meanwhile, news from the bilateral framework talks on trade with the US this week may affect movements of the yen, which usually has a short-term impact on bond yields. A stronger yen will support bonds, which are likely to face profit-taking by institutional investors.</p>

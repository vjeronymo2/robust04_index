			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STONEROCK, ARREOLA WHIP WEAK FIELDS IN NEWHALL ROAD RACE  </P> <P> Having taken major strides toward becoming a top-notch race by offering prize  money in 1989, the Independence Day Classic 5K road race backpedaled this year  when race organizers decided not to offer any money to the top finishers.  </P> <P> Minus the lure of $2,500 in prize money to draw in big names from other areas,  Wednesday's race through the streets of Newhall was composed primarily of local  runners and it showed in the results.  </P> <P> Gone was the depth of a year ago when Samson Obwocha of Kenya ran 14 minutes 25  seconds to defeat Alan Dehlinger (14:27) and Carmelo Rios (14:38), and seven  runners broke 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Daren Stonerock, a 1986 graduate of Saugus High, easily won Wednesday's men's  race in 15:02, but that time would have placed him 10th in last year's meet,  which was run in much hotter conditions.  </P> <P> Darcy Arreola of Nike Coast won the women's division in 16:39 and finished 10th  overall. There were 643 official finishers.  </P> <P> "I don't have a real good base yet," said Stonerock, who moved back to Saugus  in January after an up-and-down 3 1/2-year stay at Northern Arizona University.  "I'm still a long ways away from being in real good shape. Today, I just wanted  to get out the first mile and see what would happen."  </P> <P> After an initial mile in 4:41, Stonerock was all by himself a quarter-mile  later, and he widened the gap to 200 yards at the finish.  </P> <P> Peter De La Cerda, a 1989 graduate of Granada Hills High, placed second in  15:36, followed by James Barbarudlo (15:38).  </P> <P> The Canyon High trio of Dan Rattary (class of '87), Dan Berkeland (class of  '90) and Dave Hartman (class of '91) were fourth through sixth in 15:39, 15:44  and 15:47.  </P> <P> Stonerock, who outkicked De La Cerda to win the Henry Mayo 5K in April, had an  easier time Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I was really expecting De La Cerda to be close to me," Stonerock said. "I  figured it might come down to a kick again."  </P> <P> When it didn't, Stonerock simply concentrated on maintaining his pace.  </P> <P> After leading Saugus High to Southern Section 3-A Division cross-country titles  in 1984 and '85 (he won the individual title as a senior), the 22-year-old  Stonerock finds himself at a crossroads in his career after leaving Northern  Arizona because of what he termed a falling out with the coaching staff.  </P> <P> "I'm through with school," he said. "I just want to get back in really good  shape again and get a sponsor. Right now, I'm running 50 miles a week.  Hopefully, by September, I'll be up to 70."  </P> <P> Arreola, who finished seventh in the 1,500 meters in The Athletics Congress  Championships at Cerritos College last month, was never challenged in the  women's division. She won by nearly three minutes while running her fastest  5,000 road race.  </P> <P> "I wanted to run under 16:40 so I'm pretty happy with the time," said Arreola,  who redshirted this past collegiate track and field season at Cal State  Northridge. "I wanted to run hard for the first mile and get a good workout in.  I wasn't that serious. I came here just to run for fun."  </P> <P> Arreola, the women's division winner last year in 16:50, timed 5:24 at the mile  mark and 10:51 for two miles Wednesday.  </P> <P> Her next race is the 1,500 in the U. S. Olympic Festival in Minneapolis (the  track portion is from July 12-15), and then she will start focusing on her  senior cross-country season, when Northridge will make its debut at the  Division I level.  </P></p>

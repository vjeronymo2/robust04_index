			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- At its session today  the federal government discussed the situation in the wake of  the NATO air strike against the territory of the Srpska republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the vicinity of Gorazde. It decided to  send a delegation of the Yugoslav Government, headed by Vice  Prime Minister Zeljko Simic, to the Srpska republic where they  will acquaint themselves with the situation and consequences on  the spot.    The government, as is reported, also decided to send a  protest note to Italy, because it provided its air bases for the  aircraft that attacked the Serb territories in  ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the same time it decided that the  federal government would send a letter to UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali in which it will point out the facts that indicate  that the NATO air strike against the territory of the Srpska  republic was a violation of the UN Charter.</p>

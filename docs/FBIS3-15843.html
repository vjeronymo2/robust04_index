The decision was prompted by the  parliament's notorious resolution of February 23, 1994, on a  sweeping political amnesty.    Denisov argues that the Military Collegium's decision does  not comply with the Criminal Processual Code of the Russian  Federation, which demands that once initiated, any proceedings  in court should be carried though and end with passing a verdict  of either "guilty" or "not-guilty".</p>

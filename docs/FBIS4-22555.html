			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Holubchenko, by N. Sorochynskyy; </F> place and date not given: "If We Continue Living As We Are Now,  We Will Not Survive Even for A Year"]    [Text] As long as I can remember we have always spoken  about the equality of village and city. But that slogan, just as  another one, equally popular in bygone times: overtake and  surpass America, remained merely a slogan. We never overtook  America and the city and village is a misalliance just as  before. That difference has become particularly perceptible  today when all the painful sides of our life showed up as if on  a piece of litmus paper. The village appears to be particularly  unequal compared to the city at the present time. Even though,  to be truthful, the latter is also experiencing difficult times.    Enough about facts, however. As they say, whoever does not  want to work is seeking a reason, whereas those who want work  seek a possibility. Many economists in Ukraine and abroad formed  an opinion of Anatoliy Holubchenko, the minister of industry, as  a politician and a member of the government who is looking for  ways to resolve the crisis in a branch that recently made-up 38  percent of the total industrial potential of the former USSR and  currently finds itself in a very difficult position. At the same  time the level of development of industry in many ways  determines how fast and how successfully our agriculture can get  up off its knees, how it will occupy an equal place next to  industry and gradually, step by step, transform Ukraine into a  powerful agroindustrial European nation.    Today's conversation of journalist Nikolay Sorochynskyy with  Anatoliy Holubchenko deals with the possibilities of an equal  partnership between the village and the city, agriculture and  industry.    [Sorochynskyy] Anatoliy Konstantinovich, no matter how much  we talk about price parity, one thing is indisputable: today's  prices for industrial products are much higher than those for  agricultural products. How is it possible to achieve the desired  parity?    [Holubchenko] Speaking about parity, according to data of  the  Agroindustrial Bank, in 1993 prices for agricultural products  rose by a factor of 36, while material resources utilized in the  production of those goods increased by a factor of 92. That is,  prices for agricultural products lagged behind by a factor of  2.5. That is felt in everything and a logical conclusion comes  to mind: presently it is necessary to take steps in order to  bring prices for agricultural products and for material  resources into correspondence. If we have firmly decided that it  is necessary to preserve prices for agricultural products, we  must also firmly decide that they must be subsidized. For  example, if a kilogram of meat costs 10 dollars on the world  market, meat should cost the equivalent in our case as well. But  it turns out that our meat combines receive meat at 15,000  karbovantsy per kilogram while at the exchange rate of 12,600  karbovantsy to the dollar, meat should cost 126,000 karbovantsy.  The same applies to milk, bread, etc. In the world there are  certain proportions in the exchange of goods. In essence, those  proportions determine the monetary equivalent. In our case,  however, the proportions have been violated and definitely not  in favor of the village.    That is why it is now so difficult for the kolkhozes: there  is nothing to spend on mineral fertilizers, construction has  been practically halted, and many facilities in the social  sphere are in a decrepit condition. People are not going to  visit the club I saw, for example, in Mikhaylovka of Chernigov  Rayon in Zaporozhye, where the temperature indoors is lower than  out on the street. I believe that the policy of the state with  regard to the countryside is simply unfair.    [Sorochynskyy] What is your attitude toward kolkhozes as a  form of collective management in the countryside?    [Holubchenko] As indicated by data 80 percent of the people  today favor the collective form of management--kolkhozes and  sovkhozes. But it is necessary to understand something else as  well: private farming should not be rejected. We must combine  all forms. Each one of them shall find its place and will  survive. To change something unequivocally today is unrealistic  and should never be done. Therefore it is necessary to build a  basis on something that the people are accustomed to and what  they want, while for innovations it is important to create  conditions for normal existence, while supporting legislation  not with words alone but through action.    [Sorochynskyy] The industrial branch has always been closely  linked with agriculture: plants produced equipment for the  countryside, along with mineral fertilizers, chemical pesticides  and herbicides, etc. These are difficult times, however, not  just for agriculture but for industry as well. Where do orders  for the countryside stand in industrial plans?    [Holubchenko] For as long as I have worked in industry in  executive positions--from deputy foreman to minister, we have  always flagged agriculture. That flag was always red. At all  times. Meaning that it had to be prioritized. Regardless of the  level of production, 100 percent fulfillment of orders for the  village.    I feel that way especially strongly today. After all,  branches of the Ministry of Industry are inseparably linked with  the village. For instance, metal is needed for the production of  machines which we provide and we also know precisely that such  metal is needed specifically for agricultural machinery. Its  shape and amount for each machine is indicated for every plant.  We also produce all rubber parts for agricultural machinery. All  types of fertilizers are made by us as well. We conduct joint  consultations with agricultural workers along with monthly  conferences on the fulfillment of orders coming from the  countryside at the Ministry of Industry: for tires, fertilizers,  and herbicides. In other words with regard to everything that  must today be delivered for the countryside, and we deliver it.  In March, for instance, the branch headed by me produced planned  mineral fertilizers on schedule worth some 500 billion  karbovantsy. At the end of March fulfillment of the April  assignment was started.    I believe that the countryside must receive priority  attention and, as in former times, perhaps to someone's dislike,  red flagged. That is, orders for agriculture must be filled with  any level of production that exists. It is necessary not to  reject what was good before even if it was in a system which  does not appeal to all right now in part because of the priority  of the countryside.    [Sorochynskyy] The harvest is now under way. It is for good  reason that the people say you will reap what you sow. You have  just returned from the agricultural regions of Zaporozhye. What  are your predictions? Will Ukraine have bread this year? Are we  threatened by famine?    [Holubchenko] I met many grain growers, cattle farmers,  heads  of sovkhozes, and deputies of rural soviets and must say that  with all of the complications they are facing, with the problems  and their standard of living, the attitude they have toward  labor and the way in which they understand that they are feeding  all of the people--we will have no famine. That is  unquestionable. These people, I would say, perform feats every  day. But they do not elevate this to the level of a feat. They  understand the work that must be done as normal daily tasks.  They arise at four in the morning and race to milk the cows,  then return home in order to milk their own cows and feed the  livestock. Then they hasten back to work. They are also training  their children to handle this work.    [Sorochynskyy] Anatoliy Konstantinovich, I know that you  yourself also come from a labor dynasty.    [Holubchenko] Yes, I come from a dynasty of metallurgists.  In  his younger years my father worked as steel-maker's apprentice  in an open-hearth shop of the Mariupol Metallurgical Combine,  and after the war he worked as a brigade leader in a  rolling-mill department until he retired on pension. Except for  one brother who is a doctor, two of my sisters and another  brother have also worked and are now working at industrial  enterprises. I myself began work as an apprentice roller in a  rolling-mill department of the Mariupol Metallurgical Combine. I  am particularly proud of the fact that our dynasty continues: my  eldest son is graduating from the Zaporozhye Industrial  Institute, while my daughter-in-law works at Zaporozhstal. It is  good when your children select the occupation of the father.  That means you did not make a mistake in selecting a correct  path.    It would be better if the efforts of those who are  constantly  attempting to frighten us with the prospects of famine could be  directed at something else: creation of improved working  conditions in the countryside, achievement of an upturn in  industry, the resolution of domestic and external problems of  the country, and at making certain that we finally stop  complaining about all kinds of difficulties and start working.    [Sorochynskyy] The question of Ukraine joining the economic  union of CIS countries with the rights of a full and not an  associate member, has come up once again. It was a topic of  discussion at the latest session of the Cabinet of Ministers as  well. What are your views regarding the economic union?    [Holubchenko] We will come to that anyway. We are not ready  yet, but we will be. A majority in east Ukraine favors full  membership in the economic union of CIS countries. In west  Ukraine, however, there are other opinions. It would be good to  find a golden center such as a sensible compromise in that  sphere.    We have no other way out. CIS countries are our principal  markets. Another 10 - 15 years will be required at the very  least for structural reorganization and integration. But if we  continue living as we are now we will not survive even for a  year. It is already clear where we are headed.    It is necessary to simply understand the objective realities  and not depict wishes as actuality as this will result in a  fiasco in addition to harming others.    Therefore the question as to whether to join the economic  union must be studied intelligently. No one, however, will be  able to simply walk away from that problem. No matter what kind  of parliament and government there are, and no matter how much  we elevate this issue--higher of lower, we will still have to  resolve that question.</p>

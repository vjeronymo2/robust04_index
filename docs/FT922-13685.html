			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Letter: Destroying praise for dancing Sir, Clement Crisp's review of the Moscow City Ballet's Sleeping Beauty (Arts, April 8) was, as so often, extremely funny. However, it would have been more useful had he concentrated on the quality of the dancing and the overall impression of the performance. Instead, nearly half the review dealt with the costumes. Clearly they were poor - no doubt as a result of budget constraints which should not surprise us. Passing reference to this should have been enough. What the reader wants to know is whether the performance was enjoyable. When he eventually referred to the quality of the dancing, he praised it. But the effect was completely destroyed by his self-indulgent introduction. Let us take for granted Mr Crisp's literary ability and keen sense of humour. Let him get on with fulfilling the prime task of a critic - giving a balanced, informative review. Patrick Allan, 6 Catherine Court, Lake Road, London SW19 7EW</p>

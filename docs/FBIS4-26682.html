			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by Jiangxi Provincial Statistics Bureau </F> on 17 March 1994: "Statistical Report Issued by Jiangxi  Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social  Development in 1993"]    [Text] In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th Central Committee, the whole province, from the top to  the grass roots, seriously implemented a series of principles  and policies from the Central Committee and the State Council,  emancipated the mind, sought truth from facts, seized  opportunities, accelerated development, and scored marked  accomplishments in various aspects of national economic and  social development. The pace of reform and opening up was  quickened in a comprehensive way, and the national economy  maintained a sound momentum of high growth, people's living  standards continued to improve, and various social undertakings  developed further. Initial statistics show that the annual GNP  was 70.242 billion yuan, up 17.4 percent from the previous year,  of which, the increased value of primary industry was 23.44  billion yuan, up 6 percent; the increased value of the secondary  industry was 27.302 billion yuan, up 33.9 percent; and the  increased value of tertiary industry was 19.5 billion yuan, up  by 13 percent. Local financial revenue was 6.565 billion yuan,  up 30.8 percent. The annual growth rate of the entire national  economy was the fastest since reform and opening up, and the  growth rate of major economic indexes continued to be higher  than the average level across China. The main difficulties and  problems in economic operations were, namely, that the pace of  industrial restructuring needs to be further stepped up, the  range of price rises was comparatively high, the contradictions  caused by a tight money supply have not been eased, economic  returns need to be improved further, and the number of  enterprises suffering deficits and the sums involved remain  comparatively great.  <H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>   In 1993, party committees and governments at all levels  across the province gave rural economic development top priority  in economic work and implemented the party's various rural  policies in a down-to-earth way, with increasing the peasants'  income and further augmenting agricultural comprehensive  production capability as the target, and nurturing the rural  market, optimizing the industrial mix, developing "three-high"  agriculture and enterprises in townships and towns, and  increasing agricultural inputs as foci to earnestly protect the  peasants' enthusiasm in developing agricultural production, thus  maintaining the sound momentum of the sustained rural economic  growth despite serious natural disasters attacking the province  on several occasions consecutively.    Agricultural production developed comparatively fast, with  the structure continuing to be optimized. Gross agricultural  output value (at constant 1990 prices, same in the following)  was 34.499 billion yuan, up 7.3 percent from the previous year.  Under conditions where a shrunken area was planted with grain  crops and there were serious natural disasters, grain output  dropped by 3.2 percent from the previous year; however, gross  grain output was 15. 171 billion tonnes, exceeding the quota set  by the state by 671,000 tones. Cash crops continued to develop,  with an area of 1.171 million hectares sown, a drop of 3.4  percent from the previous year.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Output of Major Farm Produce                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Increase, tonne          |Increase Over 1992 ()   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grain                    |14,381,000               |-4.3                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Soya bean                |255,000                  |29.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Potato                   |2,380,000                |20.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cotton                   |156,000                  |5.3                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oil-bearing crops        |778,000                  |4.9                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |of which:                |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Peanuts                  |257,000                  |19.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rape Seed                |481,000                  |-1.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sugarcane                |2,311,000                |-9.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ambry hemp               |18,000                   |1.9                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Jute                     |6,000                    |-13.1                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flue-cured tobacco       |46,000                   |20.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sun-cured tobacco        |8,000                    |1.4                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Silkworm cocoons         |16,000                   |2.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tea                      |20,000                   |11.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fruit                    |208,000                  |47.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Of which:                |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Orange                   |120,000                  |70.4                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Forestry production developed vigorously.

Animal husbandry and fisheries production enjoyed sustained  growth. Production of aquatic products topped a new record,  with an output of 555,000 tonnes, up 34.3 percent from the  previous year.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Animal Husbandry, Fisheries Production                                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |Increase over 1992       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pork, beef, Mutton       |1,522,000 tonnes         |18.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Milk                     |28,000 tonnes            |0.6                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pigs slaughtered         |18,181,000 head          |15.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sheep at year's end      |232,000 head             |17.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Large animals at year-end|3,617,000 head           |4.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Agricultural inputs increased and production conditions  improved somewhat. Financial organs at various levels in the  province spent a total of 757 million yuan supporting  agriculture, up 13.8 percent from the previous year. The total  horsepower of farm machinery across the province was 6.304  million kw, a drop of 0.7 percent from the previous year; there  were 9,000 large and medium-sized tractors, a drop of 21.5  percent; 72,000 small tractors and rototillers, a 17.5 percent  drop; 19,000 trucks for agricultural use, up by 3.6 percent; and  irrigation and drainage equipment with a total capacity of 1.606  million kw, up by 10.5 percent.

Construction of rural  irrigation and water conservancy projects was strengthened;  1.864 million hectares of farmland had effective irrigation  systems, up by 9,000 hectares; and the proportion of irrigated  farmland as a percentage of all arable land rose to 80.2 percent  from 79.4 percent in the previous year.    Enterprises in towns and townships maintained a momentum of  fast-rate growth. In 1993, the gross output value of township  and town enterprises across the province was 58.64 billion yuan,  up by 92.8 percent from the previous year, of which industrial  output value was 38.533 billion yuan, up 92 percent.  <H5>  II. Industry and Construction </H5>   In 1993, the industrial front further emancipated the mind,  made progress despite difficulties, grasped the opportunity,  deepened reform, and accelerated development, with industrial  production continuing high-rate growth. Calculated at constant  1990 prices, the province achieved an industrial gross output  value of 88.261 billion yuan, up by 38.8 percent over the  previous year, of which industrial enterprises at and above  township levels achieved 60.566 billion yuan, up by 22.2  percent. Of the gross industrial output value of enterprises at  and above township level, that of state-owned enterprises  increased by 13.9 percent, enterprises under collective  ownership increased by 44 percent, and industry in other  economic categories, with foreign-funded enterprises as the main  channel, rose by 69.1 percent. Large and medium-sized industry  played a backbone role, with annual output value rising by 21.3  percent.    The industrial structure improved somewhat, and the  development of light and heavy industry gradually became  harmonious. The output value of light industrial enterprises at  and above township level was 27.228 billion yuan, up by 21.5  percent, and output of heavy industry was 33.338 billion yuan,  an increase of 22.8 percent.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Output of Major Industrial Products                                          |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Industrial economic returns improved further. In 1993, the  comprehensive index of industrial economic returns rose to 78.81  percent from 74 percent in the previous year. The marketing  rate of industrial products was 96.5 percent, the profit  tax rate on capital was 8.67 percent, the profit/cost  ratio was 2.56, the circulation of capital was 1.64 times, the  value-added rate was 25.75 percent, overall labor productivity  in terms of value added was an annual 8,315 yuan per capita.  However, the scale of the deficits of enterprises suffering  from losses rose by 34.4 percent from the previous year.    The construction industry continued to develop rapidly. In  1993, the value added by this sector totalled 2.666 billion  yuan, up by 31.8 percent, of which construction output value was  2.596 billion yuan, up 33.3 percent from the previous year, and  overall labor productivity, in terms of gross output value, was  18,124 yuan, up by 15.9 percent.  <H5>  III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>   In 1993, Jiangxi achieved 17.85 billion yuan of investment  in  fixed assets throughout society (excluding 2.354 billion yuan of  central investment in railroads), up 42.4 percent from the  previous year. Of this, investment in state-owned units was  12.32 billion yuan, up 49.7 percent from the previous year;  investment in local projects was 9.29 billion yuan, up 52.7  percent; investment collectively owned units in townships and  towns was 1.55 billion yuan, up 13.8 percent; and urban and  rural private investment was 3.98 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent  [all figures for fixed-assets investment as published]. There  were 3,980 capital construction, renovation, and transformation  projects in state-owned units across the province, a drop of  12.5 percent.    Construction of basic industry and infrastructure was  further  strengthened. Of investment in capital construction in  state-owned units throughout the province in 1993, investment in  agriculture, energy resources, transportation, post and  telecommunications, raw materials industry, and urban  infrastructure was 4.11 billion yuan, up 75.6 percent. The share  of this investment was 65.2 percent, a rise of 6.2 percentage  points. Of this, investment in energy resources was 1.29  billion yuan, up by 33 percent; investment in transportation,  posts, and telecommunications was 1.35 billion yuan, up 1.2  times; and investment in raw materials industry was 930 million  yuan, up 1.6 times. 1993 was a year in which the building of  railroads and highways in the province was of the largest scope,  with the greatest investment volume achieved. The construction  of the Jiangxi section of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway is in full  swing; the Xiangtang-Jian Railway is about to open; 89.3 km of  track has been completed on the double-track Zhejiang-Jiangxi  Railway; the transformation of several major trunk highways,  including the No.105 state highway, is in full swing; and the  Nanchang Bridge and the Nanchang-Jiaotan sector of the  Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway were completed and opened. Power  construction is progressing smoothly at the Xinyu Power plant,  the Jindezhen Power Plant has been completed, two 125,000-kw  generating sets at the Pingxiang Power Plant were connected to  the power network last September and December respectively, and  four 3,200-kw generating sets at the Jinggangchong Hydropower  station were all completed and put into production.    The construction of key projects made smooth progress. In  early 1993, 78 key projects were in the plan, of which 33 were  capital construction projects, and 45 were renovation and  transformation projects. Twenty-eight projects were totally or  partially completed and put into production, of which 10 were  capital construction projects, and 18 were renovation and  transformation projects. The 33 capital construction projects  involved an investment of 4.54 billion yuan in the year, and  100.9 percent [figure as published] of the annual plan was  completed. Major projects completed were the Pingxiang Power  Plant; Jinggangchong Hydropower Station; Nanchang Bridge; the  Nanchang-Jiaotan sector of the Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway; a  30,000-tonne main body project and two extra-large smelters at  the Dexing Copper Mine under the jurisdiction of the Jiangxi  Copper Industry Company; the Wushan Copper Mine southern ore  belt; the Nanchang Qingyun Water Supply Works, which has a  capacity of 200,000 tonnes daily; and the China Ceramic Sanitary  Ware Plant, which has advanced imported technology and an annual  output of 360,000 pieces. Regarding the 45 key renovation and  transformation projects, an investment of 1.26 billion yuan was  made and construction plans were completed in a comprehensive  way. Several major, key projects were completed and put into  production one after the other, including a production line at  the Huayi Electric Appliance General Company for turning out 1  million condensers; the 75/80 series production line at the  Jiangxi Diesel Engine Plant, which boasts a manufacturing  capacity of 20,000 engines; a production line at the Fuji Auto  Manufacturing Plant, which has the capacity to produce 10,000  light, all-terrain vehicles; a production line at the Xinyu  Cement Works which can produce 60,000 tonnes of portland cement;  and a production line at the Jiangxi Silk Textile Factory with a  capacity to dye 16 million m of silk.  <H5>  IV. Communications, Transportation, Posts, and </H5> Telecommunications    Production in communications and transportation enjoyed  steady growth; however, the restrictive contradiction of  transportation "bottlenecks" remained conspicuous. In 1993,  communications and transportation departments fulfilled a  freight transport volume of of 27.623 billion tonne/km, up 4.7  percent from the previous year. Of this, railway transportation  increased by 8.1 percent, highway transportation dropped by 33  percent, and water transportation dropped by 6.9 percent. The  volume of passenger transportation fulfilled was 15.369 billion  person/km, a drop of 2.4 percent from the previous year. Of  this, railway transportation increased by 16.1 percent and  highway transportation dropped by 25 percent. The volume of  highway and water transportation in departments other than  communications and transportation departments increased rapidly.    Post and telecommunications undertakings enjoyed accelerated  development, with a value of 714 million yuan, up by 41.1  percent on the previous year. By year end, the number of  private telephone subscribers had reached 238,600, up 65,400  from the previous year. The number of new subscribers for pager  and mobile telephone services was 58,900.  <H5>  V. Domestic Market and Consumer Prices </H5>   The market was brisk and active. Retail sales of consumer  goods in 1993 was 27.952 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent from the  previous year (or real growth of 9.1 percent after price rises).  Of this, the volume of consumer goods was 24.362 billion yuan,  up 23.3 percent, of which sales to residents increased by 23.3  percent and to social groups 22.9 percent. Rural markets  continued to warm up, the volume of retail sales of consumer  goods at and below county levels was 14.429 billion yuan, up 20  percent, of which retail sales of agricultural production  materials was 3.591 billion yuan, up by 8.9 percent. Comparing  retail sales volumes for various economic categories with last  year, state-owned economic entities increased by 18.6 percent,  supply and marketing cooperatives increased by 10.7 percent, and  other collectives increased by 9.7 percent; the joint-venture  economy increased by 42 percent, the self-employed economy  increased by 39.9 percent, and retail sales by peasants to  nonagricultural residents increased by 21.8 percent.

The sales volume was 10.098 billion yuan, up  43.15 percent.    Price reform was deepened further. In 1993, the state lifted  restrictions on factory prices for bulk steel products and some  coal prices under unified allocation, railway freight  transportation and power prices were raised, restrictions on  factory prices for cement under unified allocation were lifted,  and crude oil prices were raised. These price readjustment  measures played a very important role in changing price  conditions for basic products, with standards for infrastructure  charges having been on the low side for a long time, and they  promoted the formation of market mechanisms.    The general range of market price rises was comparatively  great, and the general level of social retail prices went up by  11.1 percent from the previous year, with a price rise range 1.9  percentage points lower the national average. The range of  price rises was 12.6 percent in urban areas and 10.1 percent in  rural areas.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Price Increases in 1993                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                                      |Increase Over 1992 ()                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

Consequently, the rational monetary demands of key national  projects, industrial and agricultural production, and the  purchase of farm and sideline products were ensured, while the  tense circulating funds situation in some key enterprises was  relaxed, thus powerfully supporting the sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy. At the end of  1993, savings deposits in various forms in state banks totalled  44.122 billion yuan, which represented an increase of 9.981  billion yuan or 29.3 percent over the figure at the end of 1992.

At the end of 1993, some  4.75 million households participated in household property  insurance programs. Insurance companies handled 320,000 claims  for property losses in various categories, and paid indemnities  of 548 million yuan, thus playing a comparatively good role in  compensating enterprises, households, and individuals suffering  losses and promptly recovering production, operations and making  arrangements for the people's livelihood.  <H5>  VIII.

Notes:    1. Figures in value terms on gross national product and  value added by various sectors quoted in this communique are at  current prices, while growth rates are calculated at comparable  prices.    2. Gross domestic product and value added by various  sectors mainly includes workers wage bills, profits, tax  revenues, and depreciation, but does not include various  intermediate consumption of energy resources and raw materials.  They give expression to the total annual production value of  material products and services used in society. The difference  between gross domestic product and gross national product lies  in the fact that the former does not include net (outside  region) income from overseas.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / MPs' BBC probe extended to ITV THE Commons national heritage committee, which is looking into the future of the BBC, has decided to extend its range to include ITV. Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, and top executives of the leading ITV companies will be called to give evidence when the committee resumes its main hearings in October. Mr Gerald Kaufman, the former Labour foreign affairs spokesman who chairs the committee, said: 'We do not see how you can look at the BBC alone. If you are looking at the BBC then you have to look at the whole spectrum of British broadcasting and see how it will affect the future of the BBC.' ITV companies are now being asked to submit evidence to the committee. The government plans to publish a white paper on the future of the BBC early next year as part of the process of renewing the corporation's royal charter, which runs out at the end of 1996. Earlier this month three senior ITV executives from Central, London Weekend Television and the ITV Network Centre were called before the committee over the proposal to move News at Ten. The executives received a hostile grilling and it is clear that many of issues raised then persuaded the committee that they wanted to hear more.</p>

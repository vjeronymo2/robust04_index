			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Argentina to sell state gas wells: The IADB meeting in Hamburg THE Argentine government has decided to auction more gas wells belonging to the state-owned oil company YPF, before the company's privatisation this year. Argentine officials said the sale was in response to concerns that the company, which holds up to 80 per cent of the country's gas reserves, would be able to exploit its virtual monopoly position in gas once it was privatised. The aim would be to reduce its share of gas reserves to 40 per cent. YPF is the oldest state oil company in the world and its valuation after a radical restructuring - now almost complete - has been put by the government at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.6bn). Gas pipeline and distribution companies were privatised late last year. The government has also set a schedule for the sale of the rest of YPF as a single entity. An initial public offering to international and domestic investors is scheduled for the third quarter of this year. The officials said the government was also studying mechanisms to make sure control of the company was in private-sector hands after the offering, even though the government would remain the largest - though possibly a minority  -shareholder. Possible options included converting the government's remaining shares into non-voting stock, and limiting its representation on the board. Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch are likely to be given the mandate to handle the offering.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Exports to eastern Europe fall by third GERMANY suffered a drastic reduction of almost a third in its exports to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union last year, as a result of the virtual collapse of the economies in that area. Hardest hit were exports from the former East Germany, which were cut by 60 per cent, while overall German exports were down 29 per cent to DM37.9bn, according to the private sector Ost Ausschuss, responsible for promoting trade with eastern Europe. At the same time east European sales to Germany fell by 10 per cent to DM32.9bn. Within those figures German exports to the Soviet Union, as it was, fell by more than 35 per cent to DM18.2bn and imports from the Soviet Union by 20 per cent to DM14.6bn. The figures were published as the economics ministry revealed that Hermes export credits to the former Soviet republics are still completely blocked because of failure to agree with Russia on counter-guarantees. Mr Lorenz Schomerus, head of the ministry's external trade department, blamed differences of opinion within the Russian government, or simply problems of comprehension, for its refusal to confirm an agreement reached in Bonn. The deal provided for standard counter-guarantees by Russia to be given for export credits insured by Hermes. As a result, German exports to Russia and other former Soviet republics, already subject to a DM5bn ceiling on export credits, have come to a virtual standstill since January. Mr Schomerus said 'intensive negotiations' were being reopened and would continue in Moscow next week.</p>

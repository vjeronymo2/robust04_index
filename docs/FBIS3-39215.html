			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F> Giampiero Martinotti in Paris; date not given: "Low Employment  in a `Santa Claus' State"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Martinotti] Mr. Paye, the  American recovery is strong, but the rise in the cost of money  has been received with concern by financial markets. Could this  have negative consequences on Europe?    [Paye] The rise in U.S. interest rates comes as no surprise,  the FED president himself had intimated that it was coming. The  U.S. recovery is vigorous, but the fourth quarter rhythm (5.9  percent on an annual basis) will not be maintained, and it is  better this way, as it is important to avoid inflationary  pressures. The mechanical effect on Europe of a recovery in the  United States is relatively modest, whilst the psychological  effect is substantial, and the rise in rates will probably have  marginal repercussions.    [Martinotti] In Europe, on the other hand, the situation  remains difficult, though for varying reasons from one country  to the next. Is there not the risk of a new tightening?    [Paye] The European landscape is very diverse. We have a  Britain which is experiencing respectable growth, and we have  continental Europe, which is in a far from brilliant situation,  for various reasons. In Germany we have small signs of a  recovery, very limited fluctuations, but I believe what we have  here is a major, in-depth task. A whole series of rigidities is  being called into question, and Germany's industrial apparatus  is growing tougher. Let us not forget the shock which the  country has had to face. France passed through the trough of the  economic cycle six months ago, and there is a beginning of  recovery, but unemployment is still climbing. The French  authorities have continued to make consistent choices, aimed at  long term credibility and European integration.    [Martinotti] And Italy?    [Paye] Seen from the outside, Italy is typified, once again,  by a kind of intrinsic vitality, an economic tissue, a capacity  for individual initiative, and a remarkable and encouraging  spirit of enterprise. The fact that the political difficulties  are reflected on the economic situation certainly comes as no  surprise. This applies everywhere. But the fact remains: the  country's economic basis is full of vitality.    [Martinotti] Many are asking, insistently, for a sharp cut  in  interest rates in order to relaunch Europe's economy. Do you  not feel that the monetary authorities are being overly prudent?  And that a large drop in the cost of money could genuinely  prime the recovery?    [Paye] In France and Germany, during the past 12 months,  rates have come a long way in this direction; long-term rates  are at historically low levels, which is a sign of markets'  confidence. Rates have an influence on economic activity, but  the time frame within which a decrease in the cost of money can  manifest its positive effects is open to debate, and it may be  that, because of the many changes which have occurred on the  financial markets, the interest rate weapon is less important  than it was 20 years ago. Nobody can say that a reduction in  short-term rates has a rapid effect and that the monetary lever  alone can give the desired results.    [Martinotti] And yet, one has the impression that many  countries are continuing to reason as in the past, rather than  being concerned with the problems of the future.    [Paye] In an open world, to be successful, economic policy  depends increasingly on its credibility on international  markets. A country's ability to manage its affairs autonomously  has diminished, hence the fundamental nature of the search for  credibility.    [Martinotti] Is a country like Italy credible, which every  time that it is no longer able to bide by the rules of the game  which it has accepted, resolves its problems with a competitive  devaluation?    [Paye] This is not specifically Italian behavior. Many  countries have devalued. But I repeat: In an open economy,  every country has to offer economic operators sufficiently  stable and secure reference points.    [Martinotti] In a situation like the one Europe is in, with  growing unemployment and a recovery which is slow in showing  itself, is it still possible to maintain a welfare system like  the one we have known so far?    [Paye] We are living in a world economy which is opening  up. In the long term, this is a positive phenomenon, on  condition that one knows how to adapt. The wealthiest OECD  countries believed that the growth of the 1950's and 1960's  would be continuous and therefore continued to strengthen their  social protection systems, and to multiply guarantees. This was  the case in particular in Europe, where adaptability is lower  than is really needed. It is true that this is a political and  social problem. We have to ask people to move, to give up a  little of their comfort. This creates fear, because people ask:  "Change for what?" What is clear is that the solutions cannot  be those which make for further rigidity; otherwise Europe will  remain cut off from the rest of the world and from its  development. We have to incite people to adapt. This is in  itself salutary, but being salutary with the public deficits  which we have means calling into question the social security  system which in Europe is subject to abuse, and which protects  and reimburses in an often excessive fashion. We need a  formidable effort, which will not be done in a day. Governments  must inform, explain, persuade, and pay attention to  marginalized people. Salaries have to be linked to  productivity, but for lowly qualified jobs the problem is to  find a way to integrate an overly low salary so as to make it  into a decent income. There are no miracle solutions.    [Martinotti] What does reforming the welfare state mean?    [Paye] The system has to be changed, there is no doubt. When  it comes to health insurance: Do we need to reduce payments and  control costs or else privatize and maintain a solidarity system  only for those on low incomes? There is a wealth of debate and  analyses, but the OECD is unable to make detailed  recommendations. Every country has its traditions and each one  must make choices based on its needs. The same language applies  to the pensions system.    [Martinotti] You say that you are convinced of the need for  change, but governments appear to be thinking more of the  immediate situation, and not of making changes. Their  overriding concern is monetary stability or other equilibria.  One could almost say that they are looking at the future with  today's and yesterday's eyes, not tomorrow's. That is they are  not planning the future? Does it not seem like this to you?    [Paye] No. Your vision supports state interventionism. I am  much more in favor of giving room for private initiative and  inventiveness. Monetary stability policies set out to  contribute to constructing a stable framework for business.  Governments must provide clear and equitable ground rules:  Inflation and protectionism distort the rules of the game.  Otherwise they should play the role of arbiter.    [Martinotti] Corporate interests and those of society are  not  always one and the same. Right now European companies are  laying off people in order to guarantee their productivity in  the face of competition, but does this approach not contrast  with that of their countries, already afflicted with  historically high levels of unemployment?    [Paye] One must think not only of the destruction of jobs,  but also of job creation. In an economy, 10 percent of jobs  disappear during a year, but another 10 percent are created.  This, of course, is not a crisis situation like we know it now.  But there is no contradiction between the interests of  individual corporations and those of society as a whole.    [Martinotti] But for the last three years Europe has no  longer been able to produce jobs, rather the opposite....    [Paye] Certainly, because it has become overly rigid.    [Martinotti] And perhaps also because companies lay off  people easily, in the knowledge that a safety net exists in the  form of the welfare system?    [Paye] The provident state, the welfare state, no longer has  the financial resources to play the role of Santa Claus. It is  now at the end of its possibilities. I believe that we are  moving toward greater human creativity. I am fundamentally  optimistic. Mentalities are already beginning to change, people  are understanding the need for greater individual  responsibility, that one needs to accept to take risks, that  greater mobility is beneficial to us, and that a change in value  systems is essential.    [Martinotti] To sum up with an image: Europeans must stop  thinking that, when they return home from work every day, they  will find hot soup prepared by someone?    [Paye] No, it is not like that. In order to be sure that  every day there will be someone at home to prepare the soup, one  has to be capable, in a world of rapid change, to demonstrate  initiative, an ability to adapt and research. It is also  necessary that society as a whole be able to demonstrate its  desire to help those who have to make this adjustment, and to  the weakest. We need to work more and differently, but this  does not mean that we will move away from a system of social  protection, conquered with much effort, to the law of the jungle.</p>

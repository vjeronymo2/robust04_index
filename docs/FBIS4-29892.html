			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 21, IRNA -- The ambassador of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) here, K. Yong Roi,  told managing director of the Islamic Republic of Iran  Broadcasting (IRIB), 'Ali Larijani on Tuesday that the U.S. has  private goals behind its avowed concern about nuclear  proliferation, and that it exploits the U.N. as a platform for  pressuring Pyongyang, and also pulls its strings in the  International Atomic Energy Organization in order to make things  needlessly difficult for DPRK.    He said DPRK is interested in talks with South Korea and  that  already many meetings have been held between the officials of  the two Koreas.    Larijani said the Islamic Republic of Iran has valued its  friendly relations with DPRK which, he said, is obviously  annoying to the United States.    He said Iran would all the same continue to support the  anti-imperialist position of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea.</p>

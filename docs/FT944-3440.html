			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hardys &amp; Hansons ahead 10% Hardys &amp; Hansons, the Nottingham-based brewer, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 7.72m during the 12 months to September 30. The 10 per cent increase was achieved on turnover ahead just 3 per cent at Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 31.7m) and took in a Pounds 102,000 (Pounds 78,000) surplus on fixed asset disposals. A revaluation of the group's freehold and leasehold estate threw up a surplus of almost Pounds 31m. Mr Richard Hanson, chairman, said that shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 76.8m at the period end, against Pounds 43.1m a year earlier. A recommended final dividend of 6p brings the total for the year to 9.4p (8.5p), covered 2.2 times by earnings of 20.935p (18.935p) per share.</p>

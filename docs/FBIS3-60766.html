			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A high level government  official revealed that, if another mainland plane is hijacked to  Taiwan in the future, our side will not rule out the possibility  of forced repatriation of hijackers or detaining the entire crew  to put direct pressure on the CPC. Now let us hear the entire  course of the plane hijacking yesterday. The following is a  report by Chien Ting-yuan:    The hijacked plane belongs to Fujian Airlines of the CPC  with  serial number Yun-7/3447. It was piloted by Captain Shen  Shang-ming. The plane carried eight crew members and 42  passengers, including three Taiwanese compatriots. [passage  omitted]    According to suspect Luo Chang-hua, the Kanchou city  government wantonly dismantled people's houses in the past 10  years and his two houses were expropriated four months ago. He  could not find appropriate authorities to make appeals and he  felt discontented. Therefore, he decided to hijack an airplane.    [Begin recording, presumably Luo Chang-hua] Their action  hurt the interests of hundreds of thousands of families. I did  this to show them. In other words, I will request Taiwan,  namely the legitimate government of China -- a government which  advocates humanitarianism, freedom, and a legal system -- to  demand the CPC authorities refrain from continuing their  persecution of the people. They should protect the people. It  is so written in the Constitution, but in fact the people cannot  have such protection. [end recording]    Luo Chang-hua said that he spent 20 days planning the  hijacking. He knew he might be repatriated. He said that even  if he was repatriated he wanted to tell about this unreasonable  fact to the Republic of China Government. Luo Chang-hua said  that he carried iron nails with him and that he would commit  suicide if his hijacking attempt was unsuccessful. He hoped  that his young son could be handed over to his sister-in-law who  is in Taiwan for care. [passage omitted]  As to the little hijacker, Luo Wang-huan, he has already been  handed over to Luo Chang-hua's sister-in-law, who is a resident  of Taiwan, for care.    Regarding the 10th hijacking of a mainland airliner, our  government intentionally lowered the official level in handling  the case. Interior Minister Wu Po-hsiung made a formal  statement in the capacity of convener of the policy group for  dealing with disasters or damage to airplanes in nonmilitary  airports and ships in nonmilitary ports. In his statement, he  clearly stated that hijackers are considered people who  illegally enter Taiwan and will not be allowed to apply for  residence in Taiwan. The government will not rule out that at  an appropriate time in the future, plane hijackers will be  forcibly repatriated. Besides, our side also expressed that, in  the future, we will more carefully investigate and interrogate  people on-board hijacked planes.    This statement explains for the first time our government's  clear stand that hijackers will not be allowed to apply for  residence in Taiwan. Meanwhile, our side stressed that, in the  future, we will make more prudent and detailed investigation and  interrogation and may (?detain) people on hijacked planes.  [words indistinct]</p>

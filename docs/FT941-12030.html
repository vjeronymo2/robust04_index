			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Triple-A derivatives vehicle for Lehman Lehman Brothers has set up a triple A-rated derivatives unit with an innovative structure designed to allay concerns about such vehicles and reduce the cost to the parent. Half a dozen banks have so far established separately capitalised units for trading derivative products, in order to offer credit-sensitive clients a triple-A rated counterparty. Unlike existing derivatives units, trades executed to hedge derivatives exposure will be contained within the Lehman vehicle, Lehman Brothers Financial Products (LBFP). Mr Jim Vinci, managing director in charge of LBFP, said it seemed 'unnatural to separate the hedges from the swap book, so we decided to bring the hedges within the vehicle to make it more sustainable'. As a result, the rating agencies are accepting a lower level of collateral. If the company runs into problems, a contingent manager will continue to run the existing swaps book. In some other structures, such as Salomon Brothers' Swapco, certain predetermined events trigger the termination of contracts. This technically complex innovation could be replicated by other banks. 'It could be grafted on to existing structures,' said Mr Jeremy Gluck, a senior analyst at Moody's. In 1993, Lehman Brothers executed a notional Dollars 360bn of business on its global fixed income swaps book, about 38 per cent outside the US. 'We think that we will experience a substantial increase in business,' said Mr Vinci. LBFP will initially have Dollars 200m in capital.</p>

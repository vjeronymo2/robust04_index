			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AL UNSER JR. NEVER GETS INTO RACE  </P> <P> Everything was going according to plan for the Chevrolet Spice team Sunday. The  Camel Grand Prix of Greater San Diego was about 30 minutes old and a yellow  flag came out.  </P> <P> Perfect, thought Chris Pook, president of Del Mar Race Management, which paid  Al Unser Jr. to race at the fairgrounds for the first time.  </P> <P> Perfect, thought Unser, who immediately put on his helmet and readied to switch  positions with teammate John (Jay) Cochran, whose contract provided that he  begin the race.  </P> <P> All Cochran needed to do was reach the pit area and get out of the car. He  never did.  </P> <P> The Chevy that Unser was getting ready to board crashed alongside Turn 5, where  Ruggero Melgrati, driving a Ferrari Alba, ran Cochran into the wall after 26  minutes of racing.  </P> <P> Unser shrugged when he heard the news.  </P> <P> "I'm just awfully sorry for the Spice team and for Jay," Unser said. "From what  Jay said . . . there was nothing he could do. He was running conservatively and  consistently."  </P> <P> Cochran, who has never won a GT Prototype race, had a six-second lead when it  happened. He knew the crowd of 37,000 came to watch Unser, not him.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for Chris Pook and Al," Cochran said. "The car was brilliant.  </P> <P> "Hopefully everyone will see what happened and that it wasn't my fault."  </P> <P> Cochran was on the inside of Melgrati, who turned left on the chicane and left  Cochran without any options. Melgrati finished fifth in the race.  </P> <P> "He probably tried to pass me on the left; it's neither one of our faults,"  Melgrati said. "I'm just a Camel Lights driver and he's a GTP driver, so he's  right and I'm wrong."  </P></p>

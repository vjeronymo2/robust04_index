			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLASHBACK RELIVING MOMENTS IN L.A. COUNTY HISTORY;  </P> <P> 1917: THE MARCH TO WAR  </P> <P> The record of Los Angeles' participation in the great war . . . is a proud and  inspiring one. It is the record of the achievement of our part of a people who,  until war burst upon them, were utterly without organization for war, but who  succeeded rapidly and efficiently to become a powerful and purposeful  instrument for help in its prosecution. -- Los Angeles Times, Nov. 24, 1918  </P> <P> It was a time before war lost its romance, when the call to arms was still  heard as a summons to great adventure. The first months of 1917 left few  believing that America could stay out of the conflict raging in Europe for  long.  </P> <P> European political and economic rivalries had festered for decades, needing  only a suitable saber to lance the boil. The sword turned out to be the  assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,  in Serbia in 1914.  </P> <P> Austria declared war on Serbia. Russia, in turn, mobilized against Austria,  prompting Germany to declare war on the Czar's empire. France's mobilization  resulted in Germany declaring war on her as well. When Germany moved against  France, England then declared war. Soon, all of Europe was aflame, and the "war  to end all wars" was on.  </P> <P> On April 2, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to declare war, convinced  that the United States must must make the world "safe for democracy." Four days  later, Congress approved the resolution.  </P> <P> Local newspapers boasted of the hometown drive to contribute to the war effort.  </P> <P> "Beginning in April, 1917, our industry was mobilized and our products in vast  quantities delivered to the government for military and naval uses," The Times  article continued. "Common endeavor in a common cause has brought mutual  understanding; the social effect of the self-denial we have practiced will be  enduring and Los Angeles emerges from its task strengthened, united and better  equipped for the great future which awaits it."  </P> <P> By June, 1917 -- two months after the U.S. had entered World War I -- about  42,000 of Los Angeles County's 1 million residents had registered to serve in  the armed forces. Just over half went off to combat, part of the nearly 162,000  troops from California who fought in the Great War.  </P> <P> About 1,300 Californians -- 185 from Los Angeles -- would not return.  </P> <P> The conflict had a dramatic impact on the area's economy. Defense industries  felt the swell of the demand for the instruments of war. In one case, the  Southwestern Shipbuilding Co. at Terminal Island had a wartime contract to  build 23 8,000-ton ships -- in just 77 days. Employment in the shipyards soared  to more than 16,000.  </P> <P> Contributions from Los Angeles County to the war effort ran across the  spectrum: 1,600 engineers, 392 Red Cross nurses and 235 Medical Corpsmen had  their roots in the county. Angelenos -- inspired by posters urging Americans to  "Beat back the Hun with Liberty Bonds -- bought $140,257,000 in Liberty Loans  and War Stamps, donated $500,000 worth of relief clothing and food, and paid  $7,000,000 in war-related taxes.  </P> <P> Seven million pounds of sugar -- worth $657,000 -- were sent to the front. And  28,758,408 gallons of oil from Los Angeles County refineries fueled the  machines of destruction.  </P> <P> Though most World War I veterans have died, there are still thousands living in  California. An estimated 2,400 veterans of World War I are alive and living in  the county today.  </P> <P> Source: Department of Veteran's Affairs, Veterans of WWI, Washington, and  Veterans of Foreign Wars, Los AngelesEDWARD J.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Regulating the Markets (Views from the UK and US): Enforcer rides into town - SIB chairman Andrew Large talks to Robert Peston Mr Andrew Large is intent on proving that a rabbit can tend the City of London's lettuce. This former banker, who as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board is the top regulator of the UK investments industry, plans to establish an 'enforcement culture' within the system. He believes that 'enforcement procedures are too complex'; that the monitoring and prosecuting system is 'too fragmented'; and that 'punishments (of City wrongdoers) have not been enough'. Mr Large has an ideal opportunity to secure improvements. Appointed SIB chairman on June 1, he was almost immediately asked by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to conduct a thorough review of the SIB's responsibilities under the 1986 Financial Services Act, the legislation underlying the regulation of investment businesses. The review was prompted by the failure of City regulators to prevent Mr Robert Maxwell from looting the pension funds of his companies. In his first interview since he began work on the review, Mr Large said his priority was to ensure the SIB had the authority and the resources to do its job properly. This is partly a question of assessing whether the SIB needs new powers and more staff, which he said was 'tremendously stretched'. He said it was equally important to assess whether responsibilities are divided sensibly between the SIB and other officially recognised bodies. These consist of the Self-Regulatory Organisations (or SROs), responsible for ensuring that financial firms are acting prudently and honestly, and the Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs), such as the Stock Exchange, which run financial markets. The SIB's prime role is as a regulator of regulators, to monitor whether the SROs and RIEs are carrying out their responsibilities effectively. But it also monitors a limited number of financial firms itself, notably the big UK banks' investment businesses. Mr Large is starting from the assumption that the Financial Services Act is likely to need amendments, rather than a complete overhaul. IHowever, that does not mean that his proposals - which will be put to the chancellor at the end of March - will not be radical. This was made clear by Mr Large's decision that the review should start with first principles. A small team, headed by Mr Philip Thorpe, who has been seconded by the Securities and Futures Authority, an SRO, will ask consumers, investors, financial practitioners, other regulators and politicians what they expect of the SIB and the other recognised bodies. It will then establish if there is a consensus about the aims and priorities of the SIB and the recognised bodies. Finally it will evaluate whether regulators are failing to meet legitimate public expectations and what can be done to improve their performance. Even before the inquiry is completed, Mr Large is convinced that regulators' priority should no longer be the writing of rules but making sure that 'firms obey them'. 'We need enforcers with a spirit of inquiry,' he said. He wants to attract high-flying young lawyers and accountants to work for the SIB and the SROs, in much the same way as the US Securities and Exchange Commission employs such professionals as supervisors and investigators. In this way, the City's cherished principle of self-regulation - regulation by practitioners for practitioners - would be eroded. However, Mr Large insisted that 'it's a question of getting the balance right . . . We still want some people who have industry experience.' But he is also considering a reform which would strike a stronger blow against self-regulation. Under review is the question of whether financial firms should retain their cherished right to be able to choose which SRO regulates them. The SIB's inability to force any firm to join any particular SRO is contentious at the moment because of an attempt by two regulators - Lautro for unit trust and life companies, and Fimbra for financial intermediaries - to merge and create a super-regulator for retail financial businesses, called the Personal Investment Authority. However, the big UK banks are reluctant to join the PIA, prompting life companies to threaten a boycott. If both groups were absent, the new regulator would be virtually identical to Fimbra, making the merger irrelevant. Mr Large said there are strong 'public interest reasons' for the PIA to succeed. He wants to persuade the banks to join it. But if they refuse, he may attempt to acquire the powers to force them to do so. The PIA problem is illustrative of a wider issue. Mr Large believes the regulatory system contains 'overlaps and underlaps'. He is, for example, concerned that responsibility for preventing the failure of a recognised market to operate properly is not adequately defined in law. The SIB's role in ensuring that investors do not lose money through a market malfunction is not clear, he said, though he is certain the SIB would be blamed if a market did fail. He feels that may be a regulatory 'underlap'. On the other hand, the SIB's direct responsibility for regulating the investment business of banks and certain other financial concerns is an example of regulatory overlap with the SROs. Mr Large said he had 'sympathy with the argument', made by some SROs, that this overlap is unnecessary and that the SIB should withdraw from direct supervision of financial firms and concentrate on its role of regulating the regulators. The way to end these overlaps and underlaps, according to the influential chairman of a big UK bank, is to abolish the SROs and have their functions absorbed into newly created divisions of the SIB. But Mr Large is unconvinced. He believes that the separation of the SIB and the SROs can generate a 'creative tension', with each questioning the other and thereby keeping standards high. However, he said in practice this tension has sometimes been 'destructive' as SROs have complained that they were being second-guessed by the SIB. Mr Large said the solution might be a 'halfway house'. This would involve giving the SIB power to 'prescribe the scope of the SROs' or choose their membership. The SIB would then have to decide how many SROs there should be. Mr Large is not certain that reducing them to two - the PIA for the retail market, with a detailed prescriptive rulebook, the other a more laissez-faire regulator for market professionals - is altogether sensible, though some City firms have argued for such a rationalisation. A merger of the SFA and Imro, regulator of fund managers, would be needed to create the professionals' super-regulator. But Imro's members are market professionals who manage money on behalf of individuals such as pensioners of Mr Robert Maxwell's companies. So Imro's members may need tighter regulation than the SFAs. Indeed, Mr Large also believes there is probably too much regulation of market professionals, and said there is a case for simplifying the SFA's rulebook. So he is not convinced that marrying Imro and the SFA would be felicitous. Mr Large identified a separate inadequacy of the regulatory system as its 'perceived failure' to deliver sufficiently severe punishments to wrongdoers. He said the problem was partly one of public perception. But he accepted that fines levied by SROs on miscreant firms should probably be raised: 'A Pounds 50,000 fine does not mean much.' He is investigating whether the SROs can increase their fines without any change in the law. He is also looking at whether the current process of prosecuting certain City offences through the criminal courts is too slow and ineffective. He said: 'The American model seems better.' In the US, the SEC has the power to prosecute alleged insider dealers and market manipulators - those who use unfair methods to profit from share price movements - under civil law. In civil cases the burden of proof for a successful prosecution is less than in a criminal process and the process is normally quicker. The SEC believes it has two other clear advantages over UK regulators in such cases. It has responsibility for tracking suspected insider dealing cases and for assessing whether issues of new shares and other securities in public companies conform with agreed standards. This means that a large amount of financial and investigative expertise is concentrated in the authority responsible for prosecuting insider dealers and other financial fraudsters. In the UK, however, the identification of possible insider dealers and the share-listing functions are carried out by the Stock Exchange. Mr Large is looking at the possible transfer of these responsibilities to the SIB but he stressed that this is a sensitive issue and no decision had been taken. Indeed, whenever a delicate issue such as this one is broached, he becomes somewhat equivocal. In part, this is because of his preference for change to take place by consensus. But he rejected the charge that he was a City insider incapable of providing proper protection for consumers. He is uncomfortable with the phrase 'self-regulation' as used to describe the UK system. 'I would be very happy if the word 'self' were to be abolished from the Financial Services Act,' he said. 'It does not reflect the reality. If people want to find a new word, then what about 'regulation'?'</p>

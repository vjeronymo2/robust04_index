			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Strengthen </F> Structural Readjustment, Optimize Distribution of Production  Factors, and Strive To Halt Deficits and Maintain Stability"]    [Excerpts] A few days ago, Chen Xitong, secretary of the  Beijing Municipal Party Committee, went to Beijing Copper Wire  Plant to conduct investigations. He fully affirmed the new  change taken place at the plant as a result of the efforts to  halt deficits made by this plant and the nonferrous metal  general company. He again stressed: In a certain sense, the  endeavor in halting deficits and increasing profits is precisely  aimed at ensuring stability and using the new opportunity  brought about by the market economy to accelerate structural  readjustment and optimize distribution of the production  factors. [passage omitted]    With a history of 40 years, Beijing Copper Wire Plant is a  small enterprise producing copper as well as copper alloy wire  and strips. The plant now employs 348 workers. In recent years,  its products have enjoyed good sales and have been exported to  the United States, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions.  It has earned over $1 million every year, and the demand of its  products has exceeded the supply. However, owing to fund  shortages, its output and performance have kept on declining  since last year. In the first quarter of this year, it even  suffered a loss for the first time. After allocating a certain  amount of circulating funds to this plant through the full  cooperation of departments concerned, output in April registered  a 20 percent increase over the average month output in the first  quarter. In addition, the morale of its staff and workers was  stable and they were enthusiastic about production. [passage  omitted]    Chen Xitong said in his speech: Today, after looking at the  plant and hearing the report on the work of this general  company, I have noticed the good spirits of workers and staff  members. From the general company to its subordinate plant,  staff and workers have all been vigorous in halting deficits,  thus effecting an improvement in production and giving rise to a  new atmosphere throughout the enterprise. This is the result of  the concerted efforts of leaders and the working class of the  general company and the plant. I hope that you will keep on  working hard. Facts prove that it is completely necessary to  support the enterprises and trades having good marketing and  good performance, like the Beijing Nonferrous Metal General  Company, by allocating appropriate amounts of circulating funds  to them.    Chen Xitong pointed out: To rapidly popularize the  experience  in carrying out comprehensive reform gained by this first light  industrial general company, the essential idea is to use the new  opportunity and the favorable conditions brought about by the  market economy to carry out structural readjustment and optimize  the distribution of production factors. In the endeavor of  halting deficits and carrying out structural readjustment, we  should resolutely break with the idea of "brand, position, and  face," the idea of "mine, yours, and his," and the idea of  "waiting for higher levels' support, loans, and improved  situation." If we fail to break with these three ideas, we will  lose opportunity, efficiency, and popular support. We should  make cadres more aware in submitting themselves to the central  authorities' general task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting  development, and maintaining stability." We should also clearly  explain to workers that structural readjustment is in agreement  with the essential interest and long-term interest of workers  and staff members. He again stressed: In a certain sense, the  endeavor of halting deficits and increasing profits is precisely  aimed at ensuring stability. We should continue to carry out  the method of resolving problems by looking into both its causes  and signs. At the moment, the most urgent task is to make staff  and workers have something to do, to make enterprises  profitable, to make workers' lives ensured, and to make workers'  income raised on the basis of developing production and  improving efficiency. Otherwise, stability will be impaired and  problems will be hard to be resolved thoroughly.    Then, Chen Xitong discussed with enterprise leaders on the  cross-defaults owed between different enterprises. He also  affirmed the measure adopted by the plant to withdraw loans.

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions THIS WEEK'S table is dominated by directors taking advantage of the new tax year to exercise and sell options. The large sales by nine of the directors of Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker, included disposals by Hugh Armytage, Kevin Grant-Dalton and David Low, who sold Regis Low to SBJ and, under the terms of the sale agreement, were entitled to sell 928,555 shares on or after January 7 1993. They have now sold most of these. Six other directors sold various amounts of stock while the three non-executive directors, including the chairman, made small purchases. Over the past 18 months, the directors of Rathbone Brothers have sold shares to satisfy demand from the market; and the recent disposals by four of them leave the board still owning about 34 per cent of the issued ordinary shares. Shares in Granada Group, the television and leisure company, have continued to perform well. The recent exercise and sale of options by Graham Wallace at prices between 393p and 402p, follows purchases by Charles Allen of 100,000 shares at the end of March and 85,000 in August at prices of 350p and 235p, respectively. Last week also saw an announcement that the finance director had purchased 10,000 at 398p.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                    Sector     Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BAA                         Tran      6,500       51          1 Cable &amp; Wireless            Tele     30,500      218          2* Cater Allen                 OthF     14,435       68          1* Daily Mail &amp; Gen A           Med      7,250      660          1* FII Group                   Misc     13,772       62          1* Glynwed Intl                Metl     28,125       69          1* Grampian Holdings           Cong     18,000       21          1 Granada Group                H&amp;L     36,772      147          1* JIB                         InsB     90,000      174          1* Johnson Matthey             Metl      5,881       26          1 Johnston Press               Med      5,000       26          2 Logica                      Elns     14,000       29          2 Low &amp; Bonar Nil Pd          Pack    275,000      575          1 MB Caradon                  Cong    377,354    1,116          2* Molins                      EngG     16,182       77          1 NFC Variable Voting         Tran      9,168       23          1 Northumbrian Water          Watr     19,900      129          2* P &amp; O                       Tran      5,200       30          1 Porvair                     Chem     15,000       31          1 Prism Leisure Corp           H&amp;L     40,000       43          2* Rathbone Brothers           OthF     80,000      213          4 Schroders                   Merc     40,000      592          1* Southern Water              Watr     12,000       66          1 Spear (JW) &amp; Sons           Misc      8,000       38          1 Staveley Industries         OthI     28,416       67          1* Steel Burrill Jones         InsB  1,031,989    2,415          9 TT Group                    EngG     24,000       62          1 Wessex Water                Watr     23,889      153          2 Wilson (Connolly)            C&amp;C     10,000       16          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Baltic                      OthF    742,823      517          1 Cookson Group               OthI     15,000       29          1 Erskine House               Misc    202,000       62          4 Granada Group                H&amp;L     10,000       40          1 Johnston Grp                BdMa     20,000       22          1 Mirror Group                 Med     50,000       54          1 Steel Burrill Jones         InsB     20,845       48          3 Taylor Woodrow               C&amp;C     65,360       59          3 TI Group                    EngG     10,000       30          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

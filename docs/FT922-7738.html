			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Prospects look good for the private investor - Fund managers give their views THE LONDON stock market has enjoyed a month of euphoria after the re-election of the Conservatives. Even after the share price falls of yesterday and Thursday, the FT-SE 100 Index is still trading over 10 per cent above its level on April 8. The prospect of five years of Conservative government, and of a rebound from the recession, has encouraged traders to buy shares in anticipation of a corporate profits recovery. The FT 500 Index was trading on a historic price-earnings ratio of 16.5 at the close of Thursday's trading, compared with an average of 11.6 since Mrs Thatcher was first elected in May 1979. The yield on the All-Share Index is now around 4.5 per cent, below the 1979-92 average of 4.9 per cent and well below the 5.7 per cent recorded at the start of 1991. So have private investors missed the boat? If they buy shares now, will they be making the mistake that so many have done in the past - that is, plunging into shares at the top of the market? Or do shares still represent good value on a medium or long term view? We asked a number of experienced fund managers to give their views on the likely future direction of UK share prices. Michael Hart, joint manager of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, is hopeful about the view to the end of the year. 'We might get interest rates coming down a bit and see some evidence of profits recovery', he says. However, Hart adds that there is the prospect of a setback in the short term, with rights issues and the occasional bad result, restraining the market. At the start of 1992, he was talking about 2,800 on the Footsie, but now he thinks 2,900 may be possible by the end of the year. Leonard Klahr of Capel-Cure Asset Management says that 'on a valuation basis, the market certainly doesn't look cheap, apart from the yield ratio (the relationship of gilt to equity yields)'. 'There are some good signs, however,' he adds. 'The outlook for inflation is still good, and Wall Street has been performing well.' Like Hart, Klahr feels that the market may be ahead of itself in the short term but he does not see any setback being significant. Julian St Lawrence, who manages the Capital unit trust for Framlington says that 'Footsie is clearly breaking out into a new range, but in the short term will need to consolidate at this sort of level'. There is scope, according to St Lawrence, for the small company shares to catch up with the large company shares. St Lawrence also feels that this recovery may be different from previous cycles. 'In past recoveries,' he says, 'producers of commodity type products saw the benefit of increased margins. 'This time companies may need to see sales grow in order to increase profits.' The task therefore is to look for companies in growth markets or those that can take market share from competitors. Like Hart and Klahr, St Lawrence sees scope for a short-term downturn in share prices. 'If everyone's optimistic then it's not long before people start having their doubts,' he says. Kenneth Inglis, investment director at Allied Dunbar, is optimistic about the long term outlook for the market but does not foresee a swift rise. 'The market is barely 10 per cent higher than it reached in 1987, so we haven't got that far in five years,' he says. So the market is 'hardly ludicrously expensive compared with other markets or even with itself'. However, he thinks those wanting to make big commitments should stagger their investment as a precautionary measure. 'The recovery is likely to be patchy so there may be unpleasant surprises'. But for the most part, Inglis feels that the market should increase steadily in a tempered way with no great upsurge. It is unlikely to take off until small companies come back into the market - for that to happen, the banks have to restore their health and Inglis sees this taking at least another two years. 'The downphase in the US for small companies lasted six to seven years but it is now starting up again. We peaked in the late '80s, so that suggests it won't be until the middle of the decade that small companies come back into the market,' he says. Investors can forget about quick gains. 'They should think of holding their stock in terms of five years rather than three. In fact, the longer the better' concludes Inglis. Paul Laband, deputy managing director at Abbey Life Investment Services, disagrees. 'Normally we would advise investors to keep their investment for at least five years, but my tactical view is that there is money to be made in the next two years in the UK market.' This, he says, is because he anticipates UK gilt yields falling closer to those of Germany (currently around 7.8 to 8 per cent) in over a year's time. If this happens the Footsie could rise to 3,100. 'As we move to lower inflation, risk premiums on equities diminish which has the effect of pulling equities up relative to gilts,' he says. 'Once you are in a low inflation environment the situation changes. Provided there is some growth, you would still anticipate equities giving a higher return than gilts but the differential should narrow.' Richard Hughes, manager of the Recovery fund at M&amp;G Securities, thinks that the rise in the market since the general election will not appear dramatic in the fullness of time. 'In the past year, the market has been up by 10 per cent while the yield on gilts has come down by 10 per cent.' Like Laband and Inglis, he thinks it is a good time for investors to go in. 'Before the election obviously would have been better but equity investment is a long-term strategy. The UK market at the moment is well underpinned by the yield on the All-Share and with inflation falling, it will continue to look attractive. Fundamentally, it's a cheap market,' he says. However, any pauses in the economic recovery could mean setbacks for the market but investors who go in with a view to holding on for the long term will be rewarded. Even in the short-term, 'the return on shares should be comfortably ahead of the building societies over the next 12 months.'</p>

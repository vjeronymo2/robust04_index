			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Second poll for Austrian candidates MR Rudolf Streicher won the first round in Austria's presidential elections yesterday, confirming his status as front-runner to succeed President Kurt Waldheim. But Mr Streicher, the minister for transportation and candidate of the Social Democratic party, failed to win a clear majority and will face the runner-up, Mr Thomas Klestil of the conservative People's Party, in a run-off on May 24. With 98 per cent of the votes counted, Mr Streicher led Mr Klestil with 40.8 per cent to 37.1 per cent. Mrs Heide Schmidt, the candidate of the right-wing Freedom Party, polled 16.4 per cent, and Mr Robert Jungk, of the Green Party, received 5.7 per cent. Mr Klestil, a career diplomat, did far better and Mr Streicher worse than their respective parties in the last elections in 1990. With the voting pattern of the supporters of Mrs Schmidt und Mr Jungk difficult to predict, the outcome of the second round is still open.</p>

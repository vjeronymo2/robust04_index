			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Regulation blamed for stifling new EU jobs Government barriers to competition rather than labour market rigidities explain why recent employment creation has been lower in the European Union than in the US and Japan, according to a study on comparative employment performance published today by McKinsey Global Institute, research arm of the leading international consultants. The report asserts: 'If European countries had matched the job creation performance of Japan and the US over the 1980s without suffering a productivity penalty, their gross domestic products would be 5 to 15 per cent higher and their unemployment problems would have gone away.' The study urges European policy-makers to 'abstain from regulations limiting competition even if they are intended to preserve jobs'. Strengthening general anti-trust regulations and removing barriers to market access 'are important instruments for increasing competitive intensity and overcoming vested interests'. The report examines employment performance in a number of industries, ranging from cars, computers, furniture and banking to film/video/tv and construction. It covers the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, and concludes 'product market barriers play an important role in determining employment levels'. The report says restrictions in Europe have 'inhibited the emergence of new labour-intensive segments' in the film/tv/video industry while in European construction 'the myriad rules and regulations' of land use, building quality, safety, rent and taxes stifled the product market. It adds that in Europe retail trade has been hit by 'restrictive opening hours, excessive zoning restrictions and the veto power given existing retailers' thereby limiting the creation of new jobs. The study also urges reform of Europe's labour market institutions, calling for stricter rules covering payment of unemployment benefit and social assistance and cuts in non-wage labour costs for part-time workers and the low paid. McKinsey also questions a number of widely held assumptions about the alleged inflexibilities of the western European labour market. It suggests job protection regulations do not 'play a major role' in creating rigidities. The study notes: 'While many employers complained about inflexibility in interviews, the evidence showed when companies were forced to react to dramatic changes in the market place, they were able to overcome these barriers. The transaction costs of hiring and firing play a relatively minor role compared to total labour costs.' McKinsey also found that while Europe 'may lack the institutions that can provide temporary workers and in some cases there are restrictions on part-time work, this is not a binding constraint'.

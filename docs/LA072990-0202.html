			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELER'S DIARY: UPDATING TOWNHOMES BRINGS OUT NEIGHBORLINESS  </P> <P> Most homeowners find their biggest surprises come from the cost and the time  needed to complete their remodeling projects. Not me.  </P> <P> While I'll admit to being taken aback by a bid or two, in truth, my biggest  surprises have come from the unexpected benefits of remodeling.  </P> <P> When the city of West Hollywood passed rent-control laws in 1986, a surplus of  condo conversions enabled me and 14 other lucky buyers to purchase charming  two-story townhouses with wooden floors, French windows and unexpected  archways.  </P> <P> On the downside, my charming townhouse also came equipped with 60-year-old  plumbing and wiring, ugly carpeting and a kitchen and bathroom that had been  badly remodeled 30 years earlier.  </P> <P> Even at the rock-bottom prices we paid for our new homes, our budgets were low  and our remodeling needs high.  </P> <P> But because 15 people had bought almost exactly the same home at almost exactly  the same price, we quickly learned about the benefits of semi-communal living.  </P> <P> By sharing resources such as my floor refinisher, Mark's plumber and Paul's  handyman, we were able to develop an extensive network of workers who could do  the best work for reasonable sums of money.  </P> <P> And because the plumber, handyman, floor refinisher had worked the unit next  door or across the courtyard, they could anticipate problems before they ever  occurred.  </P> <P> When the electrical remodeling proved to be an enormous undertaking, our entire  complex banded together to get one bid to complete the whole building. We  decided as a group on the minimum amount of work to be completed in each unit,  to ensure that our new homes were both up to code and safe from such natural  disasters as earthquakes.  </P> <P> Then each homeowner decided for himself or herself about additional work to be  done in each unit -- such as the location of new outlets, installation of new  circuits for computers or garbage disposals, even basic wiring in areas that  will some day be used for expansion.  </P> <P> A tireless and efficient homeowners' association board found the electrical  contractors to complete the task at the promised price and on a reasonable  schedule.  </P> <P> I have also learned to be grateful for my creative neighbors, since their ideas  could often be incorporated into my home. Until Wendy started ripping up the  seven layers of linoleum on her kitchen floor, I would never have considered  the possibility that the original flooring could be oak -- oak that refinished  magnificently.  </P> <P> It was Leslie and Lynn who discovered that the attic could one day be an extra  bedroom, but in the meantime, could serve as a efficient storage space by  installing some basic flooring. And Paul's folding shutters served equally well  in my house to hide the water heater until the kitchen remodeling is completed.  </P> <P> Need a second bathroom? Well, one neighbor turned the master bedroom's walk-in  closet into a charming powder room, while another took advantage of an  odd-shaped nook in the living room. On the other hand, my next door neighbors  turned that same nook into an efficient and convenient laundry center, hidden  behind a newly installed folding door.  </P> <P> Remodeling a kitchen? From the most basic to the most lavish, someone in our  complex has completed the project, so I have had the luxury of learning from  other people's time and money.  </P> <P> When I meet with designers, I can march them from kitchen to kitchen and point  to specific details that I find desirable. And when the bids come back, I know  when they' re too high, and when they're within the range of acceptability.  </P> <P> All this pooled information and shared resources has brought me closer to my  neighbors and created a sense of community that is too often missing in a big  city.  </P> <P> There's a warmth and intimacy that couldn't exist without our shared commitment  to revitalizing and renovating our small complex. And in a few instances, my  neighbors have truly become my friends, adding joy and comfort to my life.  </P> <P> Like every other homeowner, I have learned some unexpected skills as a result  of my renovations. I can tile, replace a faucet and even do some basic wiring.  I have also learned that I can paint a house -- but will never do it again.  </P> <P> By throwing myself into projects with advice and occasional hands-on help from  friends, neighbors and family, I have learned that I have abilities I never had  expected.  </P> <P> When I walk across a bathroom floor that I retiled, it's a constant inspiration  to experiment, to reach beyond my limitations. Just because I haven't done  something doesn't mean I can't.  </P> <P> And when I find out that I either can't -- or won't ever do it again, that's  when I call in the experts. And that's another unexpected benefit of  remodeling.  </P> <P> For every single woman in Los Angeles who has ever complained about meeting  men, I have the solution. Don't hire a matchmaker, hire a contractor.  Innumerable bright, energetic, charming men -- some of them single -- have  crossed my doorstep in the last couple of years, men who not only have a  profession -- but an exceptionally well-paying profession for which there seems  to be an endless demand.  </P> <P> After interviewing contractors and designers about remodeling my kitchen, a man  who had designed and constructed cabinets for friends came over to give me a  bid. I'm still considering the bid, but I accepted an invitation to dinner and  we've been dating ever since. He's been a most unexpected benefit of  remodeling.  </P> <P> Between my remodeling efforts and escalating real estate prices in Los Angeles,  my charming townhouse is now worth roughly three times what I paid for it. I've  broadened my skills, added to my circle of friends and found a warm and  wonderful new relationship all by remodeling. Oh, and by the way, my house  looks a lot better then when I started.  </P></p>

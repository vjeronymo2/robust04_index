			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: US financings set records US COMPANIES raised a record Dollars 420bn in new equity and debt issues during the first half of this year, according to preliminary figures released by Securities Data, the US financial information specialist. In the first half of 1991, Dollars 280bn was raised in new issues, Two factors were behind the record financings: historically low US interest rates, and buoyant stock markets. The lowest interest rates in almost 30 years fuelled a boom in the corporate bonds market, with companies raising Dollars 146bn in 929 issues of new debt, 43 per cent more than in the first half of 1991. Even the much-derided junk bond market enjoyed a banner first half. Offerings of high-yield corporate bonds reached a record Dollars 18.8bn, beating the Dollars 16.7bn raised in the second half of 1986. In the equity markets, the continued strength in prices resulted in a record 603 issues worth Dollars 41.3bn being sold to investors, topping the previous year's first-half record of Dollars 27bn. Initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock also set a record at Dollars 19.6bn.</p>

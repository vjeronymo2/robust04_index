			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that the recent  crisis observed in Turkey's money market is the result of a  failure to establish a good balance between the rate of  exchange, rate of interest, and inflation.    Our correspondent Haluk Koc reports from Switzerland that  Demirel, who is there to attend the World Economic Forum  meeting, held a news conference last night. Demirel pointed out  that the Turkish economy is a growing, developing, and  productive one and that the state's current problems are the  result of borrowing. He stated that the extraordinary situation  observed in the money market recently is the result of a failure  to establish a good balance between the rate of exchange, rate  of interest, and inflation. The president stressed that these  developments are temporary, but should not be taken lightly. He  said: When you are in such a crisis or extraordinary situation,  it is not only logic that is at work; psychological factors are  also extremely important. It is important to have an atmosphere  of trust. Those who take measures will create an atmosphere of  trust. They will deal with the developments vigorously. If  there is anything that has not been done, they will do it. This  is a war.    Demirel pointed out that Turkey has difficulties in  promoting  itself in the world. Certain countries, he said, still fail to  see the struggle Turkey is waging against a murderous gang. The  president said that Western countries recently began to support  the struggle being waged against terrorism. He added, however,  that the developed world took a stand against terrorism in order  to protect its own interests and not to support Turkey. One  reason is that terrorism disrupts public order in those  countries. The second reason is the drug traffic that is  involved in financing terrorism. These countries realize that if  they do not take a stand against terrorism, their people will  continue to be poisoned. These are the reasons why these  countries took the steps they did against the terrorist  organization, Demirel added.    The president pointed out that the chilly relations between  Ankara and Bern can be improved through dialogue and that there  should not be any ill-feeling between states.    Demirel also received the members of the coordination  council  of the Turkish Federations. He was briefed on the problems of  Turks living in Switzerland. He said that the 12 million Turks  living in Europe constitute a bridge between Turkey and Europe  and that the problems they face should not daunt them.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Victim of a guillotine - The Election and You THE GUILLOTINE which cut through the Finance Act last week has claimed a high-profile victim: the Cabot Square enterprise zone trust in Docklands. The legislation necessary was not enacted and on Thursday, Olympia &amp; York, the developers, decided to withdraw the issue, which had aimed to raise Pounds 215m. Investors will be repaid all their money, plus interest. It was an ignominious end to the most ambitious tax shelter scheme attempted in the UK. O&amp;Y, and the trusts' sponsors, Independent Property Securities, had relied on a new ruling that a building would qualify for EZ tax relief even if it was already occupied by tenants. This failed to materialise. Ten, Cabot Square, which the trust was to have bought, already has some occupied floors, so the deal could not go through in its original form. However, the trust could have been restructured so that investors only bought the unoccupied floors. This would have been complicated, but far from impossible. There may have been other reasons why O&amp;Y threw in the towel. Takings, at around Pounds 30m, seemed far short of target for a trust aiming at Pounds 215m. Bad publicity about O &amp; Y's Canadian parent company's financial difficulties did not help. Unfavourable press comment about the structure of the deal (some unjustified), and hostility among intermediaries further damaged the impressive marketing which O &amp; Y and the sponsors had devised. How will this Pounds 215m hole in the market be filled? Laser Richmount, last year's market leader, and US investment bank Merrill Lynch, both seem likely to benefit. The money coming out of Canary Wharf could lead to an influx to other trusts. This, unfortunately, means that haste might be required, even though the choice will be difficult. Important factors include: the strength of the bankers' rental guarantees, the rental yield, (pre-tax relief yields on the market vary from 6.94 per cent to 8.25 per cent), the position of the property, which helps determine prospects for capital appreciation, if the property has been pre-let (an advantage), the credit-worthiness of the tenants. There are seven sponsors in the market, offering property in 11 different enterprise zones. Advice from accountants is essential, even if the polls make you particularly keen to shelter from tax now. Comparisons of the trusts are available from Investment and Tax Publishing Services (0234-218740) and the Allenbridge Group (071-409-1111).</p>

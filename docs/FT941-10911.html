			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (16): Stock market soars to dizzy heights - Brazil When a stock market doubles in a year in US dollar terms, then rises a further 40 per cent in the first few weeks of January, warning bells usually get drowned out by the alarms. But in Brazil, where just such a dizzying rise has occurred, things often happen differently and there is still no consensus on whether the market has been overbought. 'Judging by historic Brazilian standards stocks are now expensive. But compared to foreign markets, where most of the new money is coming from, it's still cheap,' one local broker claimed. Of Brazil's nine stock markets, the Sao Paulo exchange accounts for about 65-70 per cent of trading and is the most modern. Rio de Janeiro accounts for most of the remaining volume. Sao Paulo's main Bovespa index, which tracks the market's 54 largest companies by capitalisation, has gained about 180 per cent in dollar terms in the past 12 months. But, as an indication of the market's volatility, the index has only recently returned to its 1986 level and there have been months in between when it has moved 40 per cent either way. What has driven the latest rally has been an expectation that the government's economic 'shock' plan will bring inflation sharply down from last year's annualised rate of 2,500 per cent. Foreign money has been flooding into Brazil, partly in anticipation of the plan and partly reflecting the worldwide trend towards emerging markets. Finally, there is evidence the private sector is at last becoming more competitive and less reliant on an interventionist state. Foreign holdings more than doubled last year, according to the Sao Paulo exchange, from 8 per cent to 19 per cent of the market's value. The inflow has continued with central bank figures suggesting about Dollars 260m of foreign investment flowed into exchanges in the first two weeks of January alone, a record start to the year. These investors face a problem, however. There are comparatively few large and liquid Brazilian companies quoted. Meanwhile, a poor but improving level of corporate disclosure among smaller second line companies means the race for stock has made the well known shares very expensive. The government-controlled oil company Petrobras, for example, which is Brazil's largest company in terms of turnover, is a key holding in any portfolio. But its shares added 40 per cent in just five days' trading at the start of January, before falling back slightly. Orders in Sao Paulo and Rio can be executed through open outcry or through one of the two exchange's real time screen systems. All trades are monitored by the exchanges, which have a reasonable supervisory reputation among foreign investors. Physical settlement is due on the first working day after the trade and financial settlement is made on the second working day. Sao Paulo's clearing house, known as Calispa, also guarantees settlement through its Operations Settlement Fund. Rio has the same regulations, although its Custody and Settlement Chamber is independent and profit-making. Commission fees due to brokerages vary according to transaction size, while there is a fixed 0.05 per cent transaction fee levied on every trade. Most foreign portfolio investment, is made under Annex 4 of the March 1987 investment resolution 1289. This allows direct foreign investment as long as funds are not used to acquire control of local companies and a Brazilian administrator is appointed. Foreigners are not subject to capital gains or corporate income tax. Withholding tax on dividends is 15 per cent.</p>

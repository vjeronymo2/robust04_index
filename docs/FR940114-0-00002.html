The Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of 25 to 50 percent are not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid development of serious outbreaks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.78 through 301.78&hyph;10; referred to below as the regulations), and quarantined the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles County, CA, in an interim rule effective on November 5, 1991, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 13, 1991 (56 FR 57573&hyph;57579, Docket No. 91&hyph;155). The regulations impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Medfly to noninfested areas of the United States. We have published a series of interim rules amending these regulations by adding or removing certain portions of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, CA, from the list of quarantined areas. Amendments affecting California were made effective on September 10, and November 12, 1992; and on January 19, July 16, August 3, September 22, October 14, November 23, and December 22, 1993 (57 FR 42485&hyph;42486, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;2; 57 FR 54166&hyph;54169, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;3; 58 FR 6343&hyph;6346, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;4; 58 FR 39123&hyph;39124, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;5; 58 FR 42489&hyph;42491, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;6; 58 FR 49186&hyph;49190, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;7; 58 FR 53105&hyph;53109, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;8; 58 FR 63027&hyph;63031, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;9; and 58 FR 67627&hyph;67630, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;10).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have revealed that additional infestations of Medfly have been discovered in the Wilmington area in Los Angeles County, CA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in &sect;301.78&hyph;3 provide that the Administrator of APHIS will list as a quarantined area each State, or each portion of a State, in which the Medfly has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that the Medfly is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the Medfly has been found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with these criteria and the recent Medfly findings described above, we are amending &sect;301.78&hyph;3 by expanding the area that extends through Los Angeles and Orange Counties with the addition of a Los Angeles County area of approximately 101 square miles. The new quarantined area is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Los Angeles County  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That portion of Los Angeles County bounded by a line drawn as follows: Beginning at the intersection of State Highway 91 and Crenshaw Boulevard; then south along Crenshaw Boulevard to its intersection with North Palos Verdes Drive; then east along North Palos Verdes Drive to its intersection with Palos Verdes Drive East; then south along Palos Verdes Drive East to its intersection with 25th Street; then east along 25th Street to its intersection with Gaffey Street; then north along Gaffey Street to its intersection with 22nd Street; then east along 22nd Street to its intersection with Pacific Avenue; then south along Pacific Avenue to its intersection with Bluff Place; then south from this intersection along an imaginary line to its intersection with the Pacific Ocean coastline; then east along the Pacific Ocean coastline to its intersection with the San Pedro Breakwater; then east along the San Pedro Breakwater to the Los Angeles Harbor Light Station; then east from the Los Angeles Harbor Light Station along an imaginary line to the Los Angeles Harbor Entrance East Light; then northeast from the Los Angeles Harbor Entrance East Light along the Middle Breakwater to the Long Beach Harbor Light Station; then north from the Long Beach Harbor Light Station along an imaginary line to the intersection of Harbor Scenic Way and Harbor Scenic Drive; then northwest along Scenic Harbor Drive to its intersection with Queen's Way; then north along Queen's Way to its intersection with Ocean Boulevard; then east along Ocean Boulevard to its intersection with Alamitos Avenue; then northeast along Alamitos Avenue to its intersection with State Highway 1; then east along State Highway 1 to its intersection with Cherry Avenue; then north along Cherry Avenue to its intersection with Willow Street; then east on Willow Street to its intersection with Lakewood Boulevard; then north on Lakewood Boulevard to its intersection with Carson Street; then west on Carson Street to its intersection with Paramount Boulevard; then north on Paramount Boulevard to its intersection with State Highway 91; then West on Highway 91 to the point of beginning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

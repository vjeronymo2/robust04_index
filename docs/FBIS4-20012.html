			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Regarding Bosnia, on the diplomatic level a  meeting is taking place right now in London. [passage omitted]  The American and British representatives said the Serbs should  give back part of the occupied territories. As for France, the  efforts of the alliance might be salutary and make us forget  last week's errors of judgement:    [Begin Juppe recording] A mistake was made in Gorazde. The  operation launched by the Serbs was underrated -- it was an  operation of aggression -- while all the conditions were met for  us to strike quickly and hard. The reaction came late and in  small doses. So it is necessary to draw lessons from this for  the future. By Wednesday [27 April], the Serbs must withdraw by  20 km in Gorazde. We shall be extremely vigilant. This also  means that should there be the smallest attack on the other safe  areas, what tragically took place in Gorazde must not be  repeated; that is, we must not procrastinate, we must react  quickly and resolutely. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

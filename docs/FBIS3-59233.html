			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at the chief </F> of the General Staff's Office on 28 January -- recorded]    [Text] At 0900 this morning, our Air Force hit the Zhalah  camp. As you know, the Zhalah camp recently replaced the  al-Biqa' Valley. The terrorists were being trained and  sheltered in this camp, and they were providing logistics  support to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization in  Turkey. Approximately 1,600 terrorists were nestled there. We  also received intelligence information to the effect that the  leaders of the PKK were among these terrorists. We also know  that of the 1,600 persons, approximately 300 were armed, female  militants.    Our Air Force launched an operation at 0810 this morning.  Our planes took off and the Zhalah camp was bombed at 0900.  This operation will continue. To my satisfaction, I was  informed a while ago that the operation was completely on target.    This was a political decision, and it had to be made. As I  stated earlier, 1994 must be an important turning point in the  struggle against terrorism. In order to turn 1994 into a year  in which terrorism is placed under control, we, on one hand,  waged our struggle abroad on a diplomatic level by explaining  our just cause and, on the other, displayed our political  determination today by hitting the Zhalah camp, which had become  the most important region providing logistics support for the  PKK.</p>

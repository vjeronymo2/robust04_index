			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> RESULTS OF FIRST FARMERS MARKET PLEASE MERCHANTS  </P> <P> Whittier held its first farmers market, and the results were better than  merchants had hoped, said Janet Crossman, office manager of the sponsoring  Whittier Uptown Assn.  </P> <P> "We had a thousand people," she said.  </P> <P> "It was wonderful." Crossman said the 15 vendors sold $5,000 worth of  merchandise. "They were so shocked they couldn't believe it."  </P> <P> Twenty vendors have signed up for the next market, which operates from 9:30  a.m. to 1 p.m. Fridays on Bailey Street between Greenleaf and Comstock avenues.  </P> <P> Because the market is certified by the state, Crossman said, the produce for  sale must pass regular state inspection in order to minimize any danger of  spreading agricultural pests, such as the mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> Organizers hope the market will do more than inspire the purchase of locally  produced eggs, strawberries, honey, nuts and flowers. The idea is to get  shoppers downtown again, to boost a city-center economy that was already  hurting before the October, 1987, earthquake decimated buildings and  businesses.  </P> <P> For one day at least, "the cash registers were ringing like crazy all over  town," Crossman said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY MEDICAL ASSN. SEEKS TO SOLVE HOSPITAL TURN-AWAY CRISIS  </P> <P> Decrying the crisis over medical care for the poor, the Orange County Medical  Assn. announced Friday that it will hold special meetings to try to solve the  immediate problem of women in labor being turned away from overcrowded UCI  Medical Center.  </P> <P> "This is not a UCI problem. It is more than the poor obstetrical patients. This  is a very real demonstration of the failure of the state government to be  responsible for the care of the people in this state," association President  Dr. Russell C. Ewing II said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> "This is not a time to point fingers or to express astonishment at UCI's  actions. The dam is broken. There is no place to run. We are all affected. The  well-being, the very health of people, is at stake, and we must respond."  </P> <P> The prepared statement said Ewing and the president of the county's society of  obstetricians and gynecologists have called a special meeting with  "professional representatives to address stemming the immediate problem."  Afterward, the Orange County Medical Assn. will meet with county and state  officials. "Accountability will be demanded," the statement said.  </P> <P> Ewing and other association officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In a related development, a UCI Medical Center spokeswoman said Friday that  Medi-Cal officials have rejected a plan to divert some of the overflow  patients. UCI had asked to subcontract with AMI Medical Center of Garden Grove  to handle up to 100 "low-risk deliveries" a month. The AMI hospital does not  hold a contract with Medi-Cal to be reimbursed for treating indigent patients.  UCI spokeswoman Susan Meister said hospital officials were notified of the  decision Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> Michael Murray, executive director of the California Medical Assistance  Program, which negotiates Medi-Cal contracts with hospitals for the state, said  that request was turned down because the arrangement "was not in the best  interest of the contracting program."  </P> <P> He said UCI was asking to send patients to another hospital and yet collect  more from Medi-Cal than UCI would pay the AMI hospital -- in effect, making a  profit.  </P> <P> "Some would say that's selling medical patients," Murray said. "There are other  means to solve the problem, and this would not solve it anyway."  </P> <P> Murray said the arrangement was for the AMI hospital to handle only low-risk  births, but since UCI handles so many patients with no prenatal care -- making  them susceptible to complications -- there was "no guarantee" that the patients  involved would not be high-risk. Further, he said, the proposed arrangement  would have sent an average of four patients a day to the Garden Grove hospital,  when UCI has had up to eight more obstetrical patients a day than it is  licensed for. "So this is not a solution in and of itself," he said.  </P> <P> But UCI's Meister countered that "any help would be welcome."  </P> <P> If the Garden Grove hospital could take four patients a day, "that's all that's  needed to get us out of a crisis. We're still willing to do more than our  share, but we can't operate at this level with our staff and our space without  creating a safety problem," Meister said.  </P> <P> She said the agreement with the AMI hospital would have allowed the Garden  Grove facility to transfer any high-risk patients to UCI. Further, Meister  questioned Murray's contention that UCI would profit financially.  </P> <P> She said UCI officials were told the commission turned down the subcontracting  arrangement only because the agency did not want to set a precedent.  </P> <P> "Is it more important to get this taken care of than to haggle over Medi-Cal  rates? The key was to get people taken care of," Meister said. "It's a setback  that only aggravates the situation, which is grave."  </P></p>

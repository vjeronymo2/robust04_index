			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae buys Dollars 1bn of mortgages from Citicorp THE Federal National Mortgage Association has agreed to buy Dollars 1bn of new mortgages from Citicorp on a non-recourse basis, an indication that credit standards at the bank's troubled mortgage unit may be improving. Although Fannie Mae has bought non-recourse mortgages in the past from many other US banks, the deal is the first between the company and Citicorp. Buying mortgages on a non-recourse basis means that if some of the loans should sour, Fannie Mae cannot return them to Citicorp. It also means that the bank does not have to set aside capital against the sold mortgages, as would be required with normal transactions. Citicorp said the deal would save the bank about Dollars 25m in capital costs. Industry analysts said that the deal was a sign that market confidence in the quality of Citicorp's mortgage portfolio may be growing. For years, financial institutions have only bought mortgages from Citicorp that could be returned to the bank in the event of default. Only a few months ago, a government examiner's report on Citicorp was highly critical of its mortgage unit, a report that underlined the credit problems at the bank. It is believed that Fannie Mae agreed to buy the Dollars 1bn of mortgages because they were originated recently. In the past year, Citicorp has dropped its old strategy of trying to build volume by originating loans with a minimum of documentation about the borrower, and has significantly raised its standards for mortgage seekers. Citicorp originates about Dollars 8bn of new mortgages every year, and most of them have been sold in the secondary market on a recourse basis. However, some institutions continue to boycott Citicorp mortgages. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Fannie Mae's main competitor, refuses to resume any kind of mortgage deals with the bank until Citicorp has addressed 'control and management issues' at its mortgage unit.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THREE-YEAR PACKAGE FOR MEXICO'S DEBT  </P> <P> The bank committee evaluating Mexico's massive foreign debt said Wednesday that  it has agreed on a three-year plan to finance $48 billion in commercial bank  debt and will send the pact to 450 creditor banks for their expected approval.  </P> <P> Signing of the agreement was expected in early February, said the announcement  by Mexican Finance Ministry undersecretary Angel Gurria and William Rhodes,  co-chairmen of the 15-member bank committee for Mexico.  </P> <P> Gurria and Rhodes said virtually all of Mexico's 450 bank creditors worldwide  have committed to the package for 1989-92, which covers basically all the  nation's medium- and long-term commercial bank debt of about $48 billion.  </P> <P> If the package garners the expected bank approval, it will bring significant  debt relief to Mexico and represent an important victory for the debt-relief  program championed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.  </P> <P> The Mexican debt plan is seen as the first full implementation of Brady's  well-received approach and as a model for solving the Third World debt crisis.  </P> <P> Mexico and its commercial bank creditors reached a tentative agreement July 24  under which Mexico would be granted a 35% reduction in its $53-billion  commercial debt. The commercial bank advisory committee for Mexico was charged  with working out the details of the tentative pact.  </P> <P> Mexico's foreign debt totals $104 billion, about $51 billion of it owed to the  World Bank and other international organizations.  </P> <P> The status of the $5 billion in commercial bank debt not included in the  package announced Wednesday was not disclosed.  </P> <P> Rhodes and Gurria praised what they called the ground-breaking work of the  commercial bank committee. "The positive response is unprecedented in any  package of this magnitude since the debt crisis broke out in August, 1982,"  Rhodes said.  </P> <P> Of the three basic options offered to banks in the package, about 41% of the  total exposure has committed to principal-reduction bonds, about 49% to  debt-service-reduction bonds and about 10% to new money, the announcement said.  </P> <P> "The package offers Mexico the support it needs from the commercial banks to  carry out its program of economic reform and growth, to leave the debt crisis  behind it and to look with confidence to the future," Gurria said.  </P> <P> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in December, 1988, in the midst  of Mexico's debt crisis, but resisted intense pressure to declare a moratorium  on debt payments.  </P> <P> "I will avoid confrontation," Salinas said in his inaugural speech. "But I  declare emphatically and with conviction that the interests of Mexicans come  before those of (foreign) creditors. The priority now will be not to pay, but  to return to growth."  </P></p>

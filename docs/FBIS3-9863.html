			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [KONTINENT staff report] </F>   [Text] Violations of the foreign exchange regulations are  taking place on a colossal, massive scale, Professor Todor  Vulchev, governor of the Bulgarian National Bank [BNB],  announced yesterday. The foreign exchange bureaus will be  closed down and finance houses will lose their licenses, he  claimed. He was referring to finance houses that were dealing  without permits.    About 80 of the almost 200 finance houses are operating  without licenses. The prosecution service is supposed to  intervene, but in the absence of any sound, stable  administration and police apparatus it is difficult to implement  penal sanctions, Vulchev claimed.    Of the 1,253 companies that have registered currency  exchange  bureaus, only 646 have supplied figures on the scale of their  foreign exchange operations completed in 1993, as required by  the BNB. If the others fail to present the information by 15  April, we will take away their licenses, Vulchev told the  journalists.    Vulchev said that a major violation of the foreign exchange  controls had been established in a large state bank. No  documents were available for 50 percent of its forex operations.  The head of the bank's legal department claimed that he had not  heard of Council of Ministers Decree No. 15 that controls forex  operations in Bulgaria. The bank in question had transferred a  considerable amount of money abroad for a client who had sold  real estate. The fine for violations of this kind is up to  500,000 leva. Experts point out that the Finance Ministry can  impose such a fine by ministerial decree.</p>

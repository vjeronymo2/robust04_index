			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Italian Government Bonds: Sentiment strong despite government action THE ITALIAN government bond market appears to have performed impressively this year in spite of, rather than because of, the actions of government. The cabinet crisis in April which forced the formation of Italy's 50th post-war government has threatened to delay several important bond market reforms, including procedures for reclaiming 12.5 per cent withholding tax paid by overseas buyers. Perhaps more seriously, the formation of a four-party coalition had delayed agreement on spending cuts designed to rein in this year's budget deficit. This weekend, however, the new cabinet agreed a budget package to bring the deficit back to the target of L132,000bn, or 10 per cent of gross national product. Before the cabinet agreement, bond yields had continued to fall. The first 10-year government bond issue launched in February at a net yield of 12.64 per cent currently yields around 11.6 per cent, 10 basis points lower than at the end of April. Analysts say lower yields stem from consistent overseas buying of Italian government paper. As in other higher-yielding markets such as Spain, international buying has been based on the view that exchange rate co-operation will force yields down to the level of the lowest-yielding market in the European monetary system - Germany. 'A lot of international fund managers have accepted the idea of convergence of European bond markets and are shopping around for bargains,' said one London-based money manager. 'Fixed-income investors have taken to behaving like equity investors.' The inflow of foreign funds into Italy has meant an easing of short-term interest rates, with three-month money rates falling from 11 3/8 per cent in late April to 10 7/8 per cent last week. Yesterday the Bank of Italy cut the discount rate by one percentage point to 11.5 per cent, effective today. Overseas buying has also been in evidence in the Eurobond market, where borrowers such as Volkswagen, Barclays Bank and Credit Local de France, have tapped international demand for Lira-denominated securities. The Euro-lira sector has been dominated by supranational borrowers such as the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. Italian investors do not pay withholding tax on bonds issued by these agencies. The Italian currency has rewarded the faith of international investors by remaining strong, within the limits of its 2.25 per cent divergence limit against the D-Mark. The lira is the second strongest currency within the European exchange rate mechanism, after the peseta. From L760 against the D-Mark at the beginning of 1990, the Italian currency now stands at around L740. However, dealers suggest this buoyant mood is fragile. It has been spurred by the anticipation that tax barriers to international investment will be dismantled. Delay could turn sentiment. Equally, convergence of European bond markets depends on economic and monetary integration. Any hint that Italy will not play a full role in the next stage could leave the government bond market exposed. Italy's record of economic management has been criticised by the International Monetary Fund and the Bundesbank. Hence agreement on the package of spending cuts by the cabinet could be crucial to sustaining the confidence of bond market investors.</p>

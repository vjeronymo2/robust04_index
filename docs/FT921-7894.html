			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Unigestion net income ahead 58% UNIGESTION Holding reported a 58 per cent jump in net income to SFr18.7m (Dollars 12.50m) in 1991. The Swiss group was created by the Geneva-based finance company of the same name following its sale last May of the controlling stake in Banca della Svizzera Italiana, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The directors have proposed a 52 per cent increase in the dividend to SFr5 from an adjusted SFr3.3. Unigestion Holding last August gave shareholders of the old company seven of its bearer shares for each one of the old company. Consolidated total assets stood at SFr514m at the end of the year, of which SFr208m were invested in securities, SFr130m in cash and approximately SFr137m in loans. No provisions were necessary last year, and shareholders' funds stood at SFr300m, or SFr126 per share. Consolidated sales of Bobst, the Swiss paperbox machinery maker, rose 9.1 per cent in 1991 to SFr1.1bn, due partly to the easing of the Swiss franc. The group said in a statement it also expected improved profits. The 1991 figures are based on EC accounting standards, and eliminate Bobst Brazil from the consolidation. These changes, if applied to the 1990 figures, would cause a net reduction to consolidated sales of SFr41m.</p>

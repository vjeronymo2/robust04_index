			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- At today's Federal  Government session, chaired by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, the  government reviewed a report on current issues concerning the  position of members of the nations of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia [FRY] in other countries, as well as the position of  members of the Serb and Montenegrin nations living in the  territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, which are now outside the territory of Yugoslavia.    The Ministry of Information has announced that on the basis  of this report and the ensuing discussion, the Federal  Government will adopt special conclusions at one of its future  sessions. [passage omitted]    In a report dealing with requests by certain international  bodies and organizations to send permanent missions or  representatives to Kosovo-Metohija, the government noted a clear  tendency to put forward such requests to replace the suspended  CSCE mission.    The government concluded that for reasons of principle the  FRY cannot accept requests for a CERD [as received] mission and  UNESCO representatives to be sent to Yugoslavia and to have a  seat in Kosovo-Metohija because Yugoslavia as a state is not  allowed to participate in the work of these bodies and  organizations as an equal participant.    As proof of good will, the Federal Government concluded that  Yugoslavia still expresses full readiness for dialogue and more  intensive cooperation on an equal basis with those bodies and  organizations -- of which Yugoslavia is a signatory, initiator  and founder -- which is in mutual interest and in the interest  of peace, security and cooperation in Europe and the world.

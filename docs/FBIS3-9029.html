			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 16 Mar (MTI) -- AWACS surveillance  aircraft patrolling the airspace of Hungary, among other  countries, have a U.N. mandate to continually assist and monitor  observance of the flying ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina. These  planes are not directly involved in carrying out airstrikes, a  NATO spokesman told MTI.    Brussels was responding to a group of Hungarian journalists  reporting, on the basis of information from a high-ranking NATO  general, that AWACS aircraft on duty in Hungary's airspace also  had a part in the downing of four Bosnian Serb jets on February  28.    (Hungarian Army commander Lieutenant-General Janos Deak  stated in the March 2 issue of the daily MAGYAR NEMZET that  there was no connection between NATO planes involved in the  February 28 air battle and AWACS on a surveillance mission in  Hungary that time.)    NATO sources, who requested anonymity, called attention to  the basic difference between the defensive task of controlling  the no-fly ban under a U.N. decision, and a possible offensive  action like the airstrike threatened in NATO's February 9  resolution, which finally did not take place.    As the U.N. resolution allowing AWACS to stay over Hungary  applies only to the former case, participation of surveillance  planes in offensive operations was necessarily out of the  question.    The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's Press Department said in a  statement sent to MTI on Wednesday evening:    NATO's AWACS aircraft have been patrolling Hungary's  airspace  for about one and a half years with the permission of Hungary's  government based on a parliamentary resolution. Their exclusive  task is to assist implementation of the U.N. Security Council's  decisions Nos. 781, 816 and 836 by monitoring overflights of  prohibited areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Accordingly, they are aiming to observe violations of the  no-fly ban imposed by the U.N. Security Council.    The activity of AWACS planes was limited to this even during  the February 28 events.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation worries hit M&amp;S Disappointing headline results from Marks and Spencer, together with a cautious statement, saw the shares fall in busy turnover of 8.5m yesterday. Profits of Pounds 851.5m compared with forecasts of Pounds 865m contained a surprise increase in the pension contribution. Otherwise analysts declared themselves fairly satisfied with the underlying performance. But the shares closed 12 1/2 off at 412p as some investors took their cue from Marks' remarks that cost price inflation is returning to the retail market. 'Some institutions think they might have a racier ride in some of the more undervalued and risky stores stocks,' said one dealer. Analysts kept their 1995 forecasts in the Pounds 940m to Pounds 960m range, although a number did lower their performance rating in the light of the company statement.</p>

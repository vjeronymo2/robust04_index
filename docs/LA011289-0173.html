			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLUT OF GLOVES PUTS SQUEEZE ON MEDICAL SUPPLIER'S PROFIT  </P> <P> A medical supplier that profited from an AIDS-induced shortage of latex rubber  gloves says it expects to report a big loss because a glove glut has emerged,  leaving it with mountains of unsold merchandise.  </P> <P> "We have millions of gloves -- and more arriving," said John Murray, vice  president for finance at Moore Medical Corp.  </P> <P> Moore Medical Corp. had profits of more than $4 million a year in 1986 and 1987  and pretax earnings of $3.1 million in the first three quarters of 1988, but it  has alerted stockholders to brace for a loss in the final quarter and for the  year.  </P> <P> The company said a one-time charge in the fourth quarter would be in the range  of $7 million to $11 million, or $4.3 million to $6.8 million on an after-tax  basis.  </P> <P> Moore's situation is typical of that of many medical supply firms.  </P> <P> Publicity about coming in contact with AIDS-contaminated bodily fluids created  an unprecedented demand for the gloves last year. By spring, Moore Medical and  other distributors were rationing gloves to customers at a few boxes per order.  </P> <P> "We doubled and tripled up on orders to suppliers," Murray said. But then  supplies from new factories in Asia began arriving. By late fall, he said, "all  of a sudden a lot of our orders were coming in (and) what had been close to  zero supply became a glut."  </P></p>

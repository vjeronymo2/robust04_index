			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Tougher regulation urged for tankers: Safety standards at sea criticised THE GROUNDING of the tanker Braer off Shetland yesterday has led to calls for the UK to tighten its restrictions on allowing ageing tankers into environmentally sensitive areas. The Merchant Navy Officers' Union said a steep decline in maritime safety standards had resulted in a huge increase in the number of sub-standard ships in British waters. The Oil Pollution Act, which was passed in the US in August 1990 in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez tragedy, will phase out the use of older, single-hulled tankers at US ports over the next 15 years. It also restricts the use of single-hulled vessels in environmentally fragile areas. The Braer was carrying 619,300 barrels of oil - more than double the 300,000 barrels spilt by the Exxon Valdez, which ran aground off the coast of Alaska in 1989. The Braer, which was built in 1975, had been in good condition with no previous record of serious accidents, according to Mr Norman Hook at Lloyd's Casualties. But, like most of the world's ageing tanker fleet, the Braer was a single-hulled vessel without the added protection of an outer casing, which minimises the risk of oil spills. Under rules introduced by the United Nations' International Maritime Organisation in March last year, this type of tanker cannot now be built, and all new tankers must have double hulls. Mr Roger Kohn of the institute said: 'There is some concern that the existing tanker fleet is getting older and there is a big gap between pollution control standards on old and new vessels.' The institute rules require that all existing tankers be brought up to the same pollution control standards as newly built double-hulled vessels by 1995. That involves extensive refits to the world's fleet of tankers, estimated to cost Dollars 80m (Pounds 52m) a vessel. The institute has rejected US insistence that all existing tankers be fitted with double hulls in favour of retaining more options such as refitting tankers with hydrostatic controls which equalise the pressure in the oil tank and outside in order to minimise oil spills. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on environmental protection, asked why the UK government had not followed the US administration in learning the lessons from the Exxon Valdez disaster and tightened controls on oil tankers. 'I insist they (the government) now adopt the rules the United States have already implemented,' he said.</p>

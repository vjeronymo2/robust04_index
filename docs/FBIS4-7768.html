			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Janina Paradowska: "Taming the Peasant Party: A </F> Ruling Party Still Desires Power"]    [Excerpts] Were a poll to be conducted nowadays among  politicians from various parties, both those inside and outside  the parliament, and were they asked a single question--namely,  which political party is the greatest threat to market reforms  and Poland's modernization--most would unequivocally name the  Polish Peasant Party (PSL) and the Confederation for an  Independent Poland (KPN). But, because the KPN suffered a defeat  in the recent elections and is now perceived as a fringe party,  the focus nowadays is on the PSL, a ruling party.    This is not a novel assessment of the PSL because that is  how  it has been perceived, more or less, for the past few years.  Paradoxically enough, it has always been one of the most  desirable partners for, properly speaking, all of the coalition  governments, starting with the Tadeusz Mazowiecki administration  and ending with the cabinet of Hanna Suchocka. During that  entire period, the post-Solidarity groupings followed the same  tactic of badmouthing the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] and  lauding first the ZSL [United Peasant Party] and then the PSL as  a party that has won credibility, broken with its past, and is  now an equal partner in the new democratic order. It could even  be said that the PSL had no enemies.    Thus, the PSL owes its current standing to not only the  economic situation and the ability of that party to flirt with  every political alignment but also to its courting by many  Solidarity politicians. They would say, "Without the PSL, Poland  cannot be governed and the countryside modernized," and they  attributed the defeat of the entire Solidarity movement to,  among other factors, its evolution into a large number of  parties of the still nonexistent middle class and its failure to  create a political grouping attractive to any substantial  segment of the rural electorate.  <H5>  A Painless Transformation </H5>   It is even my impression that for years there existed a  strange belief that the PSL could be tamed by being gradually  involved in governance and, on the occasion, made docile.  Accordingly, the radical and claimant comments of PSL Deputies  Jacek Soska and Wlodzimierz Wiertek were viewed as mere  curiosities, while substantive negotiations were under way with  Aleksander Luczak, who was erroneously believed to be more  representative of the dominant thinking within the PSL.    In such a situation, the PSL was bound to succeed, and this  success has many fathers. To this day, the difference between  the SLD and the PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] persists in  social awareness, whereas the transformation of the ZSL into the  PSL occurred so painlessly as to surely amaze its own members.  It is simply that there has always been the PSL, whereas the ZSL  became just one of the episodes in the history of the peasant  movement. In the course of 100 years of existence of the peasant  movement, there were as many as 45 peasant parties; the parties  were short-lived, but people remained attached to the populist  tradition. After all, some 100 members of the former Mikolajczyk  [1945] PSL and entire field branches have been incorporated in  the present-day ZSL, and, as even the most deserving ZSL  activists say, "This shows clearly where our roots lie."  Solidarity activists, who are in the opposition nowadays, judge  otherwise; they say that, if there is any political party that  remained unscathed by the recent period of tumultuous changes on  the political scene and has retained its  nomenklatura, it is the PSL, and they point out that,  even among the social democrats, the internal changes have been  more extensive.    The truth about the present-day PSL lies between these two  extreme opinions, although it is immeasurably difficult to  discover, owing to both the obvious tendency to erase the past  and the greatly different ways of thinking about the future.    The most that is known about the party concerns its  organizational status and structure, even though, for example,  its officiating Deputy Chairman Wincenty Stawarz has offered the  caveat that the related figures are incomplete and that he will  have more information only a few months hence because  "organizational status is being determined." According to  available data, the PSL has a membership of 250,000, of whom an  unknown proportion pay dues of 10,000 zlotys [Z] monthly (for  retirees, the dues are Z5,000). Among that quarter-million, only  some 10,000 are party activists, meaning members who respond to  every call and who are "experienced activists, not  rabble-rousers like Lepper." It is not known how many of them  used to be ZSL activists. Before 1989, the ZSL had a membership  of about half a million, but on paper only, so to speak. After  1991 [its transformation into the PSL], it gained some 50,000  new members; this influx was undoubtedly due to the new  proactivism among members of the former Mikolajczyk PSL, who  brought in the young on their coattails. At any rate, PSL  members are chiefly rural and small-town inhabitants. Farm  laborers account for 10,000 and the intelligentsia, chiefly  rural and small-town, for 20,000. In Warsaw, there are 3,500  members, and undoubtedly the nation's capital is a white spot on  the PSL's map. The PSL's traditional strongpoints are in  southern and southeastern Poland. All of these figures appear  inconsistent and incompatible.  <H5>  No Debts </H5>   There are 49 voivodship PSL boards at present, and each  maintains its own office. [passage omitted] In the opinion of  other political parties, the PSL is a rich party precisely  because it survived as a nomenklatura grouping under  the new order. However, its headquarters on Grzybowska Street  [in Warsaw] has a "homespun" and far from luxurious look, and  there are about 20 persons, including clerical employees, on its  salaried staff. In the field, most offices are exercised on a  volunteer basis, and their directors are on half-pay.    The PSL prides itself on having no debts. It owes no money,  but neither does it have money for publishing its own press, a  dream of most of its members because many activists believe that  the problems with achieving rapport with public opinion would be  solved once the party publishes its own daily, that once the PSL  publishes a newspaper of its own and has a press spokesman of  its own, its media image would be improved. The matter is  considered so important that one of the major and most heated  discussions held within the PSL leadership after the elections  specifically concerned appointing a press spokesman.    The image of a party greedy for power and offices and  lacking  a program of its own other than the promotion of [peasant]  interests, an image propagated by both politicians and the  media, does not for the time being seem to prevent the PSL from  winning social support.  <H5>  Without Beating About the Bush </H5>   The PSL is the sole party to have gained rather than lost  since the elections. That is because, to the conservative rural  and small-town electorate, it matters greatly that Waldemar  Pawlak [PSL] is the prime minister, like [Wincenty] Witos [a  popular prewar peasant movement leader], under whose portrait  the prime minister liked to be photographed. [That electorate  believes that Pawlak] is a good prime minister, but the liberals  from the SLD--i.e., from the former PZPR--are obstructing him.  Professor Mikolaj Kozakiewicz (PSL) put it as follows, without  beating about the bush: "The PSL is suspicious and mistrustful  toward all other parties. It cannot stand the Democratic Union  and the Liberals, and, at the same time, it finds the SLD  unbearable because it feels hostile toward its previous master,  and its recent experiences provide proof of dictatorial  intentions on the part of the SLD."    The PSL is nowadays a party that undoubtedly is aware that  most actors on the political scene perceive it as wielding  destructive clout, and it believes such perceptions to be  unjustified and exaggerated, but, at the same time, it still is  unable to bring its potential to bear. Prof. Kozakiewicz said,  "That party is strong in having Pawlak as the prime minister and  in counting on becoming the sole ruling party and winning the  elections to local governments, which should strengthen its  standing for a long time."    But, what some see as strength others view as weakness.  Janusz Piechocinski, who is for ideological reasons most  critical of what has been happening within the party in recent  times, views the PSL's drive toward political power as a sign of  weakness. He said, "Since July 1992, 33 days after Pawlak became  prime minister, the entire strategy of the PSL has been focused  on returning to the building on Aleje Ujazdowskie. The dominant  belief within the PSL is that we shall return there, and this is  combined with the belief that, once we are in power, we shall be  able to do something for the nation. The drive for political  power has become so obsessive as to completely suppress the  internal discussion, waged during 1988-91, on what kind of party  the PSL should be--a broad kind of peasants' trade union or an  increasingly broad-based rather than class-oriented political  party."    Thus, while, on the one hand, the 33 days of Pawlak's  prime-ministership afforded an opportunity for the PSL in that  they awakened the hope, verging on certainty, that the PSL would  become the helmsman of the ship of state, on the other, they  killed the hope that the PSL would become a new kind of party.  This problem is perceived most acutely by Mikolaj Kozakiewicz,  who believes that, since then, a kind of authoritarianism, of  belief that the party's reins must be held in the firm hand of  its chairman, that no internal discussions are needed, has taken  root within the PSL. The ideal of the party chairman is thus  that most faithful of loyalists, Michal Strak, who even waged  his electoral campaign under the slogan "I did not let the party  chairman down, and I won't let you down, either." Prof.  Kozakiewicz pointed out that in no other present-day political  party is so much power concentrated in the hands of a single  person as within the PSL. Thus, Waldemar Pawlak is at the same  time chairman of the PSL, chairman of the PSL's parliamentary  caucus, and the prime minister of Poland. The attack against the  concentration of powers failed. But this does not mean that  Pawlak can say, "The party, c'est moi."    Despite the evident unwillingness to engage in intraparty  discussions, such discussions are under way, even if, doubtless,  to a limited extent because it is clear to some PSL leaders that  a road must be chosen, that it is not enough to be a ruling  party when experience in governing is limited.    Piechocinski pointed out, "In the 1991 elections, our slogan  was `The peasants to the parliament,' deliberately, because we  knew that we had a chance by appealing to our most faithful  followers, the peasants. As a result of these elections, a  significant number of parliamentary seats was won by the PSL,  largely owing to such frontline peasant fighters as Soska and  Wiertek, symbols of struggle for the peasant cause."    In 1993, the electoral slogan of the PSL was, "Poland needs  a  boss," and the votes were garnered by Waldemar Pawlak, a capable  man who mastered the political scene following the "portfolio  crisis" [shifts in ministerial appointments] and who presented  himself as a serious and responsible politician, critical of  Solidarity governments but, at the same time, reasonable and  calm.    Was the change in electoral slogans followed by a change  within the party? No. The PSL remains an arena for contests  among various program ideas, each supported by a different  faction. Jacek Soska and Roman Jagielinski support building a  purely class-oriented party focusing chiefly on the defense of  farm interests. In other words, they are turning back to the  formula of a somewhat broader trade union of peasants. For his  part, Kozakiewicz longs for a return to a leftist orientation of  the PSL, but in a broadly based rather than a purely peasant  edition. In his turn, Janusz Piechocinski supports a centrist,  but also broadly based program, while Andrzej Micewski dreams of  turning the PSL into a new Christian democratic party. But so  far not one of these orientations has become predominant.  However, history shows that, within both the ZSL and the PSL, a  majority have always been greatly opposed to the concept of a  party other than that based on a community of peasant interests,  viewed to be sure in static rather than in dynamic terms. The  desire to preserve the status quo in the countryside has always  predominated over the desire to change that countryside and  propose modernization programs for it.  <H5>  A Lack of Ideas </H5>   Artur Balazs, who failed in his attempts to build a not so  much peasant as populist party based on West European parties  with populist roots and a broad social program, claimed that the  only policy pursued by the PSL nowadays is to alleviate the  burden of the reforms on farmers by getting them additional  subsidies from the budget. "The PSL has no idea what should be  done about the agrarian structure, even though it is known that  some 25 percent of the farmers will not survive in the long run.  A part of that 25 percent will have to be transferred to the  agricultural service sector, and there is no help for it. Yet  the PSL has not put forward any related institutional solutions,  and it even fails to say that change is inevitable. This is  simply immoral."    Balazs pointed out that the only institutional solution for  the countryside was put into operation during the administration  of Tadeusz Mazowiecki--namely, a system of old-age pensions for  farmers, which incidentally was established without the  participation of the PSL.    An opposition politician can always be suspected of  subjectivism. But a similar critical tone is being sounded in  the thinking and comments of PSL deputies, chiefly those more or  less opposed to their party leader and his immediate entourage.  In the interview he granted to POLITYKA, Jozef Zych admitted  that the PSL's program is a collection of generalities instead  of specific economic proposals. Kozakiewicz said plainly that,  aside from the agricultural program, whose outline had been  developed while the ZSL was still extant, the present-day PSL  has no other program planks. "Pawlak as a politician reacts  instead of initiating; if the ball flies toward him, he kicks it  rather than pursuing innovative approaches," the professor  claims. In Kozakiewicz's opinion, an exchange of ideas within  the party is moribund. The party became intellectually stagnant  once the periodical WIES WSPOLCZESNA, on which the ZSL's  intellectual creme de la creme used to labor, ceased  publication. Now the situation is further complicated by the  fact that former ideologists hold high government offices, and  there is no one to replace them within the PSL itself.  Piechocinski is of the opinion that, precisely after those first  33 days, Pawlak had a chance to attract the young intellectuals  from, say, the Agricultural Academy. At present, the PSL  contains some intellectuals, but these are rather of the  provincial kind, who need help in rising to higher rungs of the  ladder and appealing to opinion-shaping circles, but the PSL has  not availed itself of this opportunity because it is "focusing  its effort on gaining political power, no matter who its partner  might be."    When considered altogether, the opinions on various options  available to the PSL at present indicate that the party has been  placing emphasis on criticizing the policies of all of the  governments so far without making any substantial effort to  develop constructive "third road" proposals of its own. In  ideological terms, we confine ourselves to dusting off agrarian  slogans, although it is hard to say to what extent this is being  done with the object of developing a new identity for the PSL by  harking back to old prewar roots of the peasant movement, and to  what extent this mirrors the belief, especially of the older  party activists, that precisely a modified agrarianism offers  that third road for Poland. Quite a few participants in the  related discussions believe that it is the exploration of a new  identity for the PSL that is of fundamental importance.    If, however, the planks of the PSL's program that are being  so strongly exposed both on paper and in practice, if only in  parliamentary practice, are to be characterized by a common  label, that label would be principally leftist and closest to  the program espoused by the Labor Union in the  parliament--namely, labor first, capital second; equal  opportunity; social justice; and a confusing attitude toward  privatization. All of this is laced with "Christian values,"  treated here quite instrumentally. Besides, the attitude toward  these values within the PSL is authentically pluralist and  sometimes subordinated to tactics of power plays. Thus, any  intent to transform the PSL into a Christian-democratic party  does not appear feasible, even though this orientation will  certainly be present.    In all of my conversations concerning the PSL, with its  activists and representatives of other parties, the same basic  motif kept surfacing: The PSL nowadays is a ruling party and one  still desirous of political power; this is its sole distinct  image. There is room for change. There must be a sharper  confrontation between the factions in favor of the PSL as a kind  of peasant trade union and those in favor of a more broad-based  party. Which one will be the winner? Prof. Kozakiewicz believes  that, these days, practically no one within the PSL any longer  believes that it can become a broad-based rather than a purely  peasant party. In an interview granted to POLITYKA, Aleksander  Kwasniewski said that he expects the victory of the conservative  orientation within the PSL and the survival of that party as a  midsized one with an electorate of some 15 percent of the total.  Piechocinski is upset because the PSL is forfeiting the  opportunity to offer a more broad-based program. Jozef Zych is  worried because the PSL's leadership is being depleted by  appointments to offices in the government. Kozakiewicz summed  up, "So long as farmers believe in Pawlak, nothing will change  within the PSL."</p>

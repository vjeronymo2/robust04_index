			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-SECURITY GUARD ADMITS KILLING HOMELESS WOMAN  </P> <P> An El Cajon man who was a security guard at the downtown San Diego courthouse  pleaded guilty Friday to murdering a homeless mother who came to the courthouse  for help.  </P> <P> Kevin Kulo, 31, admitted to second-degree murder in the Jan. 7 slaying of Mary  Jo Zavala, 34, who authorities believe was killed in Kulo's trailer in the area  of Orange and Cypress avenues.  </P> <P> Kulo also pleaded guilty to molesting the dead woman's two daughters, ages 10  and 4, who are believed to have witnessed their mother's murder along with  their 2-year-old brother. Zavala was strangled and struck with a hammer.  </P> <P> Kulo faces a maximum sentence of 31 years to life in state prison.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge Bill Woodward dismissed a third molestation count and  a charge of kidnaping.  </P> <P> Kulo's attorney said that, if Kulo had gone to trial and been convicted of  first-degree murder plus the two dismissed counts, his sentence would have been  substantially greater.  </P> <P> "He was looking (at a possible sentence) in excess of 40 years. . . . That's  what the potential was," attorney Bill Youmans said.  </P> <P> Kulo answered yes to questions posed by the judge about the case and admitted  to molesting the girls, but he did not elaborate on any of his answers.  </P> <P> Sentencing was set for June 1.  </P> <P> "He's going to be eligible for parole in his early 50s," Youmans said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said he was satisfied with the plea.  </P> <P> The main witnesses to the murder were the girls, he said, who told police that  Kulo offered to let them stay in his trailer. They were awakened in the night,  they said, and the 10-year-old said she saw her mother on the floor with blood  on her forehead.  </P> <P> Zavala reportedly tried to get up, but Kulo put a rope around her neck.  </P> <P> Elias said one girl was molested after the mother was dead.  </P> <P> Kulo reportedly dropped the three children off at an information booth in  Mission Bay Park. The 10-year-old told workers there about their ordeal and  their mother's slaying, and her information led police to the discovery of  Zavala's body Jan. 10 in the 2400 block of Murphy Canyon Road.  </P> <P> Kulo remains in County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail.  </P></p>

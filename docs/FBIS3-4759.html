The author of the article says:    The work is a highly important work which indicates a way of  improving party work in a revolutionary manner to meet the  requirement of the development of our party and revolution after  the modelling of the whole society on the chuche idea had been  pushed to the foreground.    The work clearly expounds the principled demand and concrete  ways of effecting a new turn in party work such as the question  of building our party into a vibrant militant party full of  revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm.    For the justness and truthfulness of the idea and theory  contained in the work, the great vitality of the work has been  displayed in revolutionary practice and it serves as a historic  work which marked an occasion of a great turn in the  strengthening and development of our party.    The great vitality of the work lies, first of all, that it  made it possible to establish throughout the party a  revolutionary system of working under the unitary guidance of  the party centre.    It is the unshakable creed and absolute rules of action for  our party members and other working people to do things as  demanded by the party and think and act in accordance with the  idea and will of the party.    The great vitality of the work also lies in that it filled  the whole party with the revolutionary way of living and  struggling with lusty vigour and enthusiasm.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said:    "If a new turn is to be effected in party work, all the  officials must shake off signs of decrepitude and make our party  a vibrant party overflowing with revolutionary stamina and  enthusiasm."    The trait of which our party members and other working  people  are proud is to boldly undertake any task to fulfil the plan and  intention of the party, make a breakthrough and tenaciously  carry it to accomplishment.    In the course of applying the idea and theory contained in  the work, a radical turn has taken place in the work method of  our party.    To always mix with the masses, grasp the actual conditions  of  the lower units, give them a substantial help and solve  everything in reliance on the wisdom and creativity of the  masses is the inherent work method and habitual mode of work of  our officials today. With a great turn in the method of party  work and the strict application of the revolutionary mass line,  the consciousness and creative zeal of the popular masses as the  masters of the revolution and construction have been immensely  enhanced and a constant upsurge is being effected in socialist  construction.</p>

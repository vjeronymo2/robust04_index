			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (2): Little to celebrate  -Economy THERE is not much joy in the Swiss economy these days, but neither its current state nor its prospects appear to be as bad as many have feared. The country is coming to the end of the third year of a recession that has been unpleasant, but mercifully shallow. According to recently upwardly revised figures, real gross domestic product was in fact stagnant in 1991 and contracted by only 0.1 per cent last year. It is expected to fall 0.7 per cent this year. The slump was initially self-imposed, as inflation shot up to more than 6 per cent in 1990, forcing the Swiss National Bank to tighten monetary policy just as other stimuli were showing signs of flagging. The effect of the squeeze was felt first on private sector investment. It contracted 2.5 per cent in 1991 and 5 per cent last year, leaving the construction industry, property markets and many machinery sectors in considerable difficulty. On the other hand, exports, which account for more than a third of GDP, held up remarkably well, growing 3.4 per cent last year. But they have sagged this year as the German economy has slumped. By far the most damaging aspect of this recession has been its impact on jobs. The unemployment rate has shot up from less than 1 per cent in 1990 to 4.5 per cent, with a record 170,000 people now out of work. Economists agree that this will worsen next year. High unemployment has had a strong impact on other elements in the economy. Soaring spending for welfare benefits has been the main contributor to the government's record breaking deficits in the past two years. Economists also suspect that unemployment is behind the nervousness that has sent private consumption plunging much more deeply than in previous recessions. Consumption was off 0.2 per cent last year, and tumbled 2.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent in the first and second quarters of this year respectively. There is an uncommon unanimity among analysts that the economy is at last bottoming out, but no one expects it to recover quickly next year. Among the leading forecasters, the Lausanne-based Crea Institute for Applied Macroeconomics and Zurich-based Centre for Research of Economic Activity (KOF) are the most optimistic, expecting GDP growth of 1.7 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. Bank Julius Baer is at the bottom of the range, seeing only a 0.9 per cent growth. Whatever the outcome, no one expects that growth will be strong enough to reduce unemployment. Inflation, on the other hand, has been largely wrung out of the system. The central bank expects it will drop to under two per cent by the middle of next year compared with the September rate of 3.4 per cent. The differences in the forecasts seem mainly to reflect differing views on the outlook for exports. The Swiss National Bank seems to side with Baer. Mr Georg Rich, director and chief economist, says he is sceptical of the optimistic forecasts of German recovery recently published by the German institutes. The recovery, he says, is more likely to be led by private consumption, as people gradually lose their nervousness about unemployment. The more interesting question is the state in which Swiss industry will emerge from the recession. It has taken a beating in the past two years. A September survey of 200 industrial firms by Union Bank of Switzerland found that average capacity usage had dropped to 81 per cent and two thirds of the companies employed fewer people than a year ago. Only 4 per cent expected orders to rise in the fourth quarter. Moreover, there has been much moaning in Swiss industrial circles about the difficulties exporters now face. One obstacle is the strong Swiss franc, bolstered by large inflows of haven-seeking capital in the past year and supported by a fairly rigorous monetary policy. The central bank, having been burnt once in the late 1980s, is hesitant to stimulate the economy beyond its medium term target of one per cent growth in the monetary base. In the first half of 1992, the bank was much criticised for maintaining a tight grip. But since then, it has regained credibility, taking advantage of rises in the franc which have been caused by capital inflows to reduce interest rates unilaterally. The spread between German and Swiss short-term interest rates is still over 150 basis points and the franc remains strong, but the bank seems in no hurry to provide further unilateral relief. The more worrying problem for exporters is the possibility of discrimination in European markets as a result of Switzerland's decision last year to remain outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Mr Rich and others believe that Swiss industrial companies have made great strides during the recession to improve their competitiveness. This is shown by the fact that corporate profits have remained at respectable levels. Thus, they should be able to absorb the marginal extra costs of border formalities that their European Union competitors will no longer face. But discriminatory acts, especially covert ones, would be difficult to counter. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, managing director of BZ Trust in Zurich, a fund management firm, is especially optimistic. 'People are underestimating the progress our companies have made,' he says. 'Of course there will be some unpleasant surprises in Europe, but that is a challenge to produce better products. Swiss companies should not be in businesses where a sale depends on a 2 or 3 per cent margin.' Mr Schiltknecht also points out that Swiss companies have already had some important benefits from being outside the EEA, notably the lower interest rates made possible by the large capital inflows.</p>

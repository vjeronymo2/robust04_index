			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / German Interest Rate Rise: Economists say French GDP will still grow 2% FRENCH business confidence will be hit by the rise in the Bundesbank's discount rate, but the economy will stay on course for 2 per cent GDP growth this year, up from 1.2 per cent in 1991, economists said. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, and Mr Jacques de Larosiere, central bank governor, yesterday faced the rate rise with grim calm and stressed that French monetary policy would remain unchanged. Earlier in the week, Mr Sapin put pressure on Bonn to lower rates. French employers say they see no hope for an interest rate fall for several months, something they need to stimulate investment. 'Our investment situation is not good and this will make it worse,' a Patronat employers' organisation official said. Investment in French manufacturing industry fell by 7 per cent last year and is set to decline 8 per cent in 1992, Insee, the state statistics institute, said. This reflects the fact that France already has among the highest real borrowing costs in Europe, with a bank base rate of 9.85 per cent and annual inflation at 3 per cent. But companies can take some comfort from the fact that the Banque de France is unlikely to raise its rates in response, because German discount rate increases have little or no effect on market rates. 'The franc has been well within its EMS fluctuation margin in recent weeks, so I don't expect an increase in French rates,' said Mr Jean-Michel Charpin, chief economist at Banque Nationale de Paris. 'It would be useful to drop rates, but that is no longer possible. So we expect continuation of an already gloomy economic situation.' 'I see no reason for the Banque de France to act now, though it will not hesitate to raise rates if it sees the franc weakening,' Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London, said. The D-Mark rose slightly in Paris after the announcement to FFr3.38, but it fell back towards the end of the day to FFr3.37. The German move was likely to hit French equity and bond markets, Mr Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez, predicted. 'Europe will have to live painfully for a few more months with high German interest rates.' The French CAC-40 stock market index fell slightly, on the announcement, partially recovering to end the day down 0.11 per cent at 1,851.23.</p>

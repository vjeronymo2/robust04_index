			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Monsanto keeps juggling the assets - The US group's prospects MR Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive of Monsanto, keeps on juggling the company's assets. After two significant restructurings in the 1980s the process continued this month with the sale of the Fisher Controls valve and systems subsidiary for Dollars 1.28bn to Emerson Electric of Saint Louis, Missouri. But the US chemicals group prefers to describe the Fisher sale and indeed its overall strategy as a fine-tuning of its product portfolio that is very much in line with the trend in the sector. Yet there can be no doubt Monsanto is facing a difficult period. After stripping out special restructuring charges in 1991, Its underlying net income was down nearly 16 per cent in the first six months of 1992. Mr Mahoney's stated target of ensuring a 20 per cent return on shareholders capital seems increasingly difficult. The problem is the jewels in Monsanto's crown are looking somewhat tarnished. Take Roundup, the herbicide and world's best-selling agrochemical. Mr Mahoney said there had never been an agrochemical like it. The product represents 60 per cent of Monsanto's agrochemicals business, whose sales have stagnated at Dollars 1.7bn over the past three years. Roundup's US and European patents expired last year and by last October its price had fallen by 45 per cent as the group faced competition from generic producers of the same product. New agrochemical products are in the pipeline and high hopes have been expressed for Monsanto's new crabgrass herbicide, Dimension. It received US approval last year and Mr Mahoney hopes it will generate Dollars 100m sales. Monsanto, as the world's seventh largest agrochemical company with 6.3 per cent of the world market, also faces upheavals caused by the reforms of the European common agricultural policy. These threaten to cut demand in the world's largest market by up to 15 per cent over the next three years. The company, however, feels that while changes in the CAP could reduce opportunities in the short term, there are still greater potential gains to be had worldwide from a successful completion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) negotiations. The group's efforts to generate other new products have not always been successful. It has invested more than Dollars 1bn since 1981 on biotechnology to try to escape the traditional cycles of the chemicals market. The results so far have been disappointing. The largest investment, estimated by analysts at about Dollars 250m, was on bovine somatotropin - commonly known as BST - which is a hormone product designed to increase milk production in cows. The company is still waiting for US and European regulatory approval and argues that BST will lower the fixed costs of milk production. It is far from clear whether the world's developed nations need more milk. Meanwhile, other jewels look dull. Nutrasweet, described by Mr Mahoney as the most successful new food ingredient of the past 20 years, comes off patent in December. Last year Nutrasweet's sales growth was only 2 per cent. Operating income was reduced by Dollars 10m in 1991 to Dollars 173m by a one-time restructuring charge. In the first six months of 1992, Nutrasweet's operating profits were Dollars 87m, down from Dollars 96m because of lower prices mandated by contracts with customers well aware the patent is due to expire soon. Mr Mahoney expected competition from generic competitors and new products. A new Monsanto product, Sweetner 2000, will be sent to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) soon. In addition, sales of Simplesse fat substitute have been disappointing and the product is in loss. Monsanto's Searle pharmaceuticals operations, with sales last year of Dollars 1.53bn and operating profits of Dollars 170m, are tiny compared with the industry's giants. The division is suffering from competition from generic producers, but is hoping to launch new products to make up for this. In the first half of 1992 Searle suffered a Dollars 16m operating loss. Calan, a drug used in treating hypertension, accounted for one third of last year's Dollars 1.53bn of sales. But the FDA has just given preliminary approval to a generic version and this could slash sales of Calan by as much as 50 per cent over the next couple of years. The group's performance is not being helped by its chemicals businesses which continue to suffer from recession. The division, which manufactures plastics, fibres, resins and rubber chemicals, bore the brunt of last year's restructuring. Sales fell 7 per cent last year from Dollars 4bn to Dollars 3.7bn and a Dollars 478m restructuring charge drove it into a Dollars 154m loss. Further restructuring cannot be ruled out. 'We need to be number one or two in everything we do in chemicals and we need to be making money,' said Mr Mahoney. So far, the company has declined to explain how it will use the cash from the sale to Emerson Electric, except to say excess cash might be used for investment in existing businesses, acquisition or share repurchasing. Wall Street is convinced, however, that Mr Mahoney will choose the share buy-back option to boost his company's return on equity. Mr Jeff Cianci, a chemicals analyst at Bear Stearns in New York, says he is convinced the proceeds from the Fisher sale will be used to buy back shares. He does not, however, believe the sale of Fisher is the last asset disposal. "I think the Fisher move is not the last piece in the puzzle. The future of this company is in the areas of agriculture, such as pest-resistant seeds and other biotechnology products, plus food, health care and chemicals. In chemicals I would expect more joint ventures and outright sales of some of the lower-return businesses." Mr Mahoney has said: 'The group's structure is mostly in place. We underwent two major restructurings during the 1980s. If we haven't got it right by now, then shame on us'. The Monsanto chief must now make his businesses perform. Otherwise he could be left with even fewer assets left to juggle.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Business leaders fear loss of consumer confidence Industry and commerce yesterday criticised Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for raising interest rates because of the government's political crisis and warned that confidence among consumers could be damaged. Retailers voiced concern about the timing of the rise in the crucial shopping weeks leading up to Christmas. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'The impression has been given that the chancellor has rushed into a political decision rather than a decision based on sound economic judgment.' The half-point rise in interest rates would make investment more expensive, he said. 'It would have been more sensible to delay it until the dust had settled after the government defeat on VAT and the chancellor had announced the measures to recover the lost VAT revenue.' The Confederation of British Industry agreed that the timing of the rise was dictated more by political than by economic considerations. Mr Howard Davies, director-general, said: 'We did not want to see another interest rate move this year. Inflationary pressures remain weak, especially in the retail sector.' He added that the recovery would continue in spite of the increase, but said the chancellor had to act decisively to restore confidence in the government's fiscal strategy. Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said the rise was a further blow to business confidence. Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's Smaller Companies Council, said the rise was unfortunate but 'not disastrous.' Representatives of the smallest companies were less sanguine. Mr Bernard Juby, chairman of financial affairs for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'A rise in base rates will wipe out any small business measures announced in last week's Budget speech.' Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said that the most damaging impact of the rise would be its effect on consumer confidence. He said the forum was largely concerned at a decrease in the number of small companies that were growing faster than the pace of inflation. The motor trade and industry, already alarmed by statistics released on Tuesday showing a fall in new car sales to private buyers, warned that the rate increase would further depress sales. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: 'The November sales figures demonstrated how fragile consumer confidence remains. This increase will do nothing to help.' It said that there was now 'no prospect' of sales this year reaching the 2m level which the industry needed for profitability. The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of the UK retail trade, was worried about the impact of the rate rise on consumer confidence. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director, said: 'It will inevitably make people more cautious about spending.' The rise was 'exceedingly ill-timed and unwelcome', coming in the middle of the crucial Christmas trading period. He could see 'little evidence of justification' for the move, and added: 'Demand levels have very much kept the lid on inflation. Retail sales have grown by value and volume but there is no indication that retail sales are running away with themselves.'

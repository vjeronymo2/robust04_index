			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Twists and turns of the tax maze - Exporting / Ian Hamilton Fazey answers questions on VAT There are two types of foreign trade as far as European VAT authorities are concerned - trade within the European single market and 'third country' trade with the rest of the world. The following answers to common questions have been compiled with the help of UK Customs and Excise officers, notably Barry Price, a VAT specialist since 1972. Q: Are exports free of VAT? A: Third country trade is zero rated, provided you can prove goods have been exported. Export evidence must be obtained within one month and retained to justify zero rating, otherwise VAT will be charged at standard rate. Documents must identify the exporter, the customer, the goods and the export destination. Vague descriptions are not acceptable. Q: Which documents will be accepted by VAT inspectors? A: Authenticated bills for air or sea carriage, as well as standard international consignment notes or bills of lading - receipts of goods placed on board a ship - are all considered primary evidence of export. Secondary evidence - such as a certificate of shipment - is also acceptable if issued by a carrier, but the carrier must hold the necessary primary evidence so it can be traced if verification is required. Q: What if a company sells to a foreign customer but does not ship the goods itself or appoint the carrier? A: This sort of indirect exporting happens commonly when a customer arranges collection of goods direct from the factory or warehouse. The exporting company needs something to prove the goods have arrived at the other end, such as transit documentation and receipts. Customs officers advise taking a deposit equal to the amount of VAT, returnable when satisfactory proof of export is obtained. This gives the customer an incentive not to forget to send the evidence. Q: Is trade between European Union countries also zero rated? A: Zero rating is allowed, provided supply is made in the UK to a person or company in another EU country registered for VAT there. The exporter must obtain the local VAT registration number of the customer, show it on the sales invoice and keep copies. Evidence of removal of goods from the UK must also be obtained and retained. If these conditions cannot be met, then VAT must be charged to other EU customers at the UK rate. Q: Do you need to register for VAT in EU countries where you trade? A: It depends on where the supply of goods is deemed by the local VAT authorities to have taken place. If you have a warehouse in another EU country, transfer of your own goods to it will be deemed a supply and you will need to be registered in that country so as to zero rate the consignment in the UK - otherwise you will have to charge yourself VAT. Goods offered on sale or return terms are treated similarly. Another pitfall is the VAT-registration threshold in any EU country where you trade. This was raised to an annual turnover of Pounds 45,000 in the UK last November in order to take tens of thousands of small businesses out of having to account for VAT at all. But the threshold is zero in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Technically, this means you cannot legally, say, take a stand at an exhibition or trade fair in any of these countries and sell the actual goods displayed on it, as many companies have done in the past to save transporting the goods home afterwards. You cannot sell the stand either, as some companies have done to help pay for going to the trade fair in the first place. You can, of course, take orders to supply the goods from the UK, even if they are the same goods you had on exhibition. Q: Does the type of goods being exported make any difference? A: Supply of anything that has to be installed or assembled by the vendor takes place in the EU country where this work is done, so local registration may be necessary. The UK has simplified procedures so this will not require registration of companies selling such items into the UK, but there is not yet universal reciprocity on this. Customs and Excise advises exporters to contact the fiscal authorities in other countries to find out if registration is necessary. Q: So what if I have to register? Is it going to cause problems? A: Not if you have the language skills and knowledge of local accounting terms and systems to fill in another set of quarterly VAT returns in Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish or whatever. In practice, exporters without the necessary administrative infrastructure in the country concerned use local fiscal agents - some countries may require this anyway. Some large firms of accountants with offices spread throughout the EU offer this as a service to UK clients. Charges vary individually, but will almost certainly not be economic without a volume of regular business to make them worthwhile. This in turn brings us back to a central theme in this series on exporting: as the Institute of Export advises consistently, do not do it on a one-off, intermittent, sporadic or casual basis. Ian Campbell, the institute's director-general, never tires of stressing that exporting should always be part of the main thrust of a business, not a bolt-on function. The regular exporter should have the sales volume to pay for and cope with any administrative burdens, such as VAT, which foreign trade brings with it.</p>

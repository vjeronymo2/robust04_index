			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Executive Council of the Slovene Christian  Democrats, in a statement for the public, condemned any sort of  use of violence in the fulfillment of political and ideological  goals.    The Slovene Christian Democrats, therefore, call upon all  those who have violated fundamental moral and ethical principles  to leave the Slovene political scene.    As the second most powerful parliamentary party, the  Christian Democrats wish to contribute toward appeasement,  stability, and progress, because divisions cannot be the guiding  star of the young Slovene state, which was also confirmed by the  incident in Depala Vas and recent statements by President Milan  Kucan in Nova Gorica.    In cases of abuse of power, the Christian Democrats also  expect the resignation of incumbent ministers.    If it transpires that the president of the republic has also  been involved in the recent events, the Christian Democrats will  demand his resignation, too.</p>

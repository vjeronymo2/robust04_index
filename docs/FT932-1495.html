			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: WMX earnings warning prompts share price fall WMX TECHNOLOGIES, the international disposal company that recently changed its name from Waste Management, has issued an earnings warning. It said declines in US government-directed environmental clean-ups were trimming income from a prime subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management, and would lead to lower-than-expected earnings in the second quarter. The news, released after Wall Street closed on Monday, pushed WMX stock down Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 1/8 at the end of trading yesterday. WMX said although quarterly earnings from its other subsidiaries, including Wheelabrator Technologies, Waste Management International and Rush International were on target, softness in Chemical Waste's earnings would reduce second-quarter results by 2 to 3 cents per share. Analysts had projected WMX second-quarter earnings at near 45 cents per share. Now, they say, earnings could be closer to 42 or 43 cents. The company will release its second-quarter results in July. Chemical Waste said it expected second-quarter operating earnings in the range of 5 to 6 cents per share, below Wall Street estimates and down from 16 cents in the second quarter of 1992. The company began to experience a drop in waste volumes from clean-up projects in the last quarter of 1992, and the trend has continued so far in 1993. 'Government-mandated clean-up work at contaminated areas has failed to materialise,' the company said. The company added that private contracts for hazardous waste disposal were being postponed.</p>

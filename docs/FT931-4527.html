			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Goodman defends company against fraud charges Mr Larry Goodman, the controversial founder of Goodman International, Europe's largest meat processor, yesterday appeared in the witness box to defend his company against allegations of fraud, abuse of EC payments systems, and political favouritism. Speaking before a parliamentary enquiry into the Irish meat industry, Mr Goodman claimed the allegations have been 'blown up out of all proportion'. Although he did not deny some breaches of regulations had taken place at a couple of his plants, he said that a comparison should have been made with other companies in the industry. 'We can back our record against anyone's,' he said. Goodman International ran into financial difficulties in 1990 following the Gulf war and the suspension of export contracts to Iraq. An examiner was appointed in August of that year to enable the company to arrange an agreement with its 33 creditor banks to whom it owed some IPounds 460m (Pounds 450m). The banks had guaranteed a further IPounds 200m against beef contracts. Answering allegations that his company had taken advantage of the EC intervention system, Mr Goodman said: 'Prior to Ireland joining the EC, our net margins were in excess of 5 per cent. They have never been at that level since. We lobbied very strongly against the intervention system as we were concerned that people would sell without any marketing effort. It removed the incentive for companies to market in Europe and abroad.' The Goodman group has become Europe's biggest supplier of meat products to supermarket chains in the UK. Accusations of dishonesty made in the witness box by the prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, against a cabinet colleague last October resulted in the collapse of the coalition and a general election last year.</p>

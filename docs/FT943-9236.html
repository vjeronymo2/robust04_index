			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: Sir Alex Alexander - An appreciation Sir Alex Alexander, who died on July 25, did more for Glyndebourne's financial well-being during his period of trusteeship and directorship than any other individual in this opera company's history of 60 years. He brought a new dimension to the business of fund-raising and sponsorship and, at the same time, he instilled a sense of commercialism in the management of Glyndebourne's operation. His fund-raising efforts obviously benefited Glyndebourne's artistic endeavours but the commercial policy never came into fundamental conflict with artistic objectives. I first met Alex in 1973, following correspondence in which I invited him to support Glyndebourne Touring Opera - an invitation which was characteristically not refused. I felt an immediate rapport with him and this grew into friendship which, within a few months, caused me to think that he might join our board of trustees. I consulted one of our trustees, Sir Mark Turner, who expressed some surprise on the grounds that Alex, to his knowledge, had not shown much interest in the performing arts up to that point. Two years after Alex's appointment to the Glyndebourne Arts Trust, Sir Mark commented that the decision to appoint Alex must have been the best one of my life - a comment with which I have no possible disagreement. Alex, within a very brief period of trusteeship, joined the board of Glyndebourne Productions Limited (the organisation which holds executive responsibility for the Opera Company). He was also appointed chairman of a finance committee which I brought into existence in the mid-70s at a time of recession and at a time when box office receipts were unable to keep pace with inflation. He was hugely active as chairman of this committee and, as a result, Glyndebourne - despite diminishing box office returns - successfully met the challenge of inflationary costs. Alex also chaired an appeal in 1983 which raised Pounds 750,000 to help maintain the fabric of the theatre. It might be expected that his widespread and very effective success in 'robbing Peter' to pay Glyndebourne could have created enemies. Not so in the case of Alex, whose charm - he had an irresistible smile - and practical approach beguiled all who came into his fund-raising sights. I know of no other individual with a better track record for raising funds for the arts. Glyndebourne was, I believe, the first charitable organisation in the field of the performing arts to benefit from his genius, but there were others who got swept into his slipstream - to their great advantage. His friendship with people was based on a code of ethics, the chief one of which was unshakeable loyalty. Once a friend of Alex, always a friend - unless you breached the code. In Marga he had a wife who gave him stalwart support in his business life and who, more than anyone, inspired his interest in the arts. We grieve for her and her family. Sir George Christie is chairman of Glyndebourne Productions.</p>

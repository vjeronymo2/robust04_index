			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Ramon Huerta] </F>   [Text] Wiwili, Jinotega Department -- All the inquiries  into the death of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]  Political Secretary Javier Barahona in this town lead to the  conclusion that it was a political crime. "It was particularly  aimed at him because of his quality as a natural leader and not  just because he is a Sandinist," residents and authorities  concurred.    The climate in this town has turned violent. "Things have  regressed. Mistrust prevails again, and the hopes of any needy  persons in the programs Javier was implementing have been  dashed," Rosa Benavidez, a town resident, said with a broken  voice.    Sergeant Major Faustino Herrera Palacios, the officer in  charge of the local police, told BARRICADA the case will be  transferred today at the latest to the judge who will try the  armed chieftains in absentia. A visibly shaken Herrera Palacios  went to the place where Barahona had been bound. He found him  without eyes and tongue, and with a knife embedded in this chest.    According to preliminary investigations, Barahona was  viciously killed. "It was a horrendous murder, preceded by a  kidnapping. The culprits are Omar [not further identified],  Jose Davila Reyes, Estrella [not further identified], and Erasmo  Vasquez Salgado," the authorities affirmed.    The police said armed men intercepted a bus with passengers  between Jinotega and Wiwili, and went straight for Javier  Barahona. His brother, Cesar Barahona, got off the bus, but was  told to get back on it. These men took Javier Barahona to Aguas  Amarillas and killed him near Bola de Cuajada Mountain. "They  removed his boots, pants, personal effects, and left him there,"  Herrera Palacios stated.    "At approximately 1800, I heard four shots and told my son:  `That sounds bad. They killed Barahona,'" Leonila Castro, a  resident of the area where the Sandinist leader was found,  stated.    In addition, Herrera Palacios said the armed men carried a  list of persons with Sandinist affiliation, including persons  from Wiwili, adding they know their victims well. This opinion  coincides with that of the area residents who said the armed  person were tailing Barahona since the previous Sunday.    This kind of operation shows these men are the remnants of  El  Guapote's group because Omar -- a young man who just a few years  ago was a child seen on Wiwili's streets -- joined this rebel  leader and afterward was a member of the 3-80 Northern Front.  When El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera] began negotiations with  the government, he and Chele Gringo [not further identified]  were opposed and left to become active in the area around the  town.    Army troops have been pursuing this group -- estimated at  between 15 to 20 men -- since noon Wednesday. They have  disbanded, thus hampering their capture. Until yesterday, there  had been no contact with them, but "we hope to soon," the  military source said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 13/6/1994 -- The transition  process has inevitably diminished Romania's capacity to ensure  its own security. Romania does not have, as at now, allies and  firm security guarantees. The main danger lies in having its  own domestic weaknesses exploited. There is a direct  relationship between the reform and the national security.  These are some of the main ideas Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary  of state in the Romanian Ministry of National Defense,  elaborated on in the comprehensive interview for the CURIERUL  NATIONAL of 13 June.    Speaking of the integrated concept of Romania's national  security, a recently issued document, Pascu says the study ends  with the basic conclusion that for now and for a while to come,  "Romania cannot rely on allies and firm security guarantees."  Besides, the transition from one type of society to another has  diminished its capacity to ensure security by its own means,  "particularly as we are located in an area characterized by a  high degree of conflict potential."    In Mr. Pascu's opinion, the most important sign of Romania's  insecurity since December 1989 is the very fact that threats are  no longer mostly external, and that "the main danger is posed by  the possibility of having its domestic weaknesses exploited."  And among the main internal risk factors he listed the economic  situation, the social costs required by the changes brought  about by the transition period, a diminished social cohesion etc.    To face the domestic risk factors this country needs to  ensure the continuity of the reform process: "the success of the  reform, however cannot be obtained in the absence of security,  and to have security, we need to take the reform to the end  successfully."    The defense official also mentioned some of the external  risk  factors for Romania's security, such as the appearance and  worsening of certain conflicts, the existence of zones with a  high potential of political and military instability close to  Romania.    As directly concerning Romania's security, Secretary of  State  Mircea Pascu names international developments like the recent  stability plan adopted in Paris, the agreement for the reduction  of the conventional armaments and troops in Europe, the  Partnership for Peace plan, Romania's geopolitical position, the  relations with Russia.    Concluding, the dignitary predicted about the future of  Romania's security in the following terms: "If we ignore the  unpredictable, which, unfortunately, will continue to be there  both in the near and medium future, I think we can be optimistic  about Romania's long- term chances of integration in the  European and Euro-Atlantic security systems."</p>

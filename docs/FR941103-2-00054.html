			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Several informal meetings were held between the publication of the July 1, 1993, FRN and the beginning of the public rate adjustment process. These meetings, involving personnel from Western, Reclamation, and represen- tatives from organizations of interested parties, produced many issue papers that identified and discussed the items which should be considered in a firm power rate adjustment. Agreement as to how to approach many of the issues was reached during this time, considerably reducing the number of unresolved issues and easing the later formal public process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On December 27, 1993, letters were mailed from Western's Loveland, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City Area Offices to all Integrated Projects customers and other interested parties announcing an informal public meeting to be held on January 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

An FRN was published on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19008), officially announc- ing the proposed firm-power rate adjustment, initiating the public consultation and comment period, announcing the public information and public comment forums, and presenting procedures for public participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On April 22, 1994, a rate announcement package was mailed from Western's Salt Lake City Area Office to all Integrated Projects customers and other interested parties announcing the publication of the FRN of April 21, 1994, and the beginning of the formal public process to adjust firm power rates.

The projects were integrated for marketing and ratemaking purposes on October 1, 1987. The goals of integration were to increase marketable resources, simplify contract and rate development and project administration, assure repayment of Collbran and Rio Grande Projects' costs, and create a common rate. The projects maintain their individual identities for financial accounting and repayment purposes, but their revenue requirements are integrated into one PRS for ratemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Power Repayment Studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PRSs are prepared each FY to determine if power revenues will be sufficient to pay, within the prescribed time periods, all costs assigned to power.

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Libya proposes to turn over alleged Lockerbie bombers In an 11th-hour bid to forestall sanctions, Libya has proposed turning the two alleged Lockerbie bombers over to Malta, according to diplomats at the United Nations, AP reports from New York. But the Security Council is unlikely to approve the Libyan proposal, which was offered through the Arab League, the diplomats said. 'The latest proposal is to turn them over to Malta, to postpone sanctions and hold negotiations,' Venezuelan Ambassador Diego Arria said. 'But I don't think it will fly,' he said. He described the Libyan offer 'as a dilatory tactic to endlessly postpone sanctions.' There was no word whether Malta would accept the proposal and take custody of the two men. The US and Britain are demanding that the two suspects be handed over for trial in the west, but do not object if intermediaries are involved. Mr Arria said that Libya also had asked him whether Venezuela might be willing to take custody of the men. But the Caracas government had refused to do this, he said. Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Libya last night urged its Arab neighbours to disregard the UN sanctions, which are due to take effect at a minute after midnight New York time tomorrow. after Libya's refusal to hand over two men accused of the 1988 bombing of a US airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, Tony Walker reports. Major Abdel-Salam Jalloud, Libya's second-in-command, bluntly told Arab labour ministers in Tripoli, that 'the Arabs should not implement resolution 748'. It was Libya's most pointed call to its fellow Arabs to ignore the UN sanctions resolution, which calls for an air and arms embargo, and a downgrading of Libyan representation abroad. Libyan prepared for the sanctions deadline by declaring a day of 'mourning' today, during which communications with the west were cut off, against a background of continuing and apparently futile Arab diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis.</p>

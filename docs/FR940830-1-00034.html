This proposal would require repetitive inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors, and correction of discrepancies, if necessary. This proposal would also require replacement of the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. This proposal is prompted by a report that, during an emergency evacuation of in-service airplanes, the left aft passenger/crew door jammed against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position due to bushing migration. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by October 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;94&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The DGAC advises that, during an emergency evacuation of an in-service airplane, the left aft passenger/crew door jammed against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position. Investigation revealed the bushing of the lower connection link had migrated. The cause of this migration has been attributed to the seizing of the upper locking hook into its bronze bushing from the frame segment at the level of the door lifting bellcranks. This condition, if not corrected, could result in jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1047, dated April 25, 1994, which describes procedures for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Performing repetitive detailed visual inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Removing the passenger/crew door and inspecting the bushings to detect damage, if any bushing has migrated;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Reinstalling the bushing, if the bushing housings are not damaged; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Reaming the door structure and installing an oversize shouldered bushing, if any bushing housing is damaged; and repairing the bushing housing, if damage is not completely removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

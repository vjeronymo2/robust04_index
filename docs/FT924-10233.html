			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins/RHM Personalities apart, it is the two very distinct views of UK milling and baking which makes the tussle for Ranks Hovis MacDougall (RHM) so absorbing. On one side are those who claim the industry is stuck in a long-term decline, plagued by complex structural problems and the fast-changing patterns of retailing and distribution. On the other side are those who say the sector is approaching the low point in the cycle, that shorn of a bit more capacity it can still deliver respectable, if not wildly attractive returns. Hanson and Tomkins, whose bids were both made with the retention of RHM's core activities in mind, naturally incline to the latter thesis. Back-of-the-envelope calculations, though, suggest Hanson's 220p per share cash offer - assuming he recouped most of the money by selling RHM's brands  -would have allowed him to acquire the milling and baking for a song. By contrast, Tomkins' offer of 270p (including a 10p dividend) appears to leave little margin for error if anything goes wrong. Certainly the idea that there is huge overcapacity in UK milling is an old story. RHM has already done much to redress the balance itself, and is an efficient player. But the fact remains that flour is a commodity product, subject to external variables like the size and quality of the harvest. That said, baking is indeed the trickier problem. At the moment RHM appears caught between low-cost independent bread producers on the one hand, and market leader Associated British Foods on the other. Given that ABF is run more like a private than a public company - and has cash flow from sugar coming out of its ears - there seems little reason to suppose it will suddenly abandon its aggressive pricing policy. Tomkins ought to be able to make large acquisition provisions if it chooses, but will be unable to protect earnings per share indefinitely. The City may not worry so much about Tomkins' claim that its expertise in mowers and push bikes will help revive RHM's food brands. There will presumably be willing buyers on hand. But savings at the Windsor head office apart, investors are likely to require more persuading that RHM will respond to the conglomerate treatment.</p>

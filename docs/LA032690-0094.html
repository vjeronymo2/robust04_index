			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RON HOWARD'S MOVING TRIBUTE TO FAMILYHOOD  </P> <P> It was, appropriately enough, a family affair for "Parenthood" director Ron  Howard, honored Friday night at the annual Moving Picture Ball.  </P> <P> Not only were his parents on hand to pay tribute to the still-boyish Howard (a  father of four), but his television mother and father -- "Happy Days" stars Tom  Bosley and Marion Ross -- were there to praise Howard as well.  </P> <P> "You did such a good job with him," Ross called across the room to Howard's  real-life mom, Jean. "It's been a pleasure to be your mother, Ron, even if it's  just on TV."  </P> <P> And in his acceptance speech, Howard thanked all the members of his family and  also members of his on-screen family who helped him develop an early aspiration  for filmmaking.  </P> <P> "Thanks, Andy, for creating an environment where kids were encouraged . . . it  was a great show to grow up on," Howard said, referring to "The Andy Griffith  Show." "I can't help feeling incredibly lucky to be able to grow up in this  business and to be able to live out my dream."  </P> <P> Howard said he decided at age 7 that he wanted to be a film director. Actually,  he aspired to be a filmmaking hyphenate, with a few additions to the usual  list: "I wanted to be an actor-director-writer-producer-cameraman and baseball  player."  </P> <P> The Moving Picture Ball's board of directors -- a group of filmmakers that  include Martin Scorsese, Sidney Pollack, George Lucas and Francis Coppola --  give their American Cinematheque Award to the person seen as the year's hot  young talent, "an extraordinary artist currently making a significant  contribution to the art of the moving picture." The unassuming Howard seemed  more than a little surprised to be given the award so early in his directing  career. (Past winners have included such other Wunderkinds as Steven Spielberg,  Robin Williams, Bette Midler and Eddie Murphy.)  </P> <P> "I don't think of this as an ideal time in my career to stop and look back,"  Howard said in an interview before the show. "I'm trying to move forward." He  likened the event to a "giant surprise party: It runs a little counter to my  personality." But, he quickly added that "it's a nice idea that they have to  honor people who are mid-stride."  </P> <P> The ball's organizers have clearly been impressed by the 36-year-old Howard's  roster of directorial credits, which include "Nightshift," "Cocoon" and  "Splash."  </P> <P> The event, which raises money for the nonprofit American Cinematheque, drew a  crowd of 1,200 to the Century Plaza. Those who attended paid anywhere from $300  to $700 each, contributing to a total of $350,000 for the organization, which  is dedicated to the "celebration of the moving picture in all its forms" and is  currently building an arts complex in Hollywood scheduled to open in mid-1993.  </P> <P> At times the grown-up Howard seemed more like the young Opie Taylor, his face  almost childlike as he took in the show, produced by Henry Winkler and directed  by Spike Jones Jr. Among the highlights were a hilarious tribute from Steve  Martin and taped segments from comedians Martin Short and Dana Carvey (as  President Bush), the glowing accolades of Jessica Tandy and George Lucas, and  the loving testimonies from Howard's real-life mother Jean, actor-brother Clint  and wife Cheryl (who finished off her emotion-laden speech with: "No matter how  much hair you lose, I'll always be proud of you, honey.")  </P> <P> Howard seemed almost transfixed when the USC marching band, in full regalia,  was brought in to play "76 Trombones" from the score of "The Music Man," in  which 8-year-old Howard played the adorable little brother of the film's  librarian, Shirley Jones.  </P> <P> Both Opie and "Happy Days' " Richie Cunningham might have judged the evening's  highlight to be the presentation of an autographed baseball from one of  Howard's longtime heroes, former Dodger Sandy Koufax. The inscription read:  "Opie's come a long way. Congratulations and Best Wishes."  </P></p>

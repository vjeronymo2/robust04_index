The Nigerian Ministry of Defense  said on Thursday [6 January] that what the Cameroonians were  complaining about was a normal movement of troops within  Nigerian territory.    Cameroon's foreign minister [title as heard], Mr. Francis  Nkwain, had alleged that 500 Nigerian soldiers moved into the  islands on Monday [3 January].    Meanwhile, Nigeria's minister of external affairs,  Ambassador  Babagana Kingibe, left for Yaounde on Thursday for talks with  the Cameroonian authorities on the border issue. Mr. Kingibe  told a Voice of Nigeria correspondent shortly before he left  Lagos that the Nigerian Government was determined to end all  border clashes with Cameroon. The meeting is expected to evolve  ways of ending the border dispute between the two countries.</p>

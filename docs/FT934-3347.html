			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / People: Capel's management gets a shake-up Charles Smedley, head of James Capel's European operations, is stepping down as part of a management shake-up at the top of the London stockbroking arm of HSBC Holdings, Britain's biggest bank. Smedley, 42, who joined Capel in 1979, has spent most of his career on the international side. He opened Capel's New York office in 1984 and has been chairman of James Capel Europe since 1989. He said yesterday he was resigning from the firm because he felt he had completed his strategic task. When he took charge of Capel's Continental European operations it was ranked number eight in the Extel rankings. It is now second only to S G Warburg. Although the parting is described as 'amicable' it is understood that Capel is keen to modernise the management of a side of its business which has not always lived up to expectations in terms of profitability. Lin Moran, the head of European research, and Angus McNeilage, European sales chief, will take over Smedley's responsibilities. However, the exodus of old James Capel hands is not all one way. Philip Gray, 45, who began his City career as a European equity analyst with Capel in 1972, is rejoining his old firm as head of James Capel Asia, covering Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul and Taipei. After leaving Capel he spent 15 years as a fund manager with with GT Management. He is chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Investment Analysts and was responsible for launching GT's emerging market funds. Along with Moran, Gray is one of a dozen new directors of a much expanded board of James Capel Holdings, parent of James Capel &amp; Co. Other members of the new board include David Gray, head of UK research; John Green, head of corporate broking; and Peter Maynard, head of James Capel Inc. The board of James Capel &amp; Co has also more than doubled in size with the appointment of 16 new directors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the Provincial CPC Committee: </F> "Province To Develop Its Export Industries"]    [Text] Yunnan hopes to rejuvenate its economy by  developing export-oriented industries and opening up domestic  and world markets.    The province has set up the Beijing Yunnan Economic and  Trade  Promotion Corporation Limited in Beijing to help develop  Yunnan's export-oriented economy and to establish trade ties  with countries like the Commonwealth of Independent States.    Over the past decade, the province has achieved significant  progress in economic development. Its gross domestic product  increased from 6.9 billion yuan ($793 million) in 1979 to 64.8  billion yuan ($7.4 billion) last year. The annual revenue  jumped from 1.1 billion yuan ( $126 million) to 20 billion yuan  ($2.2 billion) during the same period.    Moreover, the province invested more than 10 billion yuan  ($1.1 billion) in a number of infrastructure projects involving  communications, energy, telecommunications and water  conservation.    Yunnan's foreign trade was valued at $840 million including  2.8 billion yuan ($321 million) of border trade deals in 1993.    Located on the Southwest border of China, the province is  rich in natural resources. It is well aware of its potential to  become an export-orientated economy.    Last year, the province produced 874,000 tons of tobacco,  5.3  cases of cigarettes 92,000 tons of rubber, 63,000 tons of tea,  750,000 tons of tropical fruit,270,000 tons of nonferrous metals  and 5 million tons of phosphate ores.    There's been a boost in exports to Southwest and South Asia,  Europe, Australia and the United States. And the province also  aims to concentrate on opening up markets in North, Northeast  and Northwest China.    Yunnan plans to adjust its industrial structure to develop  perfume, pharmaceutical, building material and wood processing  industries.    Yunnan, which has a population of more than 38 million, has  an abundance of biological, mineral and energy resources.    Sharing a long land border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar  and  linked to Thailand and Cambodia by the same river, the province  is China's gateway to Southeast Asia.    With its neighbours keen to foster trade links, Yunnan is in  a good position to take an active part in cross border trade.    The government has recently worked out a plan to speed up  the  pace of development in the western part of the country in the  1990s.    To implement the plan, five of China's southwestern regions,  Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi and Tibet, are working  together to enhance economic co-operation and open up to the  outside world.    Sponsored by the five provinces and Chengdu and Chongqing  cities, the Kunming Export Commodity Fair held last August  proved to be a success.    During the Third Plenary Session of the Party's 14th  Congress  and according to Deng Xiaoping's speech during his trip to South  China in 1992, emphasis was placed on speeding up economic  development. In line with this spirit, Yunnan will work hard to  open its door even further to the outside world. It will import  more advanced technology, human resources, materials and  equipment that the province needs.    At the same time, Yunnan hopes to export more of its  products.    The Beijing Yunnan Economic and Trade Promotion Corporation  will establish more trade channels in North and Northeast China  as well as in foreign countries.    The corporation will act as agents for the province and  promote the sales of various commodities and purchase raw  materials, technology and equipment. It will also deal with  real estate and investments; provide information, consultancy,  transportation and advertising services; absorb foreign  investment, finance domestic funds and further develop resources  in the province.</p>

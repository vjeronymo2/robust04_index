Replying to journalists' questions, the speaker of the upper  house called the situation which had arisen during the ballot  "routine teething troubles." In his opinion, they were due to  the fact that, on the one hand, members of the Federation  Council did not want to bring matters to the point of  confrontation, but, on the other hand, there are people among  them with different, at times diametrically opposed, political  views. The speaker stated that he would seek to exclude various  lobby intrigues from the Federation Council.    Vladimir Shumeyko also dwelt on the question of relations  between the upper house and the State Duma, in particular, in  the event that the lower house adopts, for whatever reasons, an  unconstructive stance. He recalled that, under the  Constitution, in addition to the president, the government, and  State Duma deputies, the Federation Council as a whole and  individual members of the Federation Council also possess  legislative initiative. In that case, he stressed, it is  possible, in cooperation with Duma deputies who really desire to  do something, to elaborate legislative acts in joint committees  and commissions and adopt them straightaway right here.  Vladimir Shumeyko clarified that he was talking of "an extreme  case" and "bitter necessity."</p>

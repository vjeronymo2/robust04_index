			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKE TIME TO SETTLE  </P> <P> In "Know Your Rights, Obligations If Home Is Damaged by Fire" (Dec. 31), Merle  Henkenium wrote: "Don't settle before knowing extent of cost." That is  certainly a rule that should be followed.  </P> <P> We had extensive water damage a few years ago and learned that water damage is  insidious and doesn't always show up right away! Our insurance agent was  anxious to settle our claim as quickly as possible, and we finally agreed, not  realizing that we would no longer be covered when other water-damage problems  surfaced.  </P> <P> Our rugs were soaked, and the insurance company had a rug cleaning service dry  them out. But within a year, we discovered that water-soaked rugs cannot be  fixed with drying. . . . The backings fell to pieces and the rugs had to be  replaced. Ceilings were repainted but the paint kept peeling off because the  water had softened the base. We ended up having to re-stucco, tile or have  acoustical ceiling texture applied, though this was not our decorating choice.  </P> <P> MRS. FRED HAUTER  </P> <P> La Canada Flintridge  </P></p>

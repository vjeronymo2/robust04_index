			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Intense competition holds manufacturers' prices steady The recent rise in commodity prices helped push input prices for manufacturers to higher-than-expected levels last month, official figures yesterday showed. But intense competition has so far prevented manufacturers from passing these rises on to their customers, the data suggested. The cost of materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent in June compared with May, the Central Statistical Office said. Measured over the year as a whole, input prices rose 1.6 per cent. However, the price of goods leaving factory gates in the manufacturing sector as a whole remained flat between June and May. Measured without the volatile food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum sectors, output prices rose 0.1 per cent between May and June, and 1.9 per cent over the year. The rise in input prices was higher than the City had expected, with some analysts warning that this might feed through to output price inflation later this summer. But the fact that input prices have been rising faster than output prices for several months now, reversing the trend seen last year, suggests that the intense competitive pressures are forcing manufacturers to absorb the costs themselves, analysts said. A rise in the price of metals and other imported commodities accounted for nearly half of the 0.8 per cent change in the input index, with the metals sector seeing the sharpest monthly rise in input prices, reflecting the recent surge in commodity prices. Metal input prices rose 1.5 per cent between May and June, and 8.3 per cent over the year. This rise was partly offset by a fall in the cost of domestically produced commodities and fuel. The cost of home-produced food manufacturing inputs and fuel both fell 1.2 per cent last month. Nevertheless, nearly all categories within the manufacturing sector saw input prices rise at a faster rate than output prices last month. The wood and wood products sector saw the sharpest yearly rise in input prices, with input prices growing 5.6 per cent over the year, after edging up rapidly in recent months. Output prices, by contrast, grew just 2.6 per cent in the same period. In the basic metal and metals product sector, input prices grew 6 per cent over the year, while output prices rose just 4.6 per cent. The electrical and optical equipment sector saw a rise of 3.9 per cent in input costs, while output prices grew 1.3 per cent.</p>

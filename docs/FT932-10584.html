			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (2): A new generation may now get its chance - Politics, at a time of great uncertainty, John Murray Brown considers what may happen next PRESIDENT Turgut Ozal's sudden death from heart failure on April 17 was a severe blow, setting off an unpredictable chain of events. If the loss of Mr Ozal is followed by a decision by prime minister Suleyman Demirel to stand as a candidate for the presidency, this would remove the two principal actors from the Turkish political stage. One possibility is that the present turmoil will eventually encourage the two right-wing parties to join forces. It may also result in a reunification of the left. This in turn could force through a new generation of younger Turkish politicians. These, at least, are the hopes of many Turks. It would be hard to imagine the True Path (DYP) party without Mr Demirel, if he gives up the leadership to become president. Yet much the same was said of the late Mr Ozal when he had himself appointed to the presidency in 1989. In the event, after a bitter internal struggle, the Motherland Party (Anap) emerges today with a good chance of winning the next election under Mr Mesut Yilmaz, a leader of experience and a former prime minister. Few of the parliament's 450 deputies appear anxious to settle the issue with early elections. Without Mr Demirel at the helm to steer the party through the next election, many DYP parliamentarians would expect to lose their seats and, more important, lose the lever of patronage that goes with it. The question of who would succeed Mr Demirel as DYP head has first to be settled. Various names have been put forward, including that of interior minister Ismet Sezgin, a respectable if uninspiring figure. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the feisty economy minister, has made no secret of her leadership ambitions, although conservative elements in DYP may block her. Parliamentary speaker Husamettin Cindoruk would be a more popular choice, although his maverick stance on issues in defiance of the DYP has alienated some party support. The search for a new leader could well lead to the collapse of the 17-month old coalition with the Social Democratic Populists (SHP), and the painstaking formation of a new government. to secure their democratic traditions. If the history of coalitions is a fairly unhappy one, it nonetheless underscores the unstable nature of Turkish political loyalties. Since 1960, the country has seen three military coups. Successive interventions have left the political landscape riven with fault lines. But today, particularly among young people, there is a growing disillusion with the old-style patronage politics. Like peers in the House of Lords, Turkish deputies have come under public fire, the latest target being the parliament's appalling record of absenteeism. Apart from the extreme parties, particularly the Islamic right, divisions in Turkish politics remain artificial. The spectrum ranges from fundamentalist Islam to nationalists of both left and right. In between these are two centre-right parties, two social democrat parties, and a radical Kurdish group, the People's Labour party (HEP). The recent proliferation  - there are now 10 parties with representation in parliament  - is not so much a measure of Turkish pluralism, as the result of Mr Demirel's decision to lift the ban on parties outlawed by the generals in 1980. On the right, it is often hard to distinguish between the DYP and Anap, currently the main opposition party. The former is the inheritor of the Justice party, banned after the 1980 coup. The Justice party, without being able to say so too explicitly, was the natural successor to the right-wing populists of the Democrat party of Adnan Menderes, the Turkish prime minister executed in 1961. Anap is more closely identified with the urban middle class. It attracts the business vote of Istanbul, while the DYP has been strong in the smaller towns of Anatolia and the Aegean. Both parties are broadly committed to the market-based economic policies pursued by Mr Ozal from the early 1980s, although the DYP has shown more instinct for Keynesian style interventionism than Anap. As long as the right-wing parties control a future government, Turkey will continue to pursue a pro-western foreign policy. The right-wing vote in Turkey has traditionally accounted for about 60 per cent of the electorate, and many analysts believe there will be an overwhelming logic for the parties to bury their differences. But for all the similarities, a DYP-Anap coalition will not be easy to forge in the wake of recent corruption allegations. For the first time since the military coup, two former Anap ministers were put on trial earlier this year, charged with irregularities on government procurement contracts. Anap's response has been to mount a vitriolic campaign of slander against state minister Cavit Caglar. In a recent poll, Mr Caglar emerged as the least popular of the main Turkish politicians. He remains a close confidant of Mr Demirel, and Anap's campaign has clearly hurt Mr Demirel's public standing. On the left, the picture is equally unresolved. Mr Erdal Inonu's SHP has of late looked distinctly uncomfortable, as the junior coalition partners of the DYP, on sensitive issues like policy towards the Kurdish minority, on the new education bill which reflects the growing influence of the Islamic lobby in the ministry, and on the recent ban on private radios  - an issue on which the coalition has lost considerable public sympathy. Also on the left, the Republican People's party (CHP) has emerged as the main beneficiary of the lifting of the ban on political parties, although predictions that large numbers of SHP deputies would defect to the CHP proved exaggerated. The CHP currently has 21 seats, compared with 54 for the SHP. The main loser has been Mr Bulent Ecevit, the former prime minister, whose Democratic Socialists (DSP) has now been reduced to just three seats. Where the DSP has fallen down, the Moslem-based Welfare party (RP) has made ground. The party, which has 40 seats, stands on an anti-western Islamic platform, and has done well in recent by-elections among the disaffected populations of the poorer urban constituencies, particularly in Istanbul. The one unknown in all this is what role Kurdish politics is to play in Turkey. The constitution currently bans politicians from appealing to explicitly ethnic sentiment. But if the various Kurdish political groups are able to forge a common stance in the wake of the rebel ceasefire, there could soon be a new force to contend with, creating quite new fissures in Turkish politics.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> EXXON BLAMES STATE FOR SPILL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Exxon has filed a legal complaint against the state of Alaska, charging that  the state prevented the oil company from using chemicals to disperse oil in the  early days of the Exxon Valdez spill last March. The company's complaint was  filed as a counterclaim to a state suit against Exxon and essentially seeks to  shift the blame off the oil company for the damage caused by the spill and onto  the state. State officials have insisted that Exxon had permission to use  dispersants in most of the spill area, but that the oil company had an  insufficient quantity of dispersant and was unable to muster the needed air  support.  </P></p>

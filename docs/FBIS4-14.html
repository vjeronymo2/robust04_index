			<p>In   a move that could complicate international efforts to maintain  pressure on Libya for its alleged involvement in the bombing of  Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 and a French airliner in 1989, Beijing  has forcefully reiterated its opposition to sanctions against  Libya and expressed greater support for Libya's position than in  the past.  Meeting with Libyan foreign minister 'Umar Mustafa al-  Muntasir on the second day of his 28-30 March visit to Beijing,  PRC Foreign Minister and Vice Premier Qian Qichen restated the  position Beijing adopted against sanctions when it intensified  its support of Libya prior to the United Nations Security Council  (UNSC) vote imposing sanctions in March 1992.  According to a 29  March Xinhua account of the talks, Qian said that Beijing  continues to "disapprove of imposing sanctions against Libya, let  alone stepping up sanctions," and "favors settlement of the  Lockerbie crisis through consultation and negotiation by the  parties concerned."  Reiterating China's "opposition to terrorism  of any description," Qian said that the sanctions had "escalated  tensions in the region" and should be settled "through peaceful  means."  Last November the PRC Ambassador to the United Nations  Li Zhaoxing had similarly registered Beijing's authoritative  opposition to new UNSC sanctions against Libya, declaring that  "to intensify sanctions" against Libya may further "complicate"  the problem (Xinhua, 12 November 1993).     Although Qian's remarks did not revise China's official stance on  sanctions, he seemed to express stronger public support for  Libya's views than has appeared in previous PRC media coverage of  the issue, treatment suggesting that Beijing wishes to further  distance itself from the West on this question.  Stating that  "China fully understands and sympathizes with Libya's plight" and  "does not want to see the situation worsen," Qian went on to  express "appreciation" for Libya's "flexibility" in trying to  settle the problem through "peaceful negotiations."  Qian gave no  indication of how China will vote on any future UNSC resolutions  to toughen the sanctions.  China abstained from voting on  Resolution 748 authorizing sanctions in 1992 and again on the  UNSC resolution approving new sanctions last November (Xinhua, 31  March 1992, 12 November 1993).

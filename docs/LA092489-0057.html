			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS: NATIVE CALIFORNIAN  </P> <P> One of the most distinctive of bulbs is native mostly to California, the  Mariposa tulip, Calochortus. Looking somewhat like a small tulip, but much more  wildly marked (some contain every color imaginable including splotches of red,  purple, yellow and brown) and often fringed or covered with hairs, these bulbs  have fascinated gardeners at various times, especially earlier in the century  when they were promoted by nurseryman Carl Purdy.  </P> <P> With many now endangered in the wild, and with a new interest in drought  resistant plantings that often use natives, there is also a renewed interest in  the calochortus and a small society has been formed. Their newsletter,  naturally named "Mariposa," is just starting up and subscriptions will costs $2  a year for four issues. Write to Mariposa, 260 Alden Road, Hayward, Calif.  94541.

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Why cost is everything It might be galling for an investor with only a couple of thousand pounds to be told: 'Options are not for you.' But this has nothing to do with the level of experience and everything to do with cost, which falls significantly after a certain level. Many brokers will charge 2 per cent commission (compared with 1.65 per cent for equities) and a minimum of between Pounds 30 to Pounds 50 for each investment, however small. Thus, it could be uneconomic to buy less than Pounds 2,500 worth of options. Many derivative specialists argue that options should not represent more than 10 per cent of a portfolio. Even ShareLink, the cut-price Birmingham-based broker which claims to carry out around a quarter of all private investor dealing, charges a minimum of Pounds 33.50 for the whole process from purchase to sale. Every point move in FT-SE index options represents Pounds 10; so, if an investor bought one contract, the option price would have to rise by 3.5 points just to cover the dealing costs. In addition to the commission, the spreads - the difference between the price at which a broker is prepared to buy and sell - often are high relative to equities. The spread on Glaxo October 500 calls was recently 62 1/2 p bid and 68 1/2 p offered, or 10 per cent. The spread on the underlying shares is around 2 per cent. The other side of the argument is that if you can afford to lose the money, options are one of the few ways to get gearing with limited risk. The costs may be higher - but the potential gains and losses are greater, too.</p>

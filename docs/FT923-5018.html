			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Mowlem On the whole investors are probably not too bothered whether or not the Stock Exchange's company news service turns into a sort of electronic Exchange and Mart. Mowlem shareholders, though, may wonder whether the unusual decision to publish its adviser's telephone number on it for the benefit of 'interested parties' reflects the urgency of signing a London City airport deal. The company insists not, and to be fair the financial warning lights are hardly flashing. Mowlem's balance sheet looks reasonably robust by contractors' standards - gearing should not be more than 35 to 40 per cent this year - and 1991's 3 1/2 times interest cover provides a respectable buffer. The scaffolding side ought to be a cash generator even in depressed times, and though a cash outflow is expected on the contracting side there are no obvious horror stories. That said, the decision to flush out co-investors at this stage remains puzzling. The City airport project may start to generate cash over the next 12 to 18 months, while the promoters can point to improved road access and recent successes in developing new services. But an operating loss on the airport looks inevitable this year - one incidentally which will show up in the group profit and loss account now the 1990 provision has been exhausted  -while the required passenger volumes for breaking even still look some way off. Perhaps Mowlem has simply - and not unwisely - decided to cut its losses on a Docklands excursion conceived in headier days.</p>

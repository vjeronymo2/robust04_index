			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Poor second half leaves Reliance Security down 68% RELIANCE Security Group suffered badly in the second half and over the year to April 30 experienced a 68 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits. The shares dropped 13p to 117p. The dividend, however, is maintained at 4.5p, the final being 3.4p to which directors waived half their entitlement. Earnings per share came to 3.5p (10.2p). Turnover rose to Pounds 68m (Pounds 63.4m) and pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 3.42m), struck after further losses of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 900,000) in developing the electronic surveillance business towards the critical mass in sales needed to generate profits. Also, for this year, there was an exceptional debit of Pounds 352,000 relating to reorganisation of central support services and operations administration. Mr Brian Kingham, chairman, said that despite recession the group had continued with a number of investment programmes which had been costly but would more than compensate in the strength gained from market position. For the current year he forecast a recovery in earnings, even without a significant change in market conditions.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: Poor UK show in Shanghai Sir, On my return from China I read with interest your six-page survey on Shanghai (June 2). You wrote that this booming port intends to become a leading financial centre in Asia and that the year 2010 is mentioned as the target for the city to overtake Hong Kong as a financial services and trading giant. I hope the Foreign Office read the survey. At present the British consulate in Shanghai consists of three Britons and a Chinese staff of seven. The members of the UK business community with whom I spoke were unanimous in saying that the consulate offered them no help or support. Meanwhile the Australian consulate has a staff of 50; the French consulate, 20. Why doesn't the Foreign Office stop being so archaic and get down to business?

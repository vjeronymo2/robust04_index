			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> U.S. Civil Rights Commission Chairman William Barclay Allen said that President  Bush will have to come to him directly if he wants him to resign. The White  House said Bush has no intention of asking Allen to quit but made it clear that  a replacement was being readied. "It would make no sense for me to do it  (resign voluntarily)," Allen said in the wake of reports that Bush planned to  replace him with Arthur A. Fletcher, a moderate Republican and one of Bush's  early black political supporters. Allen said he has been trying to meet with  Bush since the election, but has received no response from the President or  anyone else at the White House. His term does not expire until 1992.  </P></p>

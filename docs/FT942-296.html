			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (17): Selecting quality - Mail Order / Philip Jenks of the Founders talks to Gay Firth The Founders Library, a mail order business book list, aims to act as a sieve. It recognises the hard truth that - put politely - one business book can be less useful and readable than another. Busy people have little time to sift the useful one or two from the boring thousands in an avalanche of business print. Many do not read at all. Philip Jenks was a busy but bored articled clerk in a big City law firm a couple of years ago: 'Most of the work in my first two years was about as exciting and challenging as sweeping Earls Court after the Horse of the Year show,' he says. So he set up his own imprint, Harriman House, and published The Official Lawyer's Handbook, a keyhole scrutiny as clear-headed, amusing, and irreverent as himself. Trotting the copies for sale round London's bookshops (he has sold nearly 9,000 since September 1992), Mr Jenks noted the 'creaking shelves of business books, some of them 300 pages long', on abstruse management disciplines and would-be financial wizardry. A need to sift and select, on behalf of potential readers, was plain. 'There are an awful lot of 'how to' books written by 'never did' people, perpetrating the myth of easy solutions to business problems and gilding their solutions in fancy nostrums and empty cant.' Philip Jenks's cheerful, gung-ho manner can turn steely; his eye is sharp and his purpose is serious. 'I have a healthy disdain for the heavyweight, heavy-price, theoretical side of business publishing - the stuff which is no fun and not much use either.' The Founders Library specialises in business biographies and business history. 'Our books are about founders - people who started their own businesses and successfully built them into large commercial enterprises - for founders, or at least people with a founder's mentality. Founders are entrepreneurial, single-minded and intolerant of bull. They want to know what an author has achieved to warrant their attention.' Mr Jenks selects from three sources. He buys in books - actual books, not rights - which have been successful in the US but not published here, such as the autobiography Made in America by Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart. The second source is in identifying forgotten business classics and re-publishing them. The third is a strict selection of 'founder's' books nearing the end of their first published life in the UK, bought in on trade terms for mail order distribution. Jenks's turnover in his first year was Pounds 42,000. 'In the current year it's difficult to say, but I'll be disappointed if it's not double that.' His book buyers' database is 2,973 strong: 'Not huge, but they've all bought within the last 18 months and it's a good quality list.' Jenks has more than a little of the founder's mentality himself.

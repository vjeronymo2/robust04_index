			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sharaf: "Remaining Basic Problems </F> Left on the Road to Real and Comprehensive Peace in the Middle  East"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's return  to the Middle East next week, just two weeks after his last  visit to the region, indicates that the peace process in the  region has entered a decisive stage.    The start of the implementation of the Declaration of  Principles and the Gaza-Jericho Agreement on Palestinian  self-rule a few days ago as a result of the efforts made by  Egypt's political leadership represented by President Husni  Mubarak emphasizes the need to achieve parallel progress on the  other tracks in the peace process. The Syrian-Israeli track is  the most important track and the Lebanese-Israeli track is  closely linked to it. As for the Jordanian-Israeli track, there  are no real problems facing it.    The U.S. secretary of state is returning to the region to  try  to break the deadlock on the Syrian-Israeli negotiating track.  The track has been deadlocked since the Israeli-Palestinian  Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington. There is  not much that can be said about this track. The situation  requires a major step by Israel. Israel must clearly express  its acceptance of the principle of full withdrawal from the  Syrian Golan Heights. The U.S. secretary of state carried new  Israeli proposals to Damascus during his last tour of the  region. Reports in the past two days indicate that Syria has  not rejected these proposals but expressed reservations, as they  did not explicitly refer to the principle of full withdrawal  from the occupied Syrian Golan. Other reports have also  indicated that Syria also has reservations over the timetable  for withdrawal proposed by Israel.    In light of the above it can be said that the Syrian-Israeli  negotiations hinge on an important step on the part of Israel,  namely, to clearly express its agreement to withdraw completely  from Syria's territory. As for Syria, all the reports indicate  that it is ready to establish full peace with Israel in return  for full withdrawal and to negotiate an agreement on mutual  security guarantees without infringing on the rights or basic  legitimate demands of either of the two parties.    There are strong indications that Christopher's next tour  could break the deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli talks. We do not  need to reiterate that Egypt is paying full attention to this  peace track, the attention equalling that paid to the  Palestinian-Israeli track.    The point that must be emphasized here is that while the  peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track has achieved a  great breakthrough in solving the Palestinian issue -- the core  of the conflict between the Arab countries and Israel -- some  remaining problems on this track are still very complicated.  The Israeli side has shown some flexibility in its stance on  the settlements and indicated the possibility of abandoning them  in the final stages. But its stance on other problems remains  negative and could, if the intransigence is maintained,  undermine the entire peace process despite the strenuous efforts  to date. In this regard, we specifically mention the problems  of Jerusalem and the refugees. Regarding Jerusalem, no one can  foresee how things will develop if no agreement is reached on  this issue that is acceptable to both sides and to all the  parties concerned with this major issue and its uniqueness. As  for the refugee problem, Egypt said before the multilateral  talks refugees committee, which has been meeting in Cairo since  the day before yesterday, that there will be no peace or  stability in the region if this problem is not solved. This  issue is subject to international resolutions that should be  taken into consideration. Flexibility must be a principal  element when dealing with this and other major issues during the  peace process, which remains long, uneven, and fraught with  dangers.    It is an accepted axiom that there is no alternative to  peace, which continues to represent the future and hopes of all  the peoples of the region, regardless of their nationalities.</p>

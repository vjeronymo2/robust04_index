			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS,' ROGER RABBIT SHORT  FOR $22.99  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> The surprise blockbuster of last summer comes to video today with a pleasingly  surprising price. "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which grossed $130 million at the  box office, shrinks to only $22.99 on tape. That includes the Roger Rabbit  cartoon "Tummy Trouble," which also accompanied the film in theaters.  </P> <P> Starring Rick Moranis, Matt Frewer, Marcia Strassman, Amy O'Neill and Robert  Oliveri, the fantastic comedy shows what four kids encounter as they travel  across a yard after being reduced to bug size. If you don't expect anything too  profound, this Walt Disney release (rated PG) is a lot of special-effects fun  for the whole family.  </P> <P> There's also something special in the new-release racks for fans of the late  Bette Davis. MGM/UA has come up with six more of her films from the '30s and  '40s for $19.95 each:  </P> <P> * "Dangerous" (1935). The actress won her first Oscar for her part in this  enjoyable soaper.  </P> <P> * "The Man Who Came to Dinner" (1941). Remarkable both for being a comedy (she  made few) and for Davis' part being smaller than usual during this period, this  was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play, also starring Monty Wooley.  </P> <P> * "Deception" (1946). Powerful melodrama about a pianist and the jealous men in  her life (Claude Rains and Paul Henreid).  </P> <P> * "The Great Lie" (1941). In this one, Mary Astor's the pianist (and Oscar  winner) battling Davis in a tumultuous romance-and-tragedy soaper.  </P> <P> * "In This Our Life" (1942). John Huston directed Davis as a woman who  threatens to ruin the life of her sister (Olivia de Havilland).  </P> <P> * "A Stolen Life" (1946). This time Davis plays both sisters in a soap opera  about twins in love with -- you guessed it -- the same guy.  </P> <P> Also just out:  </P> <P> "Little Monsters" (MGM/UA, $89.95, PG). Comedy for young fans of Fred Savage  ("The Wonder Years") only.  </P> <P> "A Dangerous Life" (J2, $79.95). Even though it stars Gary Busey, this  made-for-TV film isn't a documentary about his helmet-less motorcycle wreck;  it's a drama about the change of power in the Philippines.

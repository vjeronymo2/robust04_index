			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / UK fund managers confident of Yes vote UK INSTITUTIONAL fund managers overwhelmingly believe the French will vote Yes in the referendum on the Maastricht treaty, according to a survey carried out last week for Smith New Court, the stockbroker. Almost two-thirds of the managers did not expect sterling to be devalued within the European exchange rate mechanism if the French rejected the treaty. The survey confirmed that the Italian lira was the most vulnerable currency in the ERM before yesterday's 7 per cent devaluation; 81 per cent of the fund managers believed a French No vote would have led to downwards realignment of the lira. Most also believed Germany's internationally important Lombard rate would start to fall soon from near-record levels of 9.75 per cent soon. With French opinion polls indicating that the vote is more finely balanced than institutional investors believe, the survey suggests UK equity markets could be in for a sharp shock if the treaty is rejected. The survey by Gallup covered 99 fund managers who together handle Pounds 531bn of investments.</p>

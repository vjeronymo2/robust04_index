			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) NatWest faces ban on overtime Correction (published 28th September 1992) appended to this article. MORE than 1,000 staff at National Westminster Bank have voted for industrial action over compulsory redundancies, the Bifu banking union said yesterday. The union has called for an urgent meeting with the bank, and if the dispute is not resolved staff based mainly in Manchester branches will begin an overtime ban on October 1. NatWest, the second-largest UK bank, said customers would not be affected. The bank, which has a workforce of 102,000, said the action would not 'alter the compelling business reasons which make necessary the reduction in staffing levels'. NatWest announced in April that it would shed 4,000 jobs this year including 1,900 in its UK branches. The bank rejects Bifu's accusation that its methods of selecting staff for redundancy are unfair. Almost 300 staff voted in favour of the action, while almost 250 voted against. NatWest said 12 other groups among its 5,000 staff based in Manchester had also been balloted with most voting against action. Bifu members will demonstrate in Manchester today. CORRECTION NEARLY 300 members of the Bifu banking union employed by National Westminster Bank in the Manchester region have voted for an overtime ban over compulsory redundancies, and not more than 1,000 as reported in Saturday's FT. The vote against was almost 250.</p>

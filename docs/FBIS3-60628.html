The U.S. delegate made insidious remarks that the United  States would "not resume negotiations" with the DPRK unless the  continuity of nuclear safeguards was ensured. And the director  general of the IAEA groundlessly said "there is possibility of  North Korea having transferred nuclear substances to other  places as the regular lifespan of inspection cameras has come to  an end".    The outcry of the U.S. and IAEA sides that the continuity of  safeguards on nuclear activities of the DPRK were undermined is  a totally unfounded talk, and it is a dirty act reversing black  and white.    At present, the inspection cameras and seals of the IAEA  remain attached to the nuclear facilities of the DPRK. It is a  sheer distortion of fact, therefore, to say that the continuity  of safeguards on nuclear activities is on the point of  suspension and that nuclear substances might have been  transferred to other places.    The DPRK is ready to receive an inspection team for the  readjustment or replacement of inspection cameras at any moment  if the agency requests. This stand of the DPRK will remain  invariable till the nuclear problem has been solved completely  through DPRK-USA talks.    Thus, inspection cameras are enough to ensure the continuity  of safeguards. But the DPRK, taking the position of the U.S.  side into consideration, manifested the lenient stand that the  range of inspection may be further expanded, and had already  informal contacts with the U.S. side and proposed working  negotiation to the IAEA side, too.    Nevertheless, the U.S. and IAEA sides contended that the  DPRK  should accept "wholesale inspection" by the agency in order to  ensure the continuity of safeguards, setting it as one of the  preconditions for the holding of the third round of DPRK-USA  talks. This is an argument that cannot convince anyone.    The United States should come out at an early date to the  third- stage DPRK-USA talks with an honest attitude, instead of  setting unreasonable "preconditions". And the IAEA side must  refrain from despicable acts of throwing a wet blanket over the  talks any longer.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Cargill looks outside family Ernest Micek, the new president of Cargill, is neither family nor a trader, two deficits that in another time might have kept him from being next in line for the chairman's office, writes Laurie Morse. Cargill, the secretive commodity merchandiser whose tentacles reach into remote corners of the globe, was built on the canny skills of its traders, who long have been the masters of the company's universe. However, with flat global trade in bulk commodities, Micek's appointment is viewed as a shift toward the company's higher-margin commodities processing arm and its future in food marketing. Micek, 58, has spent his 35-year career building Cargill's food processing operations, including its highly profitable corn-milling division, which makes sweetners for soft drinks and is expanding into the ethanol business. Last year, the company had profits of Dollars 348m on Dollars 47bn in sales. Micek's appointment as president puts him in a logical position to succeed Whitney MacMillan, the 64-year-old great-grandson of one of the company's founders who has served as chairman for 17 years. MacMillan plans to retire next year, and with few family members waiting in the top executive ranks, a lifetime Cargill executive with upper mid-West roots may prove to be the best substitute. Another contender is David Raisbeck, the 44-year-old head of Cargill's trading sector, who was given a seat on the board when Micek was made president this month.</p>

The operation will be carried out by units of the  Engineering Command, and within the same time span that had been  announced for the operation with U.S. troops. Monjagata could  not explain where the funds would come from.    "The commander in chief on 23 March ordered that this  operation be carried out on the same date and in the same region  by units of the Army's Engineering Command jointly with other  military units," Monjagata said.    The officer stated that the operation that was planned by  the  Americans will be carried out, "but with units of our Armed  Forces." In this respect we must recall that the Paraguayan  Government did not grant permission to the U.S. Armed Forces to  carry out the operation, and denied entry to 600 soldiers and  technicians that were going to build eight schools, the same  number of water tanks, and a health center, and improve the  roads in San Pedro Department.    The government's argument for not letting in the U.S. troops  was based on the fact that some of the conditions that had been  requested by the Americans were out of order.    When asked, Monjagata could not say where the Armed Forces  would get the funds and resources to carry out this operation,  which will be called "Strong Roads '94 South."    "Presumably the commander in chief will know where to get  these funds," Monjagata said, and added that he did not have  that information.    He indicated that in his opinion the funds will be provided  from the budget of the Armed Forces.    It is strange that Wasmosy has ordered that the Armed Forces  participate in an operation that deals with construction work,  which should be in the hands of private companies, and it is  also strange that the origin of the funds to be used has not  been specified.</p>

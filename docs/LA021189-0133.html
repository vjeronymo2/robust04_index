			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE FIGURE, ONCE LOST IN DRAIN, RESURFACES  </P> <P> Remember Paul Koverman? He was a familiar figure on San Diego stages for years,  first as principal dancer with the California Ballet and eventually as ballet  master for the company.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the dance drain that skims the cream from the local community  snatched Koverman a few years ago. The enterprising ex-dancer heads a ballet  school in Phoenix now, and might never have surfaced in San Diego again had it  not been for a special friendship with Stage Seven's Ellen Richard-Gil.  </P> <P> "Last year, Ellen needed a piece for Stage Seven, and she nearly twisted my arm  to come and set something for them," Koverman said by phone from his studio. "I  had never done any choreography while in San Diego, because I just didn't think  I was ready. It takes time to get up the confidence, but Kathryn Irey (artistic  director of Stage Seven) is open to experimental work, so she gave me a  chance."  </P> <P> "I had seen some of the small things Paul did for students and a videotape of  another piece," Richard-Gil said. "He has an incredible imagination and  musicality. When Kathryn took over, we discussed using Paul, and she went for  the big risk. It's in keeping with the kind of company Kathryn wants -- a  dancer's company rather than a vehicle for one choreographer."  </P> <P> Koverman's choreography debut in San Diego during Stage Seven's concert in May  was a rousing success that opened an important door for its talented designer.  </P> <P> "It was very well received, and I've already got the (National Endowment for  the Arts) coming to see me about a grant," Koverman said. "I'm also planning to  send tapes to the Boston Ballet."  </P> <P> The work also earned Koverman a return trip to San Diego to choreograph  "L'estro Armonico" for Stage Seven's concert at 8 p.m. tonight at City College.  </P> <P> Unlike his first local effort -- a stark, postmodern work -- Koverman's latest  creation is firmly rooted in ballet, and he acknowledges that he's "still  trying to find my style."  </P> <P> Also on this weekend's program is the company debut of Patrick Nollet's modern  duo, "Valse Triste," and two other premieres: Mieczyslaw Morawski's  "Schubertones" and James Kelly's "Fronteras," a collaboration with border  artist Mario Torero.  </P></p>

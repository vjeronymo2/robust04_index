			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel and Morocco are holding contacts over the  possibility of establishing mutual bureaus of interests. This  was reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. The  prime minister's office denies that Yitzhaq Rabin plans to  travel to Morocco. The prime minister and the foreign minister  had planned to leave for Morocco immediately after the signing  of the Israeli- Palestinian agreement in Cairo on 4 May, but the  visit was canceled at the last moment. It now appears that only  Mr. Peres will visit Morocco.</p>

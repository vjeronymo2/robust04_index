			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Aleksandr Onosovskiy; from the "Novosti" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Vympel design bureau is one of the oldest  research centers of the Russian defense industry. It designs  missiles of all ranges for combat aircraft. In this type of  armament Russia still maintains its superiority -- to a large  extent thanks to Vympel. For example, not even the U.S. Army has  a reverse start missile like our R-73E [AA-11 `Archer' class],  which is designed for close-range dogfights. The air-to-air  AAM-AE missile [AA-X-12] is equal in quality to its U.S.  counterpart, [AIM-120 A] AMRAAM, while costing only half as  much. There are missiles capable of hitting targets at a range  of hundreds of miles. The list can go on and on.    But like most defense industry enterprises, Vympel finds it  hard to work now. Because of a shortage of funds, it is  continually forced to reduce long-term research, which gives an  impetus to the creation of new types of armament. Yet the  acclaimed design bureau still manages to maintain its  reputation. The newest missile system was tested recently on  the MiG-31M [`Foxhound-B'] aircraft. The Russian president  himself congratulated the work force on the success of the  experiment. Now Vympel cherishes justifiable hopes for serious  support.</p>

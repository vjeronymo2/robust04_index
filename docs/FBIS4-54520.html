			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 30 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] protested Saturday to Bosnian Serb authorities over  an attack on British UN troops on foot patrol inside a  NATO-imposed exclusion zone in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. A  patrol came under fire Friday [29 April] at 1:30 p.m. (1130 GMT)  in the east of the zone from Serb forces which were themselves  within the three-kilometre (two-mile) limit imposed by the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation on April 22, UNPROFOR spokesman  Eric Chaperon said. The British forces had taken no casualties.  They had riposted, and the Serbs were believed to have taken  three casualties in what Chaperon described as a violation of  the NATO ultimatum in the eastern town of some 65,000 residents.    Under the NATO deadline, all Serb heavy weaponry was to be  withdrawn from a 20 kilometre (12 mile) radius around Gorazde,  and troops pulled out from the inner exclusion zone, by 0001 GMT  Wednesday. No further details were immediately available on  Friday's incident.</p>

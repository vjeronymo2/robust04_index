			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Textron to replace engines on Russian regional jets TEXTRON Lycoming, the aero-engine division of the US Textron group, has reached a long term collaboration agreement with the Yakovlev Design Bureau to re-engine Russian YAK-40 regional jetliners. The US company also plans to provide engines for a proposed Russian widebody business jet, the YAK-48. The agreement reflects increasing Russian efforts to upgrade their existing aerospace products and future programmes to western standards. Rolls-Royce of the UK and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US are already involved in Russian aircraft re-engining programmes as Russian manufacturers step up their drive to try to market their products in western markets to earn hard currency. Textron Lycoming will be working with Yakovlev on plans to replace the three Russian engines powering the YAK-40 regional jet with two Lycoming LF507 turbofans. The YAK-40 is a 27-32 passenger regional jetliner specifically designed to fly in and out of smaller airports throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States and eastern Europe where runway conditions can be rough. Depending on the needs of airlines in the Russian federation, all or a part of the current YAK-40 fleet of about 1,000 aircraft could be candidates for the re-engining programme.</p>

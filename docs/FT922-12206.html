			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Legal aid move faces opposition THE LAW Society has called on the government to withdraw a legal-aid circular sent to magistrates' courts which it claims is unlawful and could deprive defendants of legal representation, Robert Rice writes. The circular, issued by the Lord Chancellor's Department, tells courts not to grant legal aid unless applicants can produce documentary evidence to support their statement of means. The society says it will be impossible for defendants arrested and kept in custody overnight to have access to such documentation by the time they appear in court. Either many defendants will be refused legal aid and will not be represented at the start of their cases, or the cases will be held up as defendants obtain the documentation. Mr Andrew Lockley, the society's director of legal practice, said: 'The Lord Chancellor's Department issued this circular without consulting the profession. If followed it will cause serious delay to court proceedings and potentially serious hardship to defendants, particularly those remanded in custody. The department should withdraw it immediately.'</p>

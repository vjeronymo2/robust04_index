			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Impeachment case against Collor 'inevitable' IMPEACHMENT proceedings against Brazil's President Fernando Collor are 'inevitable', the head of a congressional inquiry into the country's growing corruption scandal said yesterday. Mr Benito Gama heads a commission investigating charges of influence-peddling and corruption against Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a businessman who was Mr Collor's campaign treasurer. Congress will use the investigators' findings, to be published this weekend, when considering whether to begin impeachment proceedings. A two-thirds vote by the 503-member lower house of Congress is needed for proceedings to begin. The head of a parallel inquiry, investigating Mr Farias' alleged involvement in the privatisation of the airline Vasp, asked for the businessman's preventive detention. Federal Deputy Nilson Gibson said his commission had uncovered sufficient evidence against Mr Farias on charges of corruption, tax evasion and influence-peddling to warrant the request. Mr Farias admitted to the commission that he had lent money to Mr Wagner Canhedo, who purchased the airline from the state of Sao Paulo in 1990. Brazil's drastic experiment aimed at ending inflation ended quietly this week  - and economists judged it a resounding failure, Reuter reports from Rio de Janeiro. President Collor astonished Brazil when, the day after taking office in March 1990, he froze most of the country's liquid assets overnight in a once-and-for-all effort to beat inflation. Everyone with bank deposits worth more than Dollars 1,250 (Pounds 655) was told that the government had 'borrowed' their money and would not give it back for 18 months. The central bank estimates that Dollars 45.7bn was sucked out of the economy at a stroke. The 'Collor plan' left citizens penniless, threw the economy into chaos, enraged companies and helped cause one of the country's worst recessions, but failed to kill inflation. As the government paid back the final instalment of the money on Monday, no one was celebrating. After an initial dip to 3.3 per cent a month, inflation quickly bounced back and is now running close to 25 per cent a month. Brazilian debt value slips, Capital Markets Page</p>

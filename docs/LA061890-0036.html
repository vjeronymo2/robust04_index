At its first meeting, the Cabinet  named Sharon, a former defense minister, and Eitan, chief of staff during the  Lebanon invasion, to the 11-man ministerial Defense Committee. Sharon, a leader  of the conservative Likud Party, also was named chairman of a Cabinet committee  overseeing the immigration of Soviet Jews.  </P></p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fine service for real people Sir, The media (including the FT) has been reporting gleefully on delays to the Eurostar Channel tunnel trains ('Channel train delayed again', October 26). For regular travellers between London and Brussels, occasional delays of 10 minutes, or even an hour, such as those experienced by Eurostar would be acceptable compared with the discomfort and constant unpunctuality of travelling by air. London Heathrow now has the added inconvenience of buildings collapsing into access tunnels. I will be abandoning the airlines for Eurostar once regular services commence on November 14. I suppose that one should take some comfort from the fact that these Eurostar delays have not affected real people - only journalists] Bryan Cassidy, The Stables, White Cliff Gardens, Blandford Forum, Dorset DT11 7BU</p>

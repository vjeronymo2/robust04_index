			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> SEX, LIES AND: Color us astonished. Frank Magid Associates, a respected  Iowa-based research firm, recently conducted a sexual attitude survey to  determine, among other things, what performers people enjoyed listening to  "during a sexual experience."  </P> <P> (The survey was commissioned by "Hard Copy," a tabloid-TV show with an  unquenchable fascination for such matters.) The results come as something of a  shock. We'd have expected Madonna or Smokey Robinson (or at least Frank  Sinatra) to emerge as winners. But Magid, who claims to have surveyed 1,000  adults from age 18 to 49, insists that the most popular artist for sexual  encounters is . . . Neil Diamond. At No. 2 is Beethoven (!), with other Top 10  sexual healers including Luther Vandross, Randy Travis (!), Kenny G., Glenn  Miller (!!), Mozart and Led Zeppelin (!!!). Smokey and Madonna and the Chairman  of the Board were nowhere to be found, all eclipsed by country picker Conway  Twitty (!!!!), who finished 15th.  </P></p>

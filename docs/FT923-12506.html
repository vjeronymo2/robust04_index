			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Letter: Production ratio a better economic instrument than money factors You reported on the National Institute for Economic and Social Research's critical report relating to economic forecasts ('Lamont warned of flawed forecasts', July 8), and its comment that this 'could mean that we do not know how the economy responds to instruments of monetary policy'. I am not surprised, for the evidence is clear - in an economic performance with wild swings between boom and recession - that successive chancellors of the exchequer have been badly let down overall by their economic advisers' excessive concentration on money factors; though the reduction in inflation to less than 5 per cent is certainly a welcome achievement. I suggest to the chancellor that he should in future concentrate far more attention on a simple ratio, a production ratio, of the total output value of products manufactured in the UK compared to the value of UK purchases of manufactured products. For the fact is that, if we are to have a prosperous and stable economy, industry must produce far more competitive products saleable at a profit than at present. It matters little whether they are sold in the UK or overseas, provided the production ratio is brought closer to unity than it is now. We have many top companies making a full contribution to improving this ratio, but we need many more. If the chancellor will support such a policy and direct his advisers' attention to the ways of improving the production ratio, he will have less need to take their forecasts with so much salt, and we shall all the sooner get back on the road to sustainable growth. It is high time to let the wealth creators have a go. Caldecote, House of Lords, London SW1</p>

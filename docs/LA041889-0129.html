			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF TODAY'S AFI/LA FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Resurrected'  </P> <P> Great Britain, 1988, 96 minutes  </P> <P> 6:45 p.m.  </P> <P>  The only thing more hellish than war is its uncivilized aftermath in this grim  first film from director Paul Greengrass (co-author of the controversial book  "Spycatcher"), which begins seven weeks after the end of the brief Falklands  War. A missing and presumably dead British soldier miraculously straggles in  from the hills, and although this shy young man is at first given a hero's  welcome back home, he is eventually presumed to be a cowardly deserter and is  ostracized by everyone he knows. Well-told, but unremittingly bleak.CHRIS  WILLMAN  </P></p>

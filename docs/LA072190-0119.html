			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER EXPLORING SOME EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP;  </P> <P> AUTOS: IN OPENING TALKS WITH ITS UNION WORKERS, THE CAR MAKER ALSO HINTS THAT  IT MAY WANT TO BE A STRIKE TARGET.  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. officials, opening negotiations Friday with its union workers,  said they want "to explore some kind of employee ownership" in the company and  dropped hints that Chrysler may want the United Auto Workers Union to choose it  as a strike target.  </P> <P> At the opening of talks with the UAW, Chrysler's chief negotiator, Vice  President Tony St. John, presented UAW President Owen Bieber with a road map of  Detroit. "This is a street map of Detroit, and it leads to Chrysler," St. John  said in an apparent joke.  </P> <P> But it was also the strongest indication to date that Chrysler might want to be  targeted.  </P> <P> Chrysler also said it is interested in a plan for union employees to receive  some form of ownership in the company in return for labor concessions. "We  would like to explore some form of employee ownership," St. John said.  </P> <P> Chrysler is the third major U.S. auto maker this week to open talks with the  UAW on a new national labor agreement. The auto maker's labor pact with the  union, which covers about 63,000 hourly workers, expires Sept. 14.  </P> <P> The UAW traditionally chooses one of the auto makers to be a strike target  during the course of the talks. The UAW then negotiates an agreement with that  auto maker, the pattern of which the two other U.S. car makers are expected to  follow.  </P> <P> Analysts said auto makers sometimes welcome being chosen as the target, because  it may let them negotiate a deal favorable to themselves and potentially  harmful to their competitors.  </P> <P> However, the tactic can sometimes backfire because if a snag develops in the  talks, the targeted auto maker could be subject to a damaging strike.  </P> <P> Chrysler has complained that because of high labor costs, it may not be able to  follow the pattern of an agreement negotiated by its bigger and wealthier U.S.  rivals.  </P> <P> General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, kicked off its talks with  the UAW Wednesday on a new three-year labor pact covering about 330,000 active  and laid-off workers.  </P> <P> GM's overall stance is in keeping with the anticipated approach of the other  auto makers, which are demanding greater flexibility to keep costs down in the  face of tough Japanese competition.  </P> <P> Japanese auto makers have built a major manufacturing presence in the United  States, and now control a record 28% of the American car market, up from 24%  last year.  </P> <P> The Big Three auto makers, which also includes Ford Motor Co., complain that  pension and health-care costs for their workers are higher than those for the  younger and healthier workers employed at Japanese-owned U.S. auto plants.  </P> <P> The UAW has vowed that it will work with the auto makers on health care and  says adopting a national health-care system would be the ultimate solution.  </P> <P> The union, battered by widespread layoffs, is expected to push for a tightening  of the contract language over the closing of plants. The UAW has accused the  auto makers of exploiting the present contract to close plants.  </P> <P> The Big Three auto makers will be negotiating pacts covering about 500,000  active and laid-off UAW members.  </P></p>

			<p>`Anti-Democratic   Regime'   <F P=102> 944K0933B Moscow ERK in Uzbek 16 Jan 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> 944K0933B </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ERK </F> <F P=105>  Uzbek </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned Article: "From the ERK News Center"] </F>   [Text] Changes in the election law and Constitution passed  at the last session of the Uzbekistan High Assembly are another  step toward strengthening the antidemocratic regime.    As a consequence of these measures, the Uzbekistan can  control elections completely, allow a desired party to take part  in the election or declare an undesired party illegal. In fact,  the Assembly legalized a one-party system.    Aside from this, the results of the 1993 Assembly were  uninspired. There was neither applause nor praise. Even the  fawning lickspittles reaching out to the tribunal seemed  dispirited and no one made a speech.    Not even the "retirement" of the Assembly chairman Sh.  Yoldoshev could disturb the numbness of the deputies. And  President I. Karimov's amazing question of the type of "why do  you all look so tired?" remained without influence.    In the opinion of observers, this situation is a sign of  confusion in the ranks of government cadres.    The ties between the government and the cadres are becoming  weaker every day.    The cadres' lack of belief in the leadership is constantly  growing stronger. As they begin to fear for their own positions  and future, so do they fear for the future of the state. This  situation was clearly felt at the High Assembly's last session.</p>

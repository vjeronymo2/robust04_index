			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan recently in Fuzhou] </F>   [Text] Fujian, China's frontline province with Taiwan, is  hoping to penetrate Taipei's "white glove" mainland policy by  opening her harbour resources to Taiwan businesses. The  invitation by the newly-elected Fujian Governor Chen Mingyi is a  tempting offer because Taiwan which has achieved impressive  economic growth over the past decade, has been under great  pressure to expand its already saturated harbours. Taiwan's two  largest ports, Keelung and Kaohsiung, have been so heavily  congested in recent years that seagoing vessels often face  lengthy delays.    According to Mr Chen, Taiwan's petrochemical and shipping  business could reap impressive economic benefits if they made  use of port facilities on Fujian's 3,300-kilometre coastline.  For example, Mr Chen said Fujian was ready to open the Meizhou  Bay and a military port at Sandouao to Taiwan. They are ideal  for the construction of deep-water port facilities. Mr Chen  believed these two ports not only provided a solution to the  congestion problems at Taiwan's Keelung and Kaohsiung, they  could also serve as entrepot to Taiwan. Furthermore, economic  co-operation between Fujian and Taiwan could also cover joint  development of petroleum resources in the Taiwan Strait,  meteorological studies and agriculture, Mr Chen said.    According to another Fujian official, Communist Party  Secretary Jia Qinglin, Beijing has already earmarked Zhangzhou  in southern Fujian as a "priority development zone" and promised  to allocate 20 million yuan (HK$17.76 million) every year for  its development. The last attraction was considered a direct  response by Beijing to an earlier suggestion by Taiwan President  Lee Teng-hui that Taiwan farmers might consider joining hands  with their mainland counterparts.    Plagued by rising land cost and serious environmental  pollution, Taiwan farmers have been pressuring the Government  for assistance to maintain their market competitiveness. In  addition, Mr Jia, who is also the chairman of the province's  legislature, said Xiamen, which was opposite to Taiwan's Quemoy  island would soon introduce new laws to guarantee the protection  of Taiwanese investors' interest there.    Fujian's eagerness to lure Taiwan business was also evident  from the fact the Government was ready to invest billions of  yuan in energy projects including a US$4 billion (HK$30.88  billion) nuclear plant in a small town called Shanqian.    Although the Kuomintang Government in Taiwan still  officially  maintained its "one China" policy, it has steadfastly resisted  pressure from her business community to open direct  communication and transport link with the mainland. This "white  glove" policy by Taipei was a major obstacle to large Taiwan  businesses investing in China.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn, March 17 (AFP) -- The German Foreign  Ministry, in a highly unusual move, summoned Thursday [17 March]  the French ambassador for critical remarks on German foreign  policy amid signs of strain in the Franco-German partnership.    The German move also comes amid controversy over whether  Chancellor Helmut Kohl should have been invited to D-Day  celebrations in France marking the 50th anniversary of the  wartime Allied landing.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts gave no reason for  the summons, but the order for it was reported to have come  directly from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, said to have been  extremely irritated by ambassador Francois Scheer's remarks.    The office of Chancellor Helmut Kohl also indicated that the  French ambassador's remarks were considered out of order and  demanded an explanation. [passage omitted]    Sources close to the French ambassador told AFP after the  meeting that he felt his remarks had been reported selectively,  but that he maintained that relations between the two  governments needed to be improved.    Scheer was said to want to remind the united Germany that it  was anchored to West Europe. Bonn is suspected of wanting to  push for expansion of the European Union toward East Europe.    In his original remarks, Scheer reportedly also expressed  the  view that not so much France but other, smaller countries of the  European Union distrusted the German attitude in Europe, and  that D-Day was just one issue.    Both German and French diplomatic sources said the present  row would be dealt with further at ministerial level later  Thursday. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Financial restructuring for Principal Hotels PRINCIPAL Hotels Group is in discussions with its bankers and main shareholders concerning a financial restructuring of the group. This follows its withdrawal from all financial services activities, which gave rise to extraordinary losses of Pounds 7m in the year to June 30, with a further Pounds 4m deficit anticipated in respect of the 16 months to October 31 1991. Meanwhile, payment of interest on the 11 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock 1994 - 1998 has been postponed. Directors said that the group's principal bankers remained supportive and bank facilities continued to be available. In the last few months the company had been able to increase operating profits of the hotels, compared, on a like-for-like, with the same period a year earlier. Details of the proposed restructuring will be announced, together with the results for the 16 months to end-October 1991, in due course. The group's business now comprises solely the ownership and management of 19 hotels in the UK and five in continental Europe.</p>

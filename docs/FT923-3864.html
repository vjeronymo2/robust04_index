			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Initiative over late payments THE Department of Trade and Industry is to give Pounds 30,000 each to the Federation of Master Builders, the Mechanical and Metal Trades Association and the Walsall Chamber of Commerce and Industry as part of an initiative to tackle the difficulty of late payment of debts. The money will be used to provide counselling and training in credit management and debt recovery and to promote codes of practice. The government's aim is to fund pilot projects that can be used as models of good practice which may be adopted by other trade associations and which can become self-financing.</p>

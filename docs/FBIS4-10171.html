			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the runoff in the Salvadoran  presidential election scheduled for 24 April 1994.    On 5 April, the leftist coalition presidential slate  confirmed its participation in the runoff presidential election  scheduled for 24 April. Presidential candidate Dr. Ruben Zamora  said the Salvadoran left hopes the irregularities registered on  20 March will be overcome so as to guarantee the cleanliness of  the process. The commitment made by Supreme Electoral Tribunal  (TSE) magistrates to correct the anomalies is key to democracy,  and the cleanliness of the Salvadoran electoral process depends  on it, Dr. Zamora remarked. Zamora concluded by saying a draft  bill will be presented before the Assembly requesting a series  of temporary reforms to the Electoral Code. (San Salvador Radio  Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800 GMT 5 Apr 94)    Dr. Francisco Lima, leftist coalition vice presidential  candidate, has strongly denied reports some coalition parties  exerted pressure so that the left would not participate in the  runoff elections. Lima stated: "What has characterized the  coalition's political campaign is its sincerity." In a news  conference, presidential candidate Zamora confirmed the TSE  commitment to correct irregularities registered in the previous  elections. He added: "The TSE has pledged to double the number  of polling stations in the largest cities and place ballot boxes  apart so as to avoid overcrowding."

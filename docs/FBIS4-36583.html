			<p>BFN     [Text] During its session today under Speaker Shaykh  'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of Representatives  listened to a report by Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah on the political and diplomatic position on the  current developments in our country. The foreign minister  explained that many sisterly and friendly states, including the  UN Security Council permanent member states, support Yemeni  unity and democracy. He indicated that many of these states  stress that they cannot deal with a secessionist government,  that they are not ready to deal with anything outside the  framework of Yemeni unity, and that what is going on in the  Yemeni arena is an internal affair that concerns the Yemeni  people.    Addressing deputies, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah added: We have in hand very strong cards, represented  by the fact that Yemeni unity has crowned the Yemeni people's  longstanding struggle and was achieved peacefully and  democratically. Afterward, the Republic of Yemen's Constitution  was put to popular vote, winning full popular support throughout  the Republic of Yemen. Afterward, general elections were held.  Those elections, which are the source of constitutional  legitimacy, have shown which party enjoys more popular support.    The foreign minister asked the people's deputies to help  Yemeni diplomacy in all that serves Yemeni interests and  supports unity.    The deputies expressed extreme appreciation for the Foreign  Ministry's ability to deal with political issues and anything  that will support Yemeni unity.    Meanwhile, the House stressed that the secessionist  elements'  move of forming a secessionist government is null and void,  deeming it a flagrant insistence by the secessionist clique on  violating UN Security Council Resolution 924 and a glaring  breach of the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution, which  demanded a peaceful settlement within the framework of the  Republic of Yemen.    Earlier, the House listened to and approved the minutes of  its previous session. The House will continue its work on  Sunday to discuss a number of issues and topics on the agenda,  including some financial and supply issues, and other issues  that will be raised for discussion. The parliamentary committee  following up the developments experienced by our country will  complete within three days the tasks that the House has  entrusted to it. It will submit a report to the House during  the next session, which will be held Sunday morning, God willing.</p>

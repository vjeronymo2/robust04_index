			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Dutch Henry and Biter Creek Fan Complex (north  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  reaching almost to Bale Lane);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) Unnamed Fan west of Bell Canyon Reservoir and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Crystal Springs Road;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) Base of Pratt Valley (very small fan);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (5) Base of Deer Park (unnamed tributary; small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  fan);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (6) Base of Spring Valley (very small fan; mostly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  within Spring Valley); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (7) Conn Creek Fan Complex (in approved Rutherford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  viticultural area).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Napa River Floodplain and River Terraces <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Current incised channel of the Napa River;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Current floodplain of the Napa River; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) Older floodplains of the Napa River at higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  elevations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> [These landforms follow the channel of the Napa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  River, except for older terraces along the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  hillsides, which are largely obscured by dense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  hillside woodland and forest; these terraces are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  discovered through intensive field studies.] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dr. Elliott-Fisk notes that the geomorphic depositional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units (i.e., landforms) in the proposed St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viticultural area are composed almost exclusively of volcanic lithologies (around 85&hyph;90 percent volcanics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically, occasionally dropping to 70 percent on parts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sulphur Creek fan, with the remainder sedimentary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metamorphic inclusions from the bedrock underlying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sonoma Volcanics). The upper part of the Sulphur Creek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Basin contains small units of sandstone and metamorphic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lithologies exposed at the surface through faulting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slope failure. Despite this, volcanic rhyolitic tuff,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rhyolite, dacite and andesite are by far the dominant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surficial geologies, compared to the Bear Canyon Fan Complex  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the south which is 30 percent or less volcanics and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remainder sedimentary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Dr. Elliott-Fisk further observes that although several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of volcanic rocks compose the St. Helena hillside, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most widespread (and as such, ubiquitous) units are volcanic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ash-flows, referred to as tuffs, with occasional volcanic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mudflows. The matrix is rhyolitic in composition, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated clasts of obsidian, rhyolite, andesite, dacite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and tuff. Occasional metamorphic clasts of cobble or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller size are seen. This geologic parent material is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slightly acidic to acidic, with water-holding capacity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tuffaceous bedrock units moderate. This potential soil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parent material is brought down both slopes to the west and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> east of the valley floor by hillside erosion, runoff, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tributary streamflow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  According to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, the Napa River has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incised through these fan deposits discharging on the valley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor and migrated as a consequence of the resistance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these deposits versus its own stream power. The Napa River  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floodplain, and its associated recent terraces, varies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> width throughout this section of Napa Valley but has formed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important terraces along the eastern valley edge. Distinct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breaks in the natural vegetation are seen at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terrace/alluvial fan transition, as the terraces have more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fertile soils with a greater water-holding capacity. As the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> width of the valley floor in the St. Helena area is on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average less (e.g., more narrow) than anywhere else in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Napa Valley, these terraces form less viticultural acreage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than in the southern or middle sections of Napa Valley.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The lower hillside slopes below the 400-foot elevation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are difficult to map on a broad scale depicting geomorphic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces. This is largely a function of abrupt changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slope angle and vegetation type, which influence long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slope stability. Small areas of uplifted depositional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces (alluvial fans and stream floodplain terraces) were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found across these lower slopes in the proposed St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Soils of the Proposed St. Helena Viticultural Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the soils within the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viticultural area, Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that the Sonoma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volcanics rim all sides of the valley in the St. Helena area, and as such the depositional valley floor soils (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be very bouldery deposits across alluvial fans or finer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but still gravelly deposits along the Napa River proper, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principally Xerolls) are volcanic in origin, and deep, very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gravelly sandy loams to sandy clay loams to clay loams, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low to moderate water holding capacities. Sediments have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been transported relatively short distances from their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> origins, as this is the headwater area of the Napa River  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, and as such the soils contain a higher percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coarse clasts (especially boulders), with sand dominating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fine fraction of almost every soil. Dr. Elliott-Fisk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notes that small sections of the upper stream basins of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sulphur Canyon and the Spring Mountain region contain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> massive Franciscan marine sandstone and conglomerate, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its affiliated volcanic and metamorphic inclusions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lithology of the fine clasts that compose the alluvial fans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this immediate region (i.e., Sulphur Creek fan) include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher portion of non-volcanic clasts (up to 15 percent, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occasionally 30 percent) than alluvial fans to the north,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as the Ritchie Creek fan below Diamond Mountain,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located largely north of the proposed northern St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viticultural area boundary. However, the percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-volcanic clasts is much higher to the south of the St.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Helena viticultural area (i.e., Bear Canyon fan). The lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toe-slopes of the mountain slopes in the St. Helena area (below the 400-foot elevation) contain both Xerolls and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Xeralfs, depending on slope stability and age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that she has excavated an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional 17 soil trenches in the process of her scientific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation in this area. She states that she has done  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous soils work in this region and has excavated over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 350 soil trenches in Napa Valley. She has provided, as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the petition, profile drawings, descriptive field, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical laboratory data for 17 soils by horizon. Four of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these soils are from property outside of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries of the St. Helena viticultural area and were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chosen to be representative of those areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Soil Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The soils of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to the petition, are deep alluvial soils of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate age, with well-formed horizonation, textural B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> horizons, sandy clay loam to clay loam textures, reddish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colors, high gravel content (primarily of cobbles), and near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutral pH. In this erosional zone of the valley floor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the width is restricted, groundwater and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groundwater table have a significant influence, bringing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional dissolved minerals and increasing the pH (and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional content) above the valley floor soils to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> north (Calistoga region) and south (Rutherford and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oakville), as well as the hillsides (Spring Mountain, Diamond Mountain, Howell Mountain and Pritchard Hill). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soil drainage in the St. Helena area is typically good since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the water table drops in the spring, summer and fall to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the vines an adequate root zone with free oxygen and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon dioxide, thus providing vigorous conditions for grape  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growing. The moderate climate, with warm summer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature, balances well with this soil environment, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows the wine grower to manipulate the vines to extract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what the winemaker desires from a particular varietal. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such, Dr. Elliott-Fisk concludes that this provides a stable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and predictable environment for grape growing, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical geography of the region has promoted the production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fine wines in the St. Helena area for many decades.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the petitioner, the proposed St. Helena  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> viticultural area is uniform topographically and can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguished from the steeper hillsides to the east (Howell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountain) and west (Spring Mountain District) as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the valley floor areas to the south (Rutherford) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> north (Calistoga). This is an area where the valley floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrows from around 19,000 feet at Oakville Cross Road and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11,000 feet at Zinfandel Lane to around 3,500 feet at Lodi  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lane and Bale Lane. The area is marked by a uniform, steep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gradient and significant river erosion. The bedrock geology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is primarily volcanic, in contrast to the sedimentary soils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the south.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

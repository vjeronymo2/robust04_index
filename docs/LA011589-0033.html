			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART NEWS: PRISONERS SPEAK IN 'ANOTHER COUNTRY'  </P> <P> What does art by inmates jailed for everything from drunk driving to rape and  murder look like? Paintings of angry, tattooed men, bloody fist fights, cramped  cells and windows with black bars generally come to mind.  </P> <P> But generalizations and stereotypes can prove false. Case in point: "Light From  Another Country: Art From California Prisons," opening Monday at Claremont  Graduate School.  </P> <P> The grim vision of an inmate dumping garbage, a hated task performed by all, is  one of the show's few works that bespeak the dark side of prison life. Instead,  brightly colored, vibrant scenes of subject matter far removed from  incarceration dominate the multimedia exhibit with works by 30 inmates and 15  professional artists who teach art in prisons throughout the state for the  California Department of Corrections.  </P> <P> "People frequently think that there's going to be a lot of tension and violence  in the (inmates') work," said William Cleveland, who runs the  Art-In-Corrections program. "But in fact, when people are deprived of nature  and relationships, their imagination is a marvelous tool, and often their art  reflects what they don't have or what they wish they had."  </P> <P> Relationships, family and freedom, "or a yearning for freedom," are recurring  themes in the inmates' work, Cleveland said. For instance, there's a  photo-realistic painting by Alain Corbisier depicting three generations of a  family happily clustered around a sunny picnic table. A surreal self-portrait  by Steven King Ainsworth shows him standing beside a keyhole leading to the  outside world.  </P> <P> The professional artists' works are included to prove that the prison program  is a two-way street, Cleveland said.  </P> <P> "Rather than just passing on information, the teachers end up collaborating  with their students and you can see that in the work. You can see the teacher's  influence on students and see the influence of the students and the prison  environment on the teacher."  </P> <P> The quality of the inmates' work varies, said Jeanne La Barbera, gallery  director at Cal State Polytechnic, which hosted the exhibit in November. Some  looks professional, she said, and some does not.  </P> <P> "But that's not what the show is about. It's about the opportunity for  individuals we don't normally encounter to communicate with us. Some of the  less polished pieces are among the most touching because they are done by  people who don't have much formal training, but have something to say, whether  it be about loneliness for their family or anything else."  </P> <P> Studies done by the Art-In-Corrections program show declining recidivism rates  for inmates involved in the 10-year-old project, said Cleveland, a musician and  writer.  </P> <P> "The bottom line here is that people who have only found their identity and  self-worth in predatory and destructive behavior are given the opportunity to  transfer their anger, their intensity and their negative energy into a  creative, constructive activity that is well thought of and accepted by  society," he said. "For a lot of them, it's their first legitimate success in  life."  </P> <P> "Light From Another Country," through Feb. 3, is presented in the Galleries of  the Claremont Graduate School Graduate Art Program, 251 E. 10th St., Claremont.  </P> <P> GRANTS GALORE: Thirteen Southern California museums and arts institutions have  won $721,100 in grants for special exhibitions from the National Endowment for  the Arts.  </P> <P> The local recipients, among 118 institutions nationwide awarded a total of $6  million, are:  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Museum of Art, $320,000; Museum of Contemporary Art,  $140,000; La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, $118,300; Los Angeles  Contemporary Exhibitions, $28,500; Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum,  $19,900; Newport Harbor Art Museum, $17,400; University Art Gallery, Cal State  Long Beach, $17,000; Fellows of Contemporary Art, $12,500; Cal State Fullerton  Art Gallery, $12,000; California Museum of Photography, UC Riverside, $10,000;  University Art Museum, UC Santa Barbara, $10,000; Santa Barbara Museum of Art,  $5,000.  </P></p>

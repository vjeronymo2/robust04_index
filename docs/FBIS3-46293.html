Xiao  Yaotang, director of the provincial united front work  department, made a report at the meeting, and Provincial Party  Secretary Xie Fei made an important speech.    Xie Fei stressed that united front work must be strengthened  instead of being weakened. He referred to several problems  which should be resolved in the current united front work. The  first task is to expand the work field and to unite, educate,  and guide individual, private, and nonstate-owned economic  sectors; the second is to conduct meticulous and profound work  in uniting nonparty intellectuals; the third is to scale a new  height in overseas united front work; and the fourth is to  uphold and improve the CPC-led multiparty cooperative and  political consultative system. In his speech, Xie Fei also  pointed out the need to do a good job in strengthening the  united front work contingent.</p>

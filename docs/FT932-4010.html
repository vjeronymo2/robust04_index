			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Football tax-abuse inquiries span decade THE INLAND Revenue has been systematically investigating tax abuses by British football clubs and players for more than 10 years. During the same period a number of clubs have been punished for breaching football's rules on player payments. Mr Reg Burr, the chairman of Millwall, said yesterday that 'professional footballers as a body seem to think that they do not have to pay tax'. Inspectors from the Revenue's special office in Edinburgh started examining expense payments made to semi-professional clubs in the north of England at the beginning of the 1980s. Several investigations have since been conducted into professional and semi-professional leagues throughout the country. During the mid 1980s a second Revenue special office in Leeds started examining suspected tax evasion in connection with transfer fees for professional players moving between clubs. They examined records stretching back as far as 1981. That led to an agreement between football's governing bodies and the Revenue in 1988 setting down guidelines on future ex gratia payments to players. The Revenue's compliance and collection division also became involved in an investigation into Swindon Town football club in 1990, which led to the imprisonment of the chairman for six months. Tax inspectors based in Solihull, West Midlands, are co-ordinating investigations into transfer payments and other activities in professional football. A separate team in Leeds examines the semi-professional game. A number of semi-professional clubs had - often undisclosed - contracts with players but were not using the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system and so were able to provide footballers with additional payments as travelling expenses. Those on contracts should have been paid through PAYE. Professional clubs have been avoiding the tax that players should pay for signing-on fees by channelling the money to the club where a player has previously been employed, from where it is passed on as a termination payment, on which no tax is due. Mr Burr pointed out that many players had agents. He did not regard this as bad in itself, but there was a lack of regulation of these agents, he said. He knew of some managers' contracts which stipulated that the manager received a percentage of any sales they made. 'At least when it's written into a contract, that's official,' he said. Terry Neil, the former Arsenal player who is now a radio commentator and sports consultant, said that the football authorities had a duty to investigate the allegations of corruption within the game fully. 'It is crucial that they do so for the sake of the game. It is very sad to see the game now being dragged down in this manner,' he said. The Football Association is also investigating the transfers of three Australians to English clubs, Mark Bosnich, the Aston Villa goalkeeper, and Shaun Murphy and Bob Catlin of Notts County. Both clubs are alleged to have made payments to the players' agent, which break the rules of Fifa, football's international governing body.</p>

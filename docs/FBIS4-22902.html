To this end, mRNA-E', mRNA-N3S,  mRNA-2BNS3, and mRNA-NS34A4B' which encode the tick-borne  encephalitis virus (VKE) proteins were used while genetically  engineered analogues of tick-borne encephalitis virus proteins  were obtained from the Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at the  Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences in  Novosibirsk. The experimental procedure is outlined. To select  RNA segments most accessible to oligonucleotide binding and to  compare the oligonucleotide efficiency, the matrix structure was  assessed using the computational methods described by Solovyev  and Kel. The study reveals that an oligonucleotide complementary  to such a protein segment at a 2.5 M concentration  suppresses  biosynthesis of the full-scale protein almost completely and  leads to generation of a shorter product. The in  vitro study demonstrates that the most effective inhibition  is probably due to the fact that the 40S ribosome subunit cannot  destroy stable duplexes in the 5'-nontranslated mRNA area, as a  result of which the translation initiation is disrupted. The  findings open up the possibility of developing derivatives for  suppressing the tick-borne encephalitis virus reproduction in  mammal cells. The authors are grateful to K.V. Pugachev and V.V.  Solovyev for providing plasmids and helping with secondary RNA  structure analyses. Figures 8; tables 1; references 15: 4  Russian, 11 Western.</p>

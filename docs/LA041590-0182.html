			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS ARE FRUSTRATED, THWARTED IN THEIR EFFORTS AT HOUSECLEANING  </P> <P> According to the Los Angeles Times (March 25), "in a rare punitive action" the  Medical Board of California revoked the license of a longtime Orange County  practitioner.  </P> <P> The operative word here is rare.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most scurrilous lie promulgated against doctors is that they refuse  to police themselves. Trial lawyers love to complain about how difficult it is  to get a doctor to testify against another doctor.  </P> <P> As a member of the Board of Directors of the Orange County Medical Assn. for  over a decade, I can tell you that there are many misfits, incompetents or  outright charlatans whom we have been trying for years to cleanse from our  organization -- only to be frustrated and often totally thwarted by the legal  delays and maneuvers that pass as "due process."  </P> <P> Organized medicine is no more willing to see a responsible member of its  community pilloried than the media were willing to be quiet when Andy Rooney  was suspended from his TV job.  </P> <P> But given the proper policing tools and protection from guerrilla attacks by  the legal profession, the OCMA would tomorrow expel a dozen members whom it is  ashamed to call colleagues.  </P> <P> ARTHUR D. SILK, MD  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

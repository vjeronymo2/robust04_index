			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Peaks on the Footsie in post-Christmas trading - Market Report New peaks were scaled in the London stock market yesterday as traders returned from the Christmas break to find that their pre-holiday optimism had been outpaced by stock markets in the Far Eastern and other global investment centres. The FT-SE 100 Share Index jumped a further 49.7 points to a new closing high of 3,462; the Index ended well below the intra-day peak of 3,474.2, however, when Wall Street opened slowly and US investors left London alone. Confidence in economic recovery in the UK was encouraged by reports of a late surge in business at shops and travel agents in the UK, and the stock market continued to look for a cut in base rates in the New Year. However, some analysts now suggest that a base rate cut may be held back until the spring when domestic consumers will feel the bite of the Budget tax increases. Once again, share prices were pushed ahead by renewed buying of the March contract on the Footsie which broke through 3,500 at one time. The merciless squeeze on marketmaker's positions also continued and traders commented that, while the day's Seaq total of 479.3m shares was modest, it would have been much larger had stock been more readily available. Interest was seen from European sources, with buyers from Germany picking up such retail leaders as Kingfisher and Marks &amp; Spencer. But the UK institutions were clearly operating at no more than half speed, with many fund management desks only half-staffed. It was the absence of US interest, however, that took the wind out of the London market towards the close. UK analysts fear that upward pressures on interest rates may re-appear on Wall Street in the near future. Optimism on domestic interest rates brought hopes in some quarters that the Bundesbank may set a lead at its next council meeting. Investors in London brushed off two potentially disturbing factors, in the form of growing concern over prospects for a refinancing of Euro Disney, and the dismissal, by the Spanish central bank, of the board of Banco Espanol de Credito. News of developments at Eurotunnel came after trading closed in London. The strongest gains came among the bank shares which have been leading the London market throughout the latest bull phase on the expectation that higher dividends will be prompted by the improvement to balance sheets following falling interest rates. However, the sector was featured by HSBC which was responding to strength in the Far East. Store and retail shares, which have moved uncertainly as the stock market waited for news on the Christmas selling season, rose sharply on widespread reports of heavy business as the winter sales got under way. Private investor interest across the market pushed the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by 33.8 to a new peak of 3,807. Stock Exchange data disclosed that the half session on Christmas Eve brought a total of 249.9m shares, which were worth Pounds 560.6m in retail worth. Christmas week brought retail business worth Pounds 7bn in UK equities, a high level for a pre-holiday period. It also continued the run of profitable trading in equities for UK securities houses which has featured the past eighteen months, and has been reflected in high bonus payments for successful market traders and analysts.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds defends core activities' performance MR SIPKO Huismans, Courtaulds' ebullient chief executive, yesterday strongly defended the performance of his main divisions. 'I'm in very good heart about our core businesses which are in fine fettle. But we are a chemical company and it's tough out there. We defied the recession for a couple of years, but if we could walk on water we'd be called something different,' he said. The coatings division reported operating profits down from Pounds 28m to Pounds 27m on sales of Pounds 390m (Pounds 354m). The fall in profits included a Pounds 7m charge for restructuring. Mr Huismans said the division had 18 manufacturing plants in North America and Europe, and he expected those to be reduced by a third. He stressed the UK remained the group's favourite location for manufacturing in Europe. 'Germany provides an outmoded socialist environment. That country has a long way to go to reach the efficiency levels of the UK,' he said. Performance materials registered trading profits up from Pounds 7m to Pounds 13m on sales of Pounds 120m (Pounds 94m). Sales and profits benefited strongly from the light armoured vehicle contract which is now being completed. The difficulties in the civil aviation and defence industries held back demand for aerospace sealants and coatings. Packaging operations generated operating profits up from Pounds 7m to Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds 80m (Pounds 67m). Sales of tubes grew at 20 per cent, while profits from rigid packaging improved on unchanged turnover. The chemicals division reported trading profits down from Pounds 19m to Pounds 14m on lower sales of Pounds 108m (Pounds 99m). Profits in acetate filter fell from mid-summer as a buying freeze in China upset the international balance of supply and demand. The fibres and films businesses generated trading profits down from Pounds 31m to Pounds 28m, on turnover up from Pounds 306m to Pounds 321m. The credit squeeze in China also hit the European acrylic fibre market and in the US, the viscose market was affected by Far East imports. The company announced a reorganisation of its business areas from five divisions to three. The new divisions are coatings and sealants, fibres and chemicals, and polymer products. Under the new organisation, coatings and sealants reported operating profits of Pounds 32m (Pounds 33m) on turnover of Pounds 443m (Pounds 401m); polymer products posted trading profits of Pounds 18m (Pounds 10m) on sales of Pounds 184m (Pounds 147m); and fibres and chemicals registered operating profits of Pounds 41m (Pounds 49m) on turnover of Pounds 367m (Pounds 365m).</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sell direct Sir, Your article on the coffee bean surplus ('Fight over a hill o' beans', October 1) highlighted a serious problem for coffee exporting countries. The article on the consumers' switch to private label brands ('A rose by any other name', October 6) may offer a partial solution. Part of the growers' complaint is that, in spite of a surplus of coffee beans, the price to the end consumer does not reflect the true cost of the raw material. Growers should take advantage of consumers dropping their brand loyalties and start processing their own products and selling direct to supermarkets in consuming countries.

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Waigel tries to calm fears over D-Mark GERMANY'S finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, yesterday sought to reassure the German people that 'there will be no automatic doing away with the D-Mark.' The German government takes the worries of ordinary German people about monetary union and the eventual abolition of the D-Mark very seriously, he told the mass circulation Bild am Sonntag yesterday. There would be a full debate in both houses of parliament before the government took a final decision on European monetary union and the future of the currency would be decided only with the support of parliament, Mr Waigel said. 'Even if one day a common currency comes to Europe, the familiar imprint of the D-Mark will definitely remain on one of side of the new notes and coins,' he told the newspaper whose sister publication, the daily Bild Zeitung, lamented the passing of what it called 'our lovely money' after the signing of the Maastrict treaty on monetary and political union last autumn. The minister's remarks reflect the sensitivity of Bonn political circles to widespread disenchantment with the move towards a single currency, but fall short of giving the people a referendum. A poll conducted by Der Spiegel news magazine in the wake of the Danish vote against the Maastrict treaty showed almost three quarters of Germans in the western part of the country in favour of their own referendum on the issue, and a majority against political union with a common currency. In the same interview, Mr Waigel said there would be no new solidarity surcharge tax to pay for the costs of reunification. However car drivers would have to pay a toll by 1994 to help Bonn fund the reform of its railways system and to keep its roads from becoming overburdened. 'To finance the restructuring of the railways we will introduce a levy on autobahn use in the form of a vignette. That is the price that needs to be paid to prevent a collapse of the road system,' Mr Waigel said. A vignette is a sticker to be attached to the windscreen which would cost the same for all car drivers. Mr Waigel did not say what price the vignette would be. The recent fall in the German inflation rate - from 4.3 per cent in June to 3.3 per cent in July - was no grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates, Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and member of its policy-making directorate, told the Welt am Sonntag yesterday. It was essential to bring money supply growth down to the 3.5-5.5 per cent growth target set by the Bundesbank , he said, and even a 3.3 per cent inflation rate was not a level with which the central bank could feel happy. The middle-term objective was to return to inflation 'with a 2 before the comma', he said. The Bundesbank's anti-inflation policy could not be held responsible for the 3m unemployed in Germany, nor was it likely to impede an upswing in eastern Germany.</p>

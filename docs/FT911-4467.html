			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Leading Article: A missed opportunity THERE should be no satis-faction that the Japanese-Soviet summit ended in its mostly predictable stalemate. That the full normalisation of relations should still be hung up on a niggling 45-year-old territorial dispute is a sad commentary on the lack of political will and strength displayed by the two governments. To describe the summit, the first between the two countries in Tokyo since the war, as a complete failure is perhaps a little extreme. There was more intense negotiation about the Kurile islands than ever before. Presumably any remaining mutual illusions about respective positions have been swept away. The Soviet Union did say it was willing to start withdrawing some troops from them. And at least Moscow has acknowledged publicly that the territorial dispute exists, which the Japanese claimed had not been the case since 1956, and then only partially. But there was no settlement, hence no peace treaty, and hence no flood of Japanese aid and technical assistance to the distressed Soviet economy. For this last reason alone, the Soviet Union is the larger immediate loser, since it never approached the summit with what might have been a conventional Cold War aim of prising Japan loose from its US alliance. The fact that President Mikhail Gorbachev will not be going home with his pockets stuffed with yen will not make his domestic political burdens any lighter, though signing away the Kuriles might not have helped either. Collective failure The failure to go all the way should not be ascribed to the two men alone. Neither Mr Gorbachev nor Mr Toshiki Kaifu, the prime minister of Japan, is a master in his own house. The Soviet leader is hemmed in by Mr Boris Yeltsin, in whose Russian federation the disputed islands are situated, and by a Soviet military as yet unpersuaded by the virtues of arms control and strategic redeployments in Asia. Mr Kaifu's problem stems not only from his own political weakness inside the ruling Liberal Democratic party. He leads the government of a country disinclined to become more friendly towards, or even to invest more heavily in, the Soviet Union. Japanese companies, for the most part, have made it clear that they consider the Soviet economy to be a black hole down which it would be imprudent to pour investment. Their voices count with their government. Uncertain policy In fact it is perfectly possible to argue that Japan does not know exactly what it does want in terms of foreign policy these days, other than to adhere closely to the alliance with the US. This explains the dusty reception given to Mr Gorbachev's most creative proposal, the convening of an Asian security conference comprising Japan, the Soviet Union, the US, China and India. This was construed by the Japanese as an attempt principally to undermine the US military presence in the region and hence Japanese national security. There are elements in the Japanese Foreign Ministry and elsewhere who correctly believe the time is near to explore regional security issues in a way which does not necessarily involve the re-emergence of an independent and offensive Japanese military capability. However, their case is weakened by the patent political uncertainty surrounding the future direction of the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent China. Nevertheless, in the longer run, Asian security cannot remain on the back burner. The conventional view is that the Soviet Union would need to settle European and superpower arms relations first before turning to Asia, but that assumes a largely military definition of the term 'security'. As an economic power, Japan should know better than most that security should not be so narrowly defined. Indeed, the US probably would like Japan to assume greater policy and regional burdens that play to its economic strengths without sacrificing its military relationship with the US. The Tokyo summit provided an opportunity to start this ball rolling and it is to be regretted that it was not grasped.</p>

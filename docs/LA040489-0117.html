			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  MAN ARMED AT BUSH RALLY SENTENCED  </P> <P> A paralegal worker who plotted a "symbolic assassination" of President Bush  just before the November election was sentenced Monday to time served for  bringing a starter pistol to a Bush rally in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> John Arthur Junot was sentenced to four months in prison, but he faces  immediate release because he has already served five months. He was also  ordered to pay a $250 fine and $1,000 to cover the cost of his three-year  supervision after his release.  </P> <P> "You are a very bright individual, but between the left ear and the right ear  something's gone astray," U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said during the  sentencing.  </P> <P> Junot, 40, told a psychologist he wanted to fire the nonlethal pistol near Bush  in Warner Park on Nov. 6 to "remind Americans of Bush's mortality and the  consequences of (Vice President Dan) Quayle's inadequacies."  </P></p>

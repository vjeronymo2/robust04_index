			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--One of Turkey's top seven banks is said to  be facing a serious financial crisis and may collapse soon,  banking sources have claimed.    The bank, owned by a leading industrial group, has been  suffering from a shortage of foreign currency funds and failed  to meet foreign currency obligations to hundreds of customers  recently.    It cannot repay foreign exchange accounts to depositors, who  wish to close such accounts or withdraw a major portion of their  savings, sources said.    One senior banker said a group of leading banks were warned  by the "authorities" that this bank was in serious crisis and  that the group should act accordingly.    "Like a few others, we received an official letter of  warning  noting that...bank had for some time failed to meet foreign  exchange obligations to its customers because of a shortage of  foreign funds," explained the same source, who asked not to be  named.    He mentioned reports that most of the foreign exchange  depositors have been given repayment dates in the future.    "This might be a temporary liquidity problem. Yet the letter  signals that things might actually be much worse," he said.  Meanwhile, the Treasury declared that it had no fault in "not  warning" the relevant parties on time before the collapse of  three banks; TYT [Foreign Trade] Bank, Marbank and Impexbank.    It said in a written statement that the officials had  carried  out the necessary (financial) supervision and ruled out any  delays and negligence with cases of three collapsed banks. The  Treasury had come under fire for not warning (at least) the  government banks about the worsening financial structures of the  three banks and thus causing substantial public losses--at  around $80 million.    In a related development, Yalim Erez, chairman of the  Turkish  Union of Chambers and Bourses (TOBB) said on Friday [29 April]  that the banks should either "do decent banking" or become  extinct.</p>

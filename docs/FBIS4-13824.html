			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Husayn-Christopher Meeting and the Sought </F> Success"]    [Text] There are positive signs in the American position  indicating that the scheduled meeting between His Majesty King  Husayn and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher will be a success.    The recent statements by President Clinton and Christopher  on  the cordial relations between Jordan and Washington and the  siege of al-'Aqabah show that the U.S. Administration  understands, or almost understands, the great damage inflicted  by the embargo on Jordan's economy and trade.    Furthermore, there is remarkable U.S. interest in activating  the peace process and ending the crises on all tracks.    We hope the U.S. secretary will bring something new  regarding  the U.S. stand vis-a-vis the siege imposed on Jordan. The  lifting of the siege would rejuvenate Jordanian enthusiasm on  role its in the peace process, particularly if Israel agrees to  discuss all unresolved issues, such as water, borders, refugees,  and Jerusalem.    The important thing is to see the U.S. Administration end  its  bias toward Israel and work to force Israel to hold negotiations  based on withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory in  accordance with Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425  and the land for peace formula.    The success of the Husayn-Christopher meeting in London  today  will be an important indicator of U.S. interest in activating  the peace process and rendering it a success on all tracks.  During his meeting with the U.S. secretary today, King Husayn  will speak in the name of all cordon states and will reiterate  the principles of the Arab position with regard to the  Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese tracks on the basis of the  resolutions of international legitimacy.    We hope Secretary Christopher will respond to this position.</p>

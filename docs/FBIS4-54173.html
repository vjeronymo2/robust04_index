			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The South Korean Puppets Dashing on </F> the Road of War Adventure"]    [Text] The South Korean ring of the war fanatic Kim  Yong-sam is stepping up its pitch of dashing on the road of war  adventure against the fellow countrymen. This is evidenced,  among other things, by its frenzied maneuver for arms buildup.    As has been reported, the puppets, under the pretext of  further solidifying the security posture, have decided to  introduce additional late-model weapons, such as Patriot  missiles and Apache helicopters. It is no secret that the  puppets, during the warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's  junket to South Korea last month, decided to bring in  anti-artillery radar, a global positioning system [chisang  mokpyomul wisong chujok changchi], and ultra- modern gun-barrel  equipment, as well as Apache helicopters, from the United States.    On 12 May, the puppets deployed for active service new type  medium-size transport planes purchased from Spain. The South  Korean puppet clique raves that these transport planes, whose  deployment for the puppet air force will be completed by the end  of this year, will enhance their so-called operational  capability. The bellicose puppet elements' arms buildup  maneuvers--by which they deployed the new type CN-235  medium-size transport planes, in addition to Apache offensive  helicopters and Patriot missiles, which are weapons of mass  destruction, in South Korea under the instigation of the U.S.  imperialists--well expose the true colors of the U.S.  imperialists and the puppets leading the situation to a brink of  war.    The fact that the South Korean puppets are following the  road  of war adventure is also evidenced by their continuous war  exercise commotions of various types aimed at northward  invasion. As has been reported, the South Korean puppets  conducted fire games aimed at attacking us from 9 to 14 May,  such as the combat readiness exercise; a chemical, biological,  radiological exercise; a troop and equipment movement exercise;  and a combat plane emergency take-off and landing exercise. On  9 May alone, the puppets brought a large- scale naval exercise  group into the West Sea of Korea and conducted provocative war  exercises, such as a marine mobile exercise, anti- air and  anti-shore exercises, and a ship dispersion exercise, raving  about the so-called completion of the posture for coping with  the initial stage of war.    At the same time, the South Korean warmongers conducted a  joint airborne dropping exercise and a joint open-air exercise  with the U.S. forces on the East Sea of Korea.    Facts show that the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam  traitorous clique had an eye on attacking us by  three-dimensional operations from air, land, and sea through  these war exercises.    As has been made public, the Kim Yong-sam ring is raving  that  it will conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise this  November and enforce other war exercises as scheduled without  reducing their scale. The Kim Yong-sam ring's reckless  maneuvers for arms buildup and preparations for war of northward  invasion are an intolerable act of treachery aimed at driving  the fellow countrymen into the calamity of nuclear war as a  perpetrator of a war of foreign forces.    It is the invariable policy of the United States to build up  armed forces of aggression on the Korean peninsula and threaten  and crush [apsal] us by force. The United States, raving about  our nuclear development and countermeasures for our surprise  attack, are frenziedly engaged in war commotions, massively  bringing new type Patriot missiles and other military equipment,  including latest- model Apache offensive helicopters, into South  Korea. This is prompted by its desire to obliterate our  country's socialism by force.    The South Korean puppets, with the United States, have  already worked out the so-called New Operational Plan 5027, a  plan to provoke a war of northward invasion. The U.S.  warmongers--who have assembled vast aggression armed forces in  and near South Korea aimed at imposing nuclear calamity on our  nation and deployed Patriot missiles and offensive helicopters  to South Korea--are making powder-reeking such an outburst that  they will not hesitate to wage a war or preclude the possibility  of a preemptive strike.    According to the U.S. paper THE WASHINGTON POST of 12 May,  Perry and other U.S. military leaders, babbling about sanctions  against us recently, said that a war could turn out a reality.  This is a very serious remark. Needless to say, the South  Korean puppets' arms buildup and fire-game commotions are  perpetrated by this policy of aggression and war of the United  States. The South Korean puppet clique, which is sustaining its  filthy life depending on foreign forces, is attempting,  foolishly, to obliterate our Republic by force and realize its  ambition for reunifying the country by northward invasion taking  advantage of the U.S. imperialists' reckless military action.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is attempting to intensify the arms  buildup and war fire game under the pretext of building up a  security posture and lead the situation on the Korean peninsula  to a dangerous phase of war so as to leave South Korea under the  U.S. domination permanently and to sustain its power as a cat's  paw for its master's war.    Our fellow countrymen, who treasure national dignity and  love  peace, can never forgive the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique which  attaches greater importance to its personal comfort and foreign  forces' interests than to national interest and destiny and  which does not hesitate to impose the calamity of a nuclear war  on the nation. If the South Korean puppets think they can  realize their ambition for reunification by northward invasion  through the reckless arms buildup and war fire-game, they are  having an illusion. The Kim Yong-sam ring should stamp on its  mind that the treacherous act of confronting the fellow  countrymen leads to its shameful destruction.</p>

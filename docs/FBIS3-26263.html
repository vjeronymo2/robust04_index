During discussions with leaders of prefectural and city party  committees on the evening of 28 January, Liu Rongli, secretary  of the provincial commission for political science and law,  stressed: We should firmly carry out the instructions of the  party Central Committee and the provincial party committee on  legal work, make comprehensive arrangements in light of local  conditions, bring focal points into prominence, and be strict in  work to ensure political stability and social tranquility  throughout the province and to promote the smooth carrying out  of reform, opening up, and economic construction.    Liu Rongli continued: A task of primary importance at  present is to preserve social stability in a down-to-earth  manner, to put into effect all policies and measures, and to  strike severe blows at serious criminal offenses. [passage  omitted] Leaders should pay close attention to wherever public  security is chaotic, including highways and railways, should  concentrate their efforts on rectifying social order in these  places, and should not stop this rectification until social  order changes for the better.    Liu Rongli stressed the need to strengthen party leadership  over judicial work and to speed up improvement of the judicial  contingent. The key to fulfilling the heavy tasks in judicial  work is to build a good judicial contingent, to improve the  political and professional quality of judicial cadres, and to  raise their law enforcement ability.

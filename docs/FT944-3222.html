			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Leading Edge leaves Kleeneze at Pounds 0.13m Kleeneze Holdings, the home shopping and mail order company, yesterday blamed bad debt provisions and losses by The Leading Edge, its former retail chain, for a big fall in profits. The group saw pre-tax profits slide from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 128,000 in the year to August 31, despite increased turnover of Pounds 74.1m, compared with Pounds 56.6m last time. Its performance was undermined by operating losses of Pounds 1.02m at The Leading Edge, which was sold in August for Pounds 850,000, incurring a further Pounds 433,000 loss on disposal. An exceptional Pounds 800,000 provision for bad debts also hampered profits on its continuing operations, which fell slightly from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 1.99m. Mr Robin Klein, chairman, said the provision was a one-off charge to cover bad debts run up by direct selling agents who, he admitted, had not been monitored rigorously enough. The company has since vetted its sales force, withdrawn accounts from 400 agents, and yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Nigel Swabey, who has run the Kleeneze direct selling division since 1988. Mr Klein said it was essential to restore 'adequate controls' in the division, where profits fell from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 412,000. Earnings per share fell 6.08p to 0.89p. But despite the problems, the company is recommending an increased dividend of 1.5p (1p). The move, according to Mr Klein, reflected the group's confidence in its core Innovations catalogue business, which lifted profits from Pounds 582,000 to Pounds 1.59m.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts: Firebrand or fashion victim? - Can Peter Jonas, controversial ex-director of the ENO, win over conservative Munich audiences This is probably the most important week of Peter Jonas's career. The former general director of English National Opera arrived in Munich last September with a mandate to modernise a notoriously conservative institution, the Bavarian State Opera. The Munich opera festival, opening on Wednesday, is his first major test. It will show how far he has won over the Munich public to his controversial views on music-theatre. Jonas's appointment as the State Opera's first non-German intendant aroused high expectations. In London, he had played a key role developing ENO's reputation for bold theatrical ideas and enterprising repertoire. He talked about 'making opera open to everybody', 'extending the frontiers of taste' and 'going along the paths of adventure that are important to us'. That was what attracted Munich's city fathers. What they apparently overlooked was the price ENO paid for Jonas's radicalism. The fashionable production values and brash marketing campaigns of the late 1980s alienated many of ENO's core supporters, without winning the imaginary new audience to replace them. Jonas and his colleagues seemed to prize a first-night scandal above a solid artistic success. There was an air of conceit. By the time Jonas left London last summer, ENO audiences had fallen to 56 per cent, the deficit had risen to Pounds 2.3m, and the company had a sharply diminished stock of revivable productions. Not all of this could be blamed on the recession. On his arrival in Munich, Jonas made clear he would pursue 'interpretative rather than representational theatre' - productions designed to provoke rather than comfort. He would aim to reach a wider audience than the State Opera's traditional public. He would build on four pillars - Mozart, Wagner, Verdi and newly-commissioned works. As in London, the radical nature of Jonas's agenda was camouflaged by his legendary charm and eloquence. He talked about policy in a way Germans could understand. Unlike his predecessor, Wolfgang Sawallisch, he was image-conscious and knew how to court the press. The first evidence of a new direction came in March with Richard Jones's Jurassic Park treatment of Handel's Giulio Cesare. The premiere was accompanied by the kind of booing and cheering that had been de rigueur at ENO. German critics found the production cheekily entertaining, and it developed a cult-following among Munich's younger, more progressive theatre-goers. Jonas is hoping Wednesday's new production of Tannhauser will cause an even bigger splash. Wagner is a house god, and Jonas has chosen one of his most provocative ENO collaborators, David Alden, to stage it. Next season brings a transfer of David Pountney's ENO version of The Adventures of Mr Broucek, a Nicholas Hytner staging of Don Giovanni, and Parsifal directed by Peter Konwitschny, a graduate of the didactic Ruth Berghaus school of east German opera production. The question now being asked in Munich is whether this programme amounts to 'aesthetic renewal' as Jonas claims - or merely a grafting of the 'powerhouse' aesthetic from ENO. Jonas, who controls a budget of DM124m (Pounds 50m), has never hidden his contempt for the wealthy Munich burghers who bankroll his organisation. 'I have never in the whole world seen so much fake jewellery and dyed hair,' he said earlier this season. 'Many women look like gilded Christmas trees'. He talks of 'the possessiveness these people feel about their opera - they regard themselves as owners of the works being performed and shareholders of the company. But we're too dependent on them to slap them across the face.' He believes his 11 years with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and nine years with the ENO have prepared him well for his role at Munich. 'One's got a great deal of experience of how these things work. In London it was pretty difficult, because we were much more dependent on speculative customers, coming through the door on the day. In Munich it's more like Covent Garden. The subscription audience provides a huge backbone - about 11,000 people, some of whom have several subscriptions.' It is, he says, all a question of balance: 'You have to be able to create an artistic policy that will convert some of this traditional audience and draw some new people. Ultimately, you have to rely on instinct - the feel you have on the tiller of the direction you're going.' This sensitivity, however, is the very quality Jonas's critics find missing. 'He doesn't seem to have a feeling for what is appropriate for Munich,' says Marianne Reissinger of the Abendzeitung, citing Jonas's disinterest in the Strauss tradition and his approach to Verdi. In the past, Verdi's operas have been successful in Munich only when tackled from the highest musical level: Simon Boccanegra with Abbado, La traviata with Kleiber, Macbeth and Aida with Muti, La forza del destino with Sinopoli. Jonas handed Un ballo in maschera to the German conductor Peter Schneider, and the performance was about as un-Italianate as you can get. Whether Jonas was wise to choose Schneider as the company's music director is open to debate. Schneider is likable and hard-working, but lacks a strong artistic personality. One member of the orchestra expresses the widely-held view that Jonas 'doesn't have much interest in the musical side. He doesn't talk about opera in terms of music or making people happy.' On that last point, Jonas is inclined to agree. He says comic opera 'is never going to be very visible with me around, because I've always been more interested in the Sturm und Drang kind of thing. I just have a certain taste. One is chosen for one's competence, I suppose, but also for one's taste. That may be my undoing or it may be my glory. Whatever the outcome, I'm not going to change.' One area of his London experience Jonas is unlikely to repeat in Munich is his begging-bowl speech-making from the stage. 'It's extremely liberating here, in that the basic argument about the necessity of the arts was won a long time ago. Having a State Opera in this town is an accepted fact. We meet the politicians, of course, but it's not oppressive. The civil servants are helpful. What is difficult is the bureaucracy. There are rules and regulations, who you can hire and what you can pay for. It can be quite enervating. But I'd prefer that kind of circuitous difficulty, and have the essential matters accepted.' A fastidious 47-year-old, Jonas says life in Munich involves less struggle than London. His home is a short walk from the theatre. He takes part in his ballet company's work-outs. The son of a German-Jewish father and a half-Scots, half-Lebanese mother, he occasionally delights the locals by wearing the kilt he bought for his last night at ENO. He has joined the MCC - Munich Cricket Club. And he uses a cricketing metaphor to describe himself as 'a leg-glancing professional - giving the appearance of treating difficult things rather lightly, a concept that's foreign to the Germans. I hope I can make this job work. But if they believe it has to go in a different direction, or back to what it was, that's fine - they can just get rid of me.'</p>

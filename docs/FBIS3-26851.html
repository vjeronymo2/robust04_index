Article 5. The taxable amounts of special agricultural  products shall be calculated in accordance with real income from  special agricultural products and with specified tax rates. The  renminbi shall be used to calculate real income from special  agricultural products.    Real income from special agricultural products shall be  calculated by local taxation organs in accordance with actual  production amounts of special agricultural products and prices  specified by the state or set at the market.

Taxpayers shall apply for reduction or exemption of their  special agricultural product taxes. Finance organs at the  county (city) level shall review such applications and submit  them to higher finance organs for approval.    Article 7.

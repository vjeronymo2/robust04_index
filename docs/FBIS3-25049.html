According  to the poll conducted by Makinor in November, the ANC can expect  to get the votes of 74 percent of those willing and able to  vote, the National Party [NP] 15 percent and the AVF [Afrikaner  Volksfront, Afrikaner Nation Front]/CP [Conservative Party] nine  percent.    Should the voting trend indicated in the poll survive the  campaign, the ANC can expect to get 24 of the 34 seats in the  North- West parliament. The NP would get five seats, the CP/AVF  three. Undecided voters will determine the allocation of the  remaining two seats.    Members of the North-West parliament will elect 10 senators  to represent the province in Parliament. Based on the poll, the  ANC will have seven senators and the NP and AVF/CP one each.  The allocation of the final seat will be decided by the manner  in which undecided voters cast their ballots.    The North-West will also elect 17 people to represent the  province in the National Assembly. The poll shows the ANC can  expect to get 12 of these seats, the NP three and the AVF/CP  one. Undecided voters will decide the allocation of the final  seat.</p>

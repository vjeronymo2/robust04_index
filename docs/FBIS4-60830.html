			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 29 April TASS -- "Obvious violation of the  principle of equal responsibility in respect of the participants  in Bosnian and Serb-Croatian conflicts leads to their  exacerbation and hampers the beginning of serious peace talks."    Such was the conclusion made by an official delegation of  Russian lawmakers from the State Duma (Russian parliament's  lower house) on the results of their visit to the union Republic  of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The delegation prepared a communique on preliminary results  of the visit, which was highlighted at a news conference on  Friday [29 April].    The lawmakers visited former Yugoslavia on 21-27 April with  a  view to working out proposals on settling the crisis. The  delegation brought together representatives of all the State  Duma factions. They visited Belgrade, Pale, Sarajevo (including  its Moslem part), Vukovar, and Zagreb.    According to the communique, Russia "should make concerted  efforts through the UN framework to cancel gradually sanctions  against the union Republic of Yugoslavia, which are a serious  manifestation of world community's unbalanced approach to the  conflicting parties."    The lawmakers expressed particular concern about "actual  information warfare against Serbs unleashed by the mass media."    Most of the members of the delegation believe that the  Russian Foreign Ministry made mistakes in recognizing the  unitary state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in supporting unilateral  sanctions adopted by UN against the union Republic of Yugoslavia.    According to Deputy Konstantin Zatulin, who represented the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the delegates derived an  impression from talking with UN representatives that the latter  "are under tremendous pressure from NATO officers, who itch to  resort to force in former Yugoslavia."    The delegates will present their conclusions at a plenary  session of the State Duma scheduled for 11 May.</p>

Twenty-one economic research institutes surveyed put at  average minus 56 the business confidence index for major  manufacturers in the BOJ report, with predictions ranging from  minus 51 to minus 60. The index stood at minus 56 in the  previous BOJ report, published in December.    The quarterly report, based on a survey taken in February,  will be issued at 2 PM Tuesday.    In the KYODO poll, nine of the surveyed institutes projected  an improvement in the figure, while eight expected a decline.    Some of the forecasters who are relatively optimistic  reasoned that the economy, already crawling at bottom, could not  deteriorate further.    Others cited signs of recovery in durable goods sales,  firmer  showing of stock prices, and the yen's downslide in early  February when the BOJ survey is thought to have been taken.    But even optimists are cautious because the signals of  recovery that appeared in recent economic statistics may be  affected by corporate efforts to make financial results better  than they are before the book closing at the end of March.    An official with Okasan Economic Research Institute said,  "maybe, the brightness is only for the January-March period. We  want to wait for April figures before making any diagnosis on  the economy."    Pessimists, meanwhile, attributed their forecasts to  continuously depressed sales and political instability.    The research section of the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ),  regarded as one of the country's most reliable forecasting  institutions, said, "the economy remains in poor shape with  effects from higher share prices and a weaker yen limited."    The KYODO survey also found that 18 surveyed institutes  predicted the confidence index for major nonmanufacturers at  average minus 47, unchanged from the figure in the previous  report.    Their forecasts ranged from minus 42 to minus 50, with eight  seeing better results and six worse.</p>

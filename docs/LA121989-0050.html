			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSTETRICIAN CONVICTED OF MURDERING 8 BABIES, FETUS  </P> <P> Dr. Milos Klvana, a Valencia obstetrician, was convicted Monday of  second-degree murder in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus he cared for,  in a case the prosecutor said raises questions about the ability of California  medical authorities to monitor the competence of doctors.  </P> <P> Klvana, 49, faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. Each  murder count carries a sentence of 15 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> The nine deaths with which Klvana was charged occurred between 1982 and 1986.  Eight infants died during childbirth or within a few days of their delivery.  The ninth case involved a fetus that died in its mother's womb.  </P> <P> During Klvana's nine-month trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, the prosecution  contended that he lacked the medical skill and the facilities at his clinics in  Valencia and Temple City to perform out-of-hospital births and to deal with  common but high-risk prenatal or childbirth complications.  </P> <P> The jury deliberated 15 days before returning the verdicts last week. They were  announced Monday.  </P> <P> After Klvana was found guilty, prosecutor Brian R. Kelberg said outside the  courtroom that the case shows that the public should not place an unwavering  faith in a doctor simply because he has a valid medical license.  </P> <P> "The best thing that can come out of this trial is an awareness by the public  that merely because a doctor has a license to practice, or may have hospital  privileges, or may have a great bedside manner, and merely because there is a  medical board that is supposed to monitor the competence of doctors, that in no  way assures that a doctor is in fact competent," said Kelberg, head of the  medico-legal section of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.  </P> <P> "Patients should be willing to ask questions and not be intimidated because  they may not have been to medical school," Kelberg said.  </P> <P> In the Klvana case, the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance investigated  four of the deaths but did not revoke Klvana's license as a result of the  probes. The reason, Kelberg said, was Klvana's ability to manipulate Board of  Medical Quality Assurance investigators. The prosecutor has said these  investigators "deserve lambasting."  </P> <P> Ron Kraemer, the board's assistant chief of enforcement in Sacramento, said the  agency will have no comment "until we see what the prosecutor said."  </P> <P> The nine deaths all had two things in common: medical complications that  prosecution experts testified required hospital treatment and Klvana's failure  to recommend hospitalization.  </P> <P> Kelberg called the complications "bread-and-butter" matters, such as prolonged  labor, abnormal positioning of the baby, a diabetic mother and a baby that had  ingested its own fecal material. Six of the deaths were attributed by the  prosecution to Klvana's misuse of Pitocin, a labor-inducing drug that put  deadly pressure on babies' heads as they were forced through the birth canal.  </P> <P> "You cannot view any one of these cases in isolation," Kelberg said, "because  you see the same type of care or lack of care in case after case after case."  </P> <P> In addition to the nine murder counts, Klvana was convicted on 28 counts of  insurance fraud, five of practicing medicine without a license, two of grand  theft, two of perjury and one count of conspiracy. All of the charges are  felonies.  </P> <P> Richard A. Leonard, one of Klvana's two court-appointed attorneys, argued  during the trial that Klvana was at worst guilty of manslaughter, not murder.  </P> <P> After the verdicts were announced, Leonard said his client was "tough" to  defend because "there were nine dead babies and with nine all together I didn't  stand a chance."  </P> <P> Leonard added, "It looked terrible. There were no facts for the defense.  Everywhere we checked we came up dry. I didn't have one doctor to put up on the  stand."  </P> <P> Jury foreman Jaime Pulido, 30, of East Los Angeles said it became clear during  jury deliberations that there was "no defense" for Klvana, who was arrested in  October, 1986.  </P> <P> "We had experts from all over the county who were called in to testify against  him," Pulido said. The defense "had the same right to use those experts, but  they chose not to."  </P> <P> "We tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but to no avail. The evidence  against him was overwhelming," Pulido said.  </P> <P> Klvana was prosecuted on the same legal basis used to obtain second-degree  murder convictions against drunk drivers who cause fatal traffic crashes. Under  the concept known as "implied malice," a defendant can be convicted of murder  if the prosecution proves that he knew his actions could cause someone else's  death.  </P> <P> Klvana was born in Czechoslovakia and received his medical training there.  Following the Soviet Union's 1968 occupation of his native country, Klvana fled  to Canada and then the United States. He began practicing in Southern  California in 1975.  </P> <P> The Board of Medical Quality Assurance first investigated Klvana's involvement  in a baby's death after Amy Johnson died on Christmas Day, 1982. Klvana had  delivered the baby the day before. But in this and three other baby deaths  involving Klvana that the board investigated, the agency took no action against  his medical license.  </P> <P> The board was sharply criticized earlier this year by the state's watchdog  Little Hoover Commission and the University of San Diego's Center for Public  Interest Law. Alluding to the University of San Diego report, which recommended  that physician licensing fees be raised to beef up the board's investigative  staff, Kelberg said: "I am not confident that merely by adding money and  personnel the medical board can do the kind of investigation that may be  necessary to ensure that doctors like Dr. Klvana do not practice medicine.  </P> <P> "The first thing that is necessary is public awareness."  </P> <P> Kelberg also criticized hospitals that allowed Klvana to resign without  reporting his substandard care to the medical board, which then had to "operate  in the dark." Those hospitals included Northridge Hospital Medical Center,  Valley Vista Hospital in San Gabriel and Granada Hills Community Hospital, he  said.  </P> <P> Judge Judith C. Chirlin scheduled Klvana's sentencing for Jan. 12.  </P></p>

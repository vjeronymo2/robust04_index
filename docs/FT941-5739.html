			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: DSM slashes dividend after loss DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, tumbled into loss last year after suffering a narrowing of profit margins in virtually all its product ranges. The company is to cut its dividend from Fl 4.00 to Fl 1.50. Results for 1993 fell into a net loss of Fl 118m (Dollars 62m) from a net profit of Fl 224m in 1992, on turnover down nearly 10 per cent at Fl 8bn. Average selling prices for DSM's products were 7 per cent lower in 1993 than in 1992. The company blamed the downturn on economic difficulties in Europe, industry-wide overcapacity, and cheap imports from regions such as eastern Europe. The strength of the guilder since the turmoil on European currency markets in September 1992 also worked against DSM. Mr Simon de Bree, chairman, described the results as 'downright poor'. However, he said: 'It seems that we are past the lowest point now.' The company expected to post an operating and a net profit for the first quarter, he said, although he refrained from making any prediction for 1994 as a whole. DSM's shares rose 3.8 per cent, to Fl 111.70, helped by the company's decision not to omit the dividend altogether, as some analysts had expected. The company said it had decided to pay a dividend because of its success in reducing net debt, and its continued strong financial ratios. These were possible partly because of income generated by divestments.</p>

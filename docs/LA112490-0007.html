The camping reservation fee for adult groups  would increase from $20 to$25.  </P> <P> New recreational vehicle campsites with utility hookups will be available next  year.  </P> <P> They will have seasonal rates of $14 per space until May 1 and $16 from then  until Labor Day.  </P> <P> The water district received a $238,000 grant this year from the state Parks and  Recreation Department to develop the 52 hook-up sites, a picnic area and a  200-foot fishing dock at Coyote Creek. The grant was awarded through bids under  the 1988 California Wildlife, Coastal and Park Land Conservation Act. THIA BELL  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- The coalition parties  agreed today to present the "signpost" law to the next session  of the Slovak Parliament at the turn of July, chairman of the  Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky told  journalists after a session of the coalition parties today.    The law on bilingual names for towns and villages inhabited  by ethnic minorities will be discussed for the third time this  year. The bill, which pertains mostly to the 560,000-strong  ethnic Hungarians, has been twice rejected.    "The law will make it possible for the towns and villages  with at least 20 percent of ethnic population to have their  place names also in the ethnic language, while a list of the  eligible communities will be a part of the law," Carnogursky  reported.    The list will not include 13 cities bearing the names of  Slovak cultural personalities (during the previous voting, this  was the reason for some ethnic Hungarian deputies to vote  against the law). This time the Hungarian leaders did not insist  on them and promised to support the bill. The law will also bar  the names from the era of Magyarization and Horthyite occupation  (1938-1945), Carnogursky added.    According to the deputy chairman of the coalition Democratic  Left Party (SDL), Milan Ftacnik, the law assumes that change be  made on the strength of a local referendum for which a  80-percent turnout will be necessary. The present (Slovak)  place names will be still exclusively used in official contact,  while that in ethnic language will be applied only for traffic  signposts, he explained.</p>

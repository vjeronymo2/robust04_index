Before his departure to Germany, Zachert said that  Milczanowski was in favour of a closer cooperation with the BKA  and planned to meet the German interior minister in 1994.    One of the major issues to be dealt with jointly by the  police services of the two countries is smuggling and trade in  radioactive materials. According to the BKA head, 12 incidents  of ``nuclear crime'' were recorded in Germany in 1990, 160 in  1992 and over 200 during the first three months of 1993.    Poland and Germany have signed an agreement on cooperation  in  combating organized crime. Within this framework the German  government is to grant the Polish police in 1992-94 material aid  worth 6 million marks. Poland has already received cars,  motorbikes, drug detecting kits and cameras. It was agreed  during Zachert's visit that the assistance will also cover an  exchange of experts in fighting economic fraud.</p>

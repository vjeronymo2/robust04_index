			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / British Gas to restate results BRITISH GAS has agreed to restate the 1991 figures to be published in its next set of annual accounts following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog. The panel ruled that the company's decision to change its year-end from March 31 to December 31 last year, but then publish its results for the 12 months to December 31 contravened the 1985 Companies Act. Under section 223 (3) of the act, it should have shown the results only for the nine months from April 1 to December 31. British Gas has agreed to amend the comparable figures in its accounts for the current year, which will reduce 1991 pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.47bn to Pounds 496m. The panel has agreed to take no further action. It could have forced British Gas to reissue the last set of accounts, which would have proved costly since it has more than 2m shareholders. Mr Nicholas St John, group chief financial accountant at British Gas, said the company had publicised its decision and shown the nine-month figures in summary accounts and a note to the full accounts. He said use of 12-month figures had been approved by its auditors and the US Securities and Exchange Commission but no comparable process with the panel before publication was available in the UK. It wanted to show 12-month figures to reflect the fact that two-thirds of profits were generated in the first quarter of the year, reflecting the highly seasonal demand for gas. The panel said it accepted the directors' assurances that there was no intention to mislead and that the company acted in good faith. The decision potentially raises a precedent by which other companies might argue before the panel that they had contravened accounting regulations but were not attempting to mislead. However, Mr Sidney Treadgold, secretary to the panel, said yesterday: 'Each case is addressed on its merits and no precedents are being set. The panel felt it right to record the directors' intentions but our criterion must be conformity with the (companies') acts.' British Gas changed the year-end as many joint ventures and subsidiaries account for that period.</p>

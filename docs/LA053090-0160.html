			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL SUES FOR SINBAD ADKINS  </P> <P> Officials of the Great Lumberton Music Festival in Michigan are going to court  to make Sinbad Adkins, one of the stars of "A Different World," appear as  scheduled.  </P> <P> The festival's promoters say Sinbad signed up to appear at the June 30 show but  then backed out when singer Dionne Warwick asked him to be on her HBO cable  network special. The suit also names Warwick and Triad Artists, the agency that  represents both her and Sinbad. Country music legend Johnny Cash twice left the  Lumbertown festival without its headliner by backing out after being announced  as the top act, festival officials said.  </P></p>

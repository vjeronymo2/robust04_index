			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDYING FOR PEACE;  </P> <P> WORLD UNIVERSITY MARKS 15TH ANNIVERSARY AMID OJAI'S SPIRITUAL DIVERSITY  </P> <P> The psychology of miracles is taught every Tuesday night at a Main Street  storefront in Ventura.  </P> <P> For World Peace 101, students must trek up to the main campus in Ojai.  </P> <P> Both are offerings of World University, a degree-granting institute where  students learn academic subjects alongside the three Rs of New Age  spirituality.  </P> <P> "Peace is not a gift from heaven. It is a condition we have to generate by our  thoughts, by our desires, by our aspirations," said President Benito F. Reyes,  who founded World University in Ojai with his wife Dominga in 1974.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 15th Anniversary  </P> <P> The school, which will celebrate its 15th anniversary this weekend with a  two-day conference, aims to promote spiritual growth and harmonious relations  among individuals. If enough people participate, this process will eventually  lead to world peace, Reyes said.  </P> <P> What brought an urban academic from Manila to Ventura County?  </P> <P> Reyes said his spiritual leader in the Philippines chose Ojai because it was  destined to become "the new Athens of the New Age," referring to the Greek city  where philosophy and wisdom flourished more than 2,500 years ago.  </P> <P> And, clearly, Ojai is a magnet for spiritual groups of all stripes, from the  Theosophical Society to Kratona to Meditation Mount.  </P> <P> Reyes had never heard of Ojai, but being a dutiful apostle, he moved there in  1974 armed with "100% faith and zero funds," he recalled.  </P> <P> A goodly number of philanthropists have jumped on his Peace Train since then --  including early benefactors who raised $180,000 in 1976 to buy a jumble of  downtown buildings that once housed the City Hall, jail and courts.  </P> <P> As a result, one class meets in a courtroom, another in the jail. Reyes  occupies the former mayor's office.  </P> <P> Perhaps not for long though. When longtime Ojai resident Mima Porter died last  year, she willed the school her 10-acre, emerald-green estate just outside  downtown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expansion Under Way  </P> <P> Reyes plans to use the land for classrooms, a dormitory and possibly a museum.  Expansion is also under way in Ventura, where World University began offering  classes last month for those attracted to spiritual enlightenment but not a  drive to Ojai.  </P> <P> The university is also launching a Center of Compassion that will feed 100  needy people each month, and it is considering a New Age psychological  laboratory and an institute of advanced studies in consciousness.  </P> <P> In addition, Reyes plans a program geared to senior citizens -- whom he calls  "our noble citizens" -- and one in journalism ethics that would teach aspiring  reporters to write from a global, humanitarian viewpoint.  </P> <P> "Some of our students have gone down there and taken classes, and they've  enjoyed it," said Joan Halifax, a cultural anthropologist and president of the  Ojai Foundation, a non-traditional school in the Upper Ojai Valley. "Reyes is  well-educated and an excellent orator and teacher."  </P> <P> There is also some cross-pollination between World University and local  Matilija Junior High School. Assistant Principal Steve Olsen, who is mayor of  Ojai, said World University professors teach astronomy classes for gifted  students at the junior high.  </P> <P> The school also has exchange programs with other non-traditional institutes  worldwide, including Zoroastrian College in Bombay, India; the Assn. of  Religious Psychology in Tokyo, and Koh-E-Nor University in Santa Monica, which,  according to its newsletter, is "dedicated to instruction in the practical  application of the spiritual teachings of the mystical traveler."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buyout Offer  </P> <P> Then there was the Japanese corporation that recently visited World University  and asked Dominga Reyes if it could establish an affiliation with the school or  buy it outright.  </P> <P> "We have our spiritual work to do here. World University is not for sale,"  Dominga Reyes said.  </P> <P> The Reyes -- who are both 75 and live in Upper Ojai -- have a long history of  involvement in educational endeavors.  </P> <P> In 1967, Reyes was named founding president of the first free college in the  Philippines -- Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila -- which means the University  of the City of Manila in Tagalog, the main Filipino dialect.  </P> <P> He is also a two-time Fulbright scholar who has lectured throughout the United  States on spiritual and philosophical issues.  </P> <P> But Reyes refuses to rest on his metaphysical laurels. He tirelessly promotes  World University, still teaches there and has authored about two dozen books,  including "1,000 Sonnets for God" and "Education for World Peace," in which he  explains his role as educator.  </P> <P> "We are the mind-makers; we are the engineers of attitudes; we are the  architects of beliefs; we are the builders of men . . . and that indeed is a  serious task," he wrote.  </P> <P> So far, World University has handed out 65 bachelor of arts and master's  degrees in philosophy, psychology and religious studies. That is in addition to  35 students who have earned vocational certificates in fields that range from  astrology and meditation to spiritual ministry. Tuition is $40 per unit, and  100 students participate in small seminars that range from five students to  about 18, said Dominga Reyes, the dean of students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Accredited  </P> <P> World University is licensed by the state Department of Education to grant  degrees, but has not received accreditation from the Western Assn. of Schools  and Colleges, an independent accrediting agency.  </P> <P> One avid convert is 54-year-old Susan Wilson of Azusa, a registered nurse  studying for her bachelor's degree in psychology.  </P> <P> "I've been looking for years for a body of knowledge I'd be interested in  putting my time and money into, and this is it for me. It has the right blend  of spirituality and academics," said Wilson, who stays at the World University  dorms during the week and commutes to Azusa on weekends.  </P> <P> And unlike some of Ojai's more experimental institutes, World University is not  all crystals and channeling.  </P> <P> For every meditation class, there are such academic offerings as English  composition, quantum mechanics and basic psychology.  </P> <P> There is also the College of World Peace, which in 1987 began offering courses  on the psychology of peace, peace education, peace techniques, family peace,  peace ethics and meditation for peace.  </P> <P> Every Friday, the student body prays 15 minutes for world peace.  </P> <P> The Reyes predict that their university will last 1,000 years. And they read  fateful significance into the words of Theosophist Fritz Kuntz, who in a 1927  essay foretold a "world university" that would guide those who come to the Ojai  Valley seeking spiritual enlightenment.  </P> <P> And so it has come to pass.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Olsen will issue a proclamation honoring World University for  enriching the lives of the city's residents and visitors.  </P> <P> "We're a well-rounded community that accepts all sorts of educational,  philosophical and religious groups," Olsen said. "And they fit in well with the  Ojai spirit."  </P></p>

At a press conference Monday, Landsbergis said signs of a  "new Yalta" have appeared and are very threatening to central  Europe, especially Lithuania.    Discussing the problem of NATO membership, the opposition  leader said a decision to join the alliance is  "self-determination, and not only for countries in our region,  but for western countries, as well."    Landsbergis said Bulgaria and Macedonia have already  officially asked for NATO membership and are treated as "the  last states to have expressed a wish" to join the alliance. He  expressed hope that Lithuania will be "the last one" and the  Dec. 23 resolution of the Lithuanian parliament will be taken  into account.    Meanwhile, the Lithuanian administration simply awaits the  Jan. 10 NATO summit, the opposition leader said. He reminded  reporters that Lithuanian authorities still have several days  left to make their move.    Landsbergis said he is deeply concerned about a New Year's  speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who vowed to better  defend the interests of Russians living in the former Soviet  republics. The opposition leader pointed out Yeltsin's words  that Russia will have difficulty in preserving peace and that  Russia will defend its own interests, as well as the interests  of its citizens in other countries.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow boosted by good first quarter results Wall Street A STRING of mostly positive first quarter earnings announcements buoyed US stock markets yesterday, lifting the index of blue-chip industrials to record levels, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.23 at 3,306.13, below its highs for the day but still above the previous record close of 3,290.25 on March 3. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended sharply higher, up 6.31 at 412.39, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks jumped 6.66 to 594.81. Turnover was heavy at 232m shares. Although trading was busier than the previous day, the market was still hindered by the disruption of futures trading created by Monday's flood in Chicago, which put the Chicago Board of Trade, the country's main futures exchange, out of business and curtailed liquidity in all financial markets. The only economic news of the day was mixed. March retail sales fell 0.4 per cent, but the broader figure showed an 11.9 per cent in real retail sales during the first quarter. The figures, however, were overshadowed by the first full day of the quarterly reporting season and some solid corporate performances. IBM climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 88 3/8 after reporting first quarter income Dollars 1.04 a share, above market expectations and better than the 97 cents a share earned a year ago. IBM's figures boosted other big computer stocks, with Hewlett-Packard adding Dollars 3 at Dollars 80, Digital Equipment rising Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 46 7/8 , Compaq firming Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 1/4 and Motorola gaining Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 76. Securities houses were notably firmer early on following release of record first quarter results, but profit-taking and concern about future earnings wiped out all the gains, with Merrill Lynch ending down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 50 1/8 , PaineWebber finishing unchanged at Dollars 20 3/4 and west coast broker Charles Schwab closing up just Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 29 1/2 . A rare decline was posted by LA Gear, which lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 12 5/8 after the sports shoe maker unveiled a 42 cents a share first quarter loss and announced it had technically defaulted on a bank agreement. American Home Products jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 81 3/4 on news of a 15 per cent improvement in profits to Dollars 406.3m achieved on the back of strong performances from the group's domestic pharmaceutical and consumer health care businesses. Ford rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 41 after it released details of a 9.1 per cent increase in US-made car sales and a 14 per cent increase in truck sales during the first ten days of April. Canada IN TORONTO falling interest rates helped boost share prices in active trading. Based on preliminary data, the composite index rose 22.81 points, or 0.67 per cent, to 3,412.64. Advancing issues outpaced declines 311 to 267. Volume was a solid 28.2m shares against 19.5m on Monday, and trading value climbed to CDollars 318m from CDollars 178.4m. The financial services sector gained 1.65 per cent, as National Bank rose CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 9 1/4 , Scotiabank gained CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 21 1/4 , Bank of Montreal was up CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 45, and Royal Bank was up CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 24 1/8 .</p>

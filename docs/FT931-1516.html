			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UN airlift for wounded Moslems: UK and French helicopters to head for Srebrenica in key test for Serbs UNITED Nations officials intend to launch a helicopter shuttle service today to cross eastern Bosnia's battle lines and rescue wounded in the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. The operation is to be a test of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's promise in New York to open a corridor to provide an escape for tens of thousands of Moslems being pushed before advancing Bosnian Serbs. Major Pepe Gallegos of the UN protection force said the operation would be carried out by British and French helicopters. Earlier, General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in Bosnia, turned his wrath on to the Bosnian Moslems, after his heroic action to relieve the besieged Moslem population of Srebrenica last week. In a show of impartiality in keeping with his senior position in the UN's peace-keeping operations in Bosnia, Gen Morillon accused the Moslem authorities in the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla of bad faith in preventing the evacuation of Serbs. The general, who has been subject to some criticism from his military and political superiors for allegedly behaving as 'a loose cannon', had asked Mr Ejup Ganic, the Moslem Bosnian vice-president, to intervene in Tuzla, where local government officials had gone back on a promise to let some Serbs leave. 'I consider, at the present time, that their bad will is blocking the whole peace process,' the general told reporters in the Serbian border town of Mali Zvornik. 'I am only asking for the respect of the Geneva Convention.' The UN commander said he would probably be obliged to go to Tuzla, probably today, to sort things out. Bosnian Serb leaders in the area have insisted that some 240 of their compatriots should be allowed to leave Tuzla if aid convoys to Moslems cut off in other towns and villages are to be permitted to move. An aid convoy and a French field hospital attempting to reach Srebrenica remained blocked yesterday, while trucks heading for the Moslem town of Zepa were ordered to return by the UN, after having been held up by Serb militiamen for nearly a week. The local Serb military commanders were pursuing their obstructive tactics in spite of the announcement by Mr Karadzic that he had given his agreement in principle for an air corridor to be opened between Srebrenica and Tuzla. The aid airlift is to be provided by French and British helicopters, which would make as many as six flights a day. The Bosnian Serb news agency said the corridor would be open for five days, but that this could be extended. The difficulties on the ground in Bosnia occurred as the Bosnian Serb leaders ordered a 'general mobilisation' in reply to the planned vote by the UN security council to adopt a res-olution enforcing the no-fly ban over Bosnia, first imposed last November. Though international observers have been under the impression that most able-bodied Bosnian Serbs are already fighting in the civil war against the Moslems, the call-up order was intended to signal to the world that the Serbs would not take the ban lying down. Some diplomats feared that the UN resolution, while having little practical effect on the war, would further hamper the peace negotiations in New York, where there has not been a face-to-face meeting between the Bosnian Serb and Moslem leaders for weeks. Officials close to the talks said that the Moslem Bosnian president, Mr Alijah Izetbegovic, was closer to signing the map on the division of the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces than Mr Karadzic. But there was still a long way to go before either of them would be ready to conclude a peace settlement. Austria, already host to 60,000 refugees from Bosnia, will no longer accept asylum-seekers from the region, according to Mr Franz Loeschnak, the interior minister, Reuter reports from Vienna. He was speaking after a meeting in Klagenfurt, southern Austria, with Mr Ivo Bizjak, his Slovenian counterpart. 'I cannot perceive Austria accepting any more refugees in the near future,' Mr Loeschnak said. He added it was now up to other European countries to accept their full share of refugees from former Yugoslavia. 'One part of Europe acts as if the consequences of the war in the Balkans only affected the directly bordering states,' Mr Loeschnak said. He singled out Britain for criticism in the refugee question. He said that despite Austrian requests, London had granted entry to only 30 Bosnians out of 120 heading for Britain, who were stranded for days in freezing weather at the Austrian border because of Britain's refusal to grant visas. The refugees, including women and children, had been cared for by Austrians who took them into their homes until permanent accommodation was found for them. Of the 60,000 refugees taken in by Austria, 46,000 are in the care of state institutions. The remaining 14,000 are staying mainly with relatives or friends. Mr Bizjak too said his small country's capacity to take in more refugees was almost exhausted.</p>

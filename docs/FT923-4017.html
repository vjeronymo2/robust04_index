			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Observer: Out-prayed The mother of Brazil's President Fernando Collor resorted to prayer yesterday in an attempt to help her embattled son withstand the expected impeachment vote. The family matriarch Dona Leda held a mass in Rio Cathedral for his survival. Measured by numbers of supplicants to heaven, however, Collor's opponents seem to have the edge. Total attendence at the mass was under 2,000, despite a large advertising campaign. By contrast, over 50,000 pilgrims were at the church of Aparecido do Norte in Sao Paulo to hear the head of Brazil's Catholics call for the president's impeachment.</p>

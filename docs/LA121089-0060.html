			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERENT VIEWS ON 'MINORITY MOM'  </P> <P> Thanks for reminding your readers that though we're a minority, "stay-at-home  moms" do still exist. But rather than call us "rare" and "vanishing," please  substitute the words "endangered species." Vanishing means we're on our way  out, but endangered means we could use a little protection. The media can start  by resisting using the words "stay-at-home," "quaintly anachronistic," "an  anomaly" or "a fantasy" to describe a full-time homemaker mom of the '90s.  </P> <P> MARILYN PASSWATER  </P> <P> Founder, Mom's Club of Redlands  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

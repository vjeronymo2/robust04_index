			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Considering that the goal of the baseline is to most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately reflect actual 1990 gasoline composition, the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be modified to more correctly allocate parameter data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provision will be made for the use of actual RVP data to define  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summer and winter gasoline. When such Method 1, per batch actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data is not available, summer and winter months will be redefined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to better approximate the seasonal gasoline fuel parameter and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This modification to the reformulated gasoline regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will satisfy several comments received since publication in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . EPA will redefine summer and winter months,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for use when Method 1 actual batch data is not available, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows. A summer month will be redefined as any month during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which more than 50 percent (by volume) of the gasoline produced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a refiner met the federal summer gasoline volatility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Winter shall remain defined as any month which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could not be considered a summer month. This will correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations in which small quantities of summer volatility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline are produced early in the year. Originally, data from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month in which even small quantities of summer volatility fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was produced was considered a summer month. With this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification, such months in which the majority of fuel was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winter volatility would be correctly allocated as a winter data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, for any month for which both winter and summer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline were produced, if actual RVP (Method 1) data are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available, that data will be accurately divided between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summer and winter calculations, as appropriate. If such per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> batch data is not available, all data for that month would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered either summer or winter, based on the production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volumes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When actual per batch data is used, for minimum data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement purposes, a month is considered equivalent to 4 weeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of seasonal data. Therefore, 12 weeks of data sampling on summer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatility fuel satisfies the minimum three months of data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection required. If a refiner, such as the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiners, still cannot provide three months of winter data, they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may petition for less than minimum data, under the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlined in &sect;80.91(d)(1)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Baseline Determination Adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Work-In-Progress (WIP) Adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final reformulated gasoline rule provided criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing work-in-progress baseline adjustments (section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80.91(e)(5)). Work-in-progress (WIP) refers to one or more major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital changes or commitment(s) made by a refiner prior to or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990. A WIP adjustment allows a refiner to modify its baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume and fuel parameter values (which affect emissions) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for the WIP. In order to obtain a WIP modification, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refiner must petition EPA and EPA must approve the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the preamble to the final rule, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the criteria for a WIP adjustment should be fairly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent, as the adjustment was intended only for those for whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a significant investment had already been made in order to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with another government mandate. Additionally, a broad program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of adjustments could indicate that EPA exceeded its equitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama Power <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as discussed in the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Impact Analysis (RIA) accompanying the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule, EPA required that a refiner meet each of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three criteria in order to qualify for a WIP baseline adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fourth criterion was also required to minimize environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm due to WIP adjustments, via simple model parameter caps and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions caps for both the simple and complex models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since promulgation of the final rule, EPA has re-evaluated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this fourth criterion of the WIP provisions. EPA intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow WIP adjustments to relieve severe hardship where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment did not allow emissions to increase significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to the Clean Air Act baseline. The methods EPA chose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constrain WIP adjustments had inconsistent impacts depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple model or complex model use. The modification proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this Direct Final Rulemaking would ensure that the fuel parameter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constraints on WIP adjustments under the simple model would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more consistent with the emissions performance constraints under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the complex model. Specifically, WIP adjustments will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted to exceed the simple model parameter caps, but only to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent the baseline still complies with the complex model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission caps. Without this change, a WIP adjustment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more constrained in 1995 than would be the case in 1998, possibly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring a refiner to make processing changes in 1995 that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be necessary in 1998. While the emissions and parameter caps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were set to minimize environmental harm due to the WIP (realizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a WIP adjustment will actually increase baseline emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to 1990) EPA believes this modification will increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance flexibility while maintaining the environmental goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

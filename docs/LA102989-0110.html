			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO EVENS RECORD, BLANKS PATER NOSTER, 19-0  </P> <P> El Segundo, which lost its first four games this year, is playing a season from  the bottom up.  </P> <P> The Eagles defeated Pater Noster, 19-0, in Glendale on Saturday, their fourth  win in a row, to even their record at 4-4 overall and 4-1 in league play, good  for second place behind undefeated St. Monica (5-0).  </P> <P> And they've done it by accomplishing just enough on the field to survive.  </P> <P> With 2:40 remaining in Saturday's game, Pater Noster had a first and goal on  the El Segundo three-yard line and ran up the middle four straight times. El  Segundo did what was necessary, stopping the drive twice within the one.  </P> <P> That preserved the shutout and sustained El Segundo's hopes for a league title.  Pater Noster fell to 3-5 overall and 1-4 in league play.  </P> <P> "That really showed a lot by holding them when they really didn't have very far  to go for a touchdown," said El Segundo Coach Steve Newell.  </P> <P> And when El Segundo needed a score in a similar situation with 43 seconds  remaining in the first quarter, the offense produced.  </P> <P> Faced with a fourth-and-goal, sophomore running back Eran Taulua crashed in  from three yards out for a 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> That score stood until late in the third quarter, when senior quarterback Tom  Cover hooked up with receiver T.D. Mayer for a 23-yard touchdown. In the fourth  quarter, backup quarterback Brett Newell tossed a 25-yard TD pass to Eric  Stevenson.  </P> <P> El Segundo intercepted four Pater Noster passes and gave up just 135 yards in  total offense.  </P></p>

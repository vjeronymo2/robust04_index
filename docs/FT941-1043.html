			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Inspired by Picasso - Brian Sewell discusses Golding on modernism VISIONS OF THE MODERN by John Golding Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 28,368 pages What in art is modern now? It is unlikely that in the last decade of the Quattrocento, with the Italian Renaissance half done, educated Florentines still spoke in awe of Masaccio, Donatello and Fra Angelico as modern, yet in the last decade of this century, John Golding, distinguished art historian, curator of exhibitions and a painter of sorts, offers us as modern, Picasso, Matisse, Braque, more Picasso, Duchamp, Gorky, Malevitch, Brancusi and more Picasso still, all firmly rooted in the first decade. Readers hoping for a helping hand with Damien Hirst and Rachel Whiteread will find none offered here. Only with Frank Stella and himself does Golding venture into the present day  -but Stella he treats exclusively as a fellow lecturer and writer, and of Golding the painter of flaccid abstracts of footnote inconsequence, we must ask how it is that, revealing so sharp an eye and such honest judgment in his discussion of the old masters of this century, he can be so blind to the poverty of his own paintings, daubs that seem merely private therapy for a man far better employed in intellectual pursuits. For 40 years Golding has steeped himself in the study of Picasso. The obsession began with his doctoral thesis on Cubism, and its present incarnation is the exhibition at the Tate Gallery; its rich fruit is a scholarly and intuitive knowledge not only of all the artists involved with Picasso - Braque, Leger et al - or with whom he was in rivalry - Matisse - but of the critics and apologists who offered him support, of Tsara, Eluard and Apollinaire. The first essay in the book is indeed on Apollinaire, the wise, witty and misguided mountebank and showman of Parisian criticism until his death in 1918, whom Golding accuses of inventing 'the sort of pseudo-metaphysical jargon that is found all too frequently in writings about present day art.' Golding cannot himself be accused of jargon; he writes with utter clarity, and only a scholar of transparent honesty could observe of Cubist pictures after a lifetime's work that 'I have come increasingly to realise that I do not really understand them, and I am not sure that anyone else does either,' which tempts the sceptic to quote Sickert - 'Painting that requires literary explanation stands self-condemned. Here we have the condemnation of Matisse and Picasso, and even of most of Cezanne's canvases.' Golding may protest inadequacy, but his commentaries on the parallels between Braque and Picasso in their Cubist years, on the great 'Demoiselles d'Avignon', on the flowering of Gris and Leger, are passionate in their sympathy, and illuminate with such uncanny clarity that ordinary mortals may well feel that they at last understand, even if their mentor does not. By far the longest essay is devoted to Duchamp, keyed to his mysterious, unfinished and shattered work on glass, 'The Bride stripped bare by her Bachelors', damaged in transit in 1926. Amid dense argument, Golding admits to unanswerable questions and a labyrinth of ideas from which no thread leads; 'there is no solution, because there is no problem,' claimed Duchamp  -but there is a problem, and in failing to arrive at its solution, Golding surveys the whole work of the old mischief-maker, from Mr Mutt's upturned urinal to the almost posthumous tableau mort of the naked waxwork woman with her legs spread wide, seeing a cerebral kinship in the wild diversity of style. Golding writes at a still slower pace and with emotion cooled when he treats of Gorky, Malevitch and Brancusi, as though the material has been prepared for tutorials and has adapted uneasily into literary prose - even the death of Brancusi's beloved bitch brings scarcely a spark of life to that essay, and the plodding art historian swamps the connoisseur. Though they are not without merit, the inclusion of such lectures and reviews (if these are indeed what they are) blurs the focus of the book, and at the very end it is blurred still further by the vain inclusion of himself as painter, keeping company far too distinguished. Golding's eye is at its brightest and his pen most passionate when Picasso is his inspiration.</p>

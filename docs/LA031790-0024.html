			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAYING FOR STATE HIGHWAYS  </P> <P> Yes, there's a tax revolt. The reason is plain -- we are stressed out. Federal  taxes are climbing for the former middle class, which is now the lower middle  class.  </P> <P> All our hopes for climbing the ladder are fading fast in the wake of the  Reagan-Bush tax gifts to the rich, combined with the failure of the famous  Reagan trickle-down theory.  </P> <P> I would vote for the 9-cent gas tax if it would provide public transportation  and road maintenance, but I don't want to see any more freeways built. New  roads will service the new people, who are clearly not paying enough taxes to  build roads to service their needs, and will not answer the problem anyway -- a  new road quickly exceeds its capacity, and the only solution then is to build  more roads.  </P> <P> We need more health care, schools, police and jails, and more housing because  our population increases, directly or indirectly, lead to more illness,  children and crime, and a terrific housing shortage. All this is true because  demand far exceeds supply. The only possibility, then, is to cut the demand.  </P> <P> The common theme here is our skyrocketing population. We are not managing the  astonishing growth of this state, which is why Californians are crying loudly  for better urban planning.  </P> <P> We must do something about it before we all become New Yorkers.  </P> <P> CATHERINE A. STROHLEIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Lesson from the indexed decade Last week, Mr Robert Hetzel, vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, proposed that Congress should instruct the US Treasury to issue index-linked bonds. (We will come to his reasons later.) Since it is the 10th birthday of index-linked funding in the UK, give or take a few days, this is a good occasion to look back at the British experience. The initial aim was simply to save money. It was Mrs Thatcher's rage at the Bank of England's judgment that the market would require a return of nearly 16 per cent on 20-year conventional bonds, just when her strong assault on monetary inflation had started to show clear results, that triggered the decision. The bonds have indeed proved a spectacular economy for the Treasury. The initial success confirmed the theoretical case: that the right time for indexed funding is when official inflationary expectations are much more optimisitic than those of the market. In more recent years, the saving to taxpayers has shown how highly the market values the absence of risk. In offering a guarantee against nasty inflationary surprises, an inflation-fighting government is, as it were, putting its money where its mouth is. This, however, is just what the British authorities had failed to understand in years of missed opportunities. The Bank, in particular, argued that these would be 'banana republic' bonds (in spite of the fact that banana republics are the main exponents of inflating away conventional debt). More recent comments from the US Treasury and from the budget director, Mr Richard Darman, have been on the same lines. It was nonsense then, and it is still nonsense now. Some British Treasury officials, on the other hand, were held back by a secret nostalgia for the early 1970s, when they had been using banana republic tactics with great success. British bonds paid such hugely negative real returns that the national debt had by 1976 shrunk to its lowest level since the days of Gladstone, in comparison with national income. It was only after investors had rumbled this strategy that official minds moved. The economies are easiest to measure in terms of relative interest payments. Mr Robert Bootle of Midland Montagu, a leading student of indexation, has calculated what he calls the 'break-even' level of inflation - the rate which would compensate indexed holders for the income they could have had from conventional bonds - for every year since 1981. For non-taxpayers - the pensions funds that hold most of the bonds - actual inflation has been well below break-even level in most years until interest rates were raised sharply during 1988. sured as it is in other countries, without an interest rate component, gross investors have consistently lost 200-300 basis points throughout. Even for high-rate taxpayers, indexed bonds do not look a rewarding investment, except for insomniacs. It is clear, then, that the yield gap represents a risk premium. There is also, more surprisingly, a fairly consistent risk premium over income returns on equity. This is surprising because while the indexed bonds offer simply a guaranteed real return, equities should, on average, offer a rising real return, reflecting the real growth of the economy. In spite of this, equity dividends have pretty consistently exceeded the running return on indexed gilts - by more than 300 basis points in the early days, when an inflation guarantee seemed too good to be true, and by an average of about 75 basis points in recent years. This yield gap only reversed once. In 1987, a negative gap of nearly 2 per cent appeared - and we all know what happened then. The positive gap is now suggestively thin again. In short, the existence of a reasonable pool of indexed bonds (about Pounds 14bn at issue price at the moment) has provided an anchor rate of real return for the whole British financial market. This probably restrains upside volatility, making the task of monetary management a bit less difficult. It may also raise the cost of investment capital compared with other countries; but this depends on one's assessment of the other great advantage of indexed issues - as a marketing strategy. Most people prefer milk chocolate to plain; but there is an obstinate minority, including myself, which greatly prefers its chocolate dark and bitter. (Perhaps plain chocolate is for pessimists.) European chocolatiers have always catered for both markets; in the US, Hershey took a long time to come round. The issue of indexed bonds provides plain chocolate for investors, a security for those, such as regional Federal Reserve officials who worry a great deal about inflation. Once these pessimists are out of the conventional bonds market, remarkable things can happen. In the UK, holders of ordinary long bonds made a 50 per cent profit in the first six months after the indexed became generally available. From the taxpayer's point of view, this means that the government now pays a plain risk premium rather than a panic premium on its borrowing; so it may be that industrialists are also able to raise capital a bit more cheaply than they could if there were no indexed bonds in Britain, although they pay a bit more than most competitors in the developed countries. In one respect, though, indexed gilts have failed to live up to their supposed promise. It was thought that the gap between indexed and conventional yields would provide a temperature chart of the market's inflationary expectations. In the event, it seems that the market forecasts the way a picnicker does - by looking out of the window. The gap has tracked current inflation faithfully, but has no forecasting value at all. Unfortunately, this is precisely the merit which has attracted Mr Hetzel to the idea - he thinks it would give a valuable steer on monetary policy. No such luck, in London, anyway; but the other advantages are surely worth attention.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This is news that just came in. This is news that  just came in.    Approximately 500 college students in Seoul waged a  demonstration struggle protesting the plan for deployment of  Patriot missiles by burning a portrait of Perry.    According to a foreign news report, about 500 college  students today burned the portrait of U.S. Defense Secretary  Perry in protest of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to  South Korea and by shouting a slogan, "Yankee go home!"    The students denounced that Perry aggravated tension on the  Korean peninsula by ordering the deployment of U.S. Patriot  missiles to South Korea. They stated that North Korea denounced  the deployment of Patriot missiles as an act of war against  Pyongyang.    The students burned a portrait of Perry and models of  Patriot missiles in a park in downtown Seoul. As a result, black  smoke rose to the sky and the U.S. flag was tumbled all about on  the ground.    About 200 police assumed a guard posture to block the park  in an attempt to check the students' street demonstrations.    Some protesters, wearing masks, shouted the slogan, "We  oppose the deployment of Patriot missiles!"    Approximately 400 riot police with shields and clubs were  standing in front of the U.S. Embassy in the center of Seoul to  repress possible disturbances.    In the past students have burned the U.S. flag and staged  demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy opposing U.S.  policies.</p>

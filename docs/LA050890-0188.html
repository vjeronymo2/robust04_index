			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: HEPBURN STELLAR ATTRACTION AMONG '100 STARS'  </P> <P> FRANK SINATRA won't sign on board again for another stint with Bally when his  casino contract ends and the big question now is -- whither goest His Frankness  after that? (He can just about take his pick.)  </P> <P> RICHARD GERE was the big name missing from "The Night of 100 Stars" after  accepting, even though his name was taped right on the steps where the rest of  us took our bows in the finale. (Some of us were only "stars" for the moment,  courtesy of producer Alex Cohen.) 'Tis said that Gere wanted the opportunity to  make political comments in his speech. Cohen felt this was a night of fighting  AIDS for the Actors' Fund; it was not for politicking or ideology.  </P> <P> You can see this big blast on NBC come May 21, and I'm sure it will be shorter,  crisper, better than ever, and they'll identify everybody, which should add to  the fun. You'll be able to see Pia Zadora's tonsils when she sings and you can  perhaps answer the question that flew through Radio City Music Hall the night  of the taping: How much did hubby Meshulam Riklis donate to the Actor's Fund?  </P> <P> The great moment of the night was the magical appearance of Katharine Hepburn,  and they probably should have ended the show on that. But there are swell  moments after as well, so if you can endure rap singers and bad comics and  stuff designed to appeal to youthful viewers (who won't be watching anyway),  stick around for the last third of the show, which is the best part.  </P> <P> SHOOTING BEGINS Monday in Rome for a remake of "Three Coins in the Fountain,"  to be a CBS movie under the new title, "Coins in the Fountain." The producers  won permission from 20th Century-Fox to use the famous Jule Styne-Sammy Cahn  music.  </P> <P> The three stars are Loni Anderson; the petite but dynamic Stephanie Kramer,  soon to depart the TV series "Hunter" and "Major Dad's" on-air Mrs., Shana  Reed. This sequel takes place 20 years after the original, which starred  Dorothy Maguire, Jean Peters and Maggie McNamara. (There was another version in  between, titled "The Pleasure Seekers," starring Ann-Margret, Pamela Tiffin and  Carole Lynley.)  </P> <P> Producer Mike Filerman and director Tony Wharmby tried to cast Italian actors  whom they interviewed in Rome. Unable to find men who spoke English well enough  to be understood, they resorted to casting in London.  </P></p>

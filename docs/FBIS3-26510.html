The full text of the questions and answers are  as follows:    [Tseng Tak-sing] Secretary Wu Bangguo, Shanghai has  developed rapidly in the past few years and has attracted much  attention from China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the world as  a whole. Please tell us something about how Shanghai's leap  forward has been brought about. What is the significance of such  a leap in the reform and opening up of China?    [Wu Bangguo] There are two aspects in the background of  Shanghai's development. Shanghai was the center of China in the  thirties and was called the "Paris of the Orient." At that  time, Shanghai's economy was much more prosperous than that in  Hong Kong. Since liberation in 1949, Shanghai has made  relatively rapid development and relatively big contributions to  the country. Two most outstanding aspects of contribution are  given below. One is its monetary contribution to the state.  When Hu Yaobang was the General Secretary and visited Shanghai  in 1986, Jiang Zemin was the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal  CPC Committee. Hu Yaobang made a calculation together with  Jiang Zemin and found that Shanghai had handed over 440 billion  yuan to the state from liberation to 1986. The second major  contribution is that it provided the whole country with large  quantities of commodities. In those days, we practiced the  planned economy, and Shanghai's commodities accounted for 40  percent of the volume allocated according to the national plan.  Commodities made in Shanghai were found everywhere across the  country. Of course, Shanghai also made contributions in other  aspects.  <H5>  Two Aspects of the Background for Development </H5>   In addition, Shanghai is a large central city. Because of  historical reasons, Shanghai's functions as a central city have  decreased. This is mainly expressed in two aspects. One is that  Shanghai's industrial structure is not rational and the  outstanding issue is that its tertiary industry is relatively  weak. I came to work in the municipality in the beginning of  1983 and at that time, the tertiary industry accounted for about  20 percent of the economy of the municipality. The second  outstanding issue is that the urban infrastructure is very  backward. These issues have restricted Shanghai's economic  development and have restricted its role as a central city.    Another aspect of the background is that by the nineties we  have gained 10 years' experience in reform and opening up to the  outside world. In 1990 Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward that  Shanghai was a trump card of ours and should be regarded as our  shortcut. Comrade Deng Xiaoping explicitly put forward in 1991  that Shanghai should develop Pudong. He said that opening up  Pudong was required for Shanghai's own development, and was also  required for the development of the Chang Jiang valley. In  April 1991 Li Peng came to Shanghai and announced to the whole  world on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council that the central authorities had decided to carry out  reform in Pudong and to open it to the outside world. The 14th  CPC National Congress held in 1992 clearly put forward that the  meaning of "a dragon head, and three centers." This meant that  we regarded Shanghai as the dragon head of the Chang Jiang  valley and the Chang Jiang delta which gave impetus to the  development of the Chang Jiang valley and that we should  gradually build Shanghai into an international economic,  financial, and trade center.    The Chang Jiang valley includes seven provinces and one  municipality, and it spreads over 1.8 million square kilometers.  It has a population of 300 million people and the GNP of its  entire national economy amounts to 1 trillion yuan. It is a  relatively more developed region in China in terms of economy.  The development of the economy of this region means the growth  of China's economy. The success of reform in this region and the  establishment of the operational mechanism of its socialist  market economy means the success of China's reform. The opening  of this region to the outside world means the opening of all of  China to the outside world.  <H3>  The Establishment of a Collection and Distribution Center of  Five "Flows" </H3>   [Tseng] Shanghai is to be "the dragon head and three  centers" (economic, financial, and trade centers) of the Chang  Jiang valley and even of the world. This is a grand ideal. How  can this be concretely realized?    [Wu] What is the meaning of "one dragon head and three  centers?" This is a question being discussed. I think Mayor  Huang Ju's view in his speech is more accurate. He put forward  the five "flows," that is, to build Shanghai into the collecting  and distributing center of five "flows": The commodity flow,  the capital flow, the technology flow, the personnel flow, and  the information flow. In this way Shanghai's position as a  center can be established. To make it simpler, it means to turn  Shanghai into a collection and distribution center of  commodities and a collection and distribution center of  production essentials, and at the same time to build Shanghai  into a converging point between the Chang Jiang valley and delta  on the one hand and the world economy on the other.    In accordance with the needs of such development, we have  put  forward three points to be stressed in the development. First  is to make great efforts to develop urban infrastructure. Many  friends from Hong Kong find that Shanghai has changed, mainly in  urban infrastructure. Others find it inconvenient to live here  because of the poor urban infrastructure. Therefore, we have  spent a lot of money on the construction of infrastructure,  including two large bridges, the Yanggao road, power facilities,  wharves, and the airport.    The second point to be stressed in the development is to  make  great efforts to develop tertiary industry. Tertiary industry  has developed rapidly in Shanghai. In 1993 it accounted for 38  percent of the whole economy of the municipality. Our target is  to develop it to 45 percent by the end of this century. At  present, it appears that this can be accomplished earlier, and  by the end of this century it can reach 50 percent. The  outstanding focus of tertiary industry is the market for  production essentials, including the stock exchange, the futures  market, the metals exchange, and the foreign exchange market,  which is to open in January, and also including the technology  market and the personnel market.    The third point to be stressed in the development is to  develop high technology and new technology. Shanghai has the  foundation for this. Its industry can be upgraded and some  capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries can be  developed. This can give better play to Shanghai's strong  points. Technology and capable personnel are Shanghai's strong  points. We should use high technology and new technology to  transform our traditional industries.    What shall we do then? As a matter of fact, we have been  carrying out such an operation for several years. We have paid  more attention to four questions. The first is to push  enterprises toward the market. In the planned economy, economic  enterprises are a department of the government and the  government undertakes unlimited responsibility for enterprises.  This will not do and enterprises must move into the market.  Once enterprises are enlivened, the entire economy will become  enlivened. We have done a lot of work in this respect. The  most important thing is to "provide water for breeding fish."  In the past, the burden of enterprises was too heavy. The  state took care of everything for enterprises and enterprises  took care of everything for the society. This will not do and  the government must be separated from enterprises.    The second is to give enterprises the decisionmaking power,  such as the power to make decisions on wages, the use of  personnel, and planning. However, there should also be  restrictions. For example, on the wage issue, the growth in  wages of enterprises should be less than the growth in taxes  collected from enterprises, and the per capita growth in wages  should be less than the growth of labor productivity. We are  also considering linking value adding with value maintaining of  the assets of enterprises. Under such circumstances,  distribution within enterprises is enterprises' own business.  They can establish their wage system. At present we are making  further efforts in this respect. As for what was put forward at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in  the past we did more work on production operation and  management, and in the future we should gradually shift our work  to the management of assets. In this way it will be possible to  form an environment for market competition and the fittest will  survive. At present, large and medium-sized enterprises are  more flexible, but small enterprises are not good. A few large  and medium-sized enterprises are not good either, but on the  whole they are good. Why do small enterprises have so many  difficulties? There are historical reasons for this. In the  past, every bit of space was used and factories were set up in  the city where residents were in great number. Those factories  do not have the required conditions and the land prices of those  factories are high. The number of small enterprises is great,  but in terms of money, the volume of their losses are not big  because they are small enterprises after all. Losses of large  enterprises would be difficult to deal with. The 13th CPC  National Congress put forward that the reform of enterprises was  the starting point and foothold of our entire economic reform.  <H5>  The World's Third Biggest Metal Trading Market </H5>   The third question is to energetically nurture and develop  the market in combination with the development of tertiary  industry. A very big change in Shanghai in the past few years  has been the nurturing and development of the market of  Shanghai. In 1993 the volume of stock exchanges reached 500  billion yuan, the volume had increased at a speed of five to six  times a year, and the volume increased by six times last year,  which was much faster than we had expected. In addition, our  metals exchange has been set up for slightly more one year now.  Last year the volume of exchange reached more than 350 billion  yuan and the metals exchange became the world's third biggest.  Moreover, the volume of exchange was close to the world's  second biggest. The grain and edible oil exchange is operating  on a trial basis and its daily exchange volume has reached 400,  500, or 600 million yuan. In addition, there are also other  commodity markets. We have set up many shops, for example:  Taiwan's Pacific Department Store, which has recently opened at  Xujiahui, the Isetan Company at Huaihai Road, and the Shui Hing  Department Store. The annual volume of retail sales of  commodities in Shanghai last year was 35 percent over the  previous year.    The fourth question is to change government functions. What  should be administered by the government should be administered  by the government and what should not be administered by the  government should be managed by the society, for example: The  establishment of the social security system, insurance funds for  unemployment, and medical insurance. Of course, there is also  the question of changing concepts in medical insurance. Such  insurance is not unlimited, but is only basic insurance because  our country is still a developing country. In the past one  drawback of our planned economy was a high-degree of  concentration of power. In addition, its exclusiveness was very  strong. A very clear characteristic at present is that  Shanghai's role as an industrial base is developing to a higher  level. The development of technology-intensive industries is  faster than that of the labor-intensive industries, and the  labor-intensive industries are moving toward the hinterland.    Shanghai has put forward the establishment of the socialist  market economy operational mechanism before others. This has  attracted the attention of some localities. This is because we  hold that the establishment of the socialist market economy  structure cannot be determined by Shanghai alone. The whole  country is a big market and only when the socialist market  economy structure is established across the country can there be  a socialist market economy structure in Shanghai.    [Tseng] Shanghai has made outstanding achievements in  economic construction. Is there any plan for the building of  spiritual civilization?    [Wu] We are quite conscious of the building of spiritual  civilization. As the economy develops, common practices should  not become worse. With the development of the economy, the  quality of human culture should also be raised. This is also the  demand of common people.    We should find carriers for the building of spiritual  civilization. Last year, all residents of the municipality were  concerned with the East Asian Games. Originally, we were ready  to carry out the games on a small scale. Later, as the games  were linked with the application for hosting the Olympic Games,  we were prepared to carry out the games on a large scale. The  opening ceremony, in particular, should manifest our capacity  for hosting the Olympic Games. I remember that the period from  making the decision to opening the games was only 100 days.  Everything was ready in 100 days. What was the reason for  that? This was because everybody participated in the work and  everybody became the host. Everybody worked to improve the  cultural and sanitary environment of the municipality. This was  precisely the building of spiritual civilization. According to  our experience, we have found that one of the important things  in the building of spiritual civilization is the participation  of the masses and the integration with the desires of the  masses. However, many problems exist. For example, JIEFANG  RIBAO carried on the front page the day before yesterday a  letter to me from the vice president of a U.S. corporation which  mentioned unpleasant things he met with in Shanghai. For  example, a decently dressed page boy at the door of a big  restaurant used foul language. Another example was that some  personnel of a hospital smoked despite signs forbidding people  not to do so. He said that foreign enterprises paid much  attention to their images and had integrated education with  management. I have passed on this letter to people in charge of  departments concerned and have urged propaganda departments to  start work in this respect at the lowest level and proceeding  from improving the images of enterprises.  <H5>  No Horse Racing Course or Casinos </H5>   [Tseng] Public places of entertainment have sprung up like  bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the past few years. How  are they managed? Some people are worried that while these  public places of entertainment are enriching the cultural  recreation of the residents, tourists, and foreign businessmen,  they will do harm to the common practices of society. What do  you think of this? Will the ban on gambling and betting on  horse racing be lifted?    [Wu] At present, there are over 3,700 public places of  entertainment in Shanghai. Shops on Nanjing Road and Huaihai  Road are open up to 10 o'clock in the evening. Some restaurants  and public places of entertainment are open up to 12 o'clock and  others are open throughout the night. There are more than 600  ballrooms and 500 karaoke bars. Besides, there are music  teahouses and public places of sports. These public places of  entertainment developed very fast last year and this is a kind  of necessity for improving the people's life. We cannot just  keep the people at home. It will not do to have television  alone and the people, young people in particular, need other  activities. Without such a demand, the market cannot develop  either. Foreigners also find life in Shanghai more comfortable.  This is also a necessity. Some things are banned in Shanghai  because we hold ourselves responsible to foreigners and to the  13 million people in Shanghai and we do not permit damage done  to common social practices in Shanghai. In the past, Shanghai  was the paradise of adventurers and a metropolis infested with  foreign adventurers. Everything, good or bad, could be found  here. Many teleplays and films of Hong Kong reflect these  problems, including the underworld, kidnapping, and  prostitution. We do not permit dying embers to glow again. We  energetically develop healthy and positive things and at  present, we still cannot have things like a horse racing  courses, casinos, or betting companies. Some friends in Hong  Kong and Macao have written with a good intention to me telling  me the merits of those things. However, we have, after  consideration, decided not to have such things. We cannot have  girls accompanying customers in drinking and other activities.  We cannot have pornography in any disguise. We cannot have  beauty pageants either. I understand that many cities of  foreign countries also have similar rules. Some countries,  including capitalist countries, do not allow to beauty pageants.  Because Shanghai was infested with foreign adventurers in the  past, we will find it difficult to deal with them if they  develop as a result of inappropriate management. For example,  those who maintain order in casinos are actually hired ruffians.  They would form an underworld, then corrupt our judicial  departments turning policemen and bandits into one family, and  it would be impossible to stop them. Foreign businessmen have  also agreed to our acting in this way. Many Hong Kong friends,  including wives of people in Hong Kong, have told me that this  rule is good. The general principle is positive and  progressive. The cultural market should not be turned into a  pornography market under disguise, or a place for illegal  activities. Shanghai has sternly cracked down on such things.  The common people have given us great support. We have adhered  to two directions. One is to make the cultural market  prosperous and the other is to sternly crack down on illegal  activities.    [Tseng] In the past, Shanghai was also the cultural center  of China. Many first-rate artists of China began their careers  here. However, in recent years the refined arts in Shanghai have  met with much difficulty in their development. Please tell us  how you will promote the development of refined arts in the new  year.    [Wu] Regarding the question of refined arts, my  understanding is that it is necessary to have both popular arts  and refined arts. Our life is rich and colorful and we cannot  have just one color. For example, during the Cultural  Revolution, there were only eight model plays on modern themes.  Some people said that the mainland would lower the intensity of  performances given by singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan and they  opposed allowing singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan to perform in  Shanghai. Our attitude is that we welcome them. Wherever there  is an audience, there is a market. However, we do not favor  using public funds to raise the temperature of such  performances. We have attached great importance to popular  literature and art. We welcome performances given in Shanghai  by singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan. We shall also give  enthusiastic support to refined arts.    While watching an opera, I thought that Shanghai should have  ballet. Shanghai regards economy as the center, but it should  also have culture. We should not turn two legs into one. An  outstanding question is the question of funds. More than 9,000  performances were given in Shanghai last year. The government  spent 2.5 million yuan on giving support to seven opera troupes.  In addition to spending 40 million yuan on giving support to  cultural undertakings each year, 2.5 million was specially  allocated for the same purpose. Besides the question of funds,  there is also the question of cultural facilities. A first-rate  large opera house is being built at the People's Square. There  is also the question of mechanism of the opera troupes  themselves. We cannot eat "out of the same pot," nor can we  practice egalitarianism. There is a question of the reform of  the mechanism and there is great potential. The third aspect is  the support of enterprises. The Baoshan Iron and Steel Company  has donated 10 million yuan as funds for refined arts. The  ballet troupe wants to adapt Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai for  ballet and to perform Swan Lake, Don Quixote, the Nutcracker,  and Romeo and Juliet. Ten performances of the Kun opera Peony  Pavilion were given and the tickets sold very well. University  students are also interested in opera. It is matter of  fostering an interest. The orchestra went to Taiwan to give a  performance. Many people watched its performance and it was  well-received.    [Tseng] When Zhu Rongji was the mayor of Shanghai he visited  Hong Kong and stressed Shanghai and Hong Kong should cooperate  with and supplement each other. At present, the Sino-British  talks on Hong Kong's constitutional system have broken down.  How does Shanghai look at its relations with Hong Kong?    [Wu] The economy of Hong Kong and that of the mainland are  getting closer and closer and they are on the same boat. On the  part of Shanghai, it earnestly hopes to see a prosperous Hong  Kong and Hong Kong's prosperity is beneficial to Shanghai. A  lot of our funds have come via Hong Kong and much of our trade  uses Hong Kong as an entrepot. We keep contact with the outside  world through Hong Kong in terms of information and channels.  Therefore, we hope very much to have a prosperous Hong Kong.  At present, China, including Shanghai, has the ability of  maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity. The development of  Shanghai's economy is conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and  Hong Kong's prosperity can also promote Shanghai's development.  There may be some competition, but competition is not something  bad and competition can promote development. The drawback of  the past economic structure is that it has no competition. No  matter whether China and Britain will cooperate, Shanghai and  Hong Kong must cooperate. A lot of Shanghai's interests are in  Hong Kong. We believe the residents of Hong Kong are able to  make development. Sooner or later, Shanghai will become a world  economic center. We are confident that it will become one of  the world's economic centers.  <H5>  Energetically Support the Tax Sharing System </H5>   [Tseng] The tax sharing system implemented by the state  involves the readjustment of interests. The relationship  between the center and the localities is a question which  overseas people are much concerned about. What is Shanghai's  attitude toward this question?    [Wu] We are all concerned about this question. For some  time many overseas people were also concerned about it. This is  mainly a matter of the distribution system. Zhu Rongji brought  more than 60 people to Shanghai. We gave enthusiastic support  to the tax sharing system. Mayor Huang Ju was studying in  Beijing and we, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC  Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government, expressed our  attitude. Shanghai had nothing different to say about the tax  sharing system. Besides, we hope that the central authorities  can strengthen macroregulation and control. If the central  authorities lack the ability to carry out macroregulation and  control, there will be an adverse impact on Shanghai. We, for  example, have received many foreigners. They said they were not  afraid of a high foreign exchange rate or a devaluation of the  renminbi, but they were afraid of changes on our part. The  highest exchange rate at one time was $1 to 11 yuan in Shanghai  and the rate was going up. The foreigners were worried: You and  I have run a joint venture. I have injected U.S. dollars into  it, while you have injected renminbi. How should the percentage  of funds for the joint venture be calculated. This is not a  kind of cooperation. Therefore, we hope there can be  macroregulation and control, which is the need of comprehensive  development and also the need of Shanghai's development. State  taxation rates, foreign exchange rates, and tariff rates should  be highly unified.    Shanghai has resolutely implemented policies formulated by  the central authorities and has persisted in making greater  contribution to the state each year. We had harmonious talks  with the central authorities last time. In his concluding  remarks, Comrade Zhu Rongji said both sides were satisfied and  could make clear explanation. The central authorities were  satisfied and Shanghai was satisfied; clear explanation could be  given to the people of the whole country and to the people of  Shanghai.    At the central work meeting, Comrade Huang Ju, on behalf of  the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and Government, pledged  three things. The first was to guarantee the establishment of a  socialist market. The second was to guarantee the fulfillment  of the task of handing over money to the state. Last year  Shanghai handed over to the central authorities 30 billion yuan.  The third was to guarantee the fulfillment of all the tasks  assigned by the state to Shanghai and its subordination to the  state's macroregulation and control. Shanghai is the Shanghai of  the whole country. It has no raw materials. Nor has it energy  sources. Shanghai's market is only confined to 13 million  people. Shanghai's development cannot be separated from the  whole country. If the whole country is good, Shanghai is good.  If the whole country is not good, Shanghai cannot be good. We  wholeheartedly support state policies. Comrade Jiang    Zemin also praised Shanghai for always taking the interests  of the whole into account. As a matter of fact, the interests  of the whole also conform with the needs of Shanghai's  development. Recently, we held a plenary meeting of the  municipal committee at which the question of the sense of the  situation of the whole was put forward. Some articles published  abroad have exaggerated things. I think the relationship  between Shanghai and the central authorities is normal. We have  never found that the central authorities do not give support to  Shanghai or that Shanghai does not subordinate itself to central  leadership.    [Tseng] Is there a concrete timetable for Shanghai to  develop to a financial center?    [Wu] In recent years, the progress of Shanghai's formation  as a financial center has been faster than expected. Several  major financial markets in Shanghai, the currency market, the  bills and security discount market, and the foreign exchange  market, have developed rapidly. Foreign banks have set up  offices in Shanghai and the U.S. Citibank has moved its Asian  Headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In addition, we have  adopted a major measure this year.    In the past, banks and financial companies were located in a  concentrated manner in areas around the Shanghai Bund. The  Shanghai Municipal Government has put forward a plan on the  establishment of a real estate exchange center and on building a  Chinese Wall Street around the Shanghai Bund.    I do not have much contact with foreign banks in Shanghai  and  I feel that they still seem to be able to make profits.  Although they still cannot manage the renminbi business at  present, they can do business with the foreign-invested  enterprises. At present, 3,000 new foreign-invested enterprises  are opened in Shanghai each year. With such a speed in  construction, the volume of the flow of funds is very great.  Last year, Shanghai introduced over $7 billion of foreign  capital. Besides, Shanghai is actively exploring financial  reform. For example, Shanghai has most favorable conditions for  running commercial banks first. At present, the development is  faster than what was expected. Shanghai has more than 20  foreign banks, including financial companies.    The site of the municipal government was formerly the  Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation Building. The  municipal government will take the lead in moving out of the  building. At present, several foreign banks or offices of  foreign banks have shown great interest in the building. At  present, most foreign banks or offices of foreign banks are  located in hotels or other office buildings and they are not  easy to find. We are going to move government organs out of  areas around the Shanghai Bund and to let banks and financial  undertakings develop their business there.    [Tseng] The real estate business, after a period of heated  development, has cooled down and many people have taken a wait  and see attitude. Is there any problem in this respect?  <H5>  Rapid Sales of Villas in Close Suburban Areas </H5>   [Wu] The real estate business should develop along a correct  line. Because of this, we have made some rules and regulations.  For example, we have fixed a limit for the lowest price of real  estate; we have stipulated that land is given in accordance with  relevant projects and this can prevent profiteering; and we have  stipulated that funds for land development should be available  as scheduled or the land will be taken back.    At present, there are relatively heated sales of real  estate in Shanghai. After tax reform, the collection of real  estate profit taxes has met with some problems. Some people are  frightened and want to sell their houses. We think that the  taxation system should not restrict the development of the real  estate business. In Shanghai, land prices are high and the rate  of return from investment is low. We should properly study how  to fix local taxes. At present, sales of garden villas in  Shanghai's close suburbs, such as those in the Hongqiao  Development Zone, remain heated. Because Shanghai approves the  establishment of over 3,000 new foreign-invested enterprises  each year, the number of offices of foreign enterprises will  become even more. They are located in hotels and the rents  there are very expensive. They all want to buy villas in close  suburbs. Of course, the market for inexpensive houses is the  biggest. Residents whose houses have to be pulled down have a  great demand for inexpensive houses and the municipal government  has also encouraged to build more such houses. Shanghai's land  prices were high even in the past. We should make use of the  strong point of the price difference in downtown areas. On the  other hand, the development of Pudong should make use of the  strong point of low land prices. At present, quite a few large  enterprises abroad are optimistic about the real estate business  in Shanghai. A major Hong Kong real estate businessman told me:  "The true real estate business is in Shanghai. Shanghai is a  big city. To make money, we must come to Shanghai."    [Tseng] What has Shanghai done in opposing corruption and  encouraging honesty?    [Wu] We have grasped anticorruption not because corruption  is very serious. We cannot wait until corruption is very  serious. The social order is stable in Shanghai. For example,  there has been no problem in the control over guns in the past  10 years. We also have to be realistic in grasping the building  of clean administration. For example, regarding the issue of not  allowing party or government organs to run tertiary industry, we  have stipulated that party, government, or judicial organs shall  not run special businesses, such as karaoke bars; that party or  government organs shall not speculate in stocks or futures,  because if they were allowed to do so, they could use inside  information; and that party or government organs shall not  practice monopolistic management and shall not contract tertiary  businesses out to private businessmen so as to avoid damaging  the image of party or government organs. At the same time, we  have also asked cadres to exercise self-discipline and to  consciously do a good job in the building of clean  administration. We were able to implement these few things last  year.</p>

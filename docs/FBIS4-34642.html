			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] Christine Stewart, Canada's minister of state for  Latin America and Africa, supported Canada's investments in Cuba  during her address to the conference organized by the British  publication THE ECONOMIST in Havana. The conference, called the  Second Round Table Conference With the Government in Havana,  officially opens its two-day closed door meetings today, 21  June. The conference was inaugurated by Carlos Lage, vice  president of the council of ministers, Christine Stewart, and an  executive of the sponsoring publication.    Stewart stressed that Canada's government supports an  increase in investments in Cuba, not only because they  contribute to Cuba's development but because they are beneficial  to Canada.    Currently, Canada has a significant presence in the foreign  investments made in the Cuban mining sector, not only in the  traditional nickel sector but also in the new explorations for  gold, lead, and copper, as well as in the operation of oil  fields. Stewart expressed Canada's readiness to stimulate, even  more, the influx of capital to Cuba.    Ottawa announced that it will aid in the development of  Cuba,  as well as through the World Food Program, sending an emergency  $360,000 [country of currency not specified] -- $720,000 in 1995  -- in food aid to Cuba.</p>

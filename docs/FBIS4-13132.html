			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman (Petra)--Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali on Sunday [17 April] reaffirmed Jordan's rejection of  any unilateral solution to the Middle East conflict saying that  Jordan was seeking just, comprehensive and durable peace  acceptable by all Arab parties concerned.    Speaking during a meeting with representatives of  publications of political parties, Dr. al-Majali said Jordan had  been subjected to pressure in a bid to force it to change its  principled stand towards Arab issues.    Dr. al-Majali rejected Israel's attempts to link Jordan with  terrorism and said there could be a linkage between the threats  and Israel's attempts to export its internal crises to Jordan.    Dr. al-Majali said the siege of al-'Aqabah was part of the  Gulf war and that Jordan had been suffering for more than three  years from the blockade.    He said the siege had so far cost Jordan more than $1.2  billion.    The prime minister said the government was exerting efforts  with France, Britain and others to explain the dangers posed by  the situation.    He added that Jordan made intensive contacts with the U.S.  administration and the United Nations Sanctions Committee to  stop the interception of ships heading for al-'Aqabah. He  expressed hope that a solution be reached to this problem soon.    Dr. al-Majali said Lloyds Register had made an offer to  Jordan to help end the search of ships in the high seas. Lloyds  is a non-political and non-profit international corporation  whose presence will not have any effect on Jordan's national  sovereignty," he said.    Inter-Arab coordination, Dr. al-Majali said, falls short of  aspirations. "It is regrettable indeed that current events and  crises facing the Arab nation have not made them more tolerant  or more cohesive, particularly at a time when we realise that  Arab negotiators can achieve more when they are united," the  prime minister said.    On Jordanian-Palestinian relations, Dr. al-Majali said  Jordan  maintains unique and special relations with the Palestinian  people. However, he said, there are several Palestinian factions  with different political affiliations.    Dr. al-Majali said it was natural for Jordan to establish  relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the  Palestinian entity recognised by the Palestinian people, the  Arab Nation and most world countries.    The prime minister voiced Jordan's support for the PLO to  help it regain full Palestinian rights.    "We pray to God that the political organisation enters the  occupied Palestinian territories and that the Palestinian people  restore their legitimate rights on their national soil," he  said. "It is then the kind of relation between Jordan and the  Palestinians will be determined."    On Jerusalem, Dr. al-Majali said while PLO officials had  agreed to discuss the issue of Jerusalem in the second phase of  talks, Jordan believed that Jerusalem is the major problem,  given the current state of inter-Arab division. "There is no  peace without Jerusalem," Dr. al-Majali said.    On recent incidents aimed at destablising security and  stability in the country, Dr. al-Majali said perpetrators of  these crimes were trained abroad to use arms.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Government help is an important factor - In a nutshell Nine out of 10 small businesses believe the government does not do enough to help them either by providing finance or advice, according to a survey of 140 companies which made use of factoring. The survey was carried out by Lombard NatWest Commercial Services, the factoring subsidiary of NatWest Bank. Companies under a year old were more satisfied with government help than those between one and three years old, possibly reflecting the publicity given to schemes for small and start-up enterprises and a lack of assistance for better established business. Asked to list policy initiatives which the government should take to help small firms, business owners' highest priority was for a cut in interest rates followed by legislation for the prompt payment of bills, a reduction in the VAT rate and increased public spending. *Small Business Survey.

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Managers 'fail to stem car as perk' Managements seeking to dispense with the company car are offering too little in cash alternatives, a report says today. The report by Wyatt, consultants and actuaries, found that in spite of tax changes that reduced the value of a car as a company perk, 95 per cent of employers were offering company cars compared to 98 per cent a year ago. About 46 per cent of employers running company cars used lease or contract hire cars while 54 per cent bought them. The report says that more companies are trying to buy back company cars with cash alternatives - 39 per cent of the 264 organisations in the study compared with 28 per cent last year. But take-up of the cash alternatives was low - only 10 per cent. Wyatt suggests this was because employers were offering too little as an alternative. Mr Mike Landon, senior consultant at Wyatt, said the average alternative on a car valued at Pounds 20,000 was Pounds 6,000 a year. He said: 'An employee would need Pounds 10,000 to operate the same car out of after-tax earnings without being worse off, which explains why most have decided to stick with their cars.' Another cash alternative under consideration by many employers is the adoption of flexible benefits schemes, enabling employees to choose a variety of benefits in exchange for part of their pay. Only 5 per cent of the employers in the survey had introduced such schemes, but half of those had done so in the last 12 months. Of employers who did not operate a flexible benefits scheme, more than 40 per cent were considering doing so, although administration was regarded as a barrier. Company Cars and Flexible Benefits.

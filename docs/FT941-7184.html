			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Siam Cement falls 20% to Bt3bn Siam Cement, the Thai construction materials company and the country's biggest conglomerate, reported a 20 per cent fall in consolidated net profits for 1993 to Bt3.16bn (Dollars 124m), from Bt3.98bn a year earlier. Strong end-of-year demand for cement helped fourth-quarter profits climb 64 per cent to Bt584m. Analysts said the drop in earnings should not obscure the company's general health which is buoyed by continued heavy domestic demand for cement. The company's aggressive depreciation policy ensures that capital expenditure hits short-term profits; plant with a life of 30 years is typically depreciated within five years. Mr George Morgan, head of research at brokers HG Asia in Bangkok, said he was expecting consolidated net profits of Bt4.10bn in 1994. Subsidiaries Siam Guardian Glass and Siam Construction Steel continue to lose money. Thailand's number two cement producer Siam City Cement announced a 30 per cent rise in net profits for its parent company to Bt1.47bn from Bt1.13bn following a 56 per cent fall in fourth-quarter net profits.</p>

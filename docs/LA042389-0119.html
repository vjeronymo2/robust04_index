			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Congress may be asked to bail out numerous corporations that will be forced  into bankruptcy in the next recession because of excessive debt, the chairman  of the Senate Finance Committee said. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) said a study  that shows a dramatic increase in the amount of high-risk "junk bond" debt  since 1980 makes him worry about the possibility of a taxpayer bailout similar  to the multibillion-dollar rescue of the nation's troubled savings and loan  institutions. Bentsen said the Library of Congress study "tells us that the  amount of corporate debt is going through the roof and that the quality of  corporate debt is going through the floor."  </P></p>

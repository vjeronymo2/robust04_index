			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Observer: Global guru Salomon Brothers has finally taken the plunge and replaced Henry Kaufman who stepped down as its chief economist in 1988. John Lipsky, a 44-year-old American, has been based in London as a director of the economic and market analysis department of Salomon Brothers International since July 1989 . If Lipsky's name isn't as familiar in London as, say, Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs or Bill Martin of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, it is not because of any lack of distinction as an economist. He is highly regarded among his peers and, as a former assistant chief in the exchange and trade relations department of the International Monetary Fund, is well known among international policy-makers. He will be commuting across the Atlantic for a while until a successor is found for him in London. His appointment shows how economic punditry is a global business these days. It remains to be seen whether increased exposure to the fragile US economy will lead Lipsky to take over Henry Kaufman's unofficial title of 'Dr Doom'.</p>

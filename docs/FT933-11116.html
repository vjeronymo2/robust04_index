			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Money Markets: European rates havoc EUROPEAN money markets were dazed yesterday by the Bundesbank's surprise decision not to lower the German discount rate, writes Stephanie Flanders. At the eye of the storm, Paris traders tried to gauge the prospects for French interest rates in the absence of a significant German monetary easing. French overnight money rates immediately rose to 15 per cent, while three-month rates finished at around 8.50 per cent, 25 basis points up on the day. Trading in French franc futures took the full brunt of the market's uncertainty. The September Pibor contract plummeted 20 basis points immediately following the Bundesbank announcement, discounting the sizeable French interest rate cuts which would follow the franc's ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism. September francs recovered somewhat during the afternoon, closing 9 basis points down in Paris at 92.76. However, in after-hours' trading, the September Pibor contract shot forward, gaining around 30 basis points in a further bout of market confusion. Elsewhere, the Dutch central bank announced a 25 basis points reduction in three of its interest rates but it, too, left the key special advances money market rate unchanged at 6.60 per cent. Belgian money market rates rose in the face of heavy pressure on the Belgian currency. Three-month money rates climbed to 8.25 per cent in the middle of the day, up from the previous close of 7.80 per cent. In London, the news from the ERM initially seemed to dampen hopes of a pre-autumn cut in UK interest rates. But the market later seemed to decide that the case for UK rates did not rest and fall on events in Germany. 'Even if the Bundesbank had cut the discount rate,' said one London-based analyst, 'we would not have had a cut in Britain. Expectations have got carried away over the past few days, but it is domestic economic and political factors which determine the UK authorities' policy, and these do not point to a cut before the end of the summer.' Supporting the isolationist view of events in UK markets, trading in sterling futures continued to reflect a belief in lower UK base rates in the months ahead. The December sterling contract was most dramatically affected, ending at around 94.75, up some 17 basis points on the day. September sterling consolidated the previous day's gain, finishing 3 basis points higher at 94.39.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Observer: Milking parlance Amid much razzmatazz the prosaically named Milk Marketing Board has announced that when its 60-year-old statutory monopoly ends some time next year the new co-operative to arise from the ashes will be known as Milk Marque. The board must have a lotta bottle to choose a name based on a French word. Perhaps it felt it had to butter up to the EC's single market. Whatever the reason, the new name sounds gibberish.</p>

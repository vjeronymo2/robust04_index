			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Falls in oil shares depress the market RENEWED selling of the leading oil and pharmaceutical stocks, triggered by worries over the outlook for Wall Street following the result of the New Hampshire primary election, turned the London stock market lower yesterday. The Footsie 2,500 mark was again abandoned as hopes of an early cut in base rates melted away and investors turned their attention to the international scene. Equities opened easier after the Tokyo market had fallen back to a 16-month low and sterling's weaker performance against the D-Mark had cast doubts on the hopes for a base rate cut which had sustained the UK stock market earlier in the week. Stock index futures were firm in early trading but could not offset the heavy falls in such equity leaders as BP, SmithKline Beecham, Wellcome and Glaxo. The stock market was soon down around 15 points on the FT-SE scale. An attempted rally died away as London grew increasingly nervous ahead of the opening of the new Wall Street session. News of a 0.4 per cent rise in domestic retail sales in January had no effect on the stock market. Wall Street lost ground in early deals, and London extended its fall to around 25 Footsie points, but then rallied when the Dow turned higher for a net gain of 4 points in UK hours. At the final reading the FT-SE 100 Index was down 19.2 to 2,536.7. UK traders sounded apprehensive, in spite of the relatively steady performance in the early part of the New York session. There was little recovery in the heavyweight oil and drug stocks. Indeed, the closing minutes of trading were overshadowed by hints that US investors, after supporting BP last week, had turned sellers of the blue chip oil concern. UK investors were still waiting to see Wall Street's definitive response to the New Hampshire poll, as well as to the appearance of Mr Alan Greenspan, chief of the Federal Reserve, before the House of Representatives and also the Fed's reduction in banks' reserve requirements. Trading volume in equities in London totalled 561.3m shares yesterday, compared with 559.3m on Tuesday, when retail, or customer, business increased to Pounds 995.4m. Some stock in the Seaq leaders was sold yesterday but traders said that pressure was no more than moderate. Outside the oil and pharmaceutical sectors, the picture was less gloomy. British Aerospace staged a strong advance in heavy trading after announcing a loss for the year which was not far from the market's predictions. ICI, with the trading report now only a week away, moved ahead in good turnover, and there were scattered gains elsewhere in the Footsie list. However, Drayton Consolidated Trust fell sharply after disclosing that a substantial loss was likely in view of the appointment of receivers at Alma Holdings, an unquoted company in which Drayton had invested. Invesco, which manages Drayton, lost a few pence on the news. The less certain tone of the market yesterday inspired some profit-taking in those stocks which had led the market ahead in the two previous sessions. Some store shares gave ground, although the market appeared to have no agreed view on the latest retail sales data.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Officials of Thailand, Laos, and the UN High  Commission for Refugees [UNHCR] are to meet in Chiang Rai next  month to find ways to speed up the repatriation of the remaining  25,000 Laotian refugees in Thailand to Laos by the end of this  year, according to a Lao diplomat.    The Laotian Ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak,  said  the meeting would examine ways to meet the deadline of the  UNHCR- sponsored repatriation and what could be done if the  refugees remained after 1994.    Speaking on Thursday at a seminar on Thai-Laotian Relations,  organized by Chulalongkon University's International  Understanding Program, Bounkeut said there should be no  mandatory repatriation for the sake of meeting the deadline.    "This will be against the agreement reached by the three  parties," the ambassador said.    In 1991, Thailand, Laos and the UNHCR agreed during their  first meeting in Luang Prabang, Laos, to a speedy three-year  repatriation program of the refugees as Thailand had given an  ultimatum to close its last refugee camp at Ban Na Pho, in Nong  Khai province, by the end of this year.    Deputy Secretary-General of the National Security Council  (NSC) Khachatphai Burutphat, who joined the panel, has  reaffirmed the government's decision to close Ban Na Pho.  Khachatphai contended that at present there were many refugees  willing to return home.    "There is a need to convince the refugees that their  homeland  had changed for the better under the new economic mechanism and  that they should return to help develop their country," he said.    He also urged the UNHCR to help in the quick return of the  remaining refugees. At the third tripartite meeting in  Savannakhet, Laos, last year, Thailand, in order to accelerate  the repatriation program, proposed that the UNHCR expand their  present overcrowded reception centres in Laos to accommodate  more returnees in transition.    According to the Foreign Ministry's press statement, only  8,619 refugees have returned home since the implementation of  the three-year program in 1991. This includes the latest batch  of 405 Hmong last month. Of the remaining 25,000 refugees there  are about 22,000 Hmongs.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A two-thirds majority of adults claim to have adopted the "designated driver"  concept when attending social functions at which alcoholic beverages are  served. Under this plan, a volunteer refrains from drinking in order to drive  his or her companions safely home. The designated driver concept has been  heavily promoted on television as part of the nationwide effort to curb drunken  driving. This public service campaign has gained widespread attention.  According to a recent Gallup Poll, 67% have seen one or more of the designated  driver TV messages, up from 54% in a survey taken last fall.  </P></p>

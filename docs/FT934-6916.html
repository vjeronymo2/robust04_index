			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: China's telecoms regime under pressure - An internal challenge to an old monopoly A struggle is under way for control of China's telecommunications industry. On its outcome depends the size and shape of potentially the world's largest telecommunications market. The Beijing government wants to quadruple the number of telephone lines from 20m to 80m by the year 2000 - an addition equivalent to three times the existing network in the UK. China has barely one telephone line per 100 people, compared with 49 per 100 in, for example, Hong Kong. However, a highly centralised system, together with a blanket prohibition on involvement by western network operators, makes Beijing's target unrealistic without far-reaching reforms. Local officials - led by the mayor of Shanghai - are calling for a relaxation of current regulations amid increasing signs of support from key utility and economic development ministries. Mr Huang Ju told leading western telecoms operators recently that he would like to arrange a 'pilot' project in Shanghai under which foreign operators would invest in building and operating a new network. Under the existing regime, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has a virtual monopoly on telecom operations. Overseas telecom equipment manufacturers have been allowed in through joint ventures, but network operation - the heart of the industry - is closed to all but MPT agents. Executives of telecoms operators such as AT&amp;T (which supplies equipment to the Chinese market) and Cable &amp; Wireless (which has a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom) dream in public almost daily about the potential of the Chinese market. Now, the domestic battle between Beijing ministries and local leaders may before long lead to a change in policy on those and other foreign operators. 'There is a lot of pushing and pulling within the different ministries,' said a western telecoms executive in Beijing. 'The MPT is putting a fairly strong block against more participation by others.' The immediate issue at stake is the MPT's absolute grip on domestic operations. Three ministries (electronic industries, railways and electric power), together with the People's Bank of China, the People's Liberation Army and other Chinese enterprises are attempting to forge an alliance to create a second national telecoms network apart from that run by MPT. Interpretations differ over whether the second network would be wholly public or use dedicated lines to link several ministries, industries and enterprises. Either way, it would break the MPT's monopoly and give a powerful stimulus to telecoms development. The PLA is a prime mover behind the project. It already controls all China's air-wave frequencies, is the largest satellite dish manufacturer and is heavily involved in the cellular phone and paging industries. So far, though, only one company has made inroads into the MPT's monopoly. Ji Tong, a domestic company established by the Ministry of Electronic Industry earlier this year, has obtained approval to establish pager and data communications services linking up with the telephone network. If it gets an MPT licence, Ji Tong has ambitious plans to develop a wide range of pager, cordless phone and data services markets. 'We can provide customers for the services and link into MPT's backbone network,' said Ms Liang Mei, Ji Tong's senior engineer. Ji Tong is also spearheading a project known as the 'three goldens', a series of telecommunications infrastructure schemes to link various ministries and industries. The first, called the 'golden bridge', is a national electronic data network; 'golden customs' is an electronic data interface for companies involved in foreign trade; and 'golden banking card' is for a network similar to that provided by automatic teller machines in western countries. Another company, Lian Tong, which is jointly owned by the Ministry of Electronic Industry, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Electric Power, is believed to be engaged in discussions with MPT for a licence to start a second network. Western diplomats believe MPT's power to thwart such schemes is waning. Indeed, the ministry is itself undergoing radical re-organisation. Over the next few years, it will be divided into two: one part to regulate the industry and determine prices for telecoms companies, the other to manufacture and operate services. 'China is facing a crossroads where the price of more accessible, affordable communication is less political influence,' says a western analyst in Beijing. 'But basic operation and ownership will have limits for a long time.' Western companies would be unlikely to be allowed in as anything but minority joint venture partners for the foreseeable future. Lord Young, chairman of C&amp;W, who was present at a recent conference in New York where Shanghai's Mr Huang spoke, said there was unlikely even to be pilot projects with western operators 'until the current battle is won - which could be months or far longer'. Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia-Pacific telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, said Mr Huang's view underlined the 'unsustainability' of existing policy. 'It could spell the end of the MPT monopoly, and open very significant opportunities for overseas telecom companies within a relatively short time scale.'</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> COURT STAYS HANGING OF TRIPLE MURDERER  </P> <P> A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco  issued a stay for triple murderer Charles R. Campbell, 34, who had been  scheduled Thursday to become the first person executed by hanging in the nation  since 1965. The court granted the stay pending its ruling on his appeal and  ordered additional briefs submitted by June 21. Campbell had been sentenced to  die at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla for the 1982 revenge  killings of Renae Wicklund, 31, her 8-year-old daughter, Shannah, and a  neighbor, Barbara Hendrickson, 51, whose throats were slashed in the small town  of Clearview, Wash., about 20 miles northeast of Seattle. The three were slain  when Campbell was on work release from a prison sentence for a 1976 sexual  assault on Wicklund. Both she and Hendrickson had testified at his 1978 trial.  </P></p>

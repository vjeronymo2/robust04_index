			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Bosnian aid crisis - What is needed for winter survival THE humanitarian crisis this winter is likely to be considerably worse than last year if the Bosnian war continues, UN agencies warned yesterday. Nearly 3m people in Bosnia, twice as many as last winter, are expected to need food and shelter aid: the numbers are rising each day as fighting isolates more communities. But agencies say they remain short of funding. Food aid alone in the former Yugoslavia is projected to cost Dollars 1.7m (Pounds 1.1m) a day, with the total bill for emergency aid expected to be nearly Dollars 500m, half for Bosnia. 'Last winter the weather was fairly mild and people had reserves of food and energy,' says Mr Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo. 'This winter they are exhausted, and the situation will be far worse.' CLOTHING AND SHELTER The UNHCR estimates that 500,000 people will need 'winter relief items'  - 3,500 tents, 3.6m sq m of plastic sheeting, 396,000 mattresses, 4m candles, 800,000 pairs of socks, and sweaters, gloves, vests and shoes for 400,000 people. With only Dollars 43m received of the Dollars 68m needed, there are severe shortages of clothes. FUEL With most electricity and gas supplies in the region cut, and distribution of diesel hampered by fighting, lack of fuel will be one of the most critical problems this winter, particularly in the cities. Sarajevo alone, which has no stocks of coal, is estimated to need 80,000 tonnes of coal. FOOD The UN's World Food Programme estimates that 2.7m people will require food aid for the next six months: more than 260,000 tonnes of wheat flour, oil, biscuits, meat, fish, salt and sugar. The cost, including one month's emergency stocks, will be Dollars 200m. Donations of wheat have left the WFP with sufficient carbohydrates for the next three months but only 50 per cent of the necessary high-protein foods, and little stocks for beyond January. Although the food is stacked in warehouses in Split, Zagreb and Belgrade, the WFP has been unable to build up stocks in crisis spots, and fighting in central Bosnia has already prompted reports of imminent starvation in some isolated communities. SEEDS The UNHCR has distributed nearly 4,000 tonnes of vegetable and wheat seeds which could feed 900,000 people when the harvested next summer. But fighting has prevented the distribution and sowing of some of the seed, which needs to be planted by early October. MEDICAL SUPPLIES Recent outbreaks of hepatitis have left the World Health Organisation alarmed about the deterioration in health conditions. About 1m people have lice or other health problems arising from lack of hygiene and water.</p>

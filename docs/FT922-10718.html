			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: USAir reduces losses to Dollars 63m for quarter USAir Group, the parent company of America's sixth-largest carrier, remained firmly in the red during the first three months of 1992. Its losses, however, were significantly reduced from the same period a year ago. The after-tax deficit amounted to Dollars 63m. This contrasted with the large Dollars 168.7m loss in the first three months of 1991, when the Gulf war sent traffic levels tumbling. Among the other US carriers, American has made a small profit and Delta - still coping with the aftermath of the acquisition of former Pan Am assets  -a significant loss. USAir continues to suffer from a large interest burden; net interest charges totalled Dollars 59m, against Dollars 60.5m a year ago. At the operating level it continued to make losses, scoring a Dollars 24.3m deficit, down from Dollars 161.4m in the first quarter of 1991. Total operating revenues were Dollars 1.65bn, against Dollars 1.58bn. On the cost side, USAir was helped by a fall in fuel expenses, from Dollars 233.6m to Dollars 173.5m. Mr Seth Schofield, chief executive, said 1992 would probably be 'another very difficult year for the airline industry'. He said the industry still had substantial overcapacity, and that 'recent industry-wide fare reductions will have an adverse impact on revenue, the extent and duration of which are not known at this time'. USAir, which recently took over operating the Trump Shuttle service between Washington, New York and Boston, is seen as one of the most financially fragile US carriers. It has made after-tax losses of Dollars 305.3m and Dollars 454.4m in 1990 and 1991 respectively. Yesterday, its shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 13 3/8 at close of trade, but they have been as high as Dollars 19 5/8 and as low as Dollars 7 1/8 over the past year.</p>

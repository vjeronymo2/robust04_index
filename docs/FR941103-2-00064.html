			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The statement that the Regional Office expense in 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included the Dolores Project is incorrect. The Regional Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense category applies only to the initial CRSP units (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aspinall, Flaming Gorge, Glen Canyon, and Navajo), and not to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dolores Project. Dolores Project costs are shown in their own,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate PF&hyph;3 budget document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional Office expenses shown in the initial units (CRSP) work plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differ from those included in the PRS because Western inadvertently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used an unofficial version of Reclamation's PF&hyph;3. This document did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not differ from the official budget in total costs for the CRSP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial units. An adjustment within the program was made, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased the Regional Office expense by $564,000. This was made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance to the FY 1995 Budget Submission funding amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The O&amp;M figures (for the Rio Grande Project) in the PRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear to double count capitalized moveable equipment (CME)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses for the years 1995, 1997, and 1998 . . . .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western agrees with the comment and has rerun the RGP study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to eliminate this error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For 1994, the difference in expenses between the Work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program and the PRS appears to be comprised of the $35,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for CME less a $20,500 expense reduction, which is unex-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western's numbers were correct and have been used in the PRS. The commentor's table shows a difference of $28,885. There are four reasons for the difference: (1) O&amp;M expenditures planned for FY 1993 on the Elephant Butte Dam of $67,548 (portion assigned to power = $67,548 X 20.8% = $14,050) were not spent in FY 1993, but were obligated and actually spent in 1994; (2) expenditures planned on the Elephant Butte Powerplant ($30,854, of which 100-percent is repayable by power revenues) were not spent in FY 1993, but were obligated and actually spent in FY 1994; (3) the $35,000 referred to as CME for FY 1994 is not CME, but miscellaneous tools which is charged off to O&amp;M and is properly includable in the total O&amp;M for the year; and (4) item number (2) was further complicated by the fact that both the Work Program and the FY 1995 Budget Congressional Submission are based on an incorrect version of the summarized report. A line item (which should be included in the Other Expense line) which appears on the detailed report was coded incorrectly so that it does not appear on the summarized reports, but is included in the totals of both reports. Thus, the totals are $40,000 higher in the Work Program than the total of the numbers shown and $23,921 higher than the total of the numbers shown in the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. The $40,000 budgeted Other Expense item was later reduced to $23,921, which matches the $1,141,775 figure shown in the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. Following is a table which recaps the above information starting with the figures shown in the commentor's table:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Minister's remarks upset Malaysia Malaysia is seeking clarification from the British government over remarks by Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, suggesting that calls in Britain for retaliation against Malaysia might grow unless Kuala Lumpur lifts a ban on giving contracts to UK companies. Visiting Malaysia this week, Mr Needham said he felt the ban, imposed at the end of February, would be lifted 'within six weeks'. However, he said that as long as the ban was in force there was a chance that calls for some sort of retaliatory action would increase. Mr Abu Hassan Omar, the acting Malaysian foreign minister, said Malaysia hoped for a quick response on the issue from the British government. While the reaction of the Malaysian government to Mr Needham's remarks has been muted, the government-influenced local media have sought to interpret the comments as a slight to the government. Mr Needham has played a central role in trying to persuade the Malaysians to lift the ban, imposed after a report in the London Sunday Times alleged that a British company had been involved in negotiations to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister.</p>

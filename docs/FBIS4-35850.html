			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--AL-RA'Y learns from well-informed sources  that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is expected in Amman  tomorrow, Monday, for talks with His Majesty King Husayn and  senior officials.    Sources say that discussions will center on effective joint  coordination and the declaration by the Palestinian side that  they have agreed to Jordanian proposals pertaining to the plan  of action related to the Joint Economic Agreement.    The sources further say that during his stay in Amman,  'Arafat is expected to undergo medical checkups to ascertain  that his health condition is stable. However, the sources say  that this will depend on whether or not he will have enough time  to spare and provided nothing new is added to his heavy schedule  in the wake of preparations for his visiting the autonomous  region next week.</p>

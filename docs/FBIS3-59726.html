People are  concerned by the fact that the automobile exhausts, considered a  main offender in this regard, will continue to increase with the  growth of GNP. In order to suppress CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions  and to encourage people to use public transportation, it will be  essential to promote widespread use of low-pollution vehicles.  In carrying this out, we must be aware of the fact that  batteries, serving as an energy source for electric vehicles,  must be much larger in scale than existing ones, requiring  greater amounts of resources. Consequently, in order to promote  the wide acceptance of electric vehicles, it is necessary to  construct a system designed to provide a stable supply of such  component elements as batteries. For this reason, we surveyed  the availability of material resources used to produce batteries  and evaluated battery performance in actual use. Based on these  data, we computed the required amount of resources from the  standpoint of performance. Moreover, (3) we designed a model for  battery supply system, and, based on this model, we calculated  the amount of resource which will be consumed during a certain  period and studied the feasibility of battery installation at  the time when a large number of electric vehicles will hit the  market.  <H5>  2. Trial Calculation Method and Its Example </H5>   At present, various types of promising batteries for  automobile application are being proposed; however, for the  survey, we focused on lead, nickel-cadmium, nickel, and  nickel-zinc batteries because of their development status.    (1) Concerning these batteries, we first of all surveyed  their electrode materials considered to have a tremendous impact  on the number of sales of electric vehicles. Its findings are  shown in Table 1. Since cadmium is a byproduct of zinc, zinc  reserves are by no means plentiful, in addition to the fact that  it will be difficult to provide a stable supply of these two  metals when widespread use of electric vehicles should become a  reality and large quantities of these materials are required.  Moreover, lead and cadmium are toxic metals and should not be  introduced into the environment. If we are to consider an  additional problem of resource, then construction of a recycling  system of these metals will be essential.       Table 1.

The method of this  computation is shown below. Also an example of the computational  result is shown in Table 2.    A&lt;inf&gt; ijk&lt;/inf&gt; (N) : Based on N-year's battery performance,  the amount of element i (t) required for an electric vehicle k  equipped with a battery j (i, j, and k represent the type of an  element involved, type of a battery, and the size of a vehicle -    i = lead, nickel, cadmium, iron, and zinc j = lead  battery, Ni-Cd battery, Ni-Fe battery, and Ni-Zn battery k =  large-size vehicle (approximately the size of a garbage truck),  a medium-size vehicle (light van), and compact vehicle (about  the size of an average passenger automobile))    A&lt;inf&gt; ijk&lt;/inf&gt; (N) = (P / PD&lt;inf&gt; j&lt;/inf&gt; (N)) x  X&lt;inf&gt; 6&lt;/inf&gt;  (1)    P :Output demanded of a battery (vehicle weight,  traveling speed, air resistance, overall efficiency, etc. will  be parametized&lt;sup&gt; 3)&lt;/sup&gt; )    PD&lt;inf&gt; j&lt;/inf&gt; (N): Battery j's output density for N  years    X&lt;inf&gt; ij&lt;/inf&gt;    :Weight ratio of battery j's element j    At this time, the battery's output density will be greatly  changed and with it the amount of resource required. Actual  vehicle's traveling pattern is complex. Since performance  evaluation of a stand-alone single battery does not agree with  that of a battery installed in a vehicle, further study on  performance estimates will be required. As for computation  examples shown in Table 2, in order to make comparison with  computations based on standard capacity, we used output density  based on general battery catalog performance&lt;sup&gt; 3),4)&lt;/sup&gt; .  As for the lead battery, there is an example of computing the  required amount of lead from a battery's weight energy density;  however, judging from the result showing the 1,700-1,800 tons  per 10,000 electric vehicles equipped with 40Wh-kg&lt;sup&gt; -1&lt;/sup&gt;  batteries, we can see that an extremely rigid condition is  imposed on the calculation arrived at from the output density.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

The method of  calculation is shown in the following equations, (2)-(5), and  examples of the computational results in Figs. 2-4.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-43A>             Fig. 1.

Remaining Amount of Estimated Reserve if 100,000 </FIG>       Lead is frequently used in automobile batteries. At present,  in more than 90&percnt; of cases, the Japanese use lead in  batteries.  As for its recovery, even in terms of the entire amount used,  over 40&percnt; is recovered. Advanced recycling technology  mostly  likely will facilitate construction of recycling systems.  However, at the present juncture, estimated reserves by no means  are abundant. Moreover, since battery capabilities are reaching  a saturation point, use of a large amount of lead most likely  will be restricted. As for iron and nickel, we see no problems  insofar as the availability of these material resources are  concerned. For the supply of zinc and cadmium, however, we will  have to depend largely on recycling if demands will begin to  rise for greater quantities of these metals. Especially with  cadmium, even if recycled, if an annual demand is for use in  over several hundred thousands vehicles, there will be a danger  of drying up its resource unless the mining of cadmium rock bed,  which is not part of current commercial undertakings, is now in  progress. However, since our estimates for resource requirements  are extremely generous, actual usage ratio and drastic future  improvements, viz., possible reduction in automobile body  weight, will contribute to lowering of our resource  requirements, thereby heading off the depletion of resources to  some extent. Although recovery and recycling of nickel-cadmium  batteries are being undertaken recently, these are yet to be  recycled to produce new batteries. Figures 2 and 3 indicate that  at the level of approximately 1 million vehicles, since use of  elements other than cadmium is directed more in products other  than electric vehicle batteries, new production of elements for  use in batteries does not increase an overall annual production  figure greatly . However, in view of the scarcity of mineral  resources in Japan, if these resources are going to be used  extensively worldwide, Japan must see to it that the use of  recycled resources will not depend on raw materials, and a  recycling system to be constructed must reflect this  requirement. Since the model shown in Fig. 1 is conceptual, in  order to construct an effective system which is achievable, it  will be necessary to make a detailed study of recovery and  recycling routes as well as of cost.

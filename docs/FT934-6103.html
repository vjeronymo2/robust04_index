			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: HDTV makes its video debut - Worth Watching High-definition television has taken off most rapidly in Japan, where Toshiba has announced a video cassette recorder for high-definition digital transmissions. The recorder is aimed at production and broadcasting companies, which have been using open reel machines. The GBR-1000 VCR records up to 64 minutes of video to the 1125-line Japanese HDTV standard. British companies which want to stun their clients with high-definition corporate presentations can turn to Creative Technology, in London, which records tapes in the Japanese format. The tapes can include still photos, graphics or moving images and are displayed on HDTV sets. Toshiba: Japan, 3457 4511. Creative Technology: UK, 081 877 1980.</p>

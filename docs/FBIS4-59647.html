			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Husni Mubarak by Olaf Ihlau and </F> Volkhard Windfuhr in Cairo; date not given: "We Are Living in a  New Era"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, it must be a  frustrating job to act as the peace mediator in the Middle East.    [Mubarak] To mediate for peace means to prevent bloodshed  and to contribute to raising the living standard of the peoples.  This is particularly difficult if the relations between an  occupied people and its occupiers are at issue -- the  Palestinian problem, which has been waiting for a solution for  47 years.    [DER SPIEGEL] The peace mediator is in danger of suffering  Sisyphus' fate.    [Mubarak] To live means to hope. If the sincere will to  peace exists and the partners in the negotiations really make  efforts, there must be a positive result.    [DER SPIEGEL] For decades, there has been a state of war  between Arabs and Israelis. Is better insight supposed to get  the upper hand overnight?    [Mubarak] Israel has lived in an atmosphere of war and  unrest for a long time. I cannot imagine that the Israelis  would be prepared to continue to carry such a burden. Today the  whole world has realized that problems cannot be solved by war.    [DER SPIEGEL] Here you are hardly speaking for all Arab  leaders.    [Mubarak] Those who are still talking about war today are  impostors. Even Israel is building on negotiations and sits  down at the negotiating table together with Palestinians,  Syrians, and Jordanians.    [DER SPIEGEL] And the results of the negotiations are  disputed up to the very last minute, as was demonstrated during  the spoiled ceremony in Cairo when PLO Chairman 'Arafat did not  want to initial the maps of the autonomous region of Jericho.  This must have rather bugged you as the patron and mediator?    [Mubarak] One has to expect such things. A trifle can cause  such an incident. Although the persons present looked  concerned, I was sure that we would overcome the difficulty  because the previous evening we had agreed on the points that  caused confusion in the congress center.    [DER SPIEGEL] What caused the whole turmoil? What went  wrong?    [Mubarak] It was the old story: The Palestinians do not  trust the Israelis and the Israelis have their doubts about the  Palestinians' sincerity.    [DER SPIEGEL] What was the matter with the maps that 'Arafat  did not accept?    [Mubarak] The maps were the last topic with which we dealt  the night before the signing of the agreement. Referring to  security problems, the Israelis did not want to grant the  Palestinians the area for Jericho that they demanded. And in  the autonomous region of Gaza a 47-km long coastal strip was at  issue.    [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, there was no agreement on  these questions?    [Mubarak] Yes, a compromise was found. The Palestinians got  a large coastal strip and the Israelis several kilometers of  water for their security zone. But the main point was the  agreement that the detailed negotiations on the area of the  autonomous territories in Gaza and Jericho would be continued  after the signing of the accord.    [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, 'Arafat's appearance was more  of a theatrical coup for the Palestinians' use?    [Mubarak] The Palestinians did not have any confidence.  They believed that the putting off of the matter until further  negotiations was only "Sahlaa," eyewash, particularly since no  such thing had indeed been recorded in the documents.    [DER SPIEGEL] And how did you team the two sides up again  behind the scenes?    [Mubarak] Well, it took me only two minutes. I reminded  Rabin and Peres of the nightly agreements. We decided that  Israel would draft a letter that would be signed by Americans  and Russians, the two cosponsors of the agreement, and confirm  that further negotiations would be held on the area of Jericho  and Gaza -- after the agreement. Thus, the problem was  solved....    [DER SPIEGEL] ... and your mediation mission was also  solved.    [Mubarak] The negotiations that lasted for half a night were  indeed strenuous. When the coastal waters of Gaza were  discussed, 'Arafat shouted all the time "This is my sea." This  really made me laugh.    [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin was probably right when he claimed that  now the world is only perceiving "the tip of the iceberg of the  problems" that the Palestinians and Israelis have to overcome.    [Mubarak] This is largely true.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why is 'Arafat now taking his time in the  implementation of the autonomy agreement?    [Mubarak] What is in store for 'Arafat is tremendous. For  46 years, it was not granted to the Palestinians to take over  government tasks. Now they suddenly have to deal with such  unfamiliar things as agriculture, infrastructure, services, food  supply, and civil servants' salaries.    [DER SPIEGEL] But the PLO really had enough time to prepare  itself for it.    [Mubarak] I advised the Palestinians at an early stage to  develop a plan on an administrative structure. But they would  have come into difficulties anyway. Egypt and the other  countries of the region must help the Palestinians to cope with  their initial difficulties. If we hesitate here, there will be  a setback. I would rather not imagine the consequences.    [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps widely travelled guerrilla leader  Yasir 'Arafat finds it hard to put up with the role of a better  sort of provincial governor who mainly has to deal with housing  and sewage problems.    [Mubarak] The abrupt change from the PLO chairman to the  head of government at home in Palestine is more difficult than  to wage a war. Such a process takes time.    [DER SPIEGEL] And 'Arafat also has to overcome the  resistance of those Palestinians who think that he is Israel's  Quisling.    [Mubarak] I want to tell you one thing: When President  al-Sadat signed the Camp David peace agreement with Israel for  Egypt in 1978, all Palestinians, including 'Arafat, called him a  "traitor." By Allah, this was a terrible campaign, almost a war.    And what was the result? Now they call him a hero and  lament: "If we had only listened to al-Sadat." A late insight.  At that time, the Palestinians were only dealing with 48  smaller Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, today  there are 180.    'Arafat showed courage. His decision to go to the occupied  territories deserves deep respect. He knows that he has to face  opposition, although part of them are people who are paid for  the obstruction of peace by foreign countries.    [DER SPIEGEL] Of whom do you think, of Iran and Iraq?    [Mubarak] I would rather not give any names. At any rate,  'Arafat's courageous decision to negotiate a peace agreement  with Israel mostly falls on fertile ground. The people are  yearning for a solution of their problems.    [DER SPIEGEL] In those days, for his peace agreement,  al-Sadat got all his territories that were occupied by Israel.  'Arafat is still far from it.    [Mubarak] Yes, yes -- but we did not get it at one go  either. Al-Sadat's historic peace trip to Jerusalem took place  in 1977, and only in 1982 did Israel withdraw its last troops  from Sinai. We had to wait for five years. If the Palestinians  had initiated the negotiation process earlier, they would have  become the master of their own land long ago.    [DER SPIEGEL] If we were members of militant Hamas, we would  remonstrate with 'Arafat because he gets now his own stamps for  the two autonomous regions, but not real Palestinian sovereignty.    [Mubarak] Do you seriously expect the Palestinians to get  everything at the same time? What took us Egyptians five years  will also only happen in stages in the case of the Palestinians.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be advisable to accelerate the  negotiations for the final solution of the Palestinian problem?  The massacre at Hebron showed the disruptive potential of  extremists.    [Mubarak] If the autonomy experiment is satisfactory in the  next two years, the Israelis will also realize that an  acceleration of the final negotiations will serve their security  needs best.    [DER SPIEGEL] And what will happen if the autonomy model  fails?    [Mubarak] This process is irrevocable, the wheel of history  cannot be turned back at will. I cannot imagine that Israel  will ever reintroduce occupation law in the territories that it  vacated.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Jewish settlements and the  problem of East Jerusalem are still blocking the road to  permanent peace.    [Mubarak] Nobody can predict what will happen in the next  two years. With a certain degree of mutual confidence, however,  most of the problems can be settled. Palestinians and Israelis  cannot afford to live in a state of war for another 50 years.  We are living in a new era, the population figures are  doubling, and the problems of mankind are increasing.    [DER SPIEGEL] Has Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad also  understood the signs of the new era?    [Mubarak] Yes, Hafiz al-Asad wants peace, I am convinced of  it. Here the problem is also mutual distrust.    [DER SPIEGEL] How can it be reduced?    [Mubarak] Israel must credibly prove that it will return the  whole of the Golans. In return, Syria should convince the  Israelis of its preparedness for real, comprehensive peace.  Apparently, after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  last visit to Damascus, things were set in motion. I hope very  much that the Syrians and Israelis will come to terms before the  end of the year.    [DER SPIEGEL] Things might also develop in a completely  different way. If Rabin and 'Arafat fail, Hamas and Likud might  dominate the scene.    [Mubarak] With what alternatives? I do not see any other  way than negotiations. I hope and pray that 'Arafat and Rabin  will continue to be able to negotiate. Both have experience of  many years and know all dimensions of the problem.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you also believe yourself capable of  playing the role of mediator in the newly erupted conflict in  Yemen?    [Mubarak] Before the outbreak of the hostilities, it would  have been possible to help bridge the differences of opinion  between North and South Yemen. I also tried to do this. But  the distrust on both sides was too great. What is happening now  is an inner-Yemeni affair. I do not want to interfere.    [DER SPIEGEL] Then this would be another example of the  Arabs' inability to solve their conflicts themselves?    [Mubarak] What answer am I supposed to give you? The Arabs  were also unable to solve the problem between Iraq and Kuwait.    [DER SPIEGEL] What is going to happen in Yemen? Will the  fighting go on until one of the opponents is vanquished?    [Mubarak] The fighting might take years -- topography  permits this. Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih from the north were  to conquer Aden, this would by no means be the end of the war.  Only negotiations with the help of a third country are a way  out. However, I do not rule out that certain pressure groups  might try to add fuel to the flames.    [DER SPIEGEL] According to various reports, Saudi Arabia is  said to have sent tanks to South Yemen.    [Mubarak] They would be seen. These are unconfirmed rumors.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would it not be better if North and South  Yemen were to part again instead of forming a coercive unit?    [Mubarak] The war seems to confirm this. The north wants to  preserve the unity of the state at all costs, while the south  has other ideas -- I do not want to be an arbiter here. The  Yemeni people have to decide on it themselves.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, the ceremony on the occasion  of the signing of the Palestinian autonomy agreement before  2,500 guests from all over the world was a success for you. And  you were probably relieved that there were no incidents,  although Islamic terrorists are giving you trouble.    [Mubarak] I reject the term "Islamic." All of them are  criminals. Most of them are not versed in Islam at all...    [DER SPIEGEL, interrupting] ... but that is what they call  themselves...    [Mubarak, interrupting] ... they have nothing to do with  Islam, they violate all Islamic rules. They murder innocent  people, steal, and do things that are not permitted by any  religion in the world. The motive of these terrorist gangs is  not Islam, but simply money. They are financed from abroad, we  can prove this.    [DER SPIEGEL] The money probably comes from Iran?    [Mubarak] Well, from Iran, too. In addition, however, there  are several well-to-do private persons who make large sums  available to these criminals, for example, via a bank in Italy.  I had better not enter into details, the investigations are in  progress.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do police measures suffice to cope with  religiously embellished terror or should one not also deal  politically with the militant Islamists?    [Mubarak] I know very well what it means to mix religion  with politics. The Islamists are interested in power,  influence, and money. As long as I am the president, religion  and the state will be separated. We have been familiar with the  dealings of the Islamic politicians since 1928.    [DER SPIEGEL] Since the founding of the militant "Muslim  Brotherhood." Is it still so dangerous?    [Mubarak] This is an illegal organization that is behind  most of the activities of the religious troublemakers. Have a  look at what happened in Algeria. I advised the former  president not to permit any religious parties. He flung my  advice to the winds. Now Algeria is in trouble.    [DER SPIEGEL] How do you want to cope with the phenomenon of  Islamic terrorists?    [Mubarak] There is terrorism everywhere -- in the United  States, England, Turkey, and formerly also in Germany. The  world is full of terrorism. Why are the media concentrating  just on Egypt, where these terrorists have done relatively  little damage, as compared to other countries? Egypt is still  one of the safest countries in the world.    [DER SPIEGEL] After all, these terrorists have hit Egypt's  tourism hard and caused your country great financial damage.    [Mubarak] Travel around in the country, tourism is beginning  to be revived everywhere. No, I am not alarmed and I am banking  on it that there will soon be real peace in our region, the  peoples' living standard will be raised, and there will no  longer be any conspiracies.    [DER SPIEGEL] This seems to be an Arab fairy tale.    [Mubarak] This is not a dream, but my deeply felt wish. But  I also know what the Koran says: "The soul is inclined toward  evil -- unless My Lord has mercy on it."    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, thank you for this interview.</p>

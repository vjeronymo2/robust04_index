			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORKERS WON'T MOVE;  </P> <P> FIRMS FIND BIG CITIES A HARD SELL  </P> <P> Big city life has lost its allure for some people. And big business is paying  dearly to change their minds.  </P> <P> The problem is not so much crime, pollution or traffic congestion. Rather,  people are turned off by a widening gap in the cost of living between the least  and most expensive U.S. cities. As a result, companies are giving some workers  big bonuses and tens of thousands of dollars in housing subsidies to persuade  them to move to such expensive areas as Southern California, the Bay area,  Boston and New York.  </P> <P> The trend has been downplayed partly because companies fear that discussing  special pay and housing deals might fuel dissension in the workplace. But the  growing cost gap is changing the way many companies do business as more  Americans resist relocating or demand to be well-compensated for moving to  cities where their housing expenses, income taxes and other expenses might  triple or quadruple.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Put at $15 Billion  </P> <P> "There's not a single homeowner that we move here for less than $100,000," said  Catherine Morris, relocation manager for Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield  Co. Overall, U.S. employers spend more than $15 billion annually to relocate  workers, according to the Marriott Corp.  </P> <P> Even hefty financial incentives, however, sometimes fail to sway employees. Mel  Dinkel, a General Electric plant manager in Tampa, Fla., said he turned down a  transfer to Orange County -- despite pressure from his employer -- "because of  the horror stories about housing costs." He is now taking a careful look at a  new offer to move to Anaheim.  </P> <P> Relocation has become "a major problem for companies," said Harry Usher,  managing director of the Los Angeles office of Russell Reynolds Associates,  which recently completed a study on the issue. Some companies, he said, have  begun doing more local hiring or are setting up operations in lower-cost  locales to save money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Those Most Vulnerable  </P> <P> Perhaps hardest hit, though, are employees -- generally those making less than  $70,000 annually -- who are offered transfers but, unlike senior managers, are  given little in the way of financial help.  </P> <P> The growing regional cost gap is driven by skyrocketing prices in areas where  high-tech and service industries have blossomed, such as Boston, Raleigh, N.C.,  and California. Meanwhile, weak energy and food prices have depressed the local  economies of, among other places, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, keeping prices  there relatively low.  </P> <P> As recently as 1984, there was just a 29% difference in the overall cost of  living between the least and most expensive of 10 major U.S. cities. Today, the  spread is 50%, reports the consulting firm Runzheimer International. In Los  Angeles -- the survey's third-most expensive city behind Boston and New York --  a family of four spends $66,249 for housing, goods and services that cost just  $49,694 in 10th-ranked Houston.  </P> <P> The cost of living gap is most apparent in housing prices.  </P> <P> Since 1981, for example, the median price of a single-family detached home, or  townhouse, has risen 222% to $178,500 in Boston this year and jumped 181% to  $201,000 in Los Angeles, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. During  the same period, the median home price increased 60% to $73,800 in Kansas City  and actually declined 14% to $62,900 in Houston.  </P> <P> Ever-widening cost of living differences are forcing employers to grapple with  the additional issue of whether they should devise separate pay scales for  workers who perform the same jobs but live in different cities. To some extent,  such a pattern already appears to be emerging. For example, the average weekly  salary last year of a computer systems analyst was $804.50 in Los Angeles  versus $740 in Atlanta, reports the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widening Disparities Seen  </P> <P> Many analysts expect such salary differences to grow as more companies adopt  regional pay systems. But for now, the federal government appears to be taking  the lead. In June, the government announced 20% raises for air traffic  controllers in New York, Chicago, Oakland and Los Angeles because of the high  cost of living in the four areas. The government also says it may abandon its  uniform pay system for its 1.4 million white-collar employees in favor of one  that reflects regional economic patterns.  </P> <P> Throughout most of the postwar era, the manufacturing-dominated U.S. economy  had kept the wages of most Americans -- even those at different income levels  -- rising at about the same pace, experts say. Consequently, price differences  for housing, goods and services were comparatively small from region to region.  For the most part, high-cost areas were special cases, such as New York, Alaska  and Hawaii.  </P> <P> Moreover, employee transfers did not become an important business issue until  the mid-1960s, around when a few companies set up the Employment Relocation  Council to address concerns about buying and selling employees' homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burden on Families  </P> <P> Today, U.S. workers are under pressure to move as a result of corporate mergers  and relocations by nimble-footed service industries, said Dennis J. Donovan, a  senior vice president at the New York consulting firm Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer.  In the face of that pressure, however, the rise in two-earner families and  regional cost of living differences have consorted to make families  increasingly unwilling to pack their bags.  </P> <P> "The availability of qualified labor is the paramount issue facing American  business as it enters the 1990s, in part, because of cost of living differences  workers face," said Donovan. Suddenly "more companies are offering cost of  living adjustments, housing subsidies and raising their pay scales."  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield, for example, pays as much as 25% of a new employee's or  transferee's monthly mortgage for up to five years. And the company will pay  the subsidy on mortgages up to $200,000. ARCO also provides interest-free loans  to finance up to 20% of the down payment on the new home as well as one-time  bonuses equal to one month of the employee's annual pay.  </P> <P> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York pays a monthly stipend based on a  complicated formula that takes into account family size and salary, according  to Carol Cerreta, a personnel assistant at Morgan.  </P> <P> For instance, a single homeowner, making $100,000 in Morgan's Wilmington, Del.,  offices would receive a lump-sum payment of at least $5,000 as well as $1,718  in monthly housing subsidies for up to two years if he were transferred to New  York. The bank also pays, among other things, closing costs on the purchase of  a new home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Impact on Cost Gap  </P> <P> But many employees complain that the subsidies do not come close to closing the  cost gap.  </P> <P> A 39-year-old administrator who left a $50,000-a-year hospital post in the  Southwest to take an $80,000-a-year position at National Medical Enterprises in  Los Angeles said he suffered a big change in his standard of living, despite  receiving financial assistance.  </P> <P> "I thought I was prepared for the price difference," said the administrator,  who requested to remain anonymous. "But what I envisioned and what I actually  got was quite a shock."  </P> <P> The administrator, who said he sold his former 3,800 square-foot, four-bedroom  home for $125,000, had to negotiate an interest-free 90-day loan and a mortgage  loan interest rate subsidy from his new employer to buy a home in Los Angeles.  Even so, he said he had to pay $250,000 for the house, which has three  bedrooms, 2,100 square feet of space and is located farther from his job than  his previous home. His utility costs are lower in Los Angeles but he said his  property taxes and car insurance rates have more than doubled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shocked at Prices  </P> <P> Likewise, after Tampa plant manager Dinkel went on a house hunting trip near  Anaheim, he was shocked by the huge difference in housing prices.  </P> <P> "We looked all over within an hour's drive of Anaheim," said Dinkel, who has  been asked to become manager of GE's Anaheim facility. "From what I've been  able to see now, they would have to at least double my salary, along with a  lump-sum bonus to cover the down payment" for a new house.  </P> <P> Yet while highly paid managers and executives can get such special deals from  employers, the burden of coping with the cost gap falls harder on lower-paid  professional and technical workers such as nurses, insurance actuaries and  engineers, because many companies will not fully compensate them to relocate.  </P> <P> "If they are not at the management level or above, we would not use any of the  incentives to lure them," said Alan Ewalt, senior vice president of human  resources at National Medical Enterprises. For such employees, Ewalt said,  "it's too expensive for us to apply a relocation package" that ordinarily would  equal an employee's base salary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Older Workers Resisting  </P> <P> Younger workers may swallow the loss and make the move in the interest of their  careers, experts say, but many older workers are refusing -- forcing companies  to consider relocating their offices or establishing training programs so they  can hire locally.  </P> <P> A survey by the Employee Relocation Council this year found that 40% of the  nation's 600 largest companies had some problems with employees who are  reluctant to relocate. The high cost of housing was cited as the No. 1 reason.  </P> <P> Even young workers who are willing to move for a job seem increasingly  interested in heading to less expensive communities. Among MBA graduates at the  University of Virginia's Colgate Darden business school, for instance, just 15%  accepted jobs in New York this year, compared to 27% in 1987, said Nevin  Kessler, Darden's associate director of placement.  </P> <P> "We are seeing a dramatic shift in preference from metro areas students feel  are too expensive to areas where they feel they can obtain a standard of living  that meets their need," Kessler said.  </P> <P> A case in point is Ty Eggemeyer, one of the newly minted MBAs from the  University of Virginia. After graduating, Eggemeyer turned down a Boston job  paying more than $55,000 and accepted a lower paying position at the Dallas  offices of the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. Inc.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boston Firm No Match  </P> <P> The Boston firm, he explained, "would have had to pay me 50% more for me to  have a standard of living comparable to what I'll have in Dallas."  </P> <P> When companies use financial incentives to lure workers, the extra compensation  for new employees often angers other longtime company workers.  </P> <P> "It's a terrible negative" in terms of worker morale, said Wayne L. Wright, a  former vice president of human resource for Nissan Motor Manufacturing in  Tennessee who is now an employee relations consultant at the Center for Values  Research in Dallas. Among some of his clients, he said, the gap in total  compensation -- mainly salary and signing bonuses -- between old and newly  hired relocated workers performing the same job approaches 20% or more.  </P> <P> Nearly all companies try to disguise or limit special compensation by ending  such benefits after a period of one to five years or by separating special  housing payments or bonuses from an employee's salary. Still, many workers are  resentful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Now Where's My Raise?'  </P> <P> "The work force is made up of conformists," Wright said, "and they don't  understand this sudden need for signing bonuses for people who have never done  an hour's work for the company. The natural response is: 'Well, that's fine for  them, now where's my raise?' "  </P> <P> Special pay for new employees is only "a stopgap measure," said Wright, who  questions whether any amount of money will be able to adequately compensate  workers to move to areas such as Los Angeles. "All the (data) I've looked at  say the problem is going to get a lot worse before it gets better."  </P> <P> Staff writer Maria La Ganga in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

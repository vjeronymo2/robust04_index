			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A DAY split into two distinct halves saw the futures market reach a new all-time high only to end the day in ignominious retreat, writes Christopher Price. The opening of trading on the March FT-SE future contract was dominated by hopes of a cut in German interest rates at the Bundesbank meeting tomorrow. March, which opened at 2,882, moved smartly forward on the speculation, which raised hopes for a further easing of UK rates. Strong short sterling and firm gilts also combined to squeeze March higher through a busy morning period, before the contract reached an historical high of 2,898 around midday. However, the mood changed for the afternoon when the European interest rate markets weakened and the German rate cut hopes diminished. A leading US house led the way, selling the future down, helped by rumours of a large rights issue from BP. By late afternoon, March had dropped to 2,850, its low of the day, before rallying at the close to finish at 2,856, a 10-point premium to its fair value of around 15. Volume was a credible 9,549 contracts. Volume was also healthy in the options market, where 33,322 contracts were traded, of which the FT-SE 100 contract was responsible for 9,339 lots. Marks and Spencer was the top traded stock option at 1,332, followed by Blue Circle at 1,324.</p>

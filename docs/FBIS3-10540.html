Therefore, Central  American and Caribbean exports will be at a disadvantage,  particularly with regard to textiles and apparel.    Second, as a result of NAFTA, greater investment will be  channeled to Mexico, particularly with regard to the  establishment of U.S. assembly plants and textile industries.  These will prefer to set up shop in Mexico, not only because  labor is cheap, but also because of the proximity of the U.S.  market and the advantages NAFTA offers to the investors of the  three signatory nations, Canada, the United States, and Mexico.    According to an analysis of NAFTA's impact in Central  America, drawn up by Kathleen Horkan that in turn was  distributed by the U.S. Embassy's Information and Cultural  Service, in the sugar sector, for example, Central America could  lose its competitiveness in the medium term as it will have to  compete with Mexico on the U.S. market. Another problem pointed  out in the analysis is that Central American sugar exports could  face greater restrictions on the Mexican market due to Mexico's  promise to protect the levels of sugar exported from the United  States.    The textile and apparel sectors that represent one-fourth of  the region's exports to the United States will also be adversely  affected. Horkan points out that NAFTA will reduce the tariffs  in the textile sector for Mexico; thereby threatening Caribbean  and Central American competition in exports. "Another problem  is that Central America could lose the opportunity of foreign  investment in this sector as Mexico will attract greater  investment as a result of NAFTA," the analyst states.    Likewise, the Inter-American Institute of Cooperation for  Agriculture [IICA] recently published a study on the effects of  NAFTA on Central American agricultural exports to the United  States. The study concludes that in three specific cases --  cucumbers, pineapples, and melons-cantaloupes -- there is risk  in the short term that the Central American exports will be  replaced by Mexican exports as a result of NAFTA.    Nevertheless, the IICA study indicates that 82 percent of  the  Central American agricultural exports to the United States in  1991 correspond to products for which Mexico currently does not  pay import tariffs to the United States. Therefore, more than  four-fifths of Central American exports will continue to compete  under the same conditions with Mexican products, even after  NAFTA's implementation.    The Federation of Private Enterprises of Central America and  Panama, an organization that represent the business interests in  the region, supports NAFTA. Nevertheless, it believes that "it  will produce major detours of investments and trade: investments  that would have come to the region, now however these will go to  Mexico..."    The regional institution indicates in an analysis that the  Caribbean Basin nations would lose because Mexico would have the  opportunity to export the same products free of import tariffs.</p>

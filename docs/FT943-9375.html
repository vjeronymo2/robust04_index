			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Watchdog halts trading in BPA Portugal's securities exchange commission (CMVM) yesterday suspended shares in Banco Portugues do Atlantico amid heavy buying attributed to core shareholders defending the bank from a hostile bid by Banco Comercial Portugues. A group of 13 Portuguese companies, BPA's core shareholders, are believed to have bought up to 2m shares over the past few days, increasing their stake from 27.4 per cent to more than 29 per cent. BCP, Portugal's fifth largest bank, is offering Es132bn (Dollars 821m) for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of BPA, the country's second biggest. BPA shares were quoted at Es2,650 before the CMVM suspended trading indefinitely. They had gained 31.8 per cent since BCP announced its cash offer of Es3,000 a share on July 26. Dealers said the main sellers were investment funds and small shareholders. The executive board at BPA, on which the core shareholders are not represented, has formally rejected BCP's offer. The CMVM did not specify its reasons for suspending BPA shares but dealers said the move had been expected.</p>

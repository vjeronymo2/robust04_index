			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TO HENNING;  </P> <P> NFL: MINI-CAMP IS A TIME TO THINK GOOD THOUGHTS, AND THE CHARGER COACH SAID A  NUMBER OF PLAYERS HAVE GIVEN HIM REASON TO DO SO.  </P> <P> Dan Henning completed his second mini-camp as Charger coach Friday under gray  skies but with a sunny outlook.  </P> <P> These are the times for a football team when the glass always is half full.  </P> <P> With no pads, no summer heat and the first cut-down day weeks away, mini-camps  can be love-ins for the coaches and players. And with the start of the regular  season 17 weeks away, there is ample room for optimism.  </P> <P> It is time to forget about the 6-10 record of last year and concentrate on new  players and the promise of improvement from the returning veterans.  </P> <P> In keeping in that spirit, here are some players, particularly new ones, who  caught Henning's eye this week.  </P> <P> A word of caution: The bloom of mini-camp quickly can wilt in the heat of  training camp.  </P> <P>  -- Junior Seau, first-round inside linebacker from USC: Henning's first  impression is that Seau is as advertised.  </P> <P> "I couldn't tell if Junior was going harder than anyone else or whether no one  was blocking him," Henning said.  </P> <P>  -- Jeff Mills, third-round outside linebacker from Nebraska: Although he left  mini-camp a couple of days early to attend to personal business in New Jersey,  Mills made an impression when he was here. His value increased when David  Brandon was lost for the season with a knee injury Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I'm kind of glad we (drafted him) when we did," Henning said. "It wasn't in a  particular heavy need area, but we didn't feel like there was anyone close to  him when we took him, and it became a real good pick for us."  </P> <P>  -- Donald Frank, free-agent cornerback from Winston-Salem: Frank has impressed  Henning, particularly with his speed. He was one of the four fastest players  during 40-yard dash timing Wednesday. Best yet, he plays a position at which  the Chargers need depth.  </P> <P> "He is big and fast and strong," Henning said. "He can run; he closes.  </P> <P> "If he is the real thing, if he is what he showed out here on a regular basis  in camp, he could be better than any guy at that position other than (returning  starters Sam) Seale and (Gill) Byrd."  </P> <P>  -- Derrick Walker, sixth-round tight end from Michigan: Knee surgery as a  freshman made Walker somewhat of a medical risk, but Henning said the Chargers  took him when they were assured that concern was more a matter of how long he  could play on a reconstructed knee than Walker's ability to compete in the NFL.  Known for his blocking, Walker impressed Henning with his pass-catching.  </P> <P> "Now, I'm anxious to see him in pads," Henning said.  </P> <P>  -- Walter Wilson, third-round wide receiver from East Carolina: A sprained  ankle Thursday cut his mini-camp short, but Henning said he liked what he saw  after Wilson got a slow start.  </P> <P> "Walter Wilson showed enough this week to show he can be a legitimate player at  wide receiver in this league."  </P> <P>  -- Leo Goeas, third-round offensive tackle from Hawaii: Goeas was taken  highest among five offensive linemen drafted by the Chargers. He might not be  ready to challenge the starters, but Henning sees a good future.  </P> <P> "He certainly is big enough, strong enough, smart enough," Henning said.  </P> <P>  -- Craig McEwen, fourth-year H-back acquired as a free agent late last season:  McEwen joined the team before the 13th game in 1989 and caught five passes in  the final game. He was with Henning when Henning was an assistant at  Washington.  </P> <P> "Maybe he was not ready for prime time then," Henning said. "But he has shown a  real veteran, positive approach to the position here. He is an outstanding  receiver, he does the smart things blocking, and he makes great adjustments."  </P> <P> This is but a partial list of those singled out for attention during Henning's  mini-camp wrap-up. With 89 players on the roster, there was no shortage of  candidates to praise.  </P> <P> But that is not to say all is well. Henning did find at least one area for  concern: A run of minor injuries among the nine wide receivers cut the number  available to practice, and Henning said depth needed to be added at that  position before training camp. One possible move, he said, was to switch  running back J.J. Flannigan, an eighth-round draft choice from Colorado, to  receiver.  </P> <P> The team now moves into informal workouts starting Monday and lasting until  June 13. That will be followed by a break before the start of training camp  July 21. Veterans will report a week later.  </P> <P> Although the next month is voluntary, Henning said he expects most players to  attend most of the sessions, and he had a warning for those who don't.  </P> <P> "Those players know what my attitude is to that: They better be damn good,"  Henning said. "The young guys, rookies and free agents who take liberties, then  they are not what we're looking for because they can't compete in training camp  without a full dose. There is also a tendency for some (veterans) to  over-handicap themselves and think they have it made, and that isn't looked  upon well."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> The only two players who did not show for any part of the six-day mini-camp  were inside linebacker Cedric Figaro and outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal.  Figaro was back at Notre Dame taking classes and O'Neal elected not to come  because he is a free agent. . . . The next few months will be busy for General  Manager Bobby Beathard. The Chargers have 31 unsigned players, including 17  draft choices and 14 free agents.  </P></p>

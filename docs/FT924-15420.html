			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / DTI to seek responses on debt delays THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is shortly to issue a public consultation document on a requirement for companies to publish in their accounts how promptly they pay their bills. The document comes in response to comments in the March Budget speech in which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, promised action to reduce late payment for small businesses. It follows growing concern from small businesses that they are facing severe financial difficulties because larger companies are delaying payments for several months to conserve their own cash. Officials are expecting a paper to be ready for circulation within weeks, examining options on how to provide the data and where it should be published. They are keen to strike a balance between the provision of information and a concern that its preparation should not be too demanding. Calls for action on late payment of debts are likely to be renewed at this week's Tory conference. The government has come under considerable pressure to bring forward such legislation, but is not convinced that new offences and litigation offer a way forward. Ministers will undertake to look further at possible solutions once results are available from three pilot projects on dealing with late payment, and after the publication of an overdue European Community consultation paper on the issue, expected in January. Mr Lamont said in his Budget speech that the government planned to amend the 1985 Companies Act to require large companies to state in their annual reports and accounts how quickly they pay their bills. The aim was to introduce the legislation during the current session of parliament, subject to the outcome of consultation. Mr Lamont emphasised that government departments were taking commitments to prompt payment seriously, and would require that their prime contractors to pay sub-contractors normally within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice. The DTI has recently made grants as promised in the Budget to three trade organisations to run one-year pilot programmes such as telephone hotlines to help cope with late-payment difficulties.</p>

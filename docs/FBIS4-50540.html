			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong] </F>   [Text] Four Shanghai magazine editors have been repeatedly  harassed by security officials for the past month apparently to  curb "reactionary" activities in the run-up to the fifth  anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen bloody crackdown.    They are poet Chen Dongdong, writer Sun Ganlu, and scholars  Chen Zishan and Zhu Dake. All are editors of the cultural  magazine Tendency Quarterly, founded in the United States and  Hong Kong in November.    Chinese authorities have been keeping a close eye on the  quarterly which was founded by Bei Ling, an American-based  Chinese poet who took part in the famed Democracy Wall movement  in the late 1970s.    Mr Bei was reportedly interrogated repeatedly by police and  state-security agents in Shanghai and Shenzhen in January for  publishing an "illegal journal" when he was about to return to  the U.S.    One thousand copies of the first issue of Tendency  Quarterly,  carried by Mr Bei then, were seized by the Shenzhen authorities.    The quarterly has five mainland editors. The fifth, Meng  Lang, left Shanghai in February. Mr Meng had been detained for  two months by the Shanghai public security in 1992.    Mr Chen told the South China Morning Post that he had been  interrogated six times by the Shanghai police since mid-April  for his involvement in Tendency Quarterly.    "The interrogation usually lasted a few hours. And this was  very troublesome," Mr Chen said, adding that not only were the  editors questioned but also the contributors to the magazine.    "(The police) said that the Shenzhen authorities asked them  to learn more about the magazine. They suggested that the  magazine was liaising with the democracy movement in the West.    "But I told them this was not the case. They refused to  believe me," Mr Chen said.    Speaking from Boston, Mr Bei said he was worried about the  situation of the Shanghai-based editors, particularly Mr Chen  who apparently had been questioned the most often.    "He sounded desperate the last time I talked to him.    "And Mr Sun was also deeply worried, fearing that his work  as  a contracted professional writer of the official Shanghai  Writers' Association would be jeopardized," Mr Bei said.    He said his parents in Beijing were recently questioned by  the police. "This was the first time in years that they had  done such things. They asked them what I had been doing during  my stay in Beijing during the end of 1993 and early 1994," he  said.    He contended that the Chinese authorities, by intimidating  these people, wanted to curb "reactionary" activities before the  anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen crackdown.    "(China) also wants to show the international community,  especially the Americans, that China is not afraid of the  pressure they have been trying to exert on it," Mr Bei said.    "I understand it is a sensitive magazine since a number of  dissident writers are involved. But until now, no mainland  editors have asked to resign," he said.    The second issue of Tendency Quarterly -- partly funded by  an  American foundation and with a board of editors consisting of  writers in the U.S., Hong Kong and China -- is expected to be  published next month. Mr Bei said that it would carry details  of the harassment.</p>

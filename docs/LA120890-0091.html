			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRST THE PAIN, THEN THE GAIN;  </P> <P> OCHOA'S SELFLESS MOVE UP IN CLASS A KEY IN MOORPARK'S BID FOR STATE WRESTLING  TITLE  </P> <P> Delfino Ochoa had defeated some devilishly tough wrestlers, but now he was  grappling with demons of another sort.  </P> <P> It was the day of the 1989 Southern California regional, and Ochoa, then a  Moorpark College freshman, was in hiding -- from his coach and the pain that  pierced him like St. Sebastian's arrows.  </P> <P> Ochoa had wrestled in pain throughout the season. The small finger of his left  hand came out of socket at least a half-dozen times, and his knee cartilage was  so seriously torn it would require surgery.  </P> <P> But this was too much. The pain of trying to drop four pounds in a matter of  hours to meet his 118-pound limit was becoming too much to bear.  </P> <P> Ochoa, craving food or a drink, was wearing three pairs of socks and two  plastic suits covered by a sweat shirt and a jacket.  </P> <P> Finally, Ochoa lay down on the soothingly cool tile of the shower-room floor.  That eased his feverish burning, but the shower heads were mocking him.  </P> <P> "I broke," Ochoa said.  </P> <P> In John Keever's 21 years as coach, only one Moorpark College wrestler had ever  missed weight. Now Ochoa was missing altogether. Missing weight no longer  mattered to Ochoa. He was quitting then and there. The sacrifice just was not  worth it anymore.  </P> <P> Eventually Keever tracked down Ochoa and urged him not to give up. Ochoa's  teammates and coaches goaded him back into motion. He made weight with minutes  to spare.  </P> <P> "You've got to be strong up here," Ochoa said, pointing to his head. "That day  I just snapped because you're going through all this pain to make the weight."  </P> <P> Ochoa finished second in that regional and since then has endured fewer  tribulations making weight. He went on to win the state title at 118. He enters  the final rounds of the state tournament today at Cypress College ranked No. 1  in the 126-pound division, a key to top-ranked Moorpark's bid for its first  team championship.  </P> <P> Ochoa beat Darren Uyematsu of El Camino, 9-2, in the second round Friday to  improve his record to 30-4-1. He will meet Brandon Keosky of Cuesta in the  semifinals today.  </P> <P> Ochoa has succeeded despite moving up a weight class and competing with an  injury to his left arch that has left him limping. Wrestling at 126 pounds, he  watches his diet less and his back more.  </P> <P> "I can't get lazy," Ochoa said. "I can't get lackadaisical. A lot of the guys  are just massive. When I walk out there, it's like David and Goliath. . . . I'm  just quicker on my feet than they are."  </P> <P> Ochoa would have been a strong favorite for a second consecutive title at 118  pounds, but Keever believed moving Ochoa up in weight would help the team even  if Ochoa did not win an individual title at 126.  </P> <P> Keever wanted to switch Ochoa and Billy Scannell, who wrestled at 126 last  season, on the theory that the slighter Scannell would do markedly better at  118 and Ochoa would hold his own at 126. Scannell is ranked No. 2 at 118.  </P> <P> Ochoa not only gave up a chance to repeat at 118 but also moved into the domain  of bigger and stronger wrestlers, including Orlando Montero of Cerritos, the  defending state champion at 126.  </P> <P> "He made a big-time sacrifice for our team," Keever said.  </P> <P> It was a move at which others might have balked, but Ochoa said: "It benefits  the team more."  </P> <P> At 5-foot-3 and 126 pounds, Ochoa is relatively stocky for a wrestler in a  lower-weight class. Although he gives up height to his opponents, he holds his  own in strength and has bench-pressed more than 300 pounds.  </P> <P> If Ochoa makes a good showing at 126 pounds, Keever believes that will make him  even more attractive to four-year colleges as a 118-pounder. However, going  back to 118 will be a painful move for a guy whose weight fluctuates between  137 and 140 in the off-season.  </P> <P> "I like food. I love eating," said Ochoa, who has figured out that he loses a  pound and a half every night in his sleep.  </P> <P> "Brownies, burritos, Chinese food," Ochoa says wistfully as he lists his  favorites. "Basically, I like junk food."  </P> <P> Coaches discourage roller-coaster weight swings, but living at home presents  Ochoa with the nearly irresistible temptation of his mother's cooking. Keever's  lectures on proper eating habits give Ochoa food for thought, but he still  thinks a lot about food.  </P> <P> Had Ochoa disregarded the advice of his father and Keever and not continued  wrestling, he could eat all the food he wanted. After graduating from Hueneme  High, Ochoa planned to work, but his father was pushing him to go to college  and Keever was recruiting him.  </P> <P> At Hueneme, Ochoa won three Channel League wrestling championships and was a  classmate of Freddie Bradley, the standout tailback on Moorpark's football  team.  </P> <P> "I was always the smallest one in school," Ochoa said. "My freshman year,  people used to pick on me, and Fred would be there saying, 'Hey, leave him  alone'. . . . I'd be right behind Fred just saying, 'Yeah, leave me alone.' "  </P> <P> If Bradley is the big man on the Moorpark campus, then Ochoa is the big little  man on campus. That's fine with Keever, who believes he would have lost Ochoa  to another sport if Ochoa were taller.  </P> <P> "I wanted to play basketball," Ochoa said. "When I got to high school,  everybody just sprouted, and I was still the same size. I went out for the  freshman team, and every time I tried to shoot, somebody just swatted it."  </P> <P> Ochoa might not be a Spud Webb, but he is one of the best athletes at Moorpark.  </P> <P> Chances are he will not be found lying on the shower-room floor today, but  don't be surprised if he sends an opponent to an early shower.  </P></p>

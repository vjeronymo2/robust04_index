			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Lord Franks: academic and veteran of many committees - Obituary LORD FRANKS, who died this week at the age of 87, was one of the few remaining British figures whose career spanned the Second World War and the post-war reconstruction and who was still active in the 1980s - when he headed the review committee into British policy towards the Falkland Islands. There was a time when no senior committee of inquiry could be formed without thinking of the possibility of Franks as chairman. His name also came up whenever a top public job was on offer - whether director-general of the BBC, secretary general of Nato, or the governorship of the Bank of England. Yet in spite of this pre-eminence in the world of affairs, he spent much of his time in universities. Oliver Franks was born in 1905, the son of a clergyman. The protestant influence perhaps never left him. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School and Queen's College, Oxford, where he became a fellow in philosophy. Academe might have held him for the rest of his life - he had spells at the universities of Chicago and Glasgow - had it not been for the outbreak of war. Franks was summoned to the Ministry of Supply and by 1945 was the permanent secretary there. After the war he became provost of Queen's, but the call of public life was never far away. Franks was active in the work that led to the formation of what is now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In 1948 he was appointed British ambassador to Washington. In politics and life-style he was perhaps closer to Attlee than Churchill and in 1952 he returned to London where he became chairman of Lloyds Bank. It is for his chairmanship of committees that he will be mostly remembered. When the future of higher education was under scrutiny, Franks chaired an unofficial committee on Oxford which recommended widespread reforms and even considered the radical possibility of turning Oxford and Cambridge into entirely postgraduate institutions. In the early 1970s, he led the committee on the Official Secrets Act which came down in favour of limiting secrecy and introducing a freedom of information act. The latter has not yet been implemented. From 1962 to 1976, Franks was provost of Worcester College Oxford. Shortly before he took up the post, he had stood for the chancellorship of the university and in a famous election lost to Harold Macmillan. It was said that Macmillan would have been happy to reward him with the governorship of the Bank of England. Figures like Franks - in so far as there were very many of them - were thought to have gone out under the premiership of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who disliked royal commissions and anything like them. Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the Falklands war it was to Franks that Mrs Thatcher turned for an investigation of the events that led up to it. He produced a masterpiece of Civil Service prose which, closely read, was much more damning of British conduct than was generally realised. It is probably true that there is unlikely to be a public figure like Franks again.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Prudential statement awaited THE gathering on Monday of at least 100 top UK fund managers for the unveiling of the restated 1990 and 1991 accounts of Prudential Corporation, one of the leading UK insurance institutions, was foreshadowed yesterday by a sharp rise in Prudential shares. In a generally strong equity market, the shares closed 6 1/2 higher at 278 1/2 p on turnover of 5.5m. Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential's chief executive, is expected to reveal a big increase in Prudential's profits for 1990 and 1991 which have been recalculated on the 'accruals method of accounting. There was general agreement that anything less than a doubling of life profits under the new accounting process would be disappointing. For 1990, Prudential reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 244m and for 1991, Pounds 267m. The move to accruals accounting among insurers has developed since Pearl Assurance, the UK life company, was taken over by Australian Mutual Provident, a strike which frightened the whole of the sector. Life sector analysts are divided over outlook for Prudential shares after the details are announced on Monday. Kleinwort Benson is cautious and has told clients to reduce overweight holdings, noting that the shares have performed this year and that there may be a sense of anti-climax and some profit-taking short-term . County NatWest highlighted the stock's outperformance but said it still offers good value. Mr John Marr at Charterhouse Tilney, was more aggressively bullish; 'The shares could go much higher, possibly over 300p; we think historic earnings will be more than doubled and also that Prudential will produce a chunk of life assets that wil pleasantly surprise the market. Steel hit again Badly-mauled British Steel suffered again yesterday in anticipation of a cut in profit forecast from a leading UK securities house. The 6 per cent fall in the shares was the biggest in percentage terms in the FT-SE 100 Index list; they closed 3 off at 47p, within a whisker of their all-time low, on turnover of 6m. Smith New Court analyst Mr Ian Lowe had planned to discuss Steel's prospects at the morning meeting but decided against it because he needed to do more work on the figures. However, the news that Smith was expected to produce bearish views leaked into the market and the shares were hit towards the close of trading. Mr Lowe confirmed that he would be increasing his loss forecast in the light of the recent announcement of plans to cut production by 20 per cent. He added that 'The shares are not being valued on any coherent grounds at the moment' and said he would be 'urging people to sell the shares on Monday.' Glaxo setback Shares in Glaxo turned sharply down yesterday afternoon as word reached the market of an article in the medical press believed to be highly critical of one of the company's leading drugs. The stock fell sharply after highlights of the article, on Glaxo's anti-nausea drug Zofran, were carried by an international newswire. Glaxo fell to 796p and closed 10 off at 799p with 5.2m traded. The article, in The Lancet, the premier UK medical journal, discussed perceived links with Zofran and chest pains. As a result of the reports and the fall in the share price, Glaxo published late yesterday a strongly worded rejection of The Lancet article. Analysts' reactions on The Lancet study ranged from caution to scepticism. Most pointed out that Glaxo had had a good run recently and traders were looking for excuses to take profits on the last day of the account. Publisher Dorling Kindersley came to the market on a high note. The flotation was six times oversubscribed and the shares which were issued at 165p began trading at 193p. They closed a further 20 higher at 213p. A series of profit downgrades left Standard Chartered the weakest of the big banking stocks. The shares closed 8 lower at 485p having been even lower during very early trading; turnover was 2.8m shares. County NatWest lowered its current year profits estimate from Pounds 220m to Pounds 175m. There was no let up in the takeover speculation surrounding Royal Insurance which jumped a further 10 to 225p on heavy turnover of 4.6m shares. The exploration and production sub-sector attracted a fresh bout of strong support, especially Enterprise Oil which raced up 14 more to 456p on higher than usual turnover of 2.2m. Dealers said the shares had lagged behind Lasmo and were in the process of catching up. Lasmo were barely changed at 176p. Blue Circle Industries (BCI), a strong market since news of the Tomkins' counter to Hanson's bid for RHM, jumped a further 5 to 167p, after 69p on heavy turnover of 5.2m shares. Dealers said relatively high turnover in BCI during the past two months had raised the possibility of a stakebuilder in the background. Lafarge Coppee, the French group was suggested as a predator. Magazine publisher Reed International rose 7 to 582p announcing new terms for the planned merger with Dutch publisher Elsevier. Analysts said the terms, which centre on Reed taking a stake of about 5.8 per cent in Elsevier, were good but slightly lower than market expectations of about 7 per cent. However, the market was still optimistic about the merger and also cheered by Reed's first half figures, which showed better-than-expected profit of Pounds 94m. Specialist magazine Euromoney was boosted 45 to 858p. SG Warburg has put the group on its buy list ahead of results on November 12. Smith New Court took a harsh view of its forecasts for Simon Engineering and metals group ASW Holdings (11 off at 50p). On Simon, the house cut its 1992 forecast by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 12m and the figure for next year by Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 17.5m. It also reduced its dividend estimate again. The shares tumbled 35 to 79p, the worst fall in the London market. Supermarket chain Marks &amp; Spencer eased 2 to 322p as Nomura cut back its forecast for 1993 by Pounds 30m to Pounds 730m and advised clients to take profits. Retailer Kingfisher slipped 11 to 532p on profit-taking and hints of a profit downgrade. The bought deal via which Sun Alliance disposed of a block of 60m shares in CU on September 18 was executed jointly by Smith New Court and Cazenove and not by Warburg and Cazenove as incorrectly stated in this column on Thursday.

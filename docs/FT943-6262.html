			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Brazil inflation plan setback Brazil's anti-inflation plan, launched in July, suffered its first serious setback yesterday when the government's main inflation index showed a smaller than expected fall. The index, the IPC-R, showed inflation at 5.46 per cent for the four weeks to August 15, compared to 6.08 per cent in the previous four-week period. The index appears to have remained high because of rent increases and a lower than expected drop in clothing prices. The government sought to play down the figure, claiming it contained 'one-off factors' and pointing out private sector indices showed monthly inflation has fallen to about 2 per cent. But the IPC-R is the main index the government uses to judge pay awards. The August figure will be used to attack Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former finance minister, who engineered the anti-inflation plan. He leads polls for October's presidential elections mainly because electors credit him with taming Brazil's inflation, which reached 50 per cent in the month before the plan's launch.</p>

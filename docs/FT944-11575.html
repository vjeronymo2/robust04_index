			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Definitely not post haste Privatisation is a great British product that has always sold better overseas than at home. While the policy was widely regarded as the pure essence of Thatcherism, Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, records in his memoirs that the lady herself was suspicious of it at first and feared that it would alienate floating voters. As for the word, she hated it; but nobody could come up with a mellifluous alternative. Public opinion, adds Lawson, was invariably hostile before every big privatisation. This puts the decision by Mr Major's government to abandon Post Office privatisation in context. It was clearly the narrowness of the Conservative majority rather than the intrinsic flaws of the proposal itself that put an end to this central piece of the government's legislative programme. Change is invariably painful. The conclusion of the Cold War may finally have done for state ownership as a respectable means of conducting big business, but privatisation retains its capacity to alienate and upset. As policy nostrums go, this one was always likely to become less effective over time because its scope is, by definition, finite. The state cannot transfer more to the private sector than it already owns. And by the last election about two-thirds of the formerly state-owned industries in Britain had been transferred to the private sector. In contrast deregulation will have an infinite policy shelf life if the volume of legislation continues to be used by politicians as a yardstick by which to measure their own achievement. There is thus a certain logic - though no historical inevitability - in the fact that the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act has usurped Post Office privatisation as the government's not-so-Big Idea for the next session of parliament. That is not to say that privatisation has no remaining fans. Executives of the residual state-owned industries yearn for the excuse that privatisation provides to lay a hand on remuneration packages to rival those enjoyed by the potentates of the water industry. Ministers can plop comfortably into the boardrooms of the enterprises they liberated from the Whitehall yoke. Productivity gains Nor is it the case that privatisation has nothing left to offer. Its achievements, though frequently misunderstood, are real enough. Yet paradoxically the most impressive productivity gains in privatised companies like British Steel and British Airways took place when the companies were still in the public sector. That tells us that the switch in ownership is not necessarily the key to improved performance. It is simply that important changes in industrial structure have been easier to bring about via a prospective or actual change of ownership; and the biggest successes of privatisation have come from the introduction of competition into hitherto protected markets, such as telecommunications. This is what makes the policy so popular with governments overseas. Infrastructure, whether roads, ports, railways or telecoms, are central to most economies and frequently run very inefficiently by the state. Removing the state's monopoly in the course of the privatisation process can create huge welfare gains, while the fiscal burden is simultaneously reduced. Price reductions If privatisation has not been a roaring popular success in the UK it is probably because the initial gainers, especially in the utility sector, have tended to be shareholders, rather than consumers. The scope for efficiency improvements and thus for price reductions was underestimated in the early stages of the process. In the case of the water companies, the need for substantially increased investment has resulted in big price rises. Elsewhere it is the shareholders who have been less fortunate. In Japan, those who subscribed for shares in the NTT telecom float lost fortunes, since the Ministry of Finance sought to wring the maximum proceeds from the sale as the stock market bubble of the late 1980s neared its peak. It is small wonder that the recent Japanese tobacco privatisation flopped. Even in the UK, where shareholders have been better treated, the government's subsidiary objective of popular capitalism has not been achieved. Private shareholders have tended to cash in their profits and sell to the big investment institutions. Privatisation has nonetheless become a lucrative source of invisible earnings for the UK, as the acquired expertise has been sold to foreign countries. Even the continental Europeans are adopting the practice, if in doctored form, with cross-shareholdings, restricted voting and other devices to pre-empt the discipline of takeovers. As for the discipline of bankruptcy, it remains to be seen how real it is. A government that flunks the Post Office test might balk at putting British Steel into receivership - especially if bankruptcy was the result of subsidised competition from unprivatised foreign firms. Past experience suggests that when governments confront politically-sensitive bankruptcies, a too-big-to-fail doctrine can triumph.</p>

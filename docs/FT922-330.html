			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Post-Maastricht risks 'Our central view is that the process of Maastricht ratification will be back on course by December. However, we assign a 40 per cent chance to Maastricht ratification stumbling and failing.' This is the view of the British branch of the Union Bank of Switzerland. It is not, however, just picked up from the pavements of Zurich. It is derived from a financial markets interpretation of the chances of a substantial Italian devaluation. This is now put at 40 per cent, having been 25 per cent earlier in the year, and about 15 per cent in mid-1991. The underlying assumption is that Italy is a sort of bell-wether. The idea is that on pure economic criteria Italy is a devaluation suspect. But if European economic and monetary union (Emu) goes ahead by 1997 or 1999, according to timetable, the process of convergence - and no doubt a helping hand from Germany - would avoid the need for a parity adjustment. In one sense the drive to Emu and the Maastricht Treaty have been a blow to monetary union, spelled in small letters. For until about the beginning of 1990, European interest rate differentials were falling and the realignment risks dwindling as a result of the natural developments of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Realignments were becoming fewer - the last one involving France and Germany had been in January 1987; and the process of policy convergence had been taken quite far at least among the core members of Germany, France and Benelux. Indeed a new study points out that, judged by many of the normal criteria for deciding whether countries form a natural monetary area or not, some of the non-EC countries, such as Austria and Sweden, are much more likely candidates than the outlying Mediterranean members of the EC.* The UK as usual lies awkwardly in between, neither quite in either category. In the past couple of years the political process has given an extra momentum to monetary convergence. But what the political process can do, it can also undo. So, while the ERM two and a half years ago appeared to be doing quite well, a sudden snap back to the state of affairs then would come as a shock to expectations. The June issue of the London Business School Economic Outlook discusses the implications of the greater Maastricht risks for British monetary policy. The problem is that doubts on Emu now throw some doubts on the ERM itself and reduce Britain's 'hard won investment' in the credibility of the DM 2.95 parity. This in turn may delay a further fall in British interest rates and in the worst case force an increase. There is thus a danger of a vicious circle in which the reduced credibility of the ERM link keeps up interest rates and delays economic recovery, which in turn stirs up further hostile debate, which further pushes up the required UK interest rate in a self-reinforcing process. The most constructive LBS suggestion is that the weakening of counterinflationary credibility following the Danish referendum should be offset both by a move to narrow the present 6 per cent ERM margins - which most people seem to expect before the Edinburgh summit in December - plus a move to an independent Bank of England. In other words, if a belt risks coming apart, it would be helpful to wear braces as well. The independent Bank would itself reduce market fears of a government in a corner dropping the ERM parity. Second, it offers some insurance against the possibility of the German counterinflationary anchor proving weak after all and would allow the UK to take the lead in Europe in such circumstances. Third, it is some insurance against a worst case scenario in which the ERM breaks up or a government takes Britain outside the system. The LBS goes into more detail about how an independent Bank might work than others have done. The Bank should be free to determine interest rate policy in the light of a low and stable medium term inflation rate objective. It should report annually to Parliament and perhaps more frequently on its open market operations. As a safeguard against political pressure, appointments should be made for extended terms, like the eight years specified for the proposed European Central Bank, with only limited possibility for dismissal. Indeed the more that proposals for an independent Bank of England are spelt out the more that Bank begins to look like a smaller version of a European Central Bank and less like the financial headmistress we know and love - or don't love. In the last resort the question is not whether we want a political federation but whether we want independent institutions to maintain sound currencies. *Is there a conflict between EC enlargement and European monetary unification?, T.

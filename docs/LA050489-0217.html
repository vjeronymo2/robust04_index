			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CONFERENCE OKS CHEMICAL SECRECY  </P> <P> An international conference today agreed to safeguard company secrets on  production of chemicals that harm the ozone layer, despite objections from  environmentalist groups.  </P> <P> The corporate secrecy issue caused fiery debate at the U.N.-sponsored meeting  reviewing the 1987 Montreal Protocol. The Montreal agreement, ratified by 36  countries, pledges drastic cuts in the production and use of  chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are blamed for breaking down the ozone  layer.  </P> <P> The secrecy resolution, put forward by the United States and the 12 nations of  the European Economic Community, won unanimous approval, delegates said.  </P> <P> Greenpeace delegate Karen Coulter said the environmental group feared that  greater secrecy could help countries hide the production of banned chemicals.  Under the Montreal Protocol, the signatory nations must report to the U.N.  Environmental Program on the production, consumption and trade in five  chlorofluorocarbons and three halon gases.  </P></p>

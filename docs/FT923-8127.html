			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ford injects Pounds 135m into Jaguar FORD MOTOR of the US has injected Pounds 135m in new equity capital into Jaguar as part of a financial restructuring of its troubled UK luxury car subsidiary. The recapitalisation, disclosed in Jaguar's annual report, has been forced by the size of the losses suffered by Jaguar in the last three years. In addition to injecting fresh equity Ford has also made substantial loans to Jaguar including Pounds 125.8m of long-term debt. Some of the loan facility was made as part of the process of Ford replacing commercial banks as Jaguar's banker as well as to provide additional working capital. The report shows, however, that loans from Ford have provided a net increase in funds of Pounds 88.5m in addition to the Pounds 135m of new equity. Ford paid Pounds 1.56bn for Jaguar in late 1989 and the capital restructuring has added significantly to that cost. Jaguar's pre-tax losses have accelerated since the takeover and totalled Pounds 226.1m in 1991 compared with a loss of Pounds 66.2m in 1990 and Pounds 58.3m in 1989. Ford disclosed recently that Jaguar suffered a continuing loss of about Dollars 70m (Pounds 36.6m) in the second quarter of 1992, virtually unchanged from a year ago. Its first quarter loss was reduced from Dollars 130m to Dollars 90m. Jaguar maintained virtually unchanged research and development expenditure last year of Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 54.9m), but the financial squeeze caused its capital spending to be cut sharply from Pounds 70m in 1990 to only Pounds 44.2m. The annual report discloses for the first time the financial impact of last year's heavy redundancy programme with an exceptional charge of Pounds 42.5m. The workforce was cut from 12,100 in 1990 to 8,015 at the end of last year and is now just under 8,000. Sales in the US and the UK, its two most important markets, plunged last year, causing production to be reduced to only 23,018 vehicles - the lowest level since 1982 - from 41,883 in 1990. Wholesale deliveries to dealers fell by 41 per cent to 24,597. In the first half Jaguar sales worldwide fell further, from 12,900 to 11,900. Production declined by 26 per cent to 10,259. There was some recovery in the US in the six months with sales rising by 10.8 per cent to 4,809 from last year's depressed level of 4,342 - although US sales in July fell sharply. Demand in the UK remained weak with a 15.2 per cent fall to 2,679. While sales and output have continued to fall, Jaguar has achieved a significant improvement in quality. In the recently published JD Power report in the US, one of the most authoritative studies of customer satisfaction in the world car industry, the company jumped to 10th place compared with 25th a year earlier.</p>

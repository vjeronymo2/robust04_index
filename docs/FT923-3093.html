			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Audit reform plan resisted THE GOVERNMENT should retain the requirement for small limited liability companies to be audited, the president of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said at the weekend. In an outspoken address to the annual conference of the association, which represents 30,000 accountants, Mr David Bishop called supporters of abolition of the smaller-company audit 'wrong, outdated in their thinking and nave.' Mr Bishop, who is a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said the audit provided protection for all those associated with a company and imposed disciplines that helped rather than hindered businesses. Earlier this year, the Department of Trade and Industry said it was considering lifting the requirement for small companies, possibly those below the Pounds 36,600 turnover VAT threshold. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants have been among the organisations since then that have lent support to reform of the existing system. They say it is costly, irrelevant and contradictory in its present form. However, the association, which has many members who perform audits on small companies, has always stood out against abolition and has been lobbying the government in the last few weeks for its retention.</p>

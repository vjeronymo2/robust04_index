			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Tories face growing pressure for poll on closer European ties Mr John Major was last night facing growing pressure to agree to a referendum on further European integration as Conservative leaders braced themselves for a heavy defeat in Thursday's Dudley West by-election. With another difficult week for the party in prospect, some pro-European Tories joined Eurosceptics in arguing that a referendum was becoming inevitable. A notable exception, however, was Mr Michael Portillo, the Eurosceptic employment secretary, who is seen by some as a future Tory leader. As Labour emphasised that it had 'an open mind' on the issue, Mr Portillo said a referendum would not be his 'first choice' for addressing Conservative divisions over Europe. Interviewed on BBC-TV's Breakfast with Frost, he said it would be better for ministers to put forward a European policy that would be 'much more Eurosceptical than in the rest of the continent'. But he acknowledged that a referendum might be 'a valuable way to heal the rift' because many Tories wanted one. As Mr Major used a Sunday newspaper article to accuse the eight Tory MPs who defied the government in a recent confidence vote of 'self-indulgence', a poll among voters in Dudley West suggested Labour would win the seat by a landslide. The survey for GMTV showed the Conservatives trailing Labour by nearly 45 percentage points ahead of Thursday's contest with the support of just 18.4 per cent of those questioned. The government could face another test on Wednesday in a Commons debate on fisheries policy, when a Labour amendment opposing any increase in Spanish fishing vessels in British waters may secure the support of some Tories. Senior ministers said they did not expect a snap decision on whether the government would offer a referendum on the next stage of European integration. Mr Portillo's antipathy - which will surprise some of his Eurosceptic allies on the Tory backbenches - is matched by still stronger opposition from pro- European cabinet ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. But cabinet colleagues confirmed that Mr Major was actively considering the idea as possibly the only way to unite the party around a package of British proposals for the 1996 EU intergovernmental conference. Some colleagues believe a commitment could come early next year if Mr Major's leadership remains under threat. One senior minister commented: 'The prime minister has not made up his mind but the (referendum) option is beginning to look inevitable.' This view appears to be shared by Mr Keith Hampson, the Tory MP for Leeds North West and one of Mr Heseltine's closest allies. Mr Hampson said yesterday that he thought 'probably the momentum has got to the stage where there has to be one'. Mr Tim Renton, the pro-European former Conservative chief whip, said autumn 1996 or spring 1997 would be the time when 'it would be right to consider having a referendum'. The prime minister appears determined not to bow to the separate demand of hardline sceptics that he should rule out now British participation in a single European currency. Speaking at the EU Essen summit, he endorsed the suggestion of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that a national debate on a single currency would be needed before any decision was taken. Mr Major, who is expected to brief MPs today on the Essen meeting, acknowledged that Britain was likely to be among the first countries meeting the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union. But he insisted there was no possibility of enough countries meeting the criteria before 1999. Keith Joseph obituary, Page 8 Editorial Comment and Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Swiss hold key to EC's transport policy: The Swiss have a vital decision to make on Sunday COMPARED with the French referendum on Maastricht, the run-up to this Sunday's six plebiscites in Switzerland is singularly lacking in drama. And it must be said that most of the issues, such as whether being a federal parliamentarian should be a full-time job, bore even the Swiss. But one of them, on the construction of two new high-speed rail lines through the country, will have a large and long-term impact on not only Switzerland's but also Europe's transport policy. The proposal, to invest a whopping SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.4bn) on two rail tunnels through the Alps and related infrastructure, was the Swiss government's counter-offer last year to its European neighbours who were fed up with the country's severe restrictions on lorry transit. Switzerland restricts lorry weights to 28 tonnes, whereas most trucks in the EC move with 40-tonne loads. Rather than lighten loads at the Swiss border, truckers prefer to travel through the Brenner pass in Austria or one of three passes between France and Italy. The result, to the increasing anger of the Austrians and French, is that Switzerland absorbs less than a fifth of north-south trans-Alpine freight tonnage. The Swiss insist that their narrow Alpine valleys cannot take much more lorry traffic, and last year they won EC agreement for their plan to build an efficient, high speed rail system for piggy-backing lorry loads through the country. Many hope that this approach will eventually be adopted more widely in Europe, easing the pressure on motorways and contributing to the overall reduction of air pollution. The plan has wide support in the centre of the political spectrum in Switzerland, even though the cost frightens many people. The government has warned that rejection would mean that Switzerland could no longer hold back the EC's 40 tonne juggernauts. But the Greens object because they say it only promotes the already excessive transport of goods between EC countries. On the right, the Automobile Party fears that all that spending on rail transport will take away from budgets for improving Swiss roads. The treaty between Switzerland and the EC that contains the tunnel proposal also includes a new airline agreement that would give Swissair rights similar to EC-based carriers in EC countries. And the campaign for acceptance has received a vigorous last minute boost this week from Swissair directors, who claim that it is vital for the airline's survival. Another referendum is on abolishing stamp duties on most securities transactions. In the past, Swiss ministers dismissed the banks' warnings that these duties were driving business abroad. But Swiss-controlled mutual funds based in Luxembourg totalled SFr179bn at the end of last year compared with only SFr34bn in Switzerland. And, for the first time in a decade, the number of people employed in banking declined. Now the government is calling for abolition and even the socialist party is divided and muted in its opposition.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Lukashov: "A Split Among the Tatar </F> National-Patriots; `Ittifak' Party Finds Itself With Two  Leaders"]    [Text] A meeting held in Kazan for leaders and  representatives of the rayon organizations of the "Ittifak"  party, which stands on extremely radical nationalist positions,  expressed mistrust of the leader and creator of this party,  Fauziye Bayramova.    The meeting resolution literally stated the following: "The  meeting participants have a critical attitude toward the  behavior of `Ittifak' Party Chairman Fauziya Bayramova, who  herself continually violates the party charter and personally  and singularly resolves questions of excluding unsuitable  members from the party ranks, dismissing governing board  members, etc. Using the deputy mandate of the RT [Republic of  Tatarstan], she has demanded special attention toward herself  and special working conditions. Her authoritarian dictate has  led to the disintegration of the party and to discord in  inter-ethnic relations in the RT."    In order to eliminate unrest, the meeting participants  adopted the decision "to convene an extraordinary congress of  the Tatar Party for National Independence [TPNN] `Irrifak' at  the end of March 1994, to be held in the city of Kazan..., and  to consider the participants of the said meeting as the  organizing committee for convening the above-mentioned  extraordinary session of the TPNN `Ittifak' under the  chairmanship of F. G. Zaynullina."    We must note that this measure was a logical continuation of  the conflict between Fauziya Bayramova and her former deputy  within the party, Flera Zaynullina. By Ms. Zaynullina's  admission, the conflict stems from personal interrelations:  "Bayramova always saw in me a political rival. But I do not need  anything--just happiness for my people..."    However, according to the unanimous opinion of local  observers, the real outcome of this conflict may only be the  split of "Ittifak" into two parties. Parties which differ (like  many others) not in their views, but in the names of their  leaders. We might add that in Tatarstan, according to  approximate accounts, there are more than 20 registered and  unregistered, small and very small parties and societies of  nationalistic persuasion. The conflict between the radical and  moderate wings of the All-Tatar Community Center (VTOTs)--the  largest political organization in Tatarstan which has given rise  to almost all the parties of nationalist persuasion--has also  not been resolved.    And while before we could speak of a national movement,  today  the split among the Tatar national-patriots is becoming ever  more apparent.</p>

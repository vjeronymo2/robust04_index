			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD  </P> <P> Shout loud enough and long enough, the old axiom goes, and you can sell the  people anything. That appears to be exactly what your editorial attempts.  </P> <P> The gist of your message is that the five-member Board of Supervisors must be  expanded to at least seven members, perhaps even nine. There was even a mention  of the need for an elected executive. Your reasoning is that it would provide  better representation.  </P> <P> May I suggest a lesson in history and another in civics? First, the history.  Four times schemes to expand the Board of Supervisors and/or to establish an  elected executive have been put before the voters. The measures were defeated  by the voters each time.  </P> <P> As a footnote to the history lesson: It just might be that the voters do not  view making government bigger as a panacea.  </P> <P> And now for the civics lesson.  </P> <P> If county government was the only local representation for 8-million-plus  people, then your call for more supervisors might have merit. But there are 86  elected city councils serving the vast majority of Los Angeles County  residents. It is these bodies who determine local zoning laws, levels of police  and fire protection, the amount of development, and many other vital issues  within their boundaries -- not the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> County government is an umbrella organization responsible for such countywide  areas as public health, mental health and welfare. There are added  responsibilities in law enforcement, prosecution and the judiciary.  </P> <P> DEANE DANA  </P> <P> Supervisor, Fourth District  </P> <P> Los Angeles County  </P></p>

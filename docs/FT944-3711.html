			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prosperity renews demand for gold Sir, Lex (December 6) concludes, on the basis of macro- and micro-economic fundamentals: 'For the gold price, the worst of all possible worlds seems to have materialised.' Investors may wish to be made aware that the fundamentals of the reasoning on which this conclusion is based leave something to be desired. The supply/demand balance for gold, according to the latest update by Gold Fields Mineral Services, portrays a different scenario to that depicted by Lex. In the first half of 1994, mine production plus scrap recovery fell short of fabrication demand, and this excludes any additional demand for physical bar hoarding. Furthermore, the market overhang created during the investment boom of 1993 has largely been worked off with the closing out of many forward commitments. Market trends indicate a continued tight supply/demand balance. The supply deficit has arisen in part because the macro-economic fundamentals cited by Lex affect only a small part of the global market. In the current long period of disinflation, gold clearly has not been demanded as an inflation hedge. With 80 per cent of gold off-take going into jewellery, both for adornment and store of value purposes, demand has been driven by rising prosperity, especially in the far east, and by the more recent cyclical upturn in the industrial countries. Accordingly, the macro- and micro-economic fundamentals seem to be pointing in a very different direction to that suggested by Lex. With regard to the ability of investors to use sophisticated derivative instruments as effective ways of offsetting dangers, one should perhaps take heed of other articles in the Financial Times citing the woes of Metallgesellschaft, Procter &amp; Gamble and Orange County.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Deadlock on Krajina ceasefire The Croatian government and Serbs from the breakaway Croatian republic of Krajina yesterday failed to agree on a ceasefire which would start paving the way for an eventual peace treaty between Croatia and Serbia. The two sides will meet again next Tuesday in a further effort to strike a deal. The talks - in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian capital - are the highest level contacts for many months between the two sides, as well as the first attempt by the Russians to broker a ceasefire in the three-year-old conflict between Serbs and Croats. The talks, hosted by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, coincided with threats by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to use military force to assert control over Krajina. The Krajina Serbs, backed by the Yugoslav army in June 1991, waged a war of secession against Croatia's moves towards independence. The Serbian side called for Croatian troops to withdraw from Krajina, a swathe of territory which cuts across south-west Croatia.</p>

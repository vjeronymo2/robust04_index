			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RACING VIEWS;  </P> <P> MISTER FRISKY IS THE NO. 1 DERBY PROSPECT  </P> <P> Who's No. 1?  </P> <P> Contrary to initial assessments, all of the best 3-year-olds bound for the  Kentucky Derby are not wintering in Florida. Mister Frisky awaits the Triple  Crown in Laz Barrera's barn at Santa Anita in Arcadia, not far from the barn in  which Sunday Silence awaited his Derby ambush of the heavily favored Easy Goer  a year ago.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky is 15-for-15 lifetime after an impressive victory in Saturday's  mile San Rafael. It was his second victory in California after 13 in Puerto  Rico, three of which set track records at El Comandante, where he won at  distances up to 9 furlongs.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky is a Florida-bred son of the little-known Marsayas, who is by  Damascus. After the weekend's 3-year-old stakes he not only stands alone as the  Kentucky Derby favorite but poses an immediate threat to Citation's record of  16 consecutive victories at ages 2 and 3.  </P> <P> "A lot of people didn't believe he could run this way," Barrera said after the  San Rafael. "They don't realize he set three records. When I went to Puerto  Rico to see him, I said, 'He's a machine.' He'll go any distance."  </P> <P> Gary Stevens said that when Tight Spot challenged his mount in the stretch  Saturday, "(Mister Frisky) grabbed the bit like a cat and hit another gear." So  far, he is the only 3-year-old to find that extra gear this season. He's No. 1.  </P> <P> If the Western leader has been determined, his counterpart in the East remains  unidentified. An assessment of Saturday's Fountain of Youth Stakes at  Gulfstream Park requires a fair amount of guessing. And then there is Red  Ransom, who lost at 3-to-10 odds in his seasonal debut in a 7-furlong  allowance.  </P> <P>  -- Red Ransom did not appear sharp in the paddock before his debut, which was  probably the result of trainer Mack Miller's backing off after a very fast work  10 days before. Miller said he may have left the colt a bit short for his first  start, but that may have been his intention. After what was more a useful  conditioning race than a true preview of what may be the real Red Ransom,  Miller mentioned the 7-furlong Swale Stakes March 17 at Gulfstream as the next  step. He also mentioned a 1 1/16-mile allowance.  </P> <P>  -- Slavic, who went off as the favorite Saturday and took sixth place, turned  in a one-paced effort that is also less alarming than was evident at first  glance, and it is likely that the Fountain of Youth provided the useful prep  for the Florida Derby that his connections were looking for.  </P> <P>  -- Roanoke ran well on a speed-favoring track to finish fifth in his first  start of the season, and he appears capable of playing a more substantial role  in the 9-furlong Florida Derby.  </P> <P>  -- Shot Gun Scott, surprise winner of the Fountain of Youth, is apparently the  season's best-kept secret, understandable since he has never raced outside  Florida. Trainer Ron Sarazin is considering the Florida Derby and the Jim Beam  Stakes, March 31 at Turfway Park.  </P> <P>  -- There is room for alarm in the Rhythm and Yonder camps, however.  </P> <P> Examination revealed that Rhythm did not bleed during the Fountain of Youth,  Shug McGaughey said Sunday morning. The colt experienced difficulty in  breathing near the three-eighths pole, a condition that may explain his dull  effort in the Hutcheson two weeks earlier. McGaughey said that the colt's  breathing was obstructed by his palate and said a veterinarian would be  summoned from Ohio this week.  </P></p>

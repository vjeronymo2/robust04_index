			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Better ways to fund IF THE self-respect of chancellors and central bankers hinged on the way markets reacted to their rhetoric, few would complete their allotted term. Mr Eddie George does not take up his post as Governor of the Bank of England until July. But this week he had a foretaste of the currency markets' notion of courtesy. When he warned in Frankfurt against further cuts in UK interest rates, sterling fell against the dollar and the D-Mark. While there is no reason to doubt Mr George's sincerity and determination, this scepticism is all too understandable. Yesterday's unexpectedly good figures for the retail prices index showed that the year-on-year headline rate of inflation in the UK is now running at 1.7 per cent, while the underlying rate excluding mortgage interest payments is 3.2 per cent. This suggests that short-term interest rates of 6 per cent at this depressed stage of the economic cycle are still high in real terms. After the badly handled one-point cut in rates late in January, few believe that Mr George's political masters will show the same resolve as he. That feeling is reinforced by the state of Britain's public finances. The markets understand that when next year's public sector borrowing requirement is heading for 9 per cent of gross national product and oversize budget deficits threaten to extend as far as the eye can see, there is only one solution to the problem: economic growth. If the government puts obstacles in the way of growth by keeping rates unduly high or, worse, raising interest rates in a panic as sterling overshoots downwards, a barely manageable problem becomes a nightmare. Stabilise sterling Here, then, is a difficulty that cannot be addressed by making speeches. If the government wants to stabilise sterling and restore confidence to a market that is all too aware of these pressures, it would help to adopt an approach to funding the PSBR that convinces people that the authorities actually believe in their own policies. If, in the words of the chancellor Mr Norman Lamont, the government's aim is to achieve a long-term rate of inflation of 2 per cent or less, funding the PSBR with long-dated gilts yielding about 8 3/4 per cent will prove appallingly costly in real terms. The market's inflation expectations are, in fact, more pessimistic. Long fixed-rate gilts are yielding around five percentage points more than the longer index-linked gilts - well above both the long-term inflation target and the declared short-run range of 1-4 per cent over the present parliament. Many institutional investors, meantime, are unwilling to believe that the government will be able to fund the PSBR at today's gilt yields because the funding requirement is so large in relation to institutional cash flow. Finance directors in industry appear to share that view. The recent spate of rights issues, and Thursday's announcement by hotels group Forte of a Pounds 200m debenture that matures in 2018, amount to a pre-emptive strike by people who anticipate funding pressure. Budget deficit This fear that the private sector will somehow be crowded out of the market is, in one sense, odd. The US has lived for years with a structural budget deficit without facing investor resistance in the market. There is little evidence in either the US or UK of a positive correlation between the PSBR and the level of bonds in institutional portfolios. And the absence of exchange controls around the world means that any shortage of domestic buying power can be supplemented from overseas. Against that background, the priority should be to establish a firm floor under sterling to activate capital flows on a global scale. One prerequisite is a convincing fiscal package in the budget. Another is a funding policy that lends credibility to Mr Lamont's inflation targets. That would involve, first, borrowing heavily in foreign currencies to support intervention in the sterling market. It would also involve more active resort to index-linked issues. And the so-called full funding rule, whereby the government finances the whole of its borrowing requirement with non-bank financial institutions, should go, allowing the banking system to buy less costly short-dated IOUs. It is, of course, more easily said than done. When the conditions for successful funding are difficult, a government needs to demonstrate some finesse in its management of the markets. That is difficult while the same people who mishandled sterling within the exchange rate mechanism remain in charge. The best reason for thinking that long gilt yields will rise is not that the fundamentals are necessarily against the authorities; it is that fund managers will be reluctant to give such a maladroit team the benefit of the doubt. That reluctance has been reinforced by the botched cut in interest rates last month. When the long-run trend in equities is still upwards, UK investors will take some persuading to buy a devalued government's bonds. Only with a great deal of luck - sorely absent in recent months - will it pull off the trick at today's prices.</p>

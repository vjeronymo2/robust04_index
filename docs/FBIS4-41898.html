			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Ovcharov: "Farmers Considered People in </F> Yaroslavl"]    [Text] Yaroslavl -- Yaroslav Oblast Governor Anatoliy  Lisitsyn has published a decree on support for private farmers.    In particular, there will now be a separate entry in the  budget for the allocation of credit resources to the Association  of Peasant (Private) Farms; these credits will represent 15  percent of the total monetary resources allocated for the  development of the agroindustrial complex. No less than 15  percent of capital investments going into the social  construction programs in the countryside (irrespective of the  sources of funding) will be directed toward private farmers.  Henceforth one-tenth of all the resources spent on road  construction in the oblast will also go to private farmers. It  has been decided to halve the level of paid services for testing  agricultural produce brought into the city by private farmers.</p>

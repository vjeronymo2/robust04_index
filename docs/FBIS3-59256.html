The  governor, appointed by the British monarch, has supreme ruling  power, so in reality the Hong Kong Government is an autocracy  with the governor acting as dictator. The Executive Council and  Legislative Council are nothing more than consulting bodies; the  latter is not a true lawmaking body. The Hong Kong Government  bears no resemblance to that in Britain, where power is divided  among the three branches of government for checks and balances.    Both the Green Paper and White Paper made it clear what the  British are up to: An attempt to foist on Hong Kong what it did  in its other colonies, namely decolonization. But Hong Kong is  different from other British colonies. It is part of China  territorially, so there is no question of its becoming  independent. Britain should return to China the Chinese  territory it had invaded. It should return the government to  China, not to the people of Hong Kong. As for returning the  government to the people, that would be up to the Chinese  authorities.    In the Green Paper, the British were still taking a go-slow  approach. In the White Paper, however, they were trying to speed  things up. About elections to the Legislative Council, for  instance, the proposal was to advance to 1985 what was  originally scheduled for 1988, that is, three years earlier.  Under the Green Paper, there would be six elected seats on the  council in 1984 and 1985 and 12 by 1988. The White Paper, on the  other hand, called for 12 elected seats.    In its debate on the government report with a number of  Legislative Council members such as Dame Lydia Dunn, the Hong  Kong British government also proposed setting up a ministerial  system. It suggested that the government reassess the central  organization, take steps to put together a ministerial system,  something similar to what they had in the United States, and  give the legislative body decision making power. The idea was to  remove the decision making power currently held by the Executive  Council, actually the governor, and hand it over to the  legislature. That would change the present government framework  fundamentally.    Many people in Hong Kong were pleased with the British  Government's relentless push for a representative system in Hong  Kong and its move to change the local political framework  drastically. Mostly these people had no confidence in China.  Many other people, a majority of them from the upper and middle  to upper crusts of society, were also concerned.    The current issue of the magazine JIUSHI NIANDAI published  two interviews, one with the senior unofficial member of the  Executive Council, Zhong Shiyuan [6945 1102 337], and the other  with a high-ranking official about to retire, Secretary for Home  Affairs Li Dunyi [7812 2415 5030]. Their conversations spoke  volumes.    According to Zhong Shiyuan, when China said things would not  change for 50 years, it did not mean there would be no change  from the way things would be in 1997, but from the existing  state of affairs. So he had three worries. First, would Hong  Kong really be run by the people of Hong Kong, or would it be  run by Beijing? Second, how can we ensure true non-intervention?  Is it like the headquarters telling the manager of a branch  office there would be no intervention? Third, can China  guarantee that its open policy would remain in place and that it  would not go back to its ultra-leftist line? Hong Kong had lost  the first round, he said, so there was no reason why Hong Kong  should keep the form of organization of the colonial government.  Instead, it should adopt a political system of democratic  elections. It should spend the three years switching to a  representative system.    Zhong Shiyuan disclosed two other things. First, he realized  full well that when China said there would be no change for 50  years, it meant there would be no change from the existing  situation, not the conditions in 1997. Be that as it may, they  wanted to change the existing situation in 13 years. Second,  how? A political system of popular elections.    What Zhong Shiyuan said made it clear that the British  strategy toward China's takeover of Hong Kong had changed.  Executive Council members were kept abreast of what was going on  in every round of the Sino-British talks. Many times either  their opinions reflected those of the Hong Kong Government or  they saw eye to eye with the latter.    Li Dunyi was even more blunt. He said unequivocally, "Times  have changed. We need to move from one era to the next. The way  things are, the governor is appointed by people outside Hong  Kong. We hope they will treat the people well, but they may turn  out to be bad guys. I don't think anybody wants to see this  situation continue in the next 13 years, all the way to the  transfer of power. That is why we must switch to another system  of government, specifically a legislature created through  elections and an executive body that is held accountable to the  legislature." He told the people of Hong Kong, "It is up to you  from now on." The interviewer, JIUSHI NIANDAI chief editor Li Yi  [2621 1837], asked him, "In the past the government has always  shied away from changing the political system, even contending  that few local citizens wanted to see a change in the system.  Now it is pushing for change, radical change, in the political  system." Referring to this inconsistency, Lidunyi said, "How can  we justify it?" Li Yi then asked, "You had no choice under the  circumstances?" He answered, "Absolutely not." Li Yi asked, "In  the past some government officials kept telling us, `Democracy  is not the only good system.' Indeed we don't have a democratic  system..." Li Dunyi said, "That's right. Things were more quiet  before there were any politics."    As a high-ranking official in the Hong Kong Government, Li  Dunyi was privy to insider information even though he was about  to retire. What he said proved that Britain had changed its  strategy in its maneuverings with China and awkwardly exposed  the hypocrisy of the British government when it declared its  intent to "return government to the people." An article at the  time said, "Britain wants to make radical change in the next 13  years but demands no change for 50 years." [Installment No. 50]  <H5>  [24 Jun p 2] </H5>      Britain Jumps the Gun on Political Reform; First  Press Conference Touches Off Controversy    At the beginning we did not fully understand the matter. We  only knew that Britain wanted to introduce a representative  system but had no inkling of its desire for radical change. I  was not sure about the situation in Beijing, but at least that  was the case in Hong Kong. When Beijing said, "No comment," we  echoed it. In response to a reporter's question, I added, "This  has to do with the British Government." Later Beijing picked up  this line, saying, "This is a matter for the British Government.  We have assumed no such obligation." Perhaps taking this as a  sign of Chinese acquiescence, more and more Britain acted as  though what it was doing was "inevitable."    Based on information from all sources, particularly the  statement "radical change in 13 years, no change in 50 years,"  we concluded that the British Government had indeed changed its  strategy toward Hong Kong's return to China. Its jumping the gun  on political reform for Hong Kong was all in all a premeditated  move, a tangible expression of its assertions that it would  continue its ties with Hong Kong beyond 1997 to protect its  interests. It might continue to play the "public opinion card,"  even turning it into the "democracy card," and advanced the plan  in the Sino-British Joint Declaration to reform the governmental  system of the special administrative region after 1997. It might  sell its political reform plan to the Hong Kong people as an  example of British benevolent rule for Hong Kong in order to win  the locals' goodwill and support. At the same time, its actions  would further divide society, helping the Hong Kong British  authorities nurture and develop pro-British forces which could  be relied on to continue to rule Hong Kong after 1997 as a  regent of London even in the absence of British rule. At my  request Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378] called a meeting to discuss  this matter. The meeting was attended by leaders from the Hong  kong and Macao Affairs Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  and the Foreign Affairs Office.    By then the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already  made representations to Britain, demanding that the switch to a  representative system be consistent with the future basic law  for Hong Kong and not affect the smooth transition in 1997. The  British had not made any formal response by the time the meeting  was held. At the meeting we speculated that Britain might try to  bring about another kind of transition, that by speeding up  reform it might create a fait accompli which the basic law must  live with. By effecting radical change in 13 years while  demanding no change for 50 years, it would in effect go back on  its commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This  was something China could not accept and must do its best to  prevent. We were also aware that the Green Paper and White Paper  had whetted the appetite for democracy among some people in  society. If there was absolutely no change in 13 years, these  people would be disappointed. There was also the need to help  the British find a way to exit gracefully. In accordance with  Deng Xiaoping's "step by step" approach, any move affecting the  political system must be incremental and cautious.    At the meeting I told Ji Pengfei that I had promised  reporters in Hong Kong that I would hold a press conference upon  my return from Beijing. Should they ask me what was discussed at  the meeting, I said to Ji Pengfei, I would respond in accordance  with the spirit of the conference. Ji Pengfei nodded and did not  offer any objection.    On 21 November I held a press conference at the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY Hong Kong branch, the very first in my life. Both TV  networks covered the event live.    The moderator, Yang Qi [2799 1142], asked the reporters to  present the questions in writing so that I could address them  collectively after they were collected and assembled.    The press conference was about to end when a female reporter  from a radio station suddenly posed this question, "What is most  essential to maintaining prosperity and stability in Hong Kong?  What may happen now that would undermine such prosperity and  stability?"    Essentially this was how I responded, "The main thing is to  proceed firmly, comprehensively, and substantively in accordance  with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. If we depart from the  provisions in the declaration, we may be undermining the  declaration." "These days we can see some people are not  operating in accordance with the document. We cannot but keep a  close eye on them." "If there is any unexpected change, this  must be it." The reporter shot back with this follow-up  question, "Who really is not operating in accordance with the  document?" I laughed, "I can't tell you now. The time is not  quite right yet."    Deputy director Chen Baijian [7115 0130 1017] of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, who accompanied me to the press  conference, said, "We all have an idea as to who is not  operating in accordance with the document."    At this point I had already been fielding questions for over  an hour; my glasses had fogged up, so I took them off to wipe  them. I held them in my right hand and picked up a copy of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration with my left hand, gesturing and  talking at the same time. In photographs and on the TV screen I  came across as quite emotional.    My public acknowledgement of the existing rift between China  and Britain touched off a chain of reactions, dubbed by the Hong  Kong media as the "document controversy."    The Hong Kong British Government responded swiftly, and so  did the British Foreign Office. The British media too got busy  and commented on my remarks. The British Foreign Office issued a  statement reiterating that Britain "has the responsibility to  govern Hong Kong until 1997. The Chinese government, on the  other hand, is responsible for formulating the basic law. The  governments of both nations are taking the Sino-British Joint  Declaration as the point of departure." The Foreign Office also  stressed that Britain had not violated the joint declaration.  Some newspapers said, "With Beijing taking a high-handed  approach, one is skeptical that China would give Hong Kong a  substantial measure of self-rule." Locally, the community  reacted strongly, with the Hang Seng index plunging 50 points.  Some groups went so far as to protest to XINHUA NEWS AGENCY,  complaining that I had been irresponsible in my statements.  [Installment No. 51]</p>

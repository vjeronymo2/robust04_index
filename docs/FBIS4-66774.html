			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Engineer Haydar Kamunah, Baghdad University </F> Institute of Higher Studies for Urban and Regional Planning:  "Commercial Streets in Baghdad; Economic Losses in Energy  Consumption"]    [Text] It is well known that energy is one of the most  important elements of power and that it is a basic support upon  which the countries of the world rely for progress and  development. Every country in the world either has faced, or  will face, an energy crisis in one form or another, and because  of that, all possibilities must be determined and attempts made  to avoid--as far as possible--being damaged by that crisis.    With respect to consumer countries, if the aspect of that  crisis is the supply or supplies of energy from abroad, then we,  as a producing and exporting country, have another aspect of  that crisis. The latter aspect is represented by the diminished  price of this energy, its excess production and supply, and the  drop in consumption, which will result in reducing the life of  its reserves. Consequently, this natural wealth will dry up in a  shorter period of time. This is especially true since our  country is going through extremely critical circumstances, with  regard to rebuilding the national Iraqi economy during this  iniquitous blockade imposed upon our valiant nation.    The process of air conditioning the buildings located on  more  than 200 commercial streets has changed the use of the land of  those streets from residential, in accordance with the basic  design agreed upon for the city of Baghdad, to commercial in  accordance with decisions made by the Municipal Council during  the last decade. This requires producing additional electrical  energy, considered to be among those economic sectors that are  capital intensive. This sector requires high investments as a  result of the enormous sums of money needed to establish power  stations, transmission networks and lines, and electrical  transformers. This gives the allocated investments an active and  influential role in raising or lowering growth rates with regard  to the production of electricity.    In Iraq, the capital-intensiveness of the electricity sector  was reflected in consecutive increases in total fixed capital  formation during the period 1970 to 1990. Through observing  actual electricity production in Iraq from 1970 to 1990, it  becomes clear that total fixed capital formation rose from 32.8  million Iraqi dinars [ID] in 1980, in fixed prices for the year  1970, to ID155.5 million for 1990. This shows an annual growth  rate of 8.1 percent for 1970-90.    The consumption of electricity fluctuated among the various  sectors. The domestic household sector consumed 40 percent,  while the administrative and services sector consumed 41.5  percent for 1988. These percentages rose in 1989 to 43.5 percent  for the household sector and 36.6 percent for the administration  and services sector, while the percentage of consumption for the  industrial sector, which is the sector that forms the country's  backbone, was no more than 8.5 percent in 1988 and 7.9 percent  in 1989. We should note that those percentages are different in  advanced countries. For example, in Sweden the percentage of  electricity consumed in the industrial sector in 1985 was 40  percent of total consumption, and in the transportation sector  it was 20 percent, while the commercial and residential sector  consumed 40 percent. In the United States, the residential and  commercial sector used about 17 percent of total electricity  consumed in 1985, while industrial sector consumption was no  more than 23 to 25 percent. The services sector used 35 percent  of total consumption.    Advanced nations try generally to guide their consumption  and  concentrate on the industrial sector, considering it the  influential economic sector with regard to the state's economic  structure. One should note that the industrial sector's  consumption rates in these countries are generally close to or  exceed the residential sector's consumption rates. Reducing the  volume of consumption for air conditioning, which uses 55  percent of the electricity consumed per residential unit in  Baghdad, is very necessary, especially if we consider that this  consumption goes up to 80 percent from May to October. However,  it is very unfortunate that changing the environment of these  streets from residential uses to commercial (multistory  buildings, with commercial shops on the ground floor and  residential apartments, offices, and clinics on the other  floors) has resulted in major economic losses in the consumption  of electrical energy. This decision was made without regard to,  or in violation of, one of the design principles that must be  employed in architecture and urban planning when erecting any  building in the city. That principle is to protect human beings  from climatic conditions and provide a suitable environment for  living, working, and recreation. In order to achieve that, it is  necessary to provide that building with a group of architectural  and physical characteristics that make it an appropriate social  instrument to fulfill its various functions.</p>

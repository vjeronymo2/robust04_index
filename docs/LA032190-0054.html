			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PRESTON'S BIG DAY LEADS MASTER'S TO 18-9 VICTORY  </P> <P> Squeezing a season's worth of statistics into one game, Jeff Preston of The  Master's had a day to remember in his team's 18-9 nonconference baseball win  over Chapman at The Master's on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Preston went four for four, scored five runs, had two doubles, a triple, a home  run (his second) and drove in seven runs to lead the rout.  </P> <P> Jeff Cole was the beneficiary of Preston's outburst, picking up the win in  relief. Joining Preston in the offensive fireworks were teammates Kevin Backes  (three for four, four runs batted in) and Mark MacArthur (two hits, two RBIs).  </P> <P> Master's improved to 10-12.  </P> <P> In other baseball games:  </P> <P> Glendale 7, Moorpark 6 -- Art Chute knocked in Victor Ramirez with the winning  run on a two-out single in the bottom of the ninth against visiting Moorpark,  which entered the game leading the Western State Conference.  </P> <P> Glendale starter Matt Whisenant (4-3) pitched his way out of a one-out,  bases-loaded jam in the top of the ninth inning to earn the win.  </P> <P> Willie Leighton (4-1) went the distance for Moorpark (12-7, 7-2).  </P> <P> Chute had a two-run single to spark a five-run third inning for Glendale (9-15,  4-5). Moorpark's Don Smith hit a solo home run in the seventh, and the Raiders  pulled into a 6-6 tie in the eighth.  </P> <P> Valley 3, Bakersfield 1 -- Dan Carroll recorded the final two outs, including a  bases-loaded strikeout to end the game, as the Monarchs held for a win in a WSC  game at home.  </P> <P> Carroll, who recorded his first save, took over for starter Colin Hines  (7-14-2, 3-5), who struck out four and allowed three hits in 8 1/3 innings to  earn the win.  </P> <P> E. J. Pape's bases-loaded single in the third gave Valley a 1-0 lead. Vladimir  Pajcin drove in the second run of the inning with a bases-loaded smash that the  right fielder could not handle.  </P> <P> Gene Demyon singled in the sixth to score Chris Greenamyer for Valley's third  run.  </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> CS Northridge 6-3, Mankato State (Minn.) 0-0 -- Debby Dickmann and Heather  Lindstrom delivered a one-two punch for Cal State Northridge as the Lady  Matadors punched out Mankato State (Minn.) in a nonconference doubleheader at  Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> Dickmann, a senior, pitched a four-hitter, striking out six and walking two.  Lindstrom, a sophomore, pitched a two-hitter with three strikeouts.  </P> <P> Lisa Erickson was three for four with two runs scored to lead the offense in  the first game. Anna Getherall was two for three in the second game.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran 6-4, Christ College-Irvine 0-6 -- DeeAndra Pilkington (8-3) fired  a three-hitter in the first game, then watched as Christ College's Lisa Merenda  picked up a win of her own in the nightcap, as the teams split an NAIA District  3 doubleheader at Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> In the opener, Kim White homered, tripled and drove in two runs. But she then  lost her 11-game hitting streak to Merenda in the second game.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL ISSUE OF ORANGE COUNTY LIFE;  </P> <P> IT'S SUMMERTIME, SO GO PETAL YOUR PICTURES  </P> <P> Summer is a good time to stop and smell the flowers, but it may be an even  better time to stop and shoot the flowers.  </P> <P> Photographing flowers can be as simple or complicated as you want to make it.  You can use an automatic point-and-shoot camera or a more advanced camera with  a macro lens, extension tubes, bellows or close-up filters. You can even  consider additional lighting, reflectors or strobes.  </P> <P> The first and foremost concern should be shooting photographs and enjoying  nature. So don't get bogged down in technique. After choosing a film, scan a  nature book just to give you an idea of different ways to look at flowers and  plants.  </P> <P> Sometimes nature needs a helping hand. So take along a spray bottle of water to  mist your subject.  </P> <P> A factor you need to consider is the wind. A gentle breeze can blur your  subject, unless you use a shutter speed fast enough to stop the movement of  your subject. For this reason, many people prefer to shoot in the calm of the  early morning hours. Another way to beat the problem is to have someone hold  the plant still or block the wind with a piece of cardboard.  </P> <P> A tripod will help keep your camera steady and make your picture sharper.  Unfortunately, sometimes the location or angle may make it impossible to use a  tripod. In that case, you must brace yourself as you squeeze the trigger.  </P> <P> It's important to follow basic photography rules. Pay attention to your  composition, background, lighting, depth of field and exposure. Also, look for  unusual patterns in the leaves or flowers to give your photo a different  perspective.  </P> <P> Shoot your subject at every conceivable angle. A different angle could give an  ordinary flower a very out-of-the-ordinary look.  </P> <P> This means you will be shooting your subject front-lit, back-lit and side-lit.  You may want to bracket the exposure if you are shooting slide film to ensure a  properly exposed slide. Negative or color print film gives you plenty of  latitude, so bracketing isn't necessary.  </P> <P> A single-lens reflex camera, or SLR, is a must for any serious close-up  photography. Viewing directly through the lens lets you see exactly what will  appear on your film.  </P> <P> For ease of operation and general close-up work, a macro lens -- a lens that  has the capability to focus close -- is the right choice for the nature  photographer. Today, macro capability is built into many lenses, ranging in  focal length from 55 to 200 millimeters. Even many zoom lens offer the feature.  </P> <P> But there are alternatives to buying a new lens.  </P> <P> Using close filters -- diopters -- is one way to bring your subject in close.  They are single-element lenses that come in different magnification levels that  you add to your lens. The advantages of a diopter are that they have a low cost  and don't change the exposure. A diopter is also easy to take on and off and is  easy to carry. The only drawback is that generally, the picture quality of a  diopter is not as high as the lens you are using.  </P> <P> Another option is an extension tube. This method adds distance between the lens  and camera. One of the nice things about extension tubes is that they allow you  to photograph close up but let you retain the high optical quality of your  lens. Make sure the extension works with the metering system in your camera or  you will have to compensate by increasing your exposure.  </P> <P> Bellows, a series of baffles that allow you to vary the distance from camera to  lens in fine increments usually incorporating a rail system, are the sign of a  serious close-up photographer. There are a lot of drawbacks, but they are  mostly inconveniences to the photographer. For example, you must use a tripod  because the extra size makes it impossible to hand hold. In addition, most  bellows will not connect with the through-the-lens metering system of your  camera, and because of the added distance you may need a flash.  </P> <P> Most people don't even consider using an electronic flash -- a strobe -- for  shooting flowers. But a strobe can add the light to give you extra depth of  field, sharpness or dramatic light.  </P> <P> Since your flash will be so close to the subject, you won't need a very  elaborate setup. A small flash will work, but you need to move your flash off  the camera. Most camera manufacturers make an extension cord for this purpose.  Try shooting with the flash just off the camera, to the side of your subject  and from behind. This type of experimentation will produce a winner.  </P> <P> If your camera reads exposures through the lens for a flash photograph, you're  set. You may need to make some exposure tests because of the short distance to  the subject. Use slide film to make the tests and keep careful records of your  f-stops, flash setting and distances of both your camera to subject and flash  to subject.  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Domtar in note and equity issues DOMTAR, a big building Canadian materials, pulp and paper and packaging group, has renegotiated a CDollars 500m (USDollars 431m) credit facility with its banks and plans a CDollars 150m equity issue and a USDollars 150m seven-year note issue in the US. In addition, a CDollars 150m interest-free loan from a Quebec government agency will be converted into preferred shares, retractable in the year 2000 in cash or common shares. The equity issue in Canada will be 42 per cent taken up by two Quebec government agencies which together hold that percentage of Domtar's common shares. The company has just over 100m common shares outstanding. The total financing package will be completed by late March, and the company said it would meet expected capital needs over the next several years. The company, with the rest of the North American forest products industry, has been severely hit by the long recession and poor markets. Also, the strong Canadian dollarhit performance in 1991 despite restructuring, asset sales and a severe pruning in costs. The company incurred a fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 44m, or 46 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 263m, or CDollars 2.99, a share a year earlier, including special charges of CDollars 237m. For all 1991, the loss was CDollars 148m, or CDollars 1.69 a share, against a loss of CDollars 294m, or CDollars 3.44 a share, including special charges. On an operating basis, Domtar had a 1991 loss of CDollars 215m against an operating loss of CDollars 45m in 1990.</p>

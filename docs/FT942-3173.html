			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Row over award of Portuguese bridge contract Two international construction companies have become embroiled in a public row over one of Europe's most prestigious civil engineering contracts, the construction of a new bridge over the Tagus river in Lisbon. The French company Bouygues, whose consortium lost to a consortium led by Britain's Trafalgar House, is complaining that the Pounds 714m contract was unfairly awarded and is pressing the Portuguese government to rescind its decision. Mr Jacques Marquet, a senior executive of the French company, has written to Portugal's minister of public works questioning the basis on which the contract was awarded in April. The letter claims that Gattel, the state concession company for the bridge, ignored a report by an independent adviser to the government which stated that the French offer was better on technical grounds. The company obtained a copy of the report through its own means after Gattel withheld circulation of documents which might have shed light on how the final decision was made. A senior manager with Bouygues said: 'We think the Portuguese government made its mind up about the contract before we even started bidding. It now seems obvious to us that we were simply allowed in to simulate competition.' In awarding the contract, Gattel said the two final offers were tied in terms of financial proposals but that the Trafalgar House consortium won on 'technical grounds.' The deadline for the losing consortium to appeal against the decision expires on Monday. Mr Joao Morais Leitao, the Portuguese lawyer for the Trafalgar House group, yesterday said that the decision on technical aspects was made in Trafalgar's favour in January, four months before the final decision was announced, and that the rest of time was spent on deciding other aspects. The Bouygues and Trafalgar consortiums were shortlisted in November 1993. It later emerged that the European Union was committed to providing a grant covering about half the cost of the project through the Cohesion Fund. Trafalgar House and the French group Campenon Bernard each have 24.8 per cent in the project. Five Portuguese companies have 50.4 per cent. The consortium known as Lusoponte plans to complete the 12km bridge by March 31 1998, in time for Expo '98, which is being hosted by Portugal.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim quivers but Nikkei stays above 21,000 Stocks declined somewhat following four days of strong gains, but the Nikkei 225 average managed to stay above 21,000 on hopes that it could rally again, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The index slipped 44.11 to 21,009.00. An afternoon high of 21,198.11, topping last year's closing peak of 21,148.11, was followed by a wave of profit-taking and a day's low of 20,965.69 just before the close. The Nikkei 300 receded 1.12 to 308.77. Volume, down from Wednesday's 691m shares, remained heavy at 650m. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 3.92 at 1,689.66, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.02 firmer at 1,396.12. Most analysts remained cautiously optimistic. Mr Keiji Ikeda, a trader at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, said that the day's modest decline was no more than 'a digesting process after four days of rising prices'. Mr Ikeda viewed the continued strong volume in the market as positive. 'This is the third time the market has tested the 21,000 level,' he said, 'but, this time, the volume looks stable.' Oils were mixed. After gains in the morning session, Nippon Oil ended a net Y2 off at Y776 and Japan Energy also Y2 down at Y456. Cosmo Oil benefited from a report that the company had won a concession from the Abu Dhabi government to develop a new oil field in the United Arab Emirates, the first such concession won by a foreign company since the 1973 oil crisis. At the close, Cosmo was up Y7 at Y881. Mitsubishi Oil retreated Y26 to Y955 on rumours, which it denied, that it had suffered losses on foreign exchange transactions. Multimedia related shares gave back most of Wednesday's gains. Hitachi was down Y20 to Y1,080, Fujitsu dipped Y10 to Y1,120 and the telecommunications giant NTT declined Y9.000 to Y883,000. In Osaka the OSE average was 76.87 higher at 23,388.06. Volume for the day amounted to 45.1m shares. Roundup Rumours, technical selling and adverse corporate reports gave a number of Pacific Rim markets an uncomfortable day. HONG KONG dropped 3 per cent, brokers blaming a spate of covered warrant issues and the market's failure to break out of its current trading range. The Hang Seng index closed 289.73 lower at 9,224.44 and turnover eased from HKDollars 4.04bn to HKDollars 3.60bn. The view was that by issuing covered warrants, shareholders had locked in profits while taking money out of the market, and that traders were now wondering where buying support would come from. Among heavily traded third-party warrants, Smart-Hopewell '94 lost 16 cents to 92 cents, Fleming-Cheung Kong '95 fell 14 cents to 73 cents, SBC-Wharf '95 dipped 13 cents to 69 cents and BZW-HSBC '96 shed 22 cents to HKDollars 1.19. In the share market, conglomerates were hit by worries that covered warrants were likely to be issued on their shares. Swire 'A' fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 58.50, Jardine Matheson HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 59 and Hutchison HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 32.25. KUALA LUMPUR plunged nearly 3 per cent, driven lower by rumours and by technical selling. The composite index lost 27.36 at 955.44 as volume rose to 131.5m shares from 93.7m. Turnover was MDollars 621m. Speculative stocks were most affected, especially those associated with Samsudin Abu Hassan. Granite Industries, in which he holds a controlling stake, was the day's most active issue, dropping 38 cents to MDollars 3.80 on rumours that it could lose its licence to operate gaming machines in China. After hours, the KLSE executive chairman, Nik Mohamed Din Nik Yusoff, denied stories that several brokerages face financial difficulties. SINGAPORE saw negative sentiment spill over from the heavy liquidations in the Malaysian stock market, and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 15.50 to 2,252.38. Brokers said, however, that the declines in Singapore blue chips were contained since volume was only 105.92m shares. Malaysia's Idris Hydraulics, Mulpha International, Promet, Renong and Landmarks were among fallers, and led volume. SEOUL staged a rebound in most telecommunications related shares and, while concerns about North Korea's nuclear programme still overshadowed the market, the composite stock index rose 4.66 to 937.43. The state-funded Korea Telecom sold off 1.16m shares in Korea Mobile Telecom much more quickly than planned. Both Korea Mobile and Dacom went the day's limit up, gaining Won6,000 and Won3,000 at Won295,000 and Won132,000 respectively. Posco led a blue-chip rebound, adding Won2,000, limit-high, at Won69,000. Taekwang Industry, South Korea's most expensive share, also sparked high-price buying, closing Won10,000 higher at Won430,000. SYDNEY was upset by a sharp decline in News Corp on reports that the US Federal Communications Commission might be conducting an investigation into the media group's activities there. The stock receded 30 cents, or 3.2 per cent, to ADollars 8.90 in volume of some 3.2m shares. The All Ordinaries index retreated 20.2 to 2,077.0 in turnover of ADollars 435m. Retailers lost ground on poorer than expected retail sales data: Coles shed 5 cents to ADollars 4.28 and Woolworths 1 cent to ADollars 3.00. TAIPEI was generally lower, although export-related stocks advanced following the recent depreciation of the Taiwanese dollar. The weighted index relinquished 4.83 to 5,956.62 in turnover of TDollars 57.5bn. BOMBAY was lifted by heavy buying from foreign institutions on the last day of the account. The BSE 30-share index finished 61.83 ahead at 3,895.32. Brokers said that market fundamentals were strong at the moment because of recent good corporate results and forecasts that the monsoon rains were likely to be normal this year. WELLINGTON improved, with domestic investors encouraged by reports that there had been an uplift in foreign investment following news that the government expected to report its first budget surplus for 17 years. The NZSE-40 capital index added 11.55 at 2,147.76, with Telecom gaining 9 cents at NZDollars 5.02 in thin volume.</p>

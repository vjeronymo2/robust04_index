			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Mercedes leads Czech truck race - Imminent restructuring for foreign involvement THE Czechoslovak truck industry faces sweeping restructuring soon as intensified negotiations between western buyers, local companies and government reach a head. Last week Mercedes Benz, the vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany, signed joint venture letters of intent with Avia and Liaz, local manufacturers of light and heavy on-road trucks respectively. If agreed by the government, which has until March 30 to decide, the deal will place Mercedes in a position to dominate the country's truck industry, beating competition from Renault of France and Iveco of Italy. The Czechoslovak truck industry is made up of Avia, Liaz and Tatra, the off-road truck maker. Its restructuring is likely to involve the merging of at least two under the umbrella of a joint venture with a foreign partner. Negotiations have been dragging, however, as industry and government officials try to reconcile the need to bring in foreign capital and the desire to maintain, at least in part, the independence of the Czech-oslovak truck industry, whose tradition goes back to the 1920s. The Czech government retains the right to reject Avia's choice of the German group. Mr Jan Vrba, industry minister, was quoted in the local press this week as saying that specific requirements made by Mercedes were 'wholly unacceptable' and that compromises would have to be reached. These requirements include important tax breaks for 10 years from the formation of the joint venture or five years if profits are made. They also include the imposition for six years of a 40 per cent customs duty on imports of utility vehicles. While negotiations will focus on these issues, the government also reserves the right to consider new proposals from rivals such as Renault. Under the country's large-scale privatisation programme, competitive bids can still be submitted up to January 20. If the deal is approved, the venture would be created in July. Mr Zdenek Bakala, head of the Prague office of Credit Suisse First Boston, which advises both Avia and the Industry Ministry, says: 'Very clear financial advantages must be put forward in order for the deal to go through. If not, the government may re-open discussions with non-German investors.' Under the agreement, the German group will acquire an initial 31 per cent of Avia and 20 per cent of Liaz, which will contribute its motor assembly line in Jablonec. Mercedes will invest DM350m (Pounds 123.2m) over the next three years and raise significantly its equity participation in Avia. Mercedes intends over the next two years to replace the production of Avia trucks, which have been manufactured under a Saviem-Renault licence since 1967. The German company will instead make two types of its own small and medium-sized trucks. Sales plummeted last year as a result of the recession in the domestic market and collapse of the Comecon trade on which all three enterprises relied heavily for their exports. Avia, which in 1991 had a turnover of Kcs4.1bn (Pounds 75.9m), has been faring better than its siblings because it was able to maintain its domestic sales, which average 9,000 trucks. Producing smaller trucks and vans, the company has been able to tap into the nascent entrepreneurial private sector in the country. Its exports have fallen dramatically, however, mostly because the former Soviet Union, which in 1990 imported 21.8 per cent of its output, is unable to renew orders. By comparison, Tatra, which produced an estimated 10,500 heavy off-road trucks in 1991, has found buyers among Siberian oil companies able to pay with supplies of raw materials, mainly because of trade joint ventures set up in the region by Motokov, Czechoslovakia's main exporter of trucks. Technically competitive in world markets, Tatra's self-confidence was particularly boosted when more than 1,300 trucks were bought by the allied forces during the Gulf war. Despite the interest of both Iveco and Mercedes, the enterprise recently put forth a privatisation project which would leave, in a first stage, nearly all its equity in the hands of Czechoslovak citizens in the form of vouchers. Foreign investors would have a chance to acquire a stake in Tatra at a later stage though, according to Mr Oldrich Svajda, deputy director of Motokov. Liaz, by far the worst off of the three companies, suffered an important fall in production this year. While output reached 15,000 trucks in 1990, sales for 1991 are estimated to have been less than 5,000. The company's decline stems mostly from its reliance for sales on hard-hit domestic buyers, such as construction companies.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Gas firm The long-awaited report on British Gas prepared by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was given a cautious thumbs up by a stock market which has been preparing itself for the possibility of much worse news. Prior to news of the MMC report Gas shares were trading around 3 easier at 320 1/2 p. The market's initial reaction to the report was to hoist the shares to a day's high point of 338p before a sustained bout of profit-taking drove the share price down to a closing level of 327 1/2 p, a net gain of 4. The MMC report generated an upsurge in turnover in Gas shares, where some 38m changed hands during a frantic trading session. Turnover yesterday was the highest for a single trading session since July 1990 when the UK government sold its remaining 54m shares in Gas at 220 3/4 p a share. Dealers said the main elements in the MMC report, including a recommendation that the company divests its gas trading activities by March 1997 and a downwards shift in its gas pricing formula, were no more than the market had expected; 'It could have been much worse,' said one marketmaker. Gas shares embarked on a strong upwards move at the beginning of last week as the market picked up the scent of a less than onerous report from the MMC. Many of the leading broking firms adopted a strong buy stance in the stock, driving Gas shares up to what was then an all-time high. One analyst who attended the post-MMC report meeting with Gas described the atmosphere among the assembled host as 'slightly gloomy', and said the feeling was that the result was 'not so bullish as a share price of 338p suggests'. Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull adopted a bearish view of the report. 'Sir James McKinnon will be feeling a lot happier than Cedric Brown after this,' he said, adding that Gas 'will find it difficult to grow the dividend'. Mr Alan Marshall, oil and gas specialist at Swiss Bank Corporation, was firmly in the optimists' camp, setting a 350p price target on the shares and describing the outcome of the report as 'pretty good'. In another twist to the Gas story, rumours began circulating that Gas may embark on a strong push into the global oil exploration business by launching a bid for Lasmo, the troubled oil exploration and production company. It would not be the first time that Gas has shown interest in Lasmo. In the late 1980s Gas launched an unsuccessful 'dawn raid' on Lasmo, netting only a handful of shares in the group. There was considerable two-way interest in Lasmo shares yesterday, turnover expanding to a much higher than usual 6.9m. The stock gained a penny at 134p.</p>

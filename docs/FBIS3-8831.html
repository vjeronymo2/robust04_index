			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Not every one had the  opportunity to listen to the ideas presented in an earlier  interview by Jozef Moravcik. We are therefore repeating some  of the more important parts of his interview.    [Begin recording] [Moravcik] I am now faced with the most  important step, and that is to form the new government. I am  fully concentrating on this task.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you already have a concept  concerning the composition of the new government?    [Moravcik] Such a concept has been taking shape for some  time. I cannot say more about it right now because negotiations  with representatives of the parliamentary parties concerned are  still going on. The composition of the new government should be  completed tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.    [Reporter] When do you want to submit the composition of the  government for the president's approval?    [Moravcik] I think this could happen on Wednesday [16  March].    [Reporter] Does it mean that you want the 27th parliamentary  session to continue with the new government?    [Moravcik] It would be desirable.    [Reporter] Are you working on your policy statement?    [Moravcik] I will submit the policy statement at the next  National Council session.    [Reporter] As a former foreign minister, how do you  visualize  the person of the future foreign minister?    [Moravcik] I think it should be a career diplomat. I am  approaching the issue from this starting point at the moment.    [Reporter] Do you have anyone tipped for this post?    [Moravcik] Naturally, I do.    [Reporter] In your interview for Slobodny Piatok [Free  Friday], you said that you were close to the ideas of the  Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic. Does that mean  that their ideas will determine your course and that you will  work with this party?    [Moravcik] We want to create a joint political party.    [Reporter] Does it mean that the party being called the  Democratic Union, whose creation has been proposed by Roman  Kovac, is going to be the joint party with the Alliance of  Democrats? Or are these parties going to be two different  political parties and you, in that case, will choose just one of  them?    [Moravcik] It is possible that another party will be  involved. That means that three or possibly four parties will  merge.    [Reporter] Which three or four parties of those you have  just  mentioned might participate in such a merger?    [Moravcik] Perhaps you should add Cernak [former chairman of  the Slovak National Party and founder of the National Democratic  parliamentary club] and maybe another body, although that is no  more than an idea at the moment.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cactus wren is a resident species, and numbers of cactus wrens residing in coastal sage scrub of coastal southern California have declined as a result of the expressed effects of many of the same factors that have similarly impacted the largely sympatric, threatened coastal California gnatcatcher ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Polioptila californica californica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). All of the published literature on the status of coastal sage scrub vegetation types in California supports the conclusion that this plant community is one of the most depleted habitat types in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it is currently evident that the cactus wrens residing in coastal sage scrub plant communities are not distinct from other cactus wrens. Therefore, cactus wrens occupying coastal southern California do not constitute a distinct vertebrate population segment. For instance, although the coastal birds almost always nest in cactus, cactus is a preferred nesting substrate of cactus wrens elsewhere in California and in the remainder of the species' range in the United States. Perhaps more importantly, no apparent morphological or other morphometric differences have been detected to date that distinguish coastal birds from other cactus wrens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it is apparent that the habitat preference of coastal birds  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> (coastal sage scrub) does not readily separate them from other members of the subspecies. Several treatments exist describing various types of scrub communities in southern California and Baja California. The coastal sage scrub plant formation grades into coastal succulent scrub and eventually into Sonoran desert scrub. Although some gaps in the range of the species may exist, birds representing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. b. bryanti  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. b. couesi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as currently defined by the American Ornithologist's Union (R. Banks,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1994), likely occupy all of these ``scrub'' plant communities or formations. Hence, because cactus wrens evidently occupy several plant communities and are not isolated in habitat, the Service concludes that providing protection pursuant to the Act for birds living in some (but not all) of these plant communities and habitats is inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the cactus wrens occupying coastal southern California are not likely significant to the continued existence of a species that occurs in portions of southern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Texas, in the United States, and mainland Mexico. The species is relatively common throughout much of its range. However, since the birds occupying coastal southern California are not distinct, the issue of significance need not be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This finding announced herein is not intended to discount the importance of the coastal sage scrub ecosystem in southern California, which is the subject of intense multispecies and ecosystem planning efforts that have been undertaken and endorsed by the Service; the Secretary of Interior; the Resources Agency, State of California; the California Department of Fish and Game; numerous local governments; citizens' groups; and individual citizens. Cactus wrens living in coastal southern California have declined in numbers, and coastal sage scrub habitats are becoming increasingly depleted. Efforts to conserve these depleted habitats will be of benefit to cactus wrens residing in coastal southern California, Federal candidate species, and other sensitive species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the absence of sufficient evidence that a listable entity exists, the Service concludes that it is appropriate to transfer the ``coastal population of the cactus wren'' from category 2 candidate status to category 3B. Category 3B species are taxa that, on the basis of current taxonomic understanding, do not represent distinct taxa, including vertebrate populations, meeting the Act's definition of ``species.'' Such taxa could be reevaluated in the future on the basis of new information. In that regard, the service will continue to accept information on the taxonomy and distinctness of cactus wren taxa and the significance of the Pacific coast population segment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 17  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Endangered and threatened species, Exports, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and Transportation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mollie H.

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Corsica faces fraud crackdown The French Agriculture Ministry yesterday promised a crackdown on Corsican farmers accused of defrauding Brussels of millions of francs' worth of subsidies. Contrary to reports from Brussels, the ministry claimed there was no question of cutting off aid to the whole island because only a minority of farmers were involved. The report by a European Commission team of inspectors which visited Corsica in September found widespread fraud, including false addresses given by farmers to get special aid for mountain regions, bogus subdivision of cattle herds to sidestep ceilings placed on the size of herd eligible for aid, and double counting of cows. The report, leaked to Liberation newspaper yesterday, said one of the reasons for recurrent forest fires on the island was that farmers turned to arson to clear mountain bush for pasture. The Commission has recommended that cattle premia, paid out of EU and national funds, should be linked from now on to better protection of the environment.</p>

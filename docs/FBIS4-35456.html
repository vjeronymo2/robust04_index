			<p>BFN     [Text] The budget session of the National Assembly began  at the Parliament House in Islamabad today. The speaker, Syed  Yusuf Raza Gilani, is chairing the session. The opposition,  ending their boycott of the National Assembly, participated in  the proceedings of the house today. Speaking during question  hour, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, said strict action  will be taken against those responsible for the fire incident in  the parliament building. She said her government believes in  the rule of law and nobody is above the law. Committees and  commissions were formed in the past, but no action was taken.  The prime minister said the present government has launched a  moral crusade and nobody will be spared.    The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has welcomed the  opposition's decision to end the boycott of the National  Assembly and described it as a positive step. Talking to  newsmen at the Parliament House in Islamabad this afternoon, Ms.  Benazir Bhutto said she had advised the opposition two days  earlier to end their boycott and fulfill their constitutional  responsibilities as elected representatives. She said she would  also respond positively and invite the opposition leader and  leaders of other political parties for discussions on economic  issues over a cup of tea.    Replying to a question regarding her challenge to the  opposition for submitting their resignations, the prime minister  said she was confident that they would not submit their  resignations to the speaker of the National Assembly. It was  her assessment as a political leader. She said after last  year's just and fair election, the politics of resignations has  come to an end. Those who are elected do not resign.    To a question about the Sindh situation, Ms. Benazir Bhutto  said the situation in the rural and urban areas of the province  is serious for internal and external reasons. External forces  have trained youths in the interior of Sindh as well in the  cities for the purpose of terrorist activities and have provided  them arms. In the past, only administrative steps had been  taken to face the situation. We have decided to tackle the  issue politically. She said her government, which is the  people's government, is going to take long-term and short-term  steps to resolve the problems faced by the people of Karachi.  These include provision of drinking water, more electricity,  transport and hospitals.</p>

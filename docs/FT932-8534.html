			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Danish Yes vote boosts treaty: Maastricht wins 56.8% support DENMARK delivered a decisive vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty on European union last night, to the profound relief of its partners in the European Community. The Yes victory, by a margin of 56.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent with all the votes counted, reversed last June's rejection of the treaty by Danish voters. Last year's result had thrown into serious doubt the EC strategy for closer economic and political union. Yesterday, in a turnout of 86.2 per cent, Danes voted to accept Maastricht, this time with the crucial proviso of the Edinburgh agreements which gave Denmark a series of opt-outs from the treaty's key programmes. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, claimed victory shortly after the first computer predictions were broadcast. 'I am happy that it is such a clear result . . . it is a very important Yes,' he said. Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister, proclaimed: 'This is good for Denmark and it is good for Europe.' Looking forward to the EC summit in Copenhagen next month, which Denmark will chair as current president of the Community, Mr Helveg Petersen said: 'Denmark can speak with greater authority.' Ms Drude Dahlerup, spokeswoman of the anti-treaty June Movement, had conceded defeat shortly after the first exit polls, saying: 'It's clearly a disappointment. It's a historic decision going the wrong way.' But she said the size of the No vote showed that: 'The people are still divided and parliamentarians must listen to all those people who voted against the treaty.' Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said last night that Denmark's decision would provide 'a stimulus to the Community'. The Yes vote would help the EC to leave behind a difficult period of 'inaction' at a time when it faced 'many internal problems - especially economic stagnation and rising unemployment'. Mr Delors added: 'For all these reasons, Europe needs a new impulse.' The EC welcomed the Danish vote, saying it would allow Denmark to continue contributing to the process of European union. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said the vote was 'a rejection of the Euro-sceptics'. He went on: 'By voting Yes, the Danish people have decided their future lies in common with their partners in the EC on the basis of the Treaty on European Union . . . I am happy that the Danish voters have acted with real European responsibility.' After Denmark, only Britain and Germany, where the treaty is being challenged in the constitutional court, have not yet ratified Maastricht. Mr Kinkel said he hoped all member states would now clear the way for Maastricht ratification before parliaments went into recess for the summer. Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman for the Christian Democrats in the German parliament, said the vote meant 'the British cannot hide behind the Danes. Such an attitude was always unworthy of them. Now they must decide for themselves whether their answer is Yes or No.' Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic affairs, said: 'The Danes have decided after long and detailed analysis that, far from forcing them down the road of an over- centralised and bureaucratic union, the Maastricht treaty will strengthen the ties between European nations without threatening their identity.' Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political affairs, described the outcome as 'an important day for Europe'. 'We are looking with high expectations towards London for the British House of Commons to complete its ratification of the treaty,' he added. France, which last June had initially urged EC partners to brush aside Denmark's rejection of Maastricht, last night welcomed yesterday's vote. The foreign ministry, with an eye to British ratification, said it was important to implement Maastricht as soon as possible. In the first Danish vote last June, the verdict went against ratification by 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent, a majority of only 46,000 votes out of almost 3.3m cast. The Edinburgh EC summit last December granted Denmark opt-outs from the treaty's provisions on a unified currency, defence policy, community-wide legal and police co-operation, as well as union citizenship.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mr Jonathan Agnew - Correction An article in the Financial Times on August 6 incorrectly reported Mr Jonathan Agnew as having been dismissed by Kleinwort Benson Group. In fact, as Kleinworts said in a press release on May 4, Mr Agnew intended to resign in August after the announcement of the interim results. The chairman's statement of August 5 confirmed Mr Agnew's resignation on August 6. The FT apologises to Mr Agnew for any embarrassment caused by the error.</p>

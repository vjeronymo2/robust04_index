			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Panel backs approval of Aids drug A PANEL of medical advisers to the US government yesterday recommended approval of DDC, a new anti-viral drug, for the treatment of Aids, provided it is used in combination with the drug AZT, writes Martin Dickson in New York. This is the first time DDC, sold as Hivid and produced by the Swiss company Hoffman-La Roche, has been given an approval recommendation for use outside of clinical tests. Earlier in the day the committee declined to recommend that the US Food and Drug Administration approve the use of DDC alone for treatment of Aids. AZT, marketed as Retrovir and developed by Britain's Wellcome, is the only anti- viral approved for all patients with Aids symptoms. The panel was swayed by a study of 56 patients, which showed positive effects from combined use of DDC and AZT. The FDA need not accept the panel's findings but usually attaches great weight to its pronouncements.</p>

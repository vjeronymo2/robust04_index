			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Israel and PLO set out peace timetable ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday began two months of detailed negotiations in Cairo and Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba to implement their outline peace agreement. In Taba, where Israeli and Palestinian security and military officials, once bitter enemies, are meeting to prepare a protocol for Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho from December 13, the opening day of talks was marred when the Israeli delegation vetoed three Palestinian delegates. Israeli officials refused to sit across the table from Mr Amin al-Hindi, PLO security chief, whom Israeli newspapers and security officials have accused of helping to plan the massacre of Israelis at the 1972 Munich Olympic games. An Israeli foreign ministry official said: 'Munich was one of the greatest traumas for Jews. We are prepared to make some compromises with Palestinians but there is a limit.' Two other delegates were vetoed because they live in Jerusalem, the most sensitive issue between Israel and the PLO in future talks over territorial jurisdiction. The three delegates were swiftly replaced by others in the Palestinian party. Both sides sought to play down the incident. Mr Nabil Shaath, head of the PLO delegation, said: 'Nobody was blacklisted, nobody was white-listed ..we have no problem about composition of the delegation.' In a joint Israeli-PLO statement, Mr Shaath and Major-General Amnon Shahak, head of the Israeli delegation, stressed the talks had been 'cordial and constructive'. The two sides agreed to set up two working groups to divide security from civilian issues and to make the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails a 'priority matter'. The two sub-committees will also focus on the territorial delimitation of the Jericho area and the transfer of powers from the Israeli military-run administration to a Palestinian interim authority. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, speaking to Israel Radio during a visit to China, said the outcome of the Taba talks would be a test for extending self-rule to other Palestinian areas captured by the Jewish state in the 1967 war. 'Without meaningful progress in the committee to advance Gaza-Jericho, all the rest will be simply marginal and secondary,' he said. In separate talks in Cairo, the two sides set a tight timetable for further detailed negotiations and established two additional committees on economic and regional co-operation. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, wrapping up the first one-day meeting of a joint PLO-Israeli liaison committee, said in Cairo: 'We shall make a supreme effort to meet the time (for withdrawal) and if possible, attempt to do so earlier'. Both Mr Peres and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, (Abu Mazen), who headed the PLO delegation, emphasised the 'positive' spirit of the talks, meeting privately before the inaugural two-hour session of the liaison committee. At both the Taba and Cairo meetings, sharp-suited Israeli and Palestinian security agents milled side by side, stony faced, in the corridors of the international hotels hosting the talks in what experts said was one of the first public demonstrations of Israeli-Palestinian security co-operation.</p>

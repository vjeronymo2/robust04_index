			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Wassall/Evode Evode's final defence document contains much spirited rhetoric. Still, Wassall's generosity - or lack of it - will be the main determinant of whether its bid for the adhesives group comes unstuck. Evode has shown it is on the mend and should benefit from its high gearing in any upswing - although the absence of a current trading statement is curious. But Wassall has exposed Evode's rickety financial structure enough to worry shareholders about its continued independence. The conglomerate clearly does not want to overpay - for the sake of long-term reputation as much as immediate profitability. The market, though, is hinting it will have to lift its 80p offer by a quarter to succeed. Wassall's reluctance to pay up may make things tight. Judging such calls correctly is what distinguishes the good conglomerate from the bad.</p>

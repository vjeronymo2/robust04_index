			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Banks fail to agree borrowing facilities for Mosaic FAILURE TO agree borrowing facilities with its bankers yesterday led Mosaic Investments to delay the redemption of preference shares, withdraw its planned final dividend and suspend temporarily the listing of its shares at 60p. This is the second cloud in two months which has passed over the mini-conglomerate, based in Birmingham. In July the board decided Mosaic needed a stronger focus on packaging and promotion activities, sold the engineering division and deposed Mr Brian Disbury as chairman. In his stead it installed Mr Gregory Hutchings, who owns 8.5 per cent of the shares but is better known as chief executive of Tomkins, a larger conglomerate. Mosaic's current problems spring from the demand by Mr Rodney Day for redemption of Pounds 2.99m worth of convertible preference shares, acquired when his advertising company was taken over. The redemption should have taken place on Monday, but Mosaic was not able to reach an agreement with its bankers on financing this one-off payment. According to Mr Leon Angrave, the managing director, this was because 'of the complexity and the term of the facilities rather than the amount.' Mosaic was asking for funds to meet that demand in addition to normal working capital. Three banks were involved, Mr Angrave said, although he would not name them. In the last available annual report for Mosaic, Midland Bank in West Bromwich and Barclays Bank in Swindon were listed as the group's principal bankers. Mosaic had been negotiating with the banks, and with Mr Day, for between two and three weeks. It expected the bank negotiations to be completed in about three weeks. However, because of the subordination of ordinary shareholders to preference holders, inability to redeem the preference shares on the due date had led to the withdrawal of the recommended 1991-92 final dividend of 5.5p, which would have cost Pounds 897,000. The hiatus led in turn to the suspension of the shares 2p higher than their overnight close, giving the group a market value of Pounds 10m. The shares, in spite of recent market firmness, have been at the bottom of their trading range, suggesting that the City remained unimpressed with the changes of last July. Mr Angrave said there was no reason why the group should change shape because of the problems with the preference shares and the dividend. Mosaic told the Stock Exchange it was trading profitably. It had net borrowings of Pounds 500,000 and pro forma net assets of Pounds 12m.</p>

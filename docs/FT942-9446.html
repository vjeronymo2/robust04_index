			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unworthy view of Labour position on Europe Your negative editorial 'Labour after John Smith' (May 13) is unworthy of a serious newspaper. Your question, 'Who can say today where Labour stands on any important aspect of the development of the European Union', shows also an arrogant ignorance. At its conference last year Labour adopted a detailed statement on Europe, Prosperity through Co-operation. Subsequently, Labour's Treasury team made a detailed submission to the Delors consultation entitled Economic Renewal in Europe. There have also been papers produced on European employment and environment policies and in many other areas. The European dimension is now fully built into the range of our domestic policies. I find it deeply depressing that a serious political commentator can dismiss this evidence so lightly or, even worse, can apparently remain in total ignorance of it. Joyce Quin, Labour frontbench spokesperson on European Affairs, House of Commons, London SW1</p>

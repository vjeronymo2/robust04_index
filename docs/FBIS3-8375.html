			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, March 8 (TANJUG) -- President of  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) Zoran Lilic said he hoped peace  would soon be restored in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "If the war continues, the danger of its spilling is very  real, and this means a war in the Balkans and Europe, not to go  anywhere further," Lilic said in an interview published by the  Banja Luka paper GLAS SRPSKI on Tuesday.    He said last week's U.S.-brokered agreement on a  Moslem-Croat  federation in Bosnia simply could not work, adding it was wrong  to exclude the Serbs from the talks.    Unless it is aimed against the Serb side, it should not  bother anyone in the Bosnian Serb republic or Yugoslavia, the  Yugoslav president said.    Bosnian Croats and Moslems started the 23-month-old war as  allies against local Serbs, but have later turned against each  other in an attempt to win more territory. Acting under the  U.S. pressure, they met in Washington last week to sign a  preliminary deal on forming a federation in Bosnia, which would  subsequently form a confederation with neighbouring Croatia.    Political analysts say Washington has opted for this  initiative in an attempt to isolate the Serbs before  pressurizing them at the conference table to make more  territorial concessions.    Arguing that the war had been imposed on Bosnian Serbs,  Lilic  said: "Were it for the Serbs, the war would never have started  ... anyway, they have not been fighting for months." [as  received]    "Bosnian Serbs had no other choice but to defend their homes  and their very existence, and Yugoslavs had no other choice but  to support Bosnian Serbs in their just struggle for survival,"  Lilic said.    "International media had been demonizing Bosnian Serbs and  fabricating lies about them although all relevant international  factors are very well aware that Bosnian Serbs have been trying  very hard from the very outset of the war to help find a  peaceful settlement as soon as possible."    To show their readiness to conclude peace, the Serbs have so  far offered considerable territorial concessions to the Moslems,  withdrawn their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo and agreed,  on certain conditions, that the city be administered by the  United Nations, but this has not satisfied the Moslems, Lilic  said.</p>

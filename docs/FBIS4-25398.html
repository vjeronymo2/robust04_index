			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Japanese Government  released an annual report today calling for more aid for other  Asian nations as a way to help revitalize the global economy.    Japan should contribute to the revitalization of the global  economy by offering positive assistance to other Asian countries  in their efforts to help themselves, while maintaining and  expanding its own dynamic growth, said the white paper on  economic cooperation for the fiscal year 1994. It added that  Japan should expand its direct investment in and imports from  other Asian countries.    The white paper, prepared by the International Trade and  Industry Ministry, described the newly-industrializing economies  (NIES) in Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) as "the growth center for world economic development."    The report consists of three parts -- current trends in the  developing countries, countries aiming at further development  through the utilization of the market mechanism and the  expansion of dynamism in Asia.    It said that gross domestic product (GDP) last year in the  developing countries showed a stable growth of 6.1 percent. The  growth in Asia reached 8.4 percent, while favorable growth was  observed in the Middle East and in Central and South America.    On the other hand, economic growth remained sluggish in  Africa, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the report  said.    It paid particular attention to China, Vietnam and India,  devoting much space to analyzing various problems related to  economic reform in these countries.    "China has achieved rapid growth again, as in the previous  year, by gradually promoting reform and more open policies since  the introduction of a market economy," the report said.    The country's trade and investment have expanded and inter-  dependence with the world economy has deepened, especially in  China's coastal areas.    But the paper noted that China still faced many problems,  such as regional differences between the rapidly-growing coastal  areas and the inland areas where the infrastructure is weak.    It said Japan's overseas aid in 1992 fell by 36.3 percent to  15,944 million U.S. dollars, smooth growth in official  development assistance (ODA) being more than offset by a  substantial drop in private-sector aid.    Japan's ODA in 1992 totalled 11,332 billion dollars, making  the country the top donor in the world for the second  consecutive year, the report said.</p>

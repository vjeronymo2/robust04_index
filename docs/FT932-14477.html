			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Minister to set out rolling-stock plans THE GOVERNMENT will today give fresh details of how Pounds 150m earmarked in last year's Autumn Statement for establishing a leasing market for railway rolling stock is to be allocated. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, is expected to use transport questions in the Commons to tell MPs which company has been chosen to build the rolling stock. British Rail has put forward details of two competing schemes for using the promised government funding. The BR proposals apparently leave the government with a choice between financing replacement trains for the London Euston to Glasgow line and replacing outdated rolling stock on Kent coast routes. BR believes both proposed upgrades are necessary, but does not expect the money to be shared between them. If the Euston to Glasgow line were selected, about 15 new InterCity 225 trains would probably be built by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering company. If the Kent coast option were chosen the new rolling stock would be built by ABB Transportation (formerly BREL).</p>

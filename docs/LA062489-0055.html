			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> B-2 COSTS TO ESCALATE, AF FIGURES SHOW  </P> <P> The B-2 stealth bombers will cost more than $530 million each, according to  cost figures declassified Friday by the Air Force, but Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.),  chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, quickly predicted that the  aircraft and its production costs "won't fly" in Congress.  </P> <P> The service plans to build 132 of the radar-evading planes at a total cost of  $70 billion, an increase from an earlier estimate of $67.7 billion. The Air  Force has already spent $17.3 billion on the B-2 and has requested $39 billion  for the program over the next five years, including about $8 billion a year in  the early 1990s when production will be at its peak.  </P> <P> According to Air Force year-by-year figures, while the Bush Administration had  planned to slow costs for the B-2 over the next three years, it would sharply  increase B-2 spending from $5.3 billion in 1991 and $7.8 billion in 1992 to  $8.4 billion in 1993, or roughly the same amount in 1993 as planned by the  Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> "We will not spend $7 billion to $8 billion a year for B-2 in its three peak  funding years," Aspin said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.G.: "Counting on a Leader--But Whom?"] </F>   [Text] The ideals born of the storm have dissipated.  On whom are we oriented right now? Which leader can society rely  on, a society in which theft and deceit have become the norm,  where corruption has encompassed the highest echelons of power?  On what individual can our youth orient itself?    It turns out our fears are somewhat exaggerated. Here are  certain data obtained by the Laboratory of Applied Sociology of  the Siberian Personnel Center (headed by Candidate of Historical  Sciences N.D. Vavilina). Sociologists conducted studies among  the population of Novosibirsk Oblast on the topic "How Young  People Feel Socially" (directive quota sampling, 1,500 analysis  units). Particular features of the material and social condition  of youth were identified, levels of income for certain age  categories delineated. Reasons for anxiety, attitudes towards  the processes taking place in society, and attitudes towards the  structures of authority were revealed. Also appearing in the  questionnaire was the question: What kind of leader do young  people prefer?    The sociologists focused their attention on young people in  the 18-25 age bracket (Group A) and 26-30 age bracket (Group B).    Significant differences between these two groups were noted  in the determination of type of leader.    Some 49 percent of those surveyed in Group A expressed  preference for a leader distinguished by virtue of  professionalism and competence. This percentage was somewhat  greater--52 percent--in Group B.    But it turns out that a professional specialist competent in  his sphere loses to a person who is simply decent, honest, and  independent of political outlook. Such a leader--honest and  decent--is preferred by 56 percent of the Group A respondents.  But these young people are clearly less democratic than their  older comrades. They clearly desire more than the others to  bring order with a hard-fist approach--44 percent. The 25- and  30-year-olds, on the contrary, are more cautious and basically  do not trust a leader capable of "bringing order to society  decisively, with a hard fist." Only 36 percent of Group B  respondents expressed support for such a leader. But they too  attribute a very great deal of importance to moral  qualities--honesty and decency, as well as to professionalism.  The young people surveyed did not attribute such importance to  questions regarding whether or not this prospective leader was  party-affiliated during the days of the CPSU, whether or not he  supported Yeltsin's policies (although there were more  supporters of the president in Group B than in Group A), and  which party and movement positions he advocated.    Of course, we are not tolerant of others' opinions. Only 18  percent of 18-year-olds and 12 percent of 20-year-olds had the  courage to admit that they listen to and take into account the  opinions of other people.    The antiparty sentiment of young people was also manifest.  Over half of all groups either desire to give power to nonparty  candidates or they do not trust any existing parties whatsoever.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Harkin has 78% of Iowa Democrat caucus vote SENATOR Tom Harkin won 78 per cent of the votes in Monday night's Democratic party caucuses in his home state of Iowa, comfortably exceeding his target of bettering the 59 per cent score of President Jimmy Carter in 1980. However, his faltering presidential campaign seemed unlikely to be able to gain much impetus from this local triumph. None of the other Democratic candidates had campaigned on Senator Harkin's home turf, and with fewer than 30,000 people attending the caucuses - barely 4 per cent of registered Democrats - the vote could scarcely be hailed as a plebiscite. Iowa's caucuses, the first to be held in each presidential campaign, have since 1972 strongly influenced the eventual nominations of both parties, especially the Democrats. This has probably contributed to a stream of Democratic candidates who were more dovish and pro-farm than the nation at large. In 1988, however, both parties' Iowa winners subsequently dropped out of the race, while Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee demonstrated that a candidate could ignore Iowa and still build a strong campaign on the cluster of primaries to be held on Super Tuesday - which this year will take place on March 10. Yet Mr Harkin, whose prairie populist campaign has failed to capitalise on a promising start at raising campaign funds and winning support from trade unionists and the other traditional Democratic power brokers, yesterday put a good face on his Iowa victory. He said the vote would give him the extra momentum needed to win over the many New Hampshire voters who are still undecided about next week's primary. Recent opinion polls place Mr Harkin fourth in New Hampshire behind former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Between 10 and 20 per cent of voters are still undecided. Mr Harkin, who describes himself as the only old-fashioned Democrat in the race, has compared his position to that of Senator Gary Hart in 1984. Like many other beneficiaries of what is known as the the Iowa 'bounce', Senator Hart did not actually win, but fared so much better than expected that his campaign caught fire, helping him to sweep the New Hampshire primary a week later. The Iowa victory will still give Senator Harkin more delegates than any other candidate, even if he fails in New Hampshire. Mr Harkin claims good support in Maine and South Dakota, the next two states to vote, but political commentators believe he will do poorly in the mainly southern Super Tuesday states.</p>

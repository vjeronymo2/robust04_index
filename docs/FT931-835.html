			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The time bomb under planet Earth: Global change threatens to plunge the human race into crisis. But what to do? Paul Kennedy examines the options . . . NO OBSERVER of contemporary trends can doubt that, as we pass from this century to the next, we are all going to be affected by broad forces for global change. The internationalisation of manufacturing, services and investment flow, with their impacts upon companies, towns and entire regions, is intensifying. New technologies, bright with promise for their inventors and investors, threaten to undermine traditional ways of making, growing and trading things. National currencies are dwarfed by the sheer volume of daily foreign-exchange dealings. As Earth adds to its total population by nearly 95m people each year, the pressure upon environments and resources grows greater, the pace of illegal migration quickens, and entire societies in the developing world collapse under the strain. While each of us has to grapple with our own needs, we are also beginning to look anxiously towards the future. Given the complexity of these forces for global change, it is not surprising that interpretations abound of what they may imply. To the 'techno-triumphalists' in the United States - such as economist George Gilder and Ben Wattenberg, of the American Enterprise Institute - capitalist enterprise and scientific breakthrough are transforming our lives in profound though beneficial ways that only left-wing doomsters will deny. To Kenichi Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese arm of management consultant McKinsey, a 'borderless world,' in which the rules of the global market prevail over traditional state-centred concerns and governments become increasingly invisible, is at last in sight. By contrast, Lester Thurow, dean of the Alfred P. Sloan school of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, detects the emergence of three giant trading blocs - north American, Europe and east Asia - engaged in a bitter, head-to-head struggle for global economic advantage. The most recent world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland - that annual barometer of the prevailing economic mood - was full of talk about protectionism, containing the surging Japanese trade surpluses, paralysis in the Gatt process, the sagging German economy, saving Russia, and quarrels over aerospace subsidies. Not everyone, it seems, finds capitalism's 'creative gales' as stimulating as Gilder. But to focus on issues such as US-Japan trade relations or the plight of French farmers, important as they are, betrays a very 'north-ocentric' bias that could, in turn, obscure understanding of the truly global changes affecting Earth and its 5.4bn inhabitants. With the benefit of hindsight, our children and grandchildren will presumably recognise, far more clearly than we, the relative insignificance of John Major's present difficulties or of Italian political scandals. Upon which trends, however, should our gaze be focused were we to attempt to answer the question: 'What are the really big forces for change bearing down upon our planet between now and 2025?' The first change, surely, is that there are likely to be many more of us - perhaps as many as 8.5bn or 9bn people - and that around 95 per cent of those additional people will be born in the poorer regions of the globe. By contrast, the populations of the world's richer societies are forecast to grow slowly or even (as in Japan, Italy and France) to decline in absolute terms - unless, of course, they admit many millions of immigrants eager to flee their own lands, a point to which I will return. Europe, north America and Japan may indeed slug it out head-to-head commercially over the next few decades but, as they do so, their collective demographic power will be falling steadily. When our present century began, Europe was at the height of its international influence and, perhaps not coincidentally, enjoyed its brightest-ever share of world population; during the next century, that share will shrivel to a mere 7 per cent or less. These demographic forecasts suggest that the 21st century could bring neither a 'new world order' nor a 'borderless world' but, instead, a deeply troubled and fractured planet. China's population, which already (at 1.1bn) outstrips its land and water resources, is projected to rise to 1.5bn, exceeded only by India, heading towards 2bn. Africa, buckling under its existing 680m inhabitants, has perhaps only the growing pandemic of Aids to curb its forecast rise to 1.6bn by 2025; and large rises are also expected in the populations of Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil, Mexico and Iran. From all of these places, a gigantic internal migration will take place as peasants seeking jobs stream into shanty-cities of 20-25m inhabitants with totally inadequate infrastructure and utilities. Finally, these will be demographically adolescent societies, with perhaps half of their populations under the age of 20 (or even, as in Kenya's case, under 16) - an ideal prescription for social turbulence. But why should a Piedmont farmer or a Tokyo housewife, beset already by problems of their own, concern themselves with the plight of Bangladesh? Hasn't our planet always contained a rich minority and a poor majority? Will we not have enough of a challenge to prepare our own societies for the technology-driven changes of the next century without being distracted by the fate of badly-run developing countries? What, in any case, have the poverty-stricken peoples of Africa in common with well-heeled bankers and brokers engaged in creating a 'borderless world' in the north? Apart from humanitarian grounds, there are three powerful reasons why we should take seriously these disturbing demographic trends and seek to lessen their impact. The first is the possibility that the collective economic activities of 5bn-8bn people may indeed be creating a 'greenhouse effect' of global warming as ever more trace gases pour into our atmosphere. It is no longer an issue of local environmental damage, serious though it is to witness the gross pollution of the Mediterranean and the disappearance of the Aral sea; the destruction of plant species and wildlife habitats in Brazil; and the steady denuding of India (where the forest cover has shrunk from one-half to one-seventh in this century alone). The eco-system itself could be at stake. While the developed countries probably possess the capital and scientific resources to become environmentally 'clean' by early next century, the atmosphere effects of such virtue are likely to be eclipsed by the continued increase in pollutants from China, India, Mexico, and other fast-industrialising countries now unable to afford sophisticated emission controls. If we are concerned about the varied consequences of global warming, rises in sea levels, increased heat stress and greater weather instabilities, we need to devise technologies to assist poorer nations to reduce emissions in the first place. Equally serious could be the prospect of further surges in large-scale illegal migration from stress-ridden, over-populated societies to richer, demographically-stagnant regions in the north. Already, millions and millions are being held in camps or are en route from central America, Africa, south Asia and the Middle East to the US, Germany, Australia and other favoured destinations - this movement being stimulated (ironically) by a communications revolution which displays, globally, television programmes like Dallas and Brideshead Revisited. Already, the Spanish and Italian navies are on daily patrol to check the flow of illegal immigrants; but as Africa's population threatens to treble while Europe's stagnates, ought we not to expect much more of this in the future? And how far will the robotics revolution coming out of Japan - where automated factories are assembling products more efficiently and cheaply than plants employing low-cost labour in south-east Asia - steadily undermine the task of creating 40-50m new jobs world-wide each year to ensure employment for fast-growing youth? If the latter cannot get jobs in the developing world, or if the rich countries' slide towards protectionism undercuts poorer nations' chances of paying their way in the world through exports, should we really be surprised if masses of people head north to find employment? Are European nations, already showing signs of xenophobia at the relatively small percentage of immigrants in their midst, capable of becoming real multi-cultural societies? If not, will the racial tensions worsen? Finally, there is the consideration that not all of these troubled states are like Ethiopia: weak, and unlikely to threaten us in the future. The same explosive combination of fast-growing populations, frustrated youth, depletion of land and water resources and so on occurs also in parts of the world - Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, the Euphrates valley, south-west Asia - where fundamentalist, anti-western movements or ambitious regimes exist; where territorial disputes are long-standing; and towards which vast numbers of sophisticated, mass-destruction weapons continue to be exported. If we prefer to see the secular, pro-western regimes remain in power in Cairo and Algiers, is it not in our own best interest to seek to improve their countrymen's conditions? And must we wait until Rome or Frankfurt are in range of north African-based missile systems before we really get serious about arms' proliferation? This brings us to the fundamental question: granted the above arguments, what, if anything, can be done during the next years to ameliorate and slow down (better still, reverse) these potentially dangerous trends? Clearly, a great deal depends upon the peoples and leaders of developing nations themselves. European and American assistance can hardly be expected to produce improvements in countries where corrupt and obstructive regimes prevail; ethnic and religious rivalries dominate politics; deeply-held animist or fundamentalist religions impair any changes in the status and education of women (and thus also impair the prospects of reducing average family size); and faulty economic policies smother growth. On the other hand, we ought to be ready to offer a package of policies to reform-minded, developing countries which plead for our co-operation and aid. These should include increasing the amount of development monies to at least the internationally agreed-upon target of 0.7 per cent of GDP annually; ensuring that such aid goes to environmentally-sound and sustainable projects in co-operation with local communities, and not to the clumsy 'giganticist' schemes of the 1960s (steel mills, huge dams, etc); supporting the tens of thousands of engineers and scientists now released from cold war-related research to use their talents to produce low-level solutions to these global problems - small 'solar ovens' to cook a village's daily meals, and solar energy projects in general are a good example here; transferring the fruits of breakthroughs in bio-tech agriculture (disease-resistant and head-resistant crops) without requiring large patent and user fees from poor nations; responding to the requests from tens of millions of married women in developing countries for safe and inexpensive contraceptives to permit them to stabilise family size; and, in general, aiding access to eduction for as many girls and women in those societies as possible. None of these programmes guarantees that we will head off global disasters. Taken together, however, they offer the best prospect of repairing at least part of our planet's troubled condition. One further ingredient is necessary. Concerned intellectuals, editors, businessmen and members of the public cannot by themselves ensure that such reform policies will be implemented. This requires the whole-hearted co-operation of political leaders, especially those in today's richer, democratic societies. And therein, alas, lies the final problem. We now have, in the Clinton-Gore administration, an American government that, for the first time in a decade, is concerned deeply about global demographic and environmental issues as well as domestic renewal - a significant change from the era of Reagan/Bush neglect that was so manifest at last June's Earth Summit in Rio. Ironically, this time around, we could see Washington more willing to assist poorer countries while many of the other OECD nations drag their feet. With the ruling parties of Japan and Italy in a state of collapse and the governments of Germany, France, Britain, Canada and many others experiencing record levels of unpopularity, they are probably incapable at present of implementing generous, far-sighted policies to aid our global ills. But if little or nothing is done soon, won't we and our children all pay a far larger price for that neglect in the future?

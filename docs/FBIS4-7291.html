			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, 27 Apr -- ROK President Kim Yong-sam's  letter in response to ASAHI SHIMBUN's questions is summarized  below:  <H5>  The North Korean Nuclear Issue and China's Role </H5>   The reality with respect to North Korea's [DPRK] nuclear  program is that the North is thought to have secured enough  plutonium to produce at least one to three (nuclear arms).    China has had friendly relations with North Korea for a long  time, supplying crude oil and foodstuffs to that country. China  can exercise more influence on North Korea than any other  country. In light of the fact that almost all of what China  wanted in the process of the UN Security Council adopting a UN  secretary general announcement was accepted, it is hoped China  will continue to fulfill its responsible role in solving the  nuclear question hereafter.  <H5>  U.S.-DPRK Talks and South-North Dialogue </H5>   Removal of suspicion about the DPRK's nuclear program is the  first stop for restoration of trust between South and North  Korea. Only when this question is resolved will South and North  Korea be able to march toward substantive improvement of  relations step by step.    The issue of the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise "Team  Spirit" will be resolved automatically if South and North Korea  enter the stage of conducting mutual nuclear inspections.    We are making efforts to create a favorable atmosphere for  U.S.-DRPK working-level talks in the hope of bringing about an  early solution to the nuclear question. We hope the  working-level talks to be held soon will bear substantive  results.    I hope I will be able to build a firm basis for South-North  reunification during my term of office.  <H5>  The North Korean Military Threat </H5>   It is true that North Korea has stepped up antiaircraft  drills in and around the Yongbyong district (where the  nuclear-related facilities are located) and has reinforced its  military capabilities in part since its nuclear arms development  question became a subject of criticism by the international  community.    But we have not been able to observe specific signs that  North Korea will make military provocations; the "crisis on the  Korean peninsula" (reported) in overseas mass media recently can  be said to have been exaggerated in some parts. North Korea has  a heavily armed, 1 million-strong regular force, and long-range  missiles it developed on its own. It has 65 percent of its  military power deployed along the demilitarized zone.  <H5>  IAEA Inspections </H5>   North Korea must not only accept additional inspections on  the radiation chemical laboratory being discussed with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as well as inspections  accompanying the changes of fuel rods, but must also accept  special inspections by the IAEA on unreported facilities. These  special inspections and South-North mutual nuclear inspections  are two different things.  <H5>  Security Cooperation in East Asia and the Question of Japan </H5> Becoming a UN Security Council Permanent Member    Since the end of the Cold War, security conditions in the  Northeast Asia region have in general turned for the better, but  instability remains because of such problem as the nuclear  suspicion in North Korea. The continued U.S. role is extremely  important to build a stable order in this area.    Furthermore, in view of the unclear security conditions of  the Northeast Asian region, a dialogue on security is necessary.  Dialogue among countries in this region should be conducted in  ways to augment such bilateral security systems as those  existing between South Korea and the United States, and between  the United States and Japan. South Korea is willing to actively  participate in security dialogue in the region and believes it  should have close cooperation with Japan while doing so.    We think discussions on reorganizing the UN Security Council  are appropriate timewise. We hope Japan will play constructive  roles--appropriate for its national power--in international  arenas like the United Nations.    Under its reform and open-door policy, China will continue  to  grow economically; and will attempt to achieve improved unity  nationally and to play increased roles internationally. We hope  that in doing so, China will make contributions to bringing  about stability in Northeast Asia.</p>

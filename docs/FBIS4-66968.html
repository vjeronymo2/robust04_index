			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] Federal Judicial Police agents, backed by search  warrants issued by Nuevo Leon State's Sixth District Court of  Criminal Proceedings, discovered a clandestine arms and  explosives factory in the town of Villa de Juarez. There, they  seized rifles, 2,000 useful cartridges, caps, exploders, a  cartridge reloading machine, and explosive and detonating  substances, among other items.    According to reports submitted to the Office of the  Assistant  Attorney for Local Offices and Inspection, headed by Alfonso  Cabrera Morales, the authorities confiscated the following  equipment on a ranch in the municipality of San Pedro Garza  Garcia, also in Nuevo Leon: 200 useful cartridges of 9, 223, 76,  and 380 mm caliber; eight loaders for an Uzi submachinegun,  squad pistols, a 38 caliber special revolver, and a 380 mm  caliber squad revolver; as well as nearly half a kg of marijuana.    The Attorney General's Office noted that, in the first case,  four rifles, a squad pistol, two professional bows, and  precision accessories for arming steel-tipped arrows, all  apparently owned by persons associated with the drug traffic,  were also placed at the disposal of the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office.    It reported that the arms and explosives factory was located  on the ranch known as San Roque, in the municipality of Villa de  Juarez, where the public poisoners presumably were hiding. Since  arrest warrants had been issued for them, the ranch was searched  on the basis of a court order from the aforementioned district  court. No arrests were made.    As for the confiscation in San Pedro Garza Garcia, the  investigative agents specified that the weapons were discovered  at No. 122 Versalles Street, in the Colonia Del Valle. It is  presumed that members of a group engaged in drug purchases and  sales gather there. The traces of marijuana found inside the  domicile prompted the assumption that its occupants intended to  meet soon with other public poisoners to close a deal involving  that drug.    It was learned that officials from the local branch of the  Attorney General's Office in Nuevo Leon have requested  information from U.S. authorities regarding the origin of the  seized weapons and other items, as well as the cartridges. It is  thought that their owners are connected with arms trafficking  groups operating on the southern United States border, and are  very likely trading that equipment for drugs.    It was stressed that the investigation is being continued,  and that information is now available on the property owners.    Arrest warrants have already been issued for two of them,  who  are expected to be placed at the court's disposal within the  next few days. Wanted for crimes against health, they are now  charged with other crimes specified and penalized in the Federal  Law on Firearms and Explosives, as well as the Criminal Code.</p>

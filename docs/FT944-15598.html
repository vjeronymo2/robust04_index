			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Honda to double Thai capacity Honda is investing more than Y10bn (Dollars 100m) in a new car-making plant in Thailand, a move which will double its Thai capacity and may lead to the production of a small, popular car for Asia, the company announced yesterday. A ground-breaking ceremony for the new press-stamping factory near Ayutthaya, 70km north of Bangkok, is to take place next week. The plant, which should be completed in early 1996, will incorporate research and development capability, according to the Japanese vehicle maker. The decision to double capacity reflects both the rapid growth of the Thai domestic market for cars and Thailand's campaign to become a regional automotive centre by welcoming foreign manufacturers with investment incentives. 'Thailand is one of the best potential markets in Asia,' Mr Tetsuyo Honda, a Honda executive in Bangkok, said yesterday. China, Indonesia, and India were also promising markets in the longer term, he said. Honda in Thailand does not make the pick-up trucks which at present account for more than half the vehicles sold in the country. With only a 7.4 per cent share of the total Thai vehicle market, it lags behind the four dominant Japanese manufacturers: Toyota, Isuzu, Nissan and Mitsubishi. But sales of Honda passenger cars, most of them Civics and Accords assembled at an existing plant in Thailand, have surged 60 per cent in the first nine months of this year to reach 26,000 units, giving Honda a 23 per cent share of Thai passenger car market - second only to Toyota. With increasing spending power and growing wealth in the population, the Thai passenger car market is expected to grow strongly to reach about 400,000 units by the end of the decade, Honda said. The market grew rapidly from 67,000 units sold in 1991 to 174,000 units last year, although it has declined by 14 per cent in the first nine months of 1994. 'Currently the pick-up market is bigger than the passenger car market,' said Mr Honda, 'but the desire of mankind is for more speedy and more comfortable transport. This kind of desire is unlimited. This is the market trend.' Honda expects its expanded Thai manufacturing facility to be one of the recipients of vehicle components it will produce in China under a joint venture arrangement with a Chinese parts maker which it announced last week.</p>

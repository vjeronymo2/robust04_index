			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant down 39% for year Holmes &amp; Marchant, the marketing services company, blamed difficult trading conditions and rationalisation costs for a 39 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 764,000 for the year to September 30. While the marketing sector as a whole generally picked up during the past year, many of Holmes' clients either cut or deferred expenditure and turnover fell 22 per cent to Pounds 25.3m (Pounds 32.3m). Mr John Holmes, chairman and chief executive, said more than Pounds 3m of the decline was the result of product launch costs and rationalisation of its consumer advertising agency. Shares closed 2p down at 33p. . In July, when the company warned of a profits shortfall, shares fell 17p in a day. Earnings per share fell to 2.5p (4.1p).</p>

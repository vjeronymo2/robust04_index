			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Taiwan to send hijackers back Taiwan, in an attempt to deter the hijacking of Chinese airliners to the island, yesterday decided it will send hijackers back to China after sentence or finishing their jail terms, Reuter reports from Taipei. Seven Chinese airliners have been hijacked to Taiwan since April. Taipei has rejected China's demands to send the hijackers back to China immediately and detained them for trial on the island. The aircraft, other passengers and the crew were sent back to China on the same day. The decision to repatriate hijackers was reached by a cabinet-level anti-hijacking committee headed by Interior Minister Wu Poh-hsiung, state radio said. But the final approval of Premier Lien Chan is still needed.</p>

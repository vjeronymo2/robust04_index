			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Major responds to nursery pressure Mr John Major's call yesterday for nursery education available for all comes as a response to increasing pressure from educationalists during the past year. The prime minister recognised that the short-term barrier to providing this was finding the necessary funds. He said: 'It would be an ambition of mine over time to move to universal nursery education, but I do stress that is an ambition . . . we don't have the resources.' Mr John Patten, the education secretary, favours universal nursery provision, but made it equally clear last month that he did not think it could be afforded while the public sector deficit remained about Pounds 50bn. Recent estimates published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggest that the UK trails countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands on nursery education. Britain's public-sector nurseries provide places for 38 per cent of three-year-olds and 56 per cent of four-year-olds. But the UK's provision is slightly ahead of the US and Japan. The National Commission on Education, an educational think-tank whose launch was welcomed by Mr Major, called last month for the phased introduction of nursery education for all. Its favoured target was to see 95 per cent of four-year-olds and 85 per cent of three-year-olds in nursery school by the year 2110. This provision, on a half-time basis for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, should be available to all children whose parents wish it, the commission said. It added that funds should be concentrated initially on inner-city areas. Mr Patten responded by saying that the funds were not available and decisions on nursery education should be left to local decision-makers. According to Department for Education estimates, the total funding needed, on this year's costings, is Pounds 1,770 per child. This money would have to come from local authority budgets, at a time when they need to find savings to meet targets set in the Budget. For political reasons, nursery budgets tend to be easier to cut than others. This leads to wide variations in provision. At the end of 1991, education department figures showed a total variation in the proportion of under-fives in nursery schools and classes from zero (Gloucestershire) and 2 per cent (for Somerset and Bromley), to 58 per cent in Newham and Walsall. Once all under-fives, including those in reception classes at primary schools, are included, the total range in provision is from 17 per cent in Bromley to 92 per cent in Walsall. Funding will be difficult. Tory-controlled Westminster city council has adopted one of the more original plans to cut costs by putting its day nurseries out to tender. It said it was happy with the response it received from the private sector, but Westminster's in-house team eventually won the contract, on cost grounds. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, urged Mr Major to make wider nursery provision a priority and to suggest ways of funding it. But she warned: 'This government does not seem to be making any progress in creating new nursery places. Where is the crash programme for the expansion of nursery provision? It just is not there. Ministers have the power to provide it, but I do not see a genuine commitment.' If Mr Major can find the funds, there is evidence from the market of strong demand for nursery education, fuelled by the trend for mothers to stay in employment. According to the commission, the number of children in English private nurseries rose by 259 per cent between 1980 and 1991, from 22,017 to 79,029. The use of childminders also more than doubled, from 98,495 to 233,258. This was in spite of significant increases of 36 per cent in children at state nursery schools, and 32 per cent in reception classes of primary schools. Universal nursery provision might prove very popular indeed with voters.</p>

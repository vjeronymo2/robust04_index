			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited </F> by Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] Tashkent -- A newspaper published by Uzbekistan's  parliament and government, NARODNOYE SLOVO (THE PEOPLE'S WORD),  has sharply criticized Kazakhstan President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's proposal for a Eurasian Union. One of the issues  of the paper carried a story headlined "Spring Has Come. The  Indefatigable Politician Is Buzzing Around," which says the  phrase "Eurasian Union" is aimed at "simpletons."    "Uzbekistan still has a long way to go to reach the level of  Europe, where states can afford the luxury of unification  without being afraid to find themselves under somebody else's  dictatorship," the story says.    "The essence of the Eurasian Union idea is not new. It  pursues the aim of restoring the Soviet Union, which is nothing  but gibberish," the story says.    Such was the first reaction in Uzbekistan to Nazarbayev's  idea. The newspaper received the story from the Republic's  national news agency.    Kiev -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, in comments to  journalists, called Nazarbayev's initiative "premature," but  said it "needs serious study." He said the final decision on it  should not be the prerogative of the heads of state of the  countries concerned but ought to be based on referendums in them.    Kravchuk said he objected to the dissolution of the CIS,  which, he said, had not yet exhausted its potential.</p>

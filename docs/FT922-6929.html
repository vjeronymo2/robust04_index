			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Spain launches Ecu250m MTN issue THE ALREADY hazy distinction between traditional Eurobonds and medium-term note issues was further blurred yesterday, when Spain launched Ecu250m two-year paper under its MTN programme, writes Simon London. The issue, fully underwritten by Lehman Brothers and the four other dealers to the programme, is the largest of its type in the Euromarket. An MTN programme provides a legal framework under which a borrower can issue bonds in a range of currencies and maturities. MTN issues are normally small and not underwritten, with dealers placing paper where they can identify pockets of demand for securities. However, increasingly large bond issues are being made under the umbrella of MTN programmes. Until yesterday, the largest issue was a Dollars 153m deal launched by Eurofima.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Eighty-two Greek-Cypriot women jailed for their part in protests that have  jeopardized Cyprus unification talks were freed by the Turkish breakaway state  of Northern Cyprus. They boarded buses to return to Greek Cypriot territory,  separated from the Turkish area by a U.N. buffer zone. However, 10 men,  including a Greek Orthodox bishop, were still in jail after refusing to pay  fines of up to $220. The protesters were among more than 100 people ordered  jailed by a Turkish-Cypriot court after staging a buffer zone demonstration  last week to mark the 15th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.  </P></p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Letter: Hoover relocation as part of larger trend Sir, Are Europe's politicians ready for the single market? Perhaps not if the reaction to the announcement of Hoover's plans to shift production of vacuum cleaners from Dijon to Glasgow is anything to go by. This case has nothing to do with social dumping and everything to do with the single market's basic goal - increased productivity and higher living standards for workers. A particular result of the single market is that production becomes more concentrated and much more specialised by region. That Hoover's announcement came just days before Nestle's decision to move from Glasgow to Newcastle and Dijon was a neat example of the way in which different industries are attracted to different regions. In the US, this process of regional specialisation is far more advanced, suggesting Europe still has a long way to go. Indeed, the Hoover and Nestle examples are part of a tidal wave of relocation sweeping across Europe. Many more plants will have to close and possibly even whole industries may have to relocate before we see the most efficient production structure in Europe. In this restructuring process, those regions with best access to Europe's core markets will find it easier to attract production and jobs. Peripheral regions will have to work harder to create an attractive regional base for inward investment. One point is clear: by harmonising social conditions, the location advantage of the core regions would be boosted enormously. Although flexibility in labour and product markets is important for all regions, it is absolutely essential for the lagging regions on Europe's periphery. Anything else will be a recipe for mass unemployment, followed by migration to the prosperous core. For us, this is the real 'social dumping' that the Community should be worried about. We go into these issues in greater deal in our recent paper, Europe: Core vs Periphery. The response we received from the Dutch authorities appears to us to be far preferable to that seen so far in France. 'The development towards increasing specialisation per region and the substantial importance of clusters of companies therein, already plays an important role in Dutch policy. The policy of (the Ministry of) Economic Affairs constantly stresses the importance of technology, infrastructure and a well-educated workforce to attract clusters of companies.'

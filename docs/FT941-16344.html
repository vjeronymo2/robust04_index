			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Construction figures point to housing market upturn Further evidence of a sustained recovery in the housing market emerged yesterday with publication of the latest construction figures from the Department of the Environment. These showed that the number of new homes started by builders rose during the first 11 months of last year by almost 20 per cent to 175,000 compared with the corresponding period in 1992. This already makes 1993 the best year for housing starts since 1989 when builders commenced work on 201,000 homes. By 1992 this annual total had slipped to just 156,500. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest housebuilders, said yesterday: 'The latest figures are encouraging and confirm our own experience that a steady improvement is under way. 'But price increases are still restrained and are likely to remain so, not least, because of the impact of Budget measures on consumers' pockets which take effect in the spring. Nevertheless, the trend is positive and I am increasingly hopeful that this momentum can be maintained.' Housing starts are regarded as one of the best guides to sales by the industry, which takes about 12 weeks on average to construct a home. The number of private-sector homes commenced during the first 11 months of last year rose by 18.6 per cent to 134,300. This compares with 120,000 private starts for the whole of 1992. Construction of homes for housing associations also jumped last year with starts rising during the first 11 months by a quarter to a record 39,300. This compared with a previous best of 33,800 starts for the whole of 1992. Builders say cuts in government spending mean that sales to housing associations are likely to fall during the next 12 months. Yet this decline is expected to be more than offset by increased sales to the private sector. Sir George Young, housing minister, said yesterday: 'Houses are now more affordable than they have been for many years, and with the prospect of modest price rises next year, I would expect to see that reflected in increased housing starts.'</p>

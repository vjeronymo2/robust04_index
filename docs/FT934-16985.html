			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / EC hunts for unity on Gatt EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will try in Luxembourg today to ease some of the sense of crisis swirling around the Gatt world trade reform talks. They intend to focus on areas in which they broadly agree, rather than on the farm trade chapter where a threatened French veto risks the collapse of the seven-year-old negotiations. In sharp contrast to the September 20 'jumbo' council of EC foreign, agriculture and trade ministers - devoted almost exclusively to consideration of French insistence on a better farm trade deal than the Blair House EC-US accord negotiated last November - the 12 want to concentrate on areas such as textiles, financial services, steel and aviation. Part of the plan is pedagogic - to place up front what will be lost in expanded trade were the Uruguay Round talks to fall apart as a result of the French veto on agricul-ture. The 'jumbo' meeting was marked by a sharp confrontation between Sir Leon Brittan, chief EC trade negotiator, and Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, and clouded by alleged UK threats to boycott the Community if the farm trade issue sabotaged an accord. Senior French diplomats made clear last week that Paris was anxious to avoid further confrontation today, while Mr Juppe recently warned a Gaullist audience of the dangers of protectionism. Senior UK officials, for their part, say there will be 'very little shoot-out atmosphere' today, and have back-tracked on the dubious boycott threat. What British officials said outside the September 20 meeting - insinuating the UK might adopt the 'empty chair' policy used by General Charles de Gaulle to boycott the EC in 1965-66 - went well beyond the measured gravity of what Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said inside the meeting. Mr Hurd warned his colleagues of an internal EC crisis by saying: 'I cannot conceive how the EC will continue with the normal transaction of business if it were seen as causing the collapse of the Uruguay Round.' Though this marked a hardening of Britain's position, a senior UK official said that 'what Hurd was saying was that a Gatt crisis would drive everything else off the (EC) agenda'. He was not threatening a boycott. Sir Leon put France's farm demands on the table at a meeting in Washington last week with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. The two negotiators are to discuss the issues in substance in Brussels on October 13. But with 10 weeks to go to the December 15 Uruguay Round deadline, the EC appears to be gearing up to try to resolve the farm trade issue at a special summit of heads of government on October 29.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is likely, under this form of transaction, that very few rightholders would chose to exercise, and that the underwriters would essentially be selling the whole institution. This gives rise to several questions. For example, wouldn't the transaction costs be awfully high, relative to the amount of new capital being raised? The answer has to be yes_but the cost should be measured relative to the major strategic accomplishment of conversion itself; presumably there was a reason to convert, or the trustees wouldn't have undertaken it. It is also worth observing that the need (opportunity) to sell nearly 100% of the stock will lead many more underwriting firms to compete for the business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another question is why not just distribute stock certificates instead of rights? The basic answer is that the selling effort of a public offering is what gets the market to focus on the fair value of the shares, and gets a group of underwriters committed to make a market in them afterwards. A direct distribution of shares could saddle the bank with an uneconomically large number of shareholders. It would leave unsophisticated holders of small numbers of shares in danger of being persuaded to sell at prices below intrinsic value. Finally, to the extent that rights were distributed to a community-oriented charity, a stock sale should probably be required to avoid leaving a controlling block of stock in the hands of a foundation or organization which might be governed by the directors of the converted mutual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One argument advanced against this form of transaction is that the existing process has raised enormous amounts of money to recapitalize ailing thrifts, and that while the industry is healthy now, we may need to be able to do that again some day. True_but the approach here proposed would be able to do that as well. If a thrift with a low equity ratio wanted to convert, it could distribute rights and hire an escrow agent and an underwriter, just the same. The shares could be priced wherever they had to, to be sold. The rights just wouldn't have much value_but that would appropriately reflect the institution's perilous condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another argument advanced is that the recent market is a highly unusual one, that the embarrassing increases in share price on the day of conversion have already begun to shrink and could soon disappear. They may or may not_and ``pops''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> though on a more modest scale, are effectively a requirement of the initial public offering market_but the transactions the existing conversion process requires would still be inefficient to the point of being improper. Under current rules, a well capitalized thrift is only able to avoid a ``pop'' by increasing its equity ratio to the point where its market/book ratio falls below industry norms_which says that a lot of the new capital will either be underutilized for several years, or used imprudently. What all parties at interest should want is the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> highest  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> market/book ratio that can be obtained, because that suggests the right business judgements have been made regarding capital structure and growth prospects. The elimination of ``pops'' would suggest a destruction of the value the trustees hold in trust, and a violation of their fiduciary duty of care_regardless of who that duty is owed to.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Merger Conversions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS interim final rule would prohibit merger conversions_whereby a stock institution acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of a mutual with no significant payment to anyone_except where the survival of the converting institution is in question. The form of transaction we here propose would permit merger conversions, but would make them essentially a purchase of subscription rights by the acquiror, with the value paid for the rights_either in cash or other consideration_going to rightholders. This would have efficiency benefits for those smaller institutions whose decision to convert flowed from a decision to affiliate with a larger organization. Trustees who decided to convert and be acquired would of course have the same obligation to get the best possible price for rightholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

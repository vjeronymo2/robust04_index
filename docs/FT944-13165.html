			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz maintains growth Annual turnover at Daimler-Benz is expected to exceed DM100bn (Dollars 66.87bn) for the first time this year, following a 9 per cent sales rise to DM73.2bn in the nine months to the end of September. The factors which generated a 13.4 per cent surge in turnover and a sharp profits turnround in the first half had continued in the third quarter, the group said in an interim report yesterday. These included international economic recovery, further cost cuts and productivity increases - the group workforce was cut by 7 per cent in the year to the end of September - and new car models from the Mercedes-Benz subsidiary, which traditionally generates the largest share of sales and profits. The report, which contained no earnings data, said Mercedes sales rose 13 per cent to DM51bn in the period. Car factories were working at full capacity, and deliveries of cars had increased 29 per cent to 436,000 units. However, sales revenue from this division rose only 13 per cent to DM31bn, reflecting both the fierce price competition in the car market and the high proportion of sales attributable to the new C-class car, introduced last year at prices virtually unchanged from those of its predecessor. Mercedes reported particularly brisk demand for cars and Freightliner trucks in the US, where turnover rose 22 per cent and helped increase group revenues there by 13 per cent to DM13bn. Mercedes' sales in Germany rose 31 per cent, while in the rest of western Europe turnover increased 37 per cent. Meanwhile, the negative factors which have long dogged Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) - defence budget cuts and low demand from airlines - continued to depress the subsidiary's performance. Sales, which were down 5.6 per cent at halfway, were 9 per cent lower at DM10.5bn at the end of the third quarter. While the introduction of the Dornier 328 regional aircraft helped boost turnover in the aircraft division, it was not enough to offset the effects of a fall in sales at Fokker of the Netherlands. Dasa, which will in future be known as Daimler-Benz Aerospace, also recorded a 4 per cent increase in incoming orders during the review period. The electronics and electrical engineering subsidiary, AEG (recently renamed AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie) raised sales 6 per cent to DM7.4bn, due mainly to improved foreign operations which increased turnover 12 per cent. At home, where sales rose only 2 per cent, the strongest push came from the railways and microelectronics divisions. The group's services division, Debis, which includes financial, mobile communications and software services, reported a 17 per cent increase in sales to DM7.9bn.</p>

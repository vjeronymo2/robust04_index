			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / 'Franc fort' set to survive French poll: But EMS key rests with Bundesbank, not with new government FOR ALL the currency markets' oft-repeated forecasts of a fresh assault on the franc, France's elections on Sunday are not likely to set fire to the tinder of the European Monetary System. Yet after the exchange rate flare-ups of the last six months, the EMS remains in a state of potential self-combustion, according to many European economists. And the key to the question whether it will eventually go up in flames appears to rest with the German Bundesbank, whose policy-making council meets today to deliberate its next interest rate moves. The right-wing French opposition parties likely to form the next government in Paris are widely expected to maintain the franc fort policy of the Socialist administration. 'The French people do not like devaluations,' says one top French official. He says France wants to bring both long-term and short-term interest rates down to German levels - an objective which should be secured once the future Paris government makes clear it will stick to the franc's present parity against the D-Mark. In particular, the 3.5 percentage point risk premium between short-term German and French rates should fall substantially once the exchange markets stop speculating on a franc devaluation, he says. France also has strong political reasons for keeping within the EMS at present rates, the official says. If the franc left the exchange rate mechanism and floated, as Britain and Italy did in September, 'this would mean the end of the EMS, of the Maastricht treaty, of the single market and the Treaty of Rome itself', he says. Over the medium term, France hopes to emulate the Netherlands, which has succeeded in bringing both short and long term interest rates below German levels during the past few months. Interest rates in many EC countries stopped converging with D-Mark rates after last summer after uncertainties intensified about the future stability of European exchange rates. But the Dutch central bank - thanks to a stern no-devaluation policy since 1983 - has managed to convince the markets that the guilder is at least as hard as the D-Mark. 'It can be done, but it takes time,' says a Dutch monetary official. Mr Jean-Michel Charpin, chief economist at Banque Nationale de Paris, says he is 'certain' that France's new prime minister will keep the franc's parity unchanged. If exchange market confidence returns, France will reap a two-fold bonus. It will profit both from further expected reductions in the basic level of German interest rates, and from a fall in the franc's interest rate differential, he says. One month interest rates in France are around 11.7 per cent against 8.3 per cent in Germany. Big French banks, under government orders, have kept their base rates unchanged at 10 per cent for several months. But the high cost of credit - at a time when French inflation is just over 2 per cent - has had a debilitating effect on the French economy. Mr Charpin says he is not excluding a revival of currency tensions, either in the autumn or next year, as the new government's difficulties in dealing with the French recession become apparent. According to Mr Heiner Flassbeck, chief economist of the Berlin-based DIW economic research institute, these problems could intensify unless the Bundesbank accelerates the interest rate cuts started last autumn. Mr Flassbeck in recent months has strongly criticised the slow pace of the Bundesbank's monetary relaxation. He believes that, at most, the Bundesbank will announce today merely a 'small step' towards further easing. However, unless the Bundesbank by the end of the year reduces short-term rates to around 4 to 5 per cent - compared with the present discount and Lombard rates of 8 and 9 per cent respectively, 'the EMS will not survive', Mr Flassbeck says. Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, European economist at Salomon Bros in London, believes the weekend 'solidarity pact' between the German government and Lander has lessened the likelihood of speedy Bundesbank rate reductions. By agreeing tax increases only for 1995, and ruling out deep spending cuts, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has sought to lower the danger that the German recession will last into 1994. But the likelihood of a slight improvement in shorter term economic prospects has exacerbated the risks of higher debts and deficits in the longer term. This will increase the risk that Germany itself will not be able to meet the fiscal targets set as conditions for countries' participation in economic and monetary union (Emu) by the end of the century, Mr Mercier says. If Mr Kohl had switched resolutely to a tighter fiscal policy, this would have paved the way for a looser Bundesbank monetary policy, Mr Mercier says. However, he describes the deal as 'more spending, more taxes, more deficits'. 'It doesn't help at all - either France or the Maastricht process.' An even more gloomy assessment comes from Mr Brendan Brown, chief economist at Mitsubishi Finance in London, a long-time sceptic about France's ability to keep its currency pegged to the D-Mark. Mr Brown believes the inadequacy of the 'solidarity pact' deal will prolong the French recession since the Bundesbank will be more reluctant to ease policy. The pain would be worthwhile if France's 'gold at the end of the rainbow' - the aim, through Emu, of replacing the D-Mark by a European currency - remained alive, Mr Brown says. But, if France's goal of Emu becomes, for political and economic reasons, increasingly remote, the sceptical Mr Brown asks: 'How long will France act as a monetary satellite of Germany?'</p>

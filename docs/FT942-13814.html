			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong dips 3% on property worries The Nikkei fell for the third consecutive day on lingering worries over the uncertain political situation and the rise in the yen, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 index moved in a narrow range throughout the day in light trading, falling 82.82 to 19,799.36 after a high of 19,934.89 and a low of 19,793.56. Some overseas investors chose to take advantage of the rise in the yen and sell large capital stocks. The yen closed up Y0.50 at Y102.90, rising above the Y103 level in spite of intermittent selling by the Bank of Japan. Traders sold the dollar against the yen and the D-Mark due to the overnight fall on Wall Street. Volume was 250m shares against 346m. Traders said that even dealers were reluctant to take positions since institutional investors were placing buy orders around the 19,500 level, while some corporations were looking to take profits around the 20,000 level. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 5.93 to 1,607.50, while the Nikkei 300 lost 1.01 to 293.83. Losers led gainers by 677 to 298, with 207 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.06 to 1,310.7. Steel stocks were sold by foreign investors: Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, fell Y7 to Y342, while Kawasaki Steel declined Y4 to Y362. Japan Airlines, which had risen on Wednesday after announcing a voluntary retirement plan for employees in their 30s, fell Y4 to Y709 on profit-taking. Nippon Trust Bank jumped Y23 to Y535 on reports, later denied, that Mitsubishi Bank was planning a bailout package for the trust bank. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 140.51 to 22,083.43 in volume of 19.8m shares. Roundup Wall Street's overnight weakness was reflected in the region. HONG KONG saw heavy selling of property shares on worries about measures being drafted by the government to cool the housing market and an expected rise in interest rates in line with the US. The Hang Seng index dropped by 286.42, or 3.1 per cent to 8,934.59, its second lowest close of 1994. Turnover rose from HKDollars 3.3bn to HKDollars 4.86bn as the property sector plunged 766.69, or 4.7 per cent to 15,437.17. Cheung Kong and Sun Hung Kai, two of Hong Kong's biggest residential property developers and among the biggest listed stocks, dropped by HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 35.75, and by HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 47 respectively; Hongkong Land, a Jardine group stock and the landlord of much of central Hong Kong, ended HKDollars 1.10 lower at HKDollars 22.10. MANILA blamed a technical correction, profit-taking after a succession of gains and a drop in PLDT stock in New York as the composite index fell 69.71, or 2.4 per cent to 2,777.11. Philippine Long Distance Telephone lost Dollars 1 7/8 on Wall Street. At home, it lost 65 pesos to 1,715 pesos, while the utility, Meralco, saw its B shares down 10 pesos at 505. AUSTRALIA was depressed by weakness in futures, the June share price index peaking at 2,036.0 before a drop to 1,995.0 and a partial recovery to 2,007.0, down 13. The All Ordinaries index ended 17.0 down at 2,029.6. Turnover was ADollars 410.86m. Among the few risers, Brambles Industries rose 20 cents to ADollars 14.40 after a newspaper report said that the company had sold its loss-making Austrian crane hire and heavy haulage business. NEW ZEALAND reflected weakness on Wall Street as the NZSE-40 index lost 22.40, or 1.1 per cent at 2,084.95. BOMBAY fell in end-of-account trade, the BSE index closing 51.36 lower at 3,778.93. There was some selling by foreign institutions but brokers said that the index fall was largely due to squaring up by local speculators. KARACHI took profits before the Friday/Saturday weekend, the KSE 100 index closing 17.42 at 2,481.64. SINGAPORE's banks were firm, but there was some weakness in properties as the Straits Times Industrial index edged up by 1.63 to 2,231.29. KUALA LUMPUR combined general uncertainty with short term speculation by retail investors, but the KLSE composite fell 10.75 to 1,028.1. TAIWAN put on 0.9 per cent on technical buying and news of maintained bank dividends, the weighted price index closing 49.15 higher at 5,741.47.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Taba talks, by Hasan Abu-Zayid in Taba on 10  January, carried within the "With the Midday Events" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Zayid] The talks between the Israeli and  Palestinian sides resumed at Taba Hotel today. Members of the  two delegations arrived at the meeting lounge at approximately  1130. This meeting was preceded by a meeting between heads of  the two delegations Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon  Shahaq. The head of the Palestinian delegation reiterated that  it is possible to resolve pending issues within three weeks. He  expressed the hope that the Israeli side will also be ready.    [Sha'th] Our expectations are that we are here to write the  final agreement. We should end this work in three weeks in the  interest of our peoples. I believe that if intentions are good,  three weeks will be enough time to reach an agreement that will  then be submitted to our political leaderships, for amendment,  approval, and then finally for signing so the implementation of  this agreement can begin.    [Abu-Zayid] Israeli sources ruled out reaching an agreement  within three week, saying it will take three months?    [Sha'th] In this case, you should ask who is ready and who  is  not ready. He who says that we need three months violates the  agreement and does not want to finalize it. The agreement  should have been finalized on 13 December. However, it was  postponed due to certain circumstances. We were ready to  finalize the agreement in one week. So, what happened to make  this take three months. I believe that this is a test of both  sides' intentions?    [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, are you just going to discuss  formal issues at today's meeting?    [Sha'th] There are things concerning essence and others  concerning form. In fact, we have not yet discussed the form.  Therefore, we should write the agreement in a way that will  enable us to implement it concerning everything on which we have  agreed. We should use the time to discuss what we do not agree  on.    [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how would al-Asad-Clinton  meeting affect the talks?    [Sha'th] I believe that the al-Asad-Clinton summit will  succeed in returning Syria to the peace process. This is  something very positive, and we are looking forward to it  because we want the entire peace process to succeed--all its  tracks--not only the Palestinian track. When the  al-Asad-Clinton summit succeeds to return Syria to the peace  process, Lebanon and Jordan will also go back to the peace  process. At that time, we will all be working in the same  direction; something which supports the entire peace process.    [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, what are the points on which  differences are centered?    [Sha'th] The truth is that this expression was the result of  the talks that were held in Cairo, Oslo, and Paris. At that  time, we decided to focus on the issues of crossings, the size  of the Jericho area, and the area of the Israeli settlements and  the security area surrounding them in the Gaza Strip. We  believe that we made progress concerning these three issues  although we did not reach full agreement on them. However,  there are other issues on which we must concentrate this time  other than these three issues. I believe that these three  issues, in addition to other points, such as security on land  and in the sea, security on roads, and the transfer of civil  powers, are all issues on which we can reach an agreement. This  is not impossible. We knew that these issues were difficult  when we began these negotiations, and we also knew that they  were difficult when we signed the Washington agreement. So,  there is no surprise here. Differences should not surprise  anyone, for negotiations constitute a means to reach an  agreement on points of disagreement through both sides'  flexibility based on the principles we set in Washington. I  believe that this is possible.</p>

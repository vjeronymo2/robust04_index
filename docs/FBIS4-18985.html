			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus </F> Kinkel by unidentified correspondent--live]    [Text] [Correspondent] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is  expected in Bonn today for a two-day working visit. During the  visit, Butrus-Ghali wants to ensure that Germany increases its  political, military, and financial contribution to the United  Nations. The secretary general wants, for example, a standing  rapid deployment force. About 20 states should each supply 2000  troops, which can be placed under UN command within one week.    I now welcome Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on the telephone  from Bonn. Good morning, Mr. Kinkel.    [Kinkel] Good morning, Mr. [name indistinct].    [Correspondent] In a newspaper interview, Butrus-Ghali  presented quite detailed ideas. To quote him, he said we will  ask Germany for, at most, 1 percent of its armed forces for  possible participation in missions. How will you respond to  this request?    [Kinkel] Well, first we need a constitutional amendment, to  which I am sorry to say the Social Democratic Party [SPD] has  offered enormous resistance up to now. I am also very  interested in how Mr. Scharping will defend this today in  Washington in his talks with the president. As long as we have  no constitutional amendment--for which we can at present only  wait again for a decision from the Federal Constitutional Court,  and in April we have a public hearing in Karlsruhe--as long as  we have no such decision, we need not and cannot give specific  consideration to the requests and ideas of the secretary  general. It is obvious that we are interested as a coalition  and as a government not only in obtaining our rights within the  United Nations, but also in performing our duties to the United  Nations in the future--also with regard to the provision of  soldiers for UN blue helmet and other missions. We will  certainly not leave the secretary general in the lurch on this.  I cannot say anything specific to him on this at the moment,  however.    [Correspondent] What is your view, in principle, of the plan  for a rapid intervention force to be placed permanently at the  disposal of the UN secretary general?    [Kinkel] It is an idea that has been considered for some  time, not only by the secretary general himself but also by the  United Nations. At present, the situation is that the UN  secretary general has to go around to the countries cap-in-hand  for every mission and must ask who is willing to participate  under very specific conditions. There is, of course, something  to be said for this, but there is something against it. I do  not think this idea is wrong as such, and we have quite positive  views on it, too. I would not like to commit myself now on  behalf of the German Government because it is simply too early.  We will, as I say, not leave the secretary general in the lurch.    [Correspondent] What can Germany's contribution to the  United  Nations look like in the future?    [Kinkel] Well, first of all, we are the third-largest  contributor at the moment. Furthermore, the actions of the  United Nations do not consist solely of peacekeeping or  peacemaking [preceding two words in English] actions, but the  United Nations concerns itself with overpopulation, with famine,  with the problem of disadvantaged children--UNICEF--and so on.  We participate in this in a huge way and are making quite a  considerable contribution, so we have not had to hide our light  under a bushel up to now. What we have not been able to do up  to now is to take part in peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts;  that will require an amendment to the Basic Law.    [Correspondent] Yesterday, Mr. Kinkel, the German United  Nations Association advised against insisting on a seat for  Germany on the Security Council. The reason they gave was that  otherwise there is the danger that an expanded Council would  become incapable of action. Would the German Government be  better advised to drop its wish for a seat in the Security  Council?    [Kinkel] No. Nor do I understand how such a view came to be  expressed there. In all opinion surveys, some 75 percent of the  population support the intention of the government and the  coalition to seek such a seat, and the figure is rising. By the  way, it was not the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union [CDU/CSU] or the Free Democratic Party [FDP], but the SPD  that was the first to call for a seat. Beginning in 1995, we  want a nonpermanent seat in the Security Council because it is  our turn again in the rotation, and we would like [passage  indistinct].    It is not a matter of adding only Germany and Japan to the  Security Council. That is not the demand at all. The discussion  only arose after Third World countries quite rightly said that  the current composition of the Security Council does not reflect  the world situation but is the result of World War II. The fact  is that the German demand is understood and supported wherever  you look.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, yesterday the United Nations  carried out air strikes on Serb positions near Gorazde for the  second time within 24 hours. How strongly does the German  Government support these attacks?    [Kinkel] Completely. What happened there yesterday and the  day before yesterday is based on Security Council Resolution 836  and is thus covered in UN terms, as it were, and is also covered  in NATO terms. The fundamental decisions were made last year,  the decisions to defend the safe areas laid down by the United  Nations by using force against force if necessary, as it were.  The measures taken yesterday and the day before yesterday were  slightly different. In that case, UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] observers were put at risk by Serb shelling; therefore,  NATO was called on to help. The measures were right, necessary,  and justified.    [Correspondent] What will happen if the Serb attacks on  Gorazde continue?    [Kinkel] If the Serb attacks on Gorazde continue--and I hope  they will not because I would like to think that the Serbs must  know that the United Nations and NATO will not accept this--but  if they should continue, as Mr. Woerner said yesterday, we will  have to do something and consider whether an ultimatum will  possibly have to be announced in line with what happened in  Sarajevo. However, this is not on the agenda at present. Of  course, we have to make sure that matters do not escalate. I  have always been in favor, and now even more so, of always  involving the Russians.    [Correspondent] Do you expect Moscow to raise objections to  further air strikes carried out by NATO or the United Nations?    [Kinkel] Yes, there certainly will be objections. [words  indistinct] (?Russia cannot be allowed simply to impose a veto  on such actions, which are necessary, which have been decided  upon and are covered by law). However, this has nothing to do  with.... [pauses] I would like to emphasize this: that  everything possible must be done to include the Russians, and  this has always been our policy. [words indistinct]    [Correspondent] During your meeting with Butrus-Ghali today,  will you and Chancellor Kohl also be raising Germany's wish that  UN institutions be established in Bonn?    [Kinkel] Yes, I will be. I have done this persistently in  the past, and I will do it again today. We want appropriate UN  institutions to be located in Germany, and particularly in Bonn.  The secretary general is familiar with our request. I have  talked to him about it on several occasions. Incidentally, this  is his third visit to Bonn. We will, of course, again raise the  matter of making Hamburg the headquarters of the International  Maritime Court. These are our wishes, and I hope that UN  institutions of one kind or another will come here to Bonn.    [Correspondent] The last question, Mr. Kinkel. You are also  the FDP's federal chairman. The presidium yesterday specified  that it would form future coalitions with the CDU. Juergen  Moellemann, the FDP chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia, said  this morning that the FDP federal party conference in Rostock  would have to state more precisely its coalition intentions. He  said that, on the one hand, key issues should be explained.  Second, he said you should opt for a coalition with the CDU  only if the election result produces this. Will the FDP leave  itself a way out so that it can form a coalition with the SPD  after the Bundestag election?    [Kinkel] The proposal I made yesterday and the decision made  by the FDP were quite clear. We will wait and see what happens  at the meeting of the FDP federal executive and the party  conference in Rostock. I would not like to comment on this  matter beforehand.</p>

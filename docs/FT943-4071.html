			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Fids Foreign income dividends, known to the cognoscenti as Fids, have begun to catch on. This week Coats Viyella, BTR, RTZ and Burmah Castrol all announced they were adopting this form of payout. Like last year's enhanced scrip dividends, Fids reduce a company's liability to tax. By paying the dividend out of foreign income which has been taxed abroad, a company can escape advance corporation tax. The lower tax bill enhances its earnings. Fids are a more welcome device than enhanced scrips, principally because they require companies to pay cash dividends. At best enhanced scrips diluted an investor's stake. At worst they were little more than rights issues in disguise. The impact of a Fid is neutral on tax-exempt investors provided - as has happened in every case so far - the company grosses up the payment to compensate them for their inability to claim an ACT credit. Tax-paying investors then become the main beneficiaries, as they receive a higher dividend than would otherwise have been the case. Tax-exempt investors may grumble that others are receiving a larger slice of the cake than hitherto. Yet even they should reap some indirect benefits. The earnings enhancement that comes from Fids is somewhat illusory. The company must pay extra dividends to reduce its tax bill, so its cash position is unchanged at the end of the day. But though the benefits are unequal, the fact that more cash is being distributed should push up share prices and increase value for everybody. Moreover, the rules prevent any scrip alternative or share issue in connection with Fids, which is one reason BTR's results were notable for the absence of a warrant issue. To benefit from the scheme, companies must ensure their subsidiaries abroad are generating the cash to pay for it. There cannot be harm in that.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: BCP earnings drop 9.7% at nine months Banco Comercial Portugues, Portugal's fifth-largest bank, yesterday reported a 9.7 per cent drop in nine-month net income to Es13.2bn (Dollars 86.3m) from Es14.6bn in the same period last year. The bank attributed the slide to a sharp decrease in profits from trading activities as a result of lower interest rates on bond and money markets. In spite of a slowdown in credit and deposit growth in Portugal due to recession, BCP's net assets grew 17.9 per cent to Es2,052bn compared with the first nine months of 1993. Total deposits rose 17.5 per cent to Es1,635bn but credit to customers grew only 2.6 per cent to Es817bn. Cash flow increased 3.9 per cent to Es45.9bn. BCP's hostile bid for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second-largest bank, was vetoed by the government in September.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INQUIRY ASKED AFTER MOLESTER HIRES MINORS  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office asked for an investigation  Wednesday into whether a convicted child molester violated probation by hiring  minors to sell candy bars.  </P> <P> John Pizzini, 30, of Costa Mesa, who pleaded guilty to four counts of child  molestation earlier this year, was released from jail in October after serving  a three-month sentence.  </P> <P> He was placed on three years' probation, which required him to register with  police as a sex offender and stay away from minors.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade said she had been informed that Pizzini was  hiring children ages 10 and older to go door to door and sell candy for  Pizzini's Youth Enterprise Program.  </P> <P> Although a former business operated by Pizzini had a different name, it is the  same type of operation that got him into trouble before, Shade said.  </P> <P> "I've called his probation officer and we're are going to investigate the  matter," Shade said, adding that she has received calls from parents who  expressed concern about Pizzini's activities.  </P> <P> Pizzini could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Officials with the county probation office, as a matter of policy, declined to  discuss Pizzini's case.  </P> <P> Pizzini was arrested in July by Costa Mesa police and charged with four  misdemeanor counts of lewd acts with a child. The victim was a 14-year-old  girl.  </P> <P> Pizzini, dubbed "the Candy Man" by local law enforcement officials, reportedly  wanted to marry the girl but was stopped by authorities, who ordered that she  be sent to a shelter for abused and neglected children. The victim was then  released into the care of her father, Shade said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Separate investigations will be conducted by the San Diego city school district  and by San Diego police into circumstances surrounding the extensive police  response to a student demonstration at Gompers Secondary School on Friday,  Supt. Tom Payzant said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> During a school board meeting, Payzant and school trustees said they are  bothered that the presence of more than 30 police units may have fanned the  demonstration into a larger incident than it otherwise would have been. Despite  the police response and the walkout by 200 students, there were no injuries,  which Payzant and board President Kay Davis termed a matter of luck.  </P> <P> The demonstration was in support of Rhoenna Armster, a controversial teacher  who was involuntarily transferred last week to Lincoln High School under an  administrative personnel procedure invoked by the Gompers principal. Payzant  said Tuesday that he and the board back the transfer, but cannot comment on the  for it because of state law and possible litigation.  </P> <P> Payzant said the district will also look into allegations that Armster and  other Gompers teachers -- who have been at odds with Principal Marie Thornton  -- actively encouraged the students to walk out of class and will discipline  them if they violated school district rules.  </P></p>

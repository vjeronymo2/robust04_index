			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: Whose violence is it anyway? - Television We are riding the crest of one of those waves of national hysteria which periodically affect the nation when, with gleeful prodding from parts of the old print medium (slowly but inexorably giving way before the competitive edge of the new electronic mass media which work faster and wider, though without the depth of print) people turn angrily on television - the thing on which the British population now spends more of its time than anything except working and sleeping - and blame it for the violence which has characterised mankind since the dawn of history. Unfair? Television is only to blame for an intensification of violence or a statistical increase? We shall come to that. Consider first a small but telling example from last weekend's Independent on Sunday. The lead letter was headed 'To see the influence of TV violence, visit a playground' and it began: 'As a teacher I come across many children from happy homes who have television in their bedrooms and watch until closedown. These children watch an unadulterated diet of violence, sex, rape and torture, and the next morning act it out in the playground'. Leaving aside the fact that there is no such thing as closedown since ITV transmissions continue round the clock, this teacher is either a non viewer, a liar, or so consumed by the national hysteria that he (or she, let's say he) honestly believes that British television transmits violence, sex, rape and torture unadulterated. Consider last night's schedules. BBC1 offered Neighbours, The News, the travel programme Holiday, EastEnders, Carla Lane's new 'comedy' series Luv, A Question Of Sport, The News, and Budget Broadcast which took us up to 9.40 when a repeat of Smith And Jones, began. That comedy may have contained some Tom And Jerry style violence, it often does, and there may have been more in Harry Enfield's Television Programme which followed. The most likely candidate for a true taste of the teacher's 'unadulterated diet' was the American television drama Glitz which began at 10.40, since it claimed to be about a 'hard nosed Miami policeman' confronting a 'seedy underworld'. BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 offered similar mixtures with comedy, wildlife, foreign reports, news and the arts all in evidence and few slots where violence might crop up, so is that letter not truly an example of hysteria? What other explanations are there? Teachers being what they are these days, perhaps this one simply does not know what 'unadulterated' means, or maybe he is thinking about the material available on satellite and cable services, though the overwhelming bulk of their material, at least on the non-pay channels, is similar to that on the terrestrial channels. If older. Of course it is possible in 1993, if you are determined to do so, to find yourself the sort of diet that the teacher describes. If you are willing to go to the cinema, hire videos, or cough up for pay-TV movie channels via satellite or cable (the penetration in Britain is still slight and the number of children with pay-TV in their bedrooms must be minuscule) then you can, indeed, find plenty of the material discussed by our film critic, Nigel Andrews, in last Saturday's Weekend FT. But anyone who dedicates his life to monitoring the output of British television knows that there is less violence on the small screen today than there was 15 or 20 years ago. Were you to make today many of the episodes of The Sweeney, Starsky And Hutch, Target or The Professionals that were made in the mid-1970s, they would not be accepted for screening. So far as I can make out (and I would no more choose to watch Silence Of The Lambs than stick my head down the lavatory) Hollywood and the video industry are turning out more and more material in which violence is the chief ingredient, and present for its own sake rather than a means to an end as in Westerns or war movies. The trouble is that, thanks to the national hysteria, television is being blamed for the nastiness of the film and video industries. Television is a part of the world in which we live. In news and current affairs programmes it shows us more violence in a year than most Britons in previous generations saw in a lifetime. Nor are the pictures limited to factual programmes. The last episode in BBC1's recent run of its mass-appeal Saturday evening drama Casualty became famous for showing a band of young thugs invading the hospital's casualty department and finally burning it down. As with most Casualty episodes this was well acted and vividly staged, though the activities of the violent youths did seem worryingly motiveless. Perhaps that was the point. On Sunday, Channel 4 showed the 1990 movie The Krays which included several scenes of explicit violence involving fists and even swords, shot in pretty revolting closeup. So which way round is the 'copycat' effect working? We know that the Kray twins and their nasty exploits are a ghastly reality. Perhaps their behaviour in real life resulted from reading too many American horror comics, one of the favourite culprits before television . . . but then how did Cain come to kill Abel, too many violent papyri? We know that Britain has suffered some appalling inner city riots in recent years, as in every century of recorded history. These dramas are telling us about some of the facts of life around us. But are they also 'de-sensitising' viewers and inducing them to copy such violent exploits? We know that the effect upon some is precisely the opposite: the more violence they watch, the more hostile to it they become. We know this because they are forever telling us so. In their roles as public guardians people such as Lord Rees-Mogg and Mary Whitehouse watch even more violent television than most of us, yet the more they watch the more they loathe it. It seems that any causal connection is not straightforward. This should be pointed out each time they trot out the old 'television sells butter so it must sell violence' routine. Doubtless they themselves eat butter yet are not violent, so what kind of 'proof' is this? Television commercials sell things that people are known to want by using jokes, jingles, pictures and endorsements which the advertisers know the viewers are predisposed to approve. So far as violence goes, television can clearly demonstrate technique, whether in rocking and turning a car to form a barricade or smashing a beer glass to use as a weapon. But can it make you want to do these things? It never has that effect upon Lord Rees-Mogg, Mary Whitehouse or me - what about you? Perhaps it is just a small minority of suggestible youths with no war to fight who are turned on to violence by television? But Geoffrey Pearson's book Hooligan shows with extensive documentation that fears about the growing lawlessness of young men, and the absurd leniency of the laws, have been expressed by every generation back through the Victorians, who were worried by the new phenomenon of 'hooligans', to ancient Rome and Greece where gangs of 'Greens' and 'Blues' at opposite ends of the chariot racing stadiums would cause mayhem. Surely in the end we must rely upon common sense. In a country where mothers in the street habitually smack their toddlers to induce obedience, where children in fee-paying schools are beaten with sticks to make them do what they are told, a country which has for centuries sent out its young men with guns and bayonets to settle matters of international disagreement, does it really seem likely that 50-year-old television is largely to blame if some teenagers conclude that violence is the way to get what you want?</p>

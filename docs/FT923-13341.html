			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Jordan dismisses Rabin's offer of regional talks JORDAN yesterday dismissed the offer by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, for talks in Jerusalem or neighbouring Arab capitals, saying there must first be 'constructive success' in the formal Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The country's chief delegate to the Middle East peace talks said the 'real issue' was Israel's acceptance of United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories. Mr Abdel Salam Majali said: 'I cannot see the point of inviting us to go to Jerusalem before we really see constructive success in the negotiations in the proper place in which we have all agreed to go to.' He added: 'Israeli leaders have said this many times but one can see it is just talk.' Jordanian officials said King Hussein would maintain his position of rejecting direct talks with Israel without a settlement on its withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza strip. Palestinian officials also said they were disappointed by Mr Rabin's offer, but said they hoped that the offer signalled that Israel might prove more flexible during the next round of Middle East peace talks. No immediate reaction was forthcoming from either Lebanon or Syria, but President Hafez al Assad of Syria has also professed the utmost resistance to visiting Israel. The only Arab leader to have made the trip was President Anwar Sadat, the assassinated Egyptian leader, in a gesture which helped forge peace between Cairo and Israel, but which ostracised Egypt from the rest of the Arab world. Senior Palestinian officials in Amman claimed that despite Mr Rabin's offer to seek a breakthrough in the peace process, the Israeli premier was avoiding what they called the 'pre-requisites for peace'. 'Our problem with Rabin is that he wants to sell himself as a peacemaker, but he has to prove himself with deeds, not words,' said one official. He said that Palestinian delegation at the peace talks wished to see Israel first accept in full the Geneva convention, which bans Israel, as an occupying power, from changing the identity of the West Bank and the Gaza strip. The official said that if Mr Rabin wished to be serious about peace he must show 'genuine readiness' to halt all settlements on the West Bank.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs rap Maxwell lawyers over cash THE COMMONS social security committee yesterday harshly criticised the lawyers and accountants responsible for recovering assets stolen from the pension funds of the late Robert Maxwell and urged that no further government funds be spent on pensioners until the advisers distributed the funds they had collected. Mr Frank Field MP, the Labour chairman, said: 'We are anxious that the government does not increase (funding) further or the whole wretched process will drag on for another year.' The committee released a report on its hearings into the operation to recover more than Pounds 440m stolen from the pension funds. Administrators to the various pension schemes are disputing each other's claims to some of the assets recovered, preventing them from being paid to pensioners. The MPs recommended that Sir John Cuckney, who is heading a government-sponsored trust raising voluntary contributions from City institutions, be appointed to act as mediator among the various parties and set a six-month deadline for the parties to reach agreement. The Department of Social Security called the report 'timely' and said ministers had already expressed concern about the delay in returning funds to the Maxwell Pension Schemes. A Pounds 2.5m government 'drip feed' allocated to pay pensions last year is shortly to be exhausted. Mr Field said that in the past year, almost none of the Pounds 150m recovered on behalf of pensioners had been distributed. In that time, Pounds 34.1m had been spent on solicitors, accountants and others charged with recovering money. That sum might rise to Pounds 100m, he said. The committee singled out for special criticism Mr Peter Phillips, partner at Buchler Phillips and joint receiver to the estate of Mr Maxwell, whom it accused of needlessly pursuing 'claims to property of a fanciful nature'. Mr Field said the committee was drawing up a schedule of representatives of investment banks, including Credit Suisse, Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, Capel-Cure Myers and Invesco MIM to question how those banks came to be in receipt of pension fund assets. The banks had claimed they had received the assets in good faith as collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Mr Field said that refunds to the pension schemes might be forthcoming after those hearings.</p>

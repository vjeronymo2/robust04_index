			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Arts: Miller's Secret Marriage - Cheltenham Festival The Secret Marriage is the well-made 18th-century opera par excellence, which established its own niche in operatic history from the very start when it was encored in its entirety at its first performance. There may be nothing remarkable in Cimarosa's music, especially for a work six years' younger than The Marriage of Figaro, or intricate about the development of the plot. But set up its comic mechanism convincingly and the two acts unwind with a succession of surefire jokes and persistent good humour. Opera North's new production, put before the public for the first time at Cheltenham last Thursday, applies effective enough lubricant to that comic clockwork. The staging is Jonathan Miller's, and marks the beginning of his rehabilitation in British operatic life after more than five years of self-imposed exile since he directed Candide for Scottish Opera in 1988. After Cheltenham the show repairs to the Buxton Festival, where it will form one element in a Miller package alongside his production of Donizetti's Maria Stuarda that opened in Monte Carlo earlier in the year. With designs by John Conklin (a tastefully marbled, duck-egg blue interior) and purposeful conducting by Roy Laughlin this Secret Marriage makes a pleasant, likeable show. The concept is straightforward enough; the action is transplanted from 18th-century Bologna back to Regency England, to the world in which Colamn and Garrick set the play from which Cimarosa's libretto was taken. The opera is sung in very clearly comprehensible English (a new plain translation by Simon Rees, not without some seemingly unintentional double entendres); Geronimo takes on a Yorkshire accent you could cut with a knife ' a self-made man from the burgeoning industrial age if ever you saw one ' and Count Robinson becomes another dim example of the English aristocracy, doubtlessly inbred. It's a sensible, untroubling piece of theatre, carefully worked out by Miller and perkily rendered by his cast. Andrew Shore's Geronimo is the latest of his portrayals of bourgeois bumptiousness, a bumbling cousin to his Don Pasquale; he handles the accent splendidly, times his entrances and exits perfectly, delivers all his gags with perfect deadpan. He's well matched against Jonathan Best's guileless Robinson and Tamsin Dives' bustling Fidalma. The young people are spiritedly taken. The Elisetta, the American Kate Egan, was making her British debut; she sings cleanly and cultivates a good mode of visible disdain. Anne Dawson is a wholesome, perky Carolina and Mark Curtis a diligent Paolino. All of them are stylish, attentive performers; the pace is never allowed to falter.

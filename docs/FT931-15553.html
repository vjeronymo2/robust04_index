			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Toray bucks trend and expands overseas - The Japanese textiles group sees room for more global growth THE economic downturn has prompted a wave of Japanese companies to withdraw from their overseas investments. Toray Industries, the large textile maker, however, is bucking this trend and still expanding overseas. 'The real survival game has just started,' says Mr Hiroshi Maeda, managing director. For Toray, overseas production of textiles is essential to hold down prices to competitive levels. It is also investing in other sectors for sales in overseas markets. The company, which supplies Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, plans to start production at its new Y15bn (Dollars 121m) textile plant in Mansfield this year. In the US, Toray recently added a Dollars 100m manufacturing line in its plastic film plant in Rhode Island, and last year started construction of a plant in Seattle to supply Boeing with carbon fibre resins. The rush back to domestic markets by other Japanese companies is similar to what happened in the recession of the mid-1970s. Although many Japanese textile companies ventured overseas in the early 1970s, the recession triggered by oil price rises prompted a quick change in plans. 'After the oil shock, we were the only ones left in south-east Asia,' says Mr Maeda. Diversification into non-textile products in the mid-1980s prompted Toray to invest in Europe and North America as its customers, trying to minimise inventories, demanded swift supplies. Meanwhile, in the textile sector, Toray bought the polyester-filament weaving operations of Courtaulds, the UK chemicals group, in 1989. Toray expects overseas capital investment for the first six months to September 1993 to rise 27 per cent to Y23bn and it hopes to maintain this growth rate during 1994 and 1995. Unlike electronics companies and carmakers, which rushed to increase production capacity in the late 1980s, analysts point out that Toray's investment decisions had little to do with the 'bubble boom' of the late 1980s. Its plans to increase overseas capacity were triggered by successful sales of newly-developed synthetic fibres. Ms Madoka Umetsu, analyst at brokerage UBS Phillips and Drew in Tokyo, said: 'Toray's domestic textile business was restructured in the 1980s after the company was hit by the endaka - high yen - recession.' The company's belief that fibres and textiles still comprise a growing sector has given it the confidence to develop its innovations. In the late 1980s, annual textile consumption, including industrial use, per capita totalled 27kg in the US, 19kg in the UK, 15.2kg in France, 9.3kg in Spain and 5.4kg in China. The company believes the global textiles market still has more room to grow. The rising yen, high labour costs and growing competition from south-east Asia, also provided the incentive for Toray to develop high value innovative fibres and textiles, which have supported its profits. In addition, the need for strong fibres which can withstand advanced high speed weaving machines has lead to the development of microfibres. Synthetic silks and other woven fabrics offer new creative possibilities for leading Japanese and western fashion designers. Toray also supplies European sports goods makers like Killy and Ellesse with its high-technology fibres which are used to make moisture permeable waterproof fabrics. However, Toray is not unscarred by the effects of Japan's 'bubble economy'. Industrial textile sales have started to fall due to lower demand from the Japanese automobile and electronics industries, while cheaper clothing imports are entering the domestic market. Losses at Toray Construction, a construction affiliate, are also depressing the group's profits. Although Toray is faring better than other leading Japanese textile manufacturers, it expects consolidated pre-tax profits to fall 7 per cent to Y60bn on a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y1,000bn, in the year to March. The company remains cautious over investments in Vietnam and eastern Europe, however. It is still trying to assess the feasibility of setting up plants in such areas. Mr Maeda said: 'Places like east Europe seem too unstable to make large commitments.' Toray needs to see steady returns on overseas investments before planning further spending programmes which justify the fall in profits due to increased borrowing costs. But, with the south-east Asian economies in good shape and the US emerging from recession, the medium-term outlook is favourable. Toray is also hopeful of potential profits in high value applications of high-technology textiles, in markets yet to be exploited.</p>

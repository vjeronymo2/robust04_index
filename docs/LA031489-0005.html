			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: MORNINGSIDE'S GIRLS HAVE SCORE TO SETTLE  </P> <P> For the second consecutive year, the Inglewood Morningside High School girls'  basketball team will play Oakland Fremont for the state Division I championship  at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.  </P> <P> Last season, Morningside held a 52-44 lead with four minutes remaining in the  game, then went cold and lost, 53-52.  </P> <P> The Lady Monarchs (31-1) will get a chance for redemption Saturday night, but  only after receiving a scare last Saturday in their Southern Regional  championship game against San Diego Point Loma.  </P> <P> That game was the most bizarre of the six championship games at the Sports  Arena.  </P> <P> The Lady Monarchs completely dominated the first five minutes, running off to a  17-0 lead. Then they were outscored in the next 11 minutes, 27-13, and led at  halftime, 30-27.  </P> <P> Their problems started when junior center Lisa Leslie picked up her third foul  early in the second quarter.  </P> <P> "I figured that (Point Loma) would come back," Morningside Coach Frank Scott  said. "I just did not see them coming back so far and so fast.  </P> <P> "Having Leslie in foul trouble definitely played a major part in their  comeback."  </P> <P> Point Loma continued its rally in the second half when Leslie picked up her  fourth foul with almost six minutes left in the third quarter. The Pointers  even took a 36-30 lead with 2:24 left in the quarter.  </P> <P> "Our intensity level just fell off at that point," Scott said. "We did not have  the same aggressiveness and just did not keep them down."  </P> <P> Scott took a gamble with 5:59 remaining in the game when he sent Leslie back  in.  </P> <P> "I kept her out as long as I could," said Scott.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-5 Leslie made her presence felt immediately and the Lady Monarchs  made their move. After several lead changes, she made a turnaround eight-foot  jump shot to put Morningside ahead to stay with 55 seconds left.  </P> <P> "She is probably the best offensive player, outside of Cheryl Miller, that I  have seen," Scott said of Leslie, who finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds  in her 21 minutes on the court.  </P> <P> Leslie's last basket did not seal victory for Morningside, as Point Loma guard  Monica Filer had a chance to win the game with seven seconds left.  </P> <P> But Filer, who finished with 20 points, missed a 28-foot shot, thinking that  that there were only three seconds remaining, giving the Lady Monarchs the  victory.  </P> <P> "Point Loma gave us problems with their man-to-man defense," Scott said. "Most  teams play us in a zone because of our quickness and size. Their defense was  tough like Kentucky Southern (the only school Morningside has lost to this  season)."  </P> <P> Jo Jo Witherspoon, the Lady Monarchs' point guard and only senior, had a  difficult time with the Pointers' defense.  </P> <P> Witherspoon, who averaged nearly 18 points a game during the season, had only  nine points and two assists.  </P> <P> "She is the only player who handles the ball for us," Scott said of  Witherspoon. "Point Loma did a great job in denying her the ball, which made it  tough on her."  </P> <P> Morningside has four other underclassmen playing major roles.  </P> <P> Forward Janet Davis, is a 6-3 freshman who averages 11 points, 10 rebounds and  four blocked shots per game. Scott refers to her as his star of the future.  </P> <P> The Lady Monarchs also have sophomores Akiba Flanigan, a 5-9 forward who  averages seven points a game; 5-8 guard Tyesha Whiting and 5-7 guard Bridget  Williams.  </P> <P> This will be the second meeting of the season between Morningside and Fremont.  The Lady Monarchs defeated Fremont in December, 50-42.  </P> <P> Morningside's boys almost joined the girls in Oakland but lost their Division  III game against Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills, the Southern Section 3-A  champion, 60-57.  </P> <P> The Monarchs, who lost in the Southern Section 3-A semifinals, played the  opposite of the Lady Monarchs in the first half, falling behind, 22-8.  </P> <P> Morningside co-Coach Carl Franklin said the Monarchs' intense desire to win  cost them in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "We wanted to win so badly at first," Franklin said. "Once things started going  wrong, we got frustrated and were complaining on every play."  </P> <P> Morningside's bench was called for a technical foul early in the second  quarter.  </P> <P> After that, the Monarchs outscored the Mustangs in the last four minutes of the  first half, 21-6.  </P> <P> "We settled down after that technical," Franklin said. "The momentum seemed to  move to us when we started to play a different type of . . . pressure defense."  </P> <P> In the second half, Morningside fell victim to what has at times plagued its  girls' team, inability to maintain a lead.  </P> <P> The Monarchs led with 5:40 left in the fourth quarter, 51-41, before Trabuco  Hills rallied.  </P> <P> "We knew that we are not any good at stalling," said Morningside's other coach,  Ron Randle. "It is just a situation where we were able to get the lead by  forcing the play but then had to make the decision to either stay with it or  pull out."  </P> <P> Morningside tried both, lost its momentum and was outscored the rest of the  way, 19-6.  </P> <P> "We were fortunate to have been invited into the state playoffs after losing in  the (sectional) semifinals," Franklin said. "I am glad that we made a good  showing."  </P></p>

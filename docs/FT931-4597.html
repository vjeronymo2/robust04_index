			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: AJ Archer agrees to buy Castle Holdings AJ ARCHER Holdings, the quoted Lloyd's underwriter, has reached agreement to acquire Castle Holdings. The association will form one of the largest agency groups at the Lloyd's insurance market. Castle shareholders will receive 12.5m Archer ordinary shares, valuing the smaller group at about Pounds 5m. The takeover will create an agency managing 15 syndicates, with a combined capacity - or capital base - of Pounds 391m. Although the group will still be significantly smaller than Sturge Holdings, the market leader with managed capacity of more than Pounds 700m, it ranks alongside such agencies as Merrett, Wellington and Murray Lawrence. The agency will also handle the affairs of some 640 Lloyd's Names - the individuals whose assets make up Lloyd's capital base - as a result of the merger of its members' agency interests.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Referendum may strengthen Kiev reformers REFERENDUMS are catching on in the former Soviet republics. First, Russian president Boris Yeltsin, under pressure from the parliament, put his leadership to the test in April's referendum. Now the Ukrainian parliament has responded to President Kravchuk's assumption of wider executive powers by voting to hold a referendum of confidence in both the president and parliament in September. In Russia, the referendum has strengthened the hand of the economic reformers. Might the same be true in Ukraine? Something certainly had to be done to give a new reform in Kiev a new impetus. After a seemingly promising start last December, prime minister Leonid Kuchma has appeared to lose his grip, culminating in last week's presidential decree declaring that Mr Kuchma will head an 'emergency committee' to run the economy under Mr Kravchuk's control. Meanwhile, the state of the economy has deteriorated rapidly. One of the best measures of economic progress in the former Soviet economies is the black market exchange rate. Output statistics are heavily distorted, unemployment rates meaningless and official inflation rates unreliable. But the willingness of the population to hold the currency gives a relatively undistorted measure of inflationary pressures and confidence in the government's economic strategy. The judgment of the Ukrainian public has been severe, as the left-hand chart shows. It tracks the exchange rate between Ukrainian coupon and US dollars at which black market traders buy dollars in Kiev. The exchange rates are measured weekly in a project run by Mr Simon Johnson of the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University and Mr Oleg Ustenko of the Kiev State Economics University. The coupon has fallen in value by nearly 250 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of the year. The sharpest falls occurred in April when it emerged that the central bank had released a new tranche of credits without informing the government. The unofficial inflation rate, compiled by measuring the prices of the same basket of goods each month in Kiev state stores, has accelerated back towards 50 per cent a month. The coupon has, as a result, the dubious privilege of being one of the few currencies in the world that has depreciated against the Russian rouble this year. The rouble-dollar exchange, measured by a Johnson-Ustenko team in St Petersburg, has fallen by 188 per cent this year. In Kiev, the coupon has slipped in value from 1.95 roubles at the beginning of January to 2.6 roubles last week. At this rate, a smart trader with transport can just make a profit from round-tripping between Kiev and St Petersburg. If President Kravchuk is serious about stabilising the inflation, then the Russian experience suggests a popular referendum might help his cause. Since Mr Yeltsin's victory, the Russian government has been able to reach a credit agreement with the central bank which has met with approval from the International Monetary Fund. The rouble exchange rate has stabilised in recent weeks in the expectation that IMF financial aid will provide a new source of non-inflationary budget finance this year. But first the Ukrainian government has to win the referendum. For a president with extensive executive powers, the temptation to buy votes by agreeing to popular increases in subsidies and welfare benefits is probably overwhelming. Certainly Mr Yeltsin took this approach which explains the slump in the rouble exchange rate in April and May and the coupon's recovery against the rouble. Western advisers now believe the underlying Russian inflation rate has fallen below 20 per cent. But the Johnson-Ustenko unofficial measure puts the rate above that in St Petersburg in the early weeks of this month. Ukraine starts its referendum campaign with a monthly inflation rate already in the 50 per cent region, the threshold at which inflation becomes hyperinflation. Ukraine now faces a destabilising few months. Watch the coupon.  --------------------------------------------------    UNOFFICIAL MONTHLY INFLATION RATES (PER CENT)  --------------------------------------------------                      Kiev        St. Petersburg  -------------------------------------------------- Jan '93               41               19 Feb                   15               46 Mar                   15                5 Apr                   12                2 May                   23               12 Jun                   47               54  --------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade figures are given in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices.

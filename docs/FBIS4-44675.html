			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Space: European Union To </F> Participate in SPOT-4 Satellite Programme"; as released by  Brussels Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] The European Union is to contribute ECU16 million  towards development of one of the Spot-4 satellite instruments,  "Vegetation," work for which is being carried out by the French  Space Agency CNES.    Spot-4 is an earth-observation satellite, due to be launched  into orbit towards the middle of 1997.    CNES announced on January 17 that an agreement had been  signed with the European Commission, under which some ECU16  million will be made available to the French agency for  development of the programme, in which besides the Commission,  the French, Belgian, Swedish and Italian Governments are to  participate. The technical work will be carried out by the  French giant Aerospatiale.    The EU will be financing 50 percent of the Vegetation  project, which calls for development of the instrument and  establishment of a centre for image processing. CNES has  announced that the Commission had already made provision for  "complementary financing." In tandem with another instrument,  the HVIR (high resolution in visible and infra-red images),  Vegetation is expected to provide daily coverage of the globe  with the same spectral characteristics as other high-resolution  satellite instruments, whose images can be analysed at local and  regional level.    Vegetation is thus expected to provide the EU with vital  data  on agriculture, environment, international cooperation and  research.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Vodafone's crime bill - Company in the News The IBM executive neglected his lunch as he recounted, sourly, how his cellular telephone had been ripped from his car by a bicycle-mounted thief in south London. He had become another victim in a crime wave in which 15,000 such phones are stolen every month. Vodafone, the UK market leader in mobile phones, can count itself a victim of the same phenomenon. Its interim results this week showed profits in the first half of the year were dented by fraud and criminal activity at home. Abroad, it was held back by heavier than expected start-up costs, amounting to Pounds 40m in the half year. Nevertheless, it managed to come in ahead of most analysts' estimates, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 186.4m on sales of Pounds 560.7m compared with predictions of Pounds 175m to Pounds 185m. One reason for Vodafone's success is that the market for mobile phones has expanded beyond all expectations in the past year. The growth has favoured mainly the established companies, Vodafone and Cellnet, offering mature and proven analogue systems, over newcomers Mercury One-2-One and Orange. Their digital networks cover less of the country and still have performance problems. This Christmas should see an unprecedented boom in mobile phone sales. Looking further ahead, analysts think there could be 10m subscribers to cellular services by 2000 compared with estimates of 8m a year ago. Vodafone's share of the growth over the past year was 263,000, an increase of 140 per cent over the same period last year. But the expansion in numbers brought an increase in fraud and 'low-quality' subscribers - people who take the service with no intention of paying and must eventually be disconnected. 'Phantom' subscribers, signed up by unscrupulous dealers to secure commissions, and 're-chippers' - people who alter the electrical identity of portable phones to make calls at other subscribers' expense  - have added to the problems. The cost to the company of various forms of fraud is about 1 per cent of turnover. Indeed, Vodafone has been making clear to analysts that the problems of fraud and low-quality subscribers have not been eliminated fully, and that low numbers of net connections compared with the rival Cellnet are expected to continue for the next two months. Abroad, Vodafone's businesses in Hong Kong and Malta are profitable while Greece and South Africa have performed well. It also belongs to a consortium, led by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which leads in the battle to get a mobile telephony licence in Spain. A big question for Vodafone and its competitors is how long prices can remain stable. They have held up strongly over the past year, helped by the declaration in June by chief executive Gerry Whent that Vodafone would not cut its tariffs this year. Inevitably, however, they will fall. And, at the same time, much of the new growth is coming from the residential sector - which is inherently less profitable than the business market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has authorized the  entry of another 4,000 Palestinian laborers from the territories  to work in Israel. Approximately half of them will be employed  in industry while the other half will work in agriculture. This  authorization applies to married Palestinians over the age of 27  who have worked in Israel for over five years.    Our correspondent 'Ofra Nehman notes that with the addition  of these workers, the number of laborers from the territories  working in Israel is now equal to the number of those employed  prior to the decision to impose a full closure.</p>

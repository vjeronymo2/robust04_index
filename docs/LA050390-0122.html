			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> CITY TO SPONSOR CLUB  </P> <P> The Monrovia Aquatics Club will remain a city-sponsored program, at least for  another 18 months, the City Council decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Community Services Department had recommended that the 45-member club  become independent, but a large turnout of supporters at City Hall Tuesday  persuaded the council to continue subsidizing the club's activities for now,  Councilwoman Mary Wilcox said.  </P> <P> After 18 months, the city will evaluate whether the club should become  independent, City Manager Jim Starbird said. Until then, the city will help pay  for coaches and insurance, he said. Starbird said the city spends $2,500 or  less each year to support the club's programs.  </P></p>

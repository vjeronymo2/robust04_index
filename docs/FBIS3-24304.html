The Causes of Economic Collapse and Ways To  Overcome It"--for first two installments see Ukrainian National  Affairs Section of Central Eurasia Daily Report of 28 Dec 93 p  30, 11 Jan 94 p 52, for parts III and IV see Ukraine Political  Affairs Section of the FBIS Report: Central Eurasia of 3 Mar 94  pp 7-15]    [Text]  <H6>  1. </H6>   Two years have gone by since our government, without giving  the matter much thought, followed in the footsteps of "older  brother" Russia and liberated the prices of consumer goods and  services. These prices are now skyrocketing madly. The output of  goods is falling. This is happening at such an accelerated pace  that by the fall of 1993 Ukraine's economy fell into the grip of  hyperinflation bearing all the signs of economic collapse.    Those who choose not to see the principal reason for this  terrible situation in the economy are trying to attribute it to  the rupture of economic ties with the sovereign states that made  up the former USSR and, above all, with Russia. Others, who  lament the decline of the command-distributive system of  management, believe that the sole cause of our economic disaster  is the disruption of the state's management of the economy.    But as life is showing us, neither the creation of the  commonwealth of independent states, which was to have restored  interstate ties, nor even the launching of an economic union  conceived for the purpose of ultimately reviving the political  union (read: transforming the USSR), nor the attempt by former  Prime Minister Kuchma to restore the centralized system of state  management are capable of halting the economic collapse.    The principal reason for our unremitting descent into an  economic abyss is the complete inaction on the part of the  Supreme Council, the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers of  Ukraine in the sphere of economic and sociopolitical change  while in unanimous agreement only on the liberalization of  prices.    Unfortunately, in contrast to Russia, the Czech Republic,  Hungary, and Poland, for example, Ukraine has produced no state  leaders with sufficient will, ability, and, above all, desire to  firmly and fundamentally implement radical economic and  sociopolitical change. A struggle for power, political and  ideological strife between the former party-nomenklatura group  and today's democratic groupings, multiplied by wariness,  self-satisfaction, and complete professional ignorance, and an  unprecedented flowering of the mafia and shadow elements have  all resulted in the formation of an ineffective ruling center,  whose ambiguous and insufficiently founded actions make it very  similar to the former Union center.    As in the days when the USSR still existed, there is a  growing body of opinion within the borders of independent  Ukraine that the fate of economic rebirth, and thus the fate of  millions of ordinary citizens of Ukraine, should not be decided  by the center, but at the local level, for a given region. Even  Leonid Kuchma in his farewell address at the eighth session of  the Supreme Council last September said that the center is no  longer able to decide socioeconomic issues and that more and  more often these matters are being handled in the regions. This  is indeed the case. Moreover, the inaction at the top with  respect to economic changes is stirring up separatist  sentiments, particularly in regions where the Russian-speaking  population constitutes a majority. In voting for the  independence of Ukraine, these people cherished the hope that  they would enjoy a better life than they had had before,  especially compared with neighboring Russia. When this did not  happen, a significant number of the people came to regard  independence, especially Ukrainian independence, as fate's  bitter irony. For these people (their place of residence is the  Soviet Union), a "sausage prosperity" is far more important than  Ukrainian statehood, let alone Ukrainian patriotism. The most  important evidence supporting their argument is the condition of  the economy, whose improvement is awaited by virtually the whole  population of Ukraine.  <H6>  2. </H6>   The disparity between the declarations of the government and  the president and the actions that actually accompany these  declarations on economic reforms (take, for example, the  decisions on privatization that were passed by the Supreme  Council in the form of two programs, one for 1992 and the second  for 1993, but not implemented) is leading to a situation in  which under pressure from enterprising individuals, local  government organs (usually city organs) in some regions are  beginning to reform their economies on their own. Without  waiting for directives from above, they are carrying out  so-called small privatization, which, unfortunately, even in  these regions is progressing at a very slack pace (estimates  show that only some 1,500 objects have been privatized). To  defend their actions, more than 100 local communal property  privatization organs have joined together in their own  association.    But as long as power remains in the hands of people who wait  for instructions from above, we cannot expect to see any  significant changes in the conduct of economic reforms in  Ukraine. Together, the local nomenklatura and the center have  already made their "contribution" to what is widely known in  international economic circles as the "Ukrainization of the  economy" -- in other words, a knack for destroying the economy.    Even in an ideal situation (something we can only imagine),  if the onservative officials are successfully replaced by  reformers (but where are we to find them?), the necessary  changes will not be made for two reasons: first, because all  changes will be implemented only on the initiative of the  center, whose directives will not always suit the specific  conditions of a given territory's development, and, second,  because without the opportunity to show initiative, local  government organs will not always be interested in executing the  directives issuing from the top. It is therefore essential to  reach agreement regarding national as opposed to regional  interests in effecting economic changes and to use this as a  basis for implementing an active territorial policy of economic  reforms. This would relax the tension in relations between the  center and the regions and transfer the burden of economic and  social problems to the local level. All strata of the population  would then be directing questions about their life to their  local government organs and themselves instead of the president  or government of Ukraine. Moreover, the separatist flames that  flare up from time to time in various regions of Ukraine would  die away. And if someone were to fan them, there would be  grounds on which to extinguish them. Whereas, quite frankly, no  such grounds exist today, because the regions have virtually no  economic independence.  <H6>  3. </H6>   What does the economic independence of regions mean? In the  transition to a market economy, and even more so once market  relations are in effect, every economic entity, every structure  within the economic system, and especially every region, must be  economically independent. Unfortunately, some leaders, who have  no understanding of real politics and even less of economics,  define economic independence as economic autonomy, which, for  the most part, is intertwined with political independence and  ultimately leads to state separatism.    The theory and practice of market relations prove that  economic independence means, above all, a region's right to  choose its own paths and methods of economic and social  development and to manage at its own discretion within the  framework of state laws but relying on local initiative and the  region's resource, production, and scientific potential. Thus  all economic and social gains become the attainment of the  region, whose fate is decided without interference from the  center but with national interests taken into account.    Today, Ukraine's various regions are attaining different  degrees and forms of economic independence by methods that are  for the most part uncivilized. The regions use different ways to  win this independence. ome, like the Republic of Crimea, do so  by way of social destabilization and threatening to join Russia,  ultimately succeeding in getting the Supreme Council of Ukraine  to pass legislation granting it limited economic autonomy.  Others -- Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk  oblasts -- also playing the Russian card, force the president to  issue an edict permitting them to conduct an experiment in which  the oblast state administrations manage all objects, including  those owned by the state. The third category -- Odessa Oblast --  passes a decision in the oblast council of people's deputies and  then requests the Supreme Council, the president, and the  Cabinet of Ministers to grant it permission to also conduct an  experiment in full-fledged economic independence. The fourth  category -- Zakarpattya Oblast -- has elected a legitimate  course towards economic autonomy through the creation of a free  economic zone on the territory of the entire oblast.    An analysis of the situation shows that the center, fearing  separatist sentiments, limits the powers of regions in the  sphere of economic independence. For example, having won  autonomy, the Crimean Republic nevertheless has limited economic  rights, under which the principles of self-sufficiency and  self-financing do not function. The fact of the matter is that  the republic's economy is subordinated to the national  centralized system of financing, taxation, and, to a certain  extent, with respect to the supply of materials and equipment.  Even its socioeconomic growth indices are coordinated with the  central ministries and departments. That the Crimean Republic's  economy is dependent on the state cauldron is also confirmed by  the fact that last year more than 60 percent of the republic's  budget expenditures were covered by the state. It should be  noted, however, that to some extent these funds were linked with  the center's desire to reduce the social tensions that were  constantly present in this region and which were giving rise to  separatist sentiments.    To avoid this diversity of ways and negative results of  attaining economic independence by various regions, the center  should view this independence as an objective factor essential  to the effective development of Ukraine as market relations are  established. The state should make provision for this  independence in its territorial policy and pass appropriate  legislation to secure it. On the basis of this legislation, as  well as a mechanism for implementing economic independence  developed in advance, all regions, regardless of their level of  development, should be granted economic freedom and allowed to  exercise it in accordance with their self-governing powers. It  is undesirable, however, for some regions to be granted more and  others fewer economic powers, which, unfortunately, is something  that we are witnessing in regions that are successfully wresting  economic power for themselves. Economic inequality will lead to  a social stratification of the regions, and this will provoke  sociopolitical tensions.    (To be continued in the next issue)</p>

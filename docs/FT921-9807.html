			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / French wine output hit by spring frost FRANCE'S wine industry suffered a drop in output of about 35 per cent last year, after three years of excellent vintages and healthy production. The latest figures from the Finance Ministry show the volume of wine produced in France fell from 65.53m hectolitres in 1990 to 42.69m in 1991, when vineyards in regions such as Bordeaux, Medoc, St Emilion and Entre-Deux-Mers were hit by bitter frosts in the early spring. The higher quality wines suffered the steepest falls in output. Production of vins delimites de qualite superieure at the upper end of the market almost halved - falling from 647,359 hectolitres in 1990 to 373,497 hectolitres last year. By contrast, production of vins de pays was relatively stable at 11.06m hectolitres. For any other industry such a steep fall in production would be disastrous. But the idiosyncratic nature of the wine trade means that, after three years of over-production, a 35 per cent fall in output is exactly what France's vineyards needed. The healthy harvests of 1987, 1988 and 1989 were good news for wine buffs in that they yielded vintages of high quality. But so much wine was produced in those years that prices have fallen, thereby imposing intense pressure on the industry's profitability. This problem of over-production has been aggravated by the economic recession in key markets, notably the US, where demand for wine has weakened leaving the French wine trade with low sales and high stocks. The poor harvest of 1991 should, at the very least, help alleviate the stock problem. In the meantime, French consumers are beginning to benefit from the wine industry's plight. Although retailers are reluctant to discuss the sensitive issue of price, there is some anecdotal evidence that prices are falling. Two St Emilion wines - Angelusse 1987 and Pavie 1987 - now sell in supermarkets for about FFr100 (Pounds 10.23) and FFr80 respectively. Both would have cost 30 to 40 per cent more six months ago. Even prestigious wine sellers like Legrand on the Rue de la Banque in Paris are not immune. Legrand has not actually stooped to cutting prices but, it says, it has not had to raise them for the last 12 months.</p>

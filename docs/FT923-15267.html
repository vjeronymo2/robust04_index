			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (9): A lot of talk but not much action - The accountants' view ACCOUNTANTS venturing into corporate finance work in the UK have been hit by the recession like their banking competitors. But it would be difficult to work that out by talking to them. 'The UK market is very, very depressed,' says Mr Howard Hyman, head of corporate finance at Price Waterhouse. 'But we have been highly successful.' Mr Richard Stone, from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, agrees: 'There's a lot of talking but not much action in mergers and acquisitions,' he says. 'But we are at about the same level as last year.' Mr Richard Mead, of Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'It's going to be a dull summer. Anyone who says the market is OK is not telling the truth . . . but the gloom and doom can be somewhat overplayed.' The apparent contradictions in the statements of these men - and most of their competitors - is partly explained by the niche strengths of their firms, of which they make great play. For Price Waterhouse, for example, that means a strong European network which helps offset the downturn of business in the UK. 'No doubt all our competitors talk about having a genuinely integrated European network, but we are the only people who really do have one,' says Mr Hyman. 'We are very federal. That has fantastic advantages, by allowing us to run as one company with access to an enormous number of contacts.' Mr Jerry Acher, head of corporate finance at KPMG Peat Marwick, says business has been 'surprisingly resilient'. He says the firm made Pounds 50.3m in the year to last September, and is projecting Pounds 55m-Pounds 60m this year. That was generated by more than 300 professional staff around the country. Peat's sources of revenue in recent months have included work on overseas privatisations such the national electricity grid in Argentina, and a series of projects in eastern Europe. Even in the UK, Mr Acher says the firm has continued to strengthen. That has partly been through the provision of advice on new issues and management buy-outs, but also because of 'forensic' accounting, financial restructuring of businesses in difficulty, and bid defence work for a number of well-known target companies in recent hostile takeover battles. For most of the firms, the lower end of the market has provided most of their work. Mr Stone says the average deal for Coopers last year was about Pounds 16m. 'We don't see the Pounds 500m disposal as in our realm,' he says. The size of deals done by the firms has shrunk in the last few months. Mr Richard Mead of Ernst &amp; Young, which generated about Pounds 7m in the year to April, says the average transaction has reduced to Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m, from about Pounds 10m two years ago. He says the firm has been increasing the number of dedicated corporate finance offices in regions around the UK to help lift new business. It has switched to different services more suitable to the recession, including financial restructuring. Assessing how the firms are doing is not easy. If they have brought nothing else to the corporate finance industry, they have certainly come well-armed with the skills of creative accountancy. Mr Hyman refuses to provide details of the income generated from PW's corporate finance arm. He argues that it is not comparable with the rival firms, which include activities other than 'straight corporate finance' work such as the due diligence conducted on acquisitions to verify stated financial information. Certainly due diligence in Coopers lifted its 'pure' corporate finance income from Pounds 35m to nearly Pounds 80m last year, according to Richard Stone. But Mr Acher defends the inclusion of these activities in KPMG's corporate finance division. 'They all have a very similar skill base,' he says. 'It's very important to have a common approach to marketing, development and quality control.' In spite of the difficulties of obtaining objective data, it does seem that the accountants have made powerful in-roads into the corporate finance market, with substantial and growing billings. That has not helped endear them to other parts of the corporate finance world. They have struck a raw nerve, which has become particularly raw during the recession. Disgruntled bankers and other observers of the industry criticise the encroachment. They moan privately that accountants are not well-trained to be deal-makers - it is quite a transition from the cautious analytical examiner of books to the bravado of the risk-taking wheeler-dealer. They suggest that the accountants do not have the contacts at sufficiently high levels within a large enough number of organisations to provide the best service. They question whether all too often deals claimed by the accountants are simply contracts on which they have 'piggy-backed' on to bankers by providing some modest technical advice, rather than as lead advisers. These are criticisms that the accountancy firms have heard all too often. 'The original entrance of the accountants into corporate finance a few years ago was over-hyped, but misdirected,' says Mr Mead. 'But the firms are now well established. It is just not true today.' Mr Stone agrees: 'There is an element of tension, but I don't think it is as great as it was. The bigger merchant banks see there is plenty of room for us all. The smaller end sees the firms as a threat.' Mr Hyman says the accountants have a very large client base to leverage, provide independent advice, and do provide the skills required. 'Where do most banks recruit financiers from? The accountancy firms,' he says. Indeed, Mr Acher says: 'I hope we continue to lose people to the merchant bankers. It is absolutely vital that we continue these relationships.' But he defends the basic training his firm offers: 'The chartered accountancy qualification is an important base. It teaches you care, and a detailed approach.' He is dismissive of the suggestion that the accountants are depriving the bankers of business. Accountants do not have access to external capital, and are unlikely to move into very large deals. Smaller businesses, which might previously have tried to conduct deals without so much external professional advice, are more of a target. 'We are fishing in the same pond to some extent, but we are trying to make the pond bigger for everyone,' he says.</p>

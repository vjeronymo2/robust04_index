			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Needham issues pledge to exporters THE PROMISE of a fresh dialogue between the government and exporters about how to improve the performance of British exports was made yesterday as a six-strong delegation from the British Exporters' Association (Bexa) met Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister. Mr Needham agreed to meet the exporters in three months' time to update them on what the government was doing and to hear their concerns. The Department of Trade and Industry said the new minister found the meeting 'helpful and useful'. Bexa said it believed that the dialogue would 'lead to a comprehensive understanding of our mutual objectives in maintaining and developing the international competitiveness of the UK export industry, for the overall benefit of the country's economy'. The delegation was led by Mr Keith Johnson, the chairman of its industry section. The association said it had not previously had a dialogue with ministers. Differences between exporters and the government were consistently highlighted last year over the government's sale of the insurance services group, the short-term credit insurance arm of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. More generally, exporters have expressed a view that the UK government is not doing as much as its foreign counterparts to promote British exports. Earlier this month, a memorandum from Bexa warning ministers of the risk that the UK was turning into 'a screwdriver-assembly economy' was leaked to the Labour party. While just a general and introductory discussion, yesterday's meeting still focused on export services provided by the government, including the role of the continuing ECGD. In the past few years, trade ministers have often committed themselves to listening to, and working in partnership with, British industry, while in practice relations have become progressively worse.</p>

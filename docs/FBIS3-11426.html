The  group of masked men, brandishing sticks and stones, positioned  themselves at the Ministry gates and prevented people who were  paying their taxes and making other transactions in the morning  of 16 March from exiting.    Castillo Figueroa and a group of bullies entered the  facilities in search of Finance Minister Edwin Sagrera to demand  an increase in the the National University allotment, but  Sagrera was not in his office at the time. The criminals said  that they would stay in the area holding employees and private  citizens hostage until the minister returned to discuss the  problem. Many women feared that something serious was going to  happen and fled through a small fence, leaving their purses and  other possessions on the premises.    National Police riot officers moved to the site in order to  protect public property. The police presence prompted the  masked men to draw the weapons they had been hiding and begin  provoking the officers, who were staying several meters away.    Several vehicles belonging to UN Observers for El Salvador  members were parked at the main entrance as though to protect  the masked men, who refused to let the employees and private  citizens leave.    Castillo Figueroa told the officers: "There will not be any  problems, we have control over the youths." Moments later the  riot police left the site, and the masked men remained inside  the building.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1200 GMT on 23 June broadcasts a 16-minute election  broadcast by Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Council  and candidate in the presidential elections. He begins by  asking listeners to vote for the candidate who spoke the truth  irrespective of whether it is convenient or not. He says that  he has never changed his views for the sake of personal gain.    Speaking about the kind of state he wants to build,  Oleksandr  Moroz says: "We should build a strong, flourishing, and  democratic state in which its citizens will be proud of their  citizenship regardless of where they are. This will not be  easy, because all the negative things that you are experiencing  in your lives are proof of the complexity of the matter. We are  talking about the poverty that is being felt today by the  majority of the population, the crippled fate of many people,  the disrespect on the part of the state toward veterans,  pensioners, those who fought in the war, and invalids. I  experienced these difficulties over the course of many years and  would like to say that the highest officials in the state should  care first and foremost for those people who cannot look after  themselves."    He goes on to say that as regards the others the state  should  create the right conditions for them to be able to realize their  potential. He says that the majority of people do not have this  possibility: "This means that the policy of the state's  development, which the authorities chose in the last few years,  has not completely corresponded to the interests of the people.  I would even say that it does not correspond to the interests  of the people to an even bigger extent, and undoubtedly this  policy must be changed."    Speaking on the economy, Oleksandr Moroz said that priority  must be given to restructuring and to encouraging enterprises to  produce for export as well as to produce goods for the  population: "You will agree with me that today such goods are  food products." He added that the right infrastructure must  also be created. He makes a special appeal to Ukraine's youth,  students, and young people in general: "It is not easy for you  today. There is an easy temptation to go into business, to make  some money, and by doing so to support one's independence  economically. It is possible to understand you because the  state created no other conditions, but it should create them in  order for you to be guaranteed your independence for your entire  lives and not only in this difficult stage of transition. This  guarantee should be based on new jobs, new labor relations, and  on the opportunity to earn a living worthy of you."    Moroz says that during his election campaign he has visited  many enterprises and organizations and was asked the same  question everywhere which was difficult to reply to: "This  question is connected with whether there will be work for  tomorrow, why are enterprises stopping production, how can one  live on such a paltry wage, will apartments be built, will the  housing waiting lists be made longer or will they be reduced,  will there be social guarantees for free education, labor,  health care, cultural achievements, and so on and so forth?  People are worried by simple everyday problems and it is  difficult for me to give a reply today but the state must reply  to these questions because otherwise there will be no trust in  the state."    Speaking on the Chernobyl problem, Oleksandr Moroz says it  is  not simply a Ukrainian problem but a problem for the whole  world. On nuclear weapons he says: "We gave a unique example  to the world of how to solve the problem of civilization. We  are the only country in the world, throughout its history, that  took specific steps to reduce military security, particularly  nuclear security."    Concluding his election broadcast on Ukrainian radio,  Oleksandr Moroz says: "I hope that those who are still undecided  today will not be frightened by my views or by my candidacy.  Dear compatriots, what I support today I supported two and even  three years ago. What I warned you against has now become  reality and you see it around you and in your families. This  should elicit fear and some thoughts as to which candidate to  support. On 26 June we are not just electing a president. Look  at who is fighting for deputies' mandates at the local level, at  rayon and oblast councils, and the city of Kiev and why." He  adds: "Think before you cast your vote and come without fail to  the elections. It is an exceptionally important matter for  society. Once again I would like to stress that I believe that  we will build a strong Ukrainian state which is respected in the  world, but in order to do this we need a joint political will  and a desire to work together, an understanding that we are all  equal, that we have one motherland and that we can only build it  if we build it for all who live here."</p>

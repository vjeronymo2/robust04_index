Dane, Chief, Office of Scientific Authority (MS-ARLSQ&hyph;725), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240; fax number 703&hyph;358&hyph;2276, telephone 703&hyph;358&hyph;1708. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates certain international trade in CITES-listed species. Export of specimens of species listed in Appendix II of the treaty may only occur upon approval of a Scientific Authority and a Management Authority of the country of export. In the United States, the Scientific Authority and Management Authority responsibilities are assigned to the Secretary of the Interior and are carried out by offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CITES provides for listing of whole plants and specifically designated parts and derivatives of Appendix II plants. Since 1973, whole plants and roots of American ginseng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Panax quinquefolius)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> have been so listed. In 1985, for reasons unrelated to the trade in American ginseng, the CITES Parties (member countries) revised listing practices and decided to regulate not only whole specimens of plants on Appendix II, but also all their readily recognizable parts and derivatives, unless they were specifically excluded. As a consequence, the listing for ginseng needed restatement, and the listing proposal adopted by the Parties (November 22, 1985, 50 FR 48212) continues to regulate ginseng exports, including plants, whole roots, essentially intact roots, and root chunks and slices [50 CFR 23.23(d)(3)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service may issue findings yearly or for more than one year. It began making multiyear findings for the export of American ginseng on a State-by-State basis with issuance of the Scientific Authority and Management Authority findings to cover the 1982&hyph;84 harvest seasons. On October 4, 1982 (47 FR 43701), the Service reported that it found that the status of wild ginseng did not appear to vary greatly from one year to the next within any given State, and that the existing information compiled was adequate to justify findings under CITES for 3 years. The initial multiyear rule was followed by a second such rule for the 1985&hyph;87 harvest seasons (50 FR 39691, September 30, 1985; 50 FR 42027, October 17, 1985), and subsequent rules for the 1988&hyph;90 seasons (53 FR 33815, September 1, 1988) and the 1991&hyph;93 seasons (56 FR 41806, August 23, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service uses information compiled since 1977 to make the multiyear findings. This notice concerns the Service's proposed findings to approve the export of American ginseng to be collected in certain States in the 1994&hyph;96 harvest seasons. The Service plans to continue to review current biological and harvest information concerning ginseng and those State programs approved for exporting of their ginseng. The State information previously submitted need not be resubmitted if it is incorporated by reference and its validity reaffirmed. The Service is retaining the option to revise 3-year findings whenever warranted by information that shows the need for change. The procedures herein have been somewhat streamlined and clarified, and the Service would welcome comments concerning further simplification of these procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scientific Authority Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The overall criteria used by the Scientific Authority in finding whether export will not be detrimental to the survival of a species are generally as follows (summarized from a notice of July 11, 1977; 42 FR 35800):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Whether such export has occurred in the past and has appreciably reduced numbers or distribution of the species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Whether such export has or is expected to increase, remain constant, or decrease; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Whether the life-history parameters of the species and relevant structure and function in its ecosystems indicate that the present or proposed levels of export, considered with the potential impacts of other factors, are expected to appreciably reduce the numbers or distribution of the species, or cause signs of appreciable ecological stress within the species and/or in other species within its ecosystems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For ginseng, the evaluation for nondetriment by the Scientific Authority, in accordance with these general criteria, is based on the information and data submitted on the following topics by each affected State and from other appropriate sources. Information previously submitted that remains valid need only be referenced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following information and data for wild ginseng can be conveniently recorded by natural region(s) of the State or by county, preferably on a State map, or in a table of the counties. Ginseng is to be considered wild if it occurs in naturally perpetuated habitat where the species is naturally propagated or with only limited planting of seeds and with no subsequent tending of plants or habitat before harvest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Historic distribution of ginseng, with indication of optimal habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Location and approximate acreage of statute-protected lands in the State on which wild ginseng occurs and where collecting is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Present abundance of ginseng, using the indices of 0 = absent, 1 = rare, 2 = occasional, 3 = frequent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Density within the ginseng populations for each natural region (or county) where present, using the indices of 1 = sparse, 2 = moderate, 3 = dense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Harvest collecting intensity, using the indices of 0 = none, 1 = light, 2 = moderate, 3 = heavy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Preferably by natural regions of the State (or by county) rather than statewide, the average number of roots per pound (dry weight) as purchased by dealers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Information on trends in wild ginseng populations for the State or, if possible, natural regions of the State, indicating whether populations are apparently increasing, stable, decreasing, or being extirpated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

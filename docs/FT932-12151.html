			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: First-quarter earnings at GMAC slide to Dollars 284m GENERAL MOTORS Acceptance Corporation saw first-quarter earnings decline to Dollars 284.1m from Dollars 349.1m in the same period last year, excluding a Dollars 282.6m charge from an accounting change for post-retirement benefits for employees, Reuter reports. First-quarter results 'reflected actions previously taken to maintain a strong liquidity posture,' Mr Robert O'Connell, GMAC chairman, said. Profits from financing operations, including mortgage results, totalled Dollars 250.3m, compared with Dollars 289.2m in 1992, excluding a Dollars 232.8m accounting charge. Lower earnings were due to reduced interest rate margins, lower asset levels and reduced gains from receivable sales, partially offset by improved loss trends and strong earnings from GMAC's international operations, GMAC said. Insurance operations contributed Dollars 33.8m to 1993 earnings, down from Dollars 59.9m, excluding a Dollars 49.8m accounting charge. The decrease was due to unfavourable commercial lines underwriting results.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: NOTHING TO DECLARE;  </P> <P> SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS MEMOIRS BY JOHN UPDIKE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 256 PP.)  </P> <P> When John Updike revisited his childhood hometown of Shillington, Penn., he  walked the streets one night in a misty rain. Everything spoke to him in its  survival, or more commonly, in its replacement by something else. There was the  luncheonette, the movie theater, the school.  </P> <P> Only his old house was mute. It seemed blunt and unrevealing. "Its familiar  face and I had little to say to each other."  </P> <P> Little to say. Perhaps it was inevitable that when Updike came to try his hand  at autobiographical sketching, after so much fictionalizing of his life, he  would offer a candid judgment on the effort. Aside from being a distinguished  novelist and the correspondence secretary of America's college class of 1954,  he is a shrewd and fair-minded reviewer.  </P> <P> Here and there through these sketches, he puts up flags of discouragement.  "These memoirs feel shabby," he writes. Memory is like the wishing-skin in  fairy tales, with its limited number of wishes. His, he writes, has been "used  up and wished away in the self-serving corruption of fiction."  </P> <P> In fact, what a memoir most requires is not memory. It is hunger. Updike seems  sated. He was moved to write, he tells us, after hearing that a would-be  biographer was on his trail seeking "to take my life, my lode of ore, my heap  of memories from me." "Self-Consciousness" -- surely the least hungry title a  memoir ever had -- is an exercise in preemptive autobiography.  </P> <P> It will not work. Updike means too much to us to be left alone. Sooner or  later, some biographer's passion will override the memorialist's weariness.  </P> <P> A memoir seeks to rediscover what its author has lost. It has the urgency of a  quest. Updike knows what he will find; he has found it before. He writes to  confirm his sensibility, not to extend it.  </P> <P> And a memoir is a journey, with the surprises and dangers of one. Updike sits  and unpacks. Lacking a journey to go on, the reader sits and watches him  unpack.  </P> <P> We sense inertness is evident from the start. The first of the sketches, and  one of the best, is Updike's nighttime ramble through Shillington. But he  doesn't simply go there; instead, he arrives by a decidedly mannered set of  coincidences.  </P> <P> He and his daughter were to stay with his mother 13 miles away. But his  daughter failed to tip the airline porter properly, the luggage didn't arrive,  daughter and mother wanted to come into Shillington to see a movie. Instead of  staying behind to wait for the luggage to be delivered, Updike arranges for an  airline representative to drop his suitcase in front of the movie theater. He  will wait outside. And this gives him time to walk around. . . .  </P> <P> Such indirection -- the self-consciousness of the title -- bestows an air of  lassitude even when the recollection is vivid and touching.  </P> <P> Updike recalls the feeling of well-being he used to get at the local department  store, as if God were a "manufacturer -- god," a guarantor of plenty.  </P> <P> He recalls hearing two teachers talking quietly, perhaps romantically, one  afternoon when he stayed late at school to work on a project. For the first  time, he realized that these grown-ups had purposes other than to educate him.  </P> <P> He retells the quiet turbulences of his home. Both father and mother were in  some sense disappointed people. The material lacks the strength it had in his  novel, "The Centaur." Still, looking down Philadelphia Avenue, Updike gives us  one of his radiant slow lines:  </P> <P> "I loved this plain street where for 13 years no great harm had been allowed to  befall me."  </P> <P> One of the sketches goes into detail about Updike's lifelong skin affliction.  We hear too much about it. But the piece has more energy than the others, and  it finds an equivalence between his struggle to resist his own nature --  "psoriasis was my health," -- and a writer's self-invention.  </P> <P> Similar equivalences are attempted in "Getting the Words Out." But the  connections are overrun. The author tells us in detail about his asthma and his  sense of being choked by his first marriage and four children. He goes on to  recount the stuttering that accompanied his guilt when he left them after 17  years.  </P> <P> Nine gruesome pages of dental surgery crown a ragbag chapter. It goes from his  non-dovishness during Vietnam -- he identified with the blue-collars against  the snobs -- to furtive sex with neighbors' wives, to the contrast between his  own Lutheran "heaviness" and the "airiness" of his wife's Unitarian family.  </P> <P> The book's flickering impulse grows fainter as it goes along. With "A Letter to  My Grandsons," it is extinguished entirely. It is 47 pages of Updikes and Op  Den Dyks, going back to the 16th Century; nothing but genealogy real and  surmised, and relieved only by some thoughts about how the grandchildren, whose  father is Ghanaian, will find life as half-blacks in America.  </P> <P> Updike makes it evident that he is not happy with his book. Perhaps this  unhappiness is its real subject. It is a confession of a sort, though an  incomplete one.  </P> <P> A confession is not just telling; it is also a search for an absolution -- from  God, the reader, the past or the future. Updike isn't looking for one. Perhaps,  after so much ministry and absolution-work among the characters he has created,  he can't believe in one.  </P></p>

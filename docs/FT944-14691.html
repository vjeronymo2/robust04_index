			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh cuts forecast as profit slides Leif Hoegh, the Norwegian shipowner, reported a sharp fall in nine-month pre-tax profit, to NKr136m (Dollars 20.8m) from NKr581m, and cut its forecast for 1994 net profits by NKr50m to NKr200m. It blamed the weaker result on reduced capacity and lower earnings by car carriers and liner vessels; high operating costs; lost time due to dry-docking; unrealised losses in the bond portfolio; and bigger than anticipated losses by its Cool Carriers unit. Group freight revenue rose to NKr2.14bn from NKr1.79bn, but higher voyage and charter-hire costs cut operating profit, before depreciation, to NKr248m from NKr463m.</p>

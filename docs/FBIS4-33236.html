			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo has announced  that Red Sun--Puka Inti, in Quechua--an Ecuadoran terrorist  group similar to Peru's Shining Path Maoist movement, will  surrender its weapons. This evening we will have very pleasant  news for the Ecuadoran people, Gallardo said, although he would  not provide details.    Red Sun began operating about three years ago and carried  out  dynamite attacks on public installations and on the headquarters  of political parties. None of those attacks produced casualties.    [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2105 GMT on 2 June, in a  similar 150-word, Quito-datelined report, adds: "Gallardo  reported that the subversive Ecuadoran group will surrender its  weapons to military authorities within the next few hours and  that its members will join the legal democratic process."]</p>

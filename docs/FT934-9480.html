			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Greek building group seeks to raise Dr5.9bn AKTOR, Greece's largest construction company, plans to raise Dr5.9bn (Dollars 24.5m) in fresh equity through a flotation on the Athens stock exchange. The company is to increase its capital base by 25 per cent, the minimum requirement for a listing on the Greek bourse. It will issue 1.69m new shares. The shares, with a nominal value of Dr250 each, will be offered at Dr3,525. About half the issue is to be placed abroad by James Capel, the UK securities house. The listing is being underwritten by Midland Bank and Societe Generale, with two private Greek banks, Credit Bank and Piraeus Bank. Aktor is controlled by the Bobolas family, which also owns an Athens daily newspaper and holds a stake in Megachannel, Greece's biggest private television station. The company said 60 per cent of funds raised through the listing would be used for working capital, while the remainder would cover purchases of new machinery. Aktor is one of a dozen local construction companies competing for large public works contracts in Greece, estimated to be worth Dr1,200bn over the next five years. More than 70 per cent of funding for the projects will come from the European Community under the Delors II aid package for infrastructure improvements in poorer member countries. The rest, meanwhile, will be provided from the Greek state investment budget. Aktor is participating in several big projects being co-financed by the EC, including construction of a 500km pipeline to carry Russian natural gas from the Bulgarian border to Athens. The company forecasts pre-tax profits for 1993 of Dr2.4bn, up from Dr1.01bn last year. Turnover is expected to reach Dr10bn, compared with Dr5.1bn last year. Three other Greek construction companies are being floated on the Athens stock exchange. Last week, shares in Aegek, seeking to raise Dr1.6bn, were oversubscribed more than 100 times. Greece's construction sector is dominated by private family-controlled companies, which finance most of their operations from private funds to avoid high interest rates, now at around 24 per cent for working capital. However, the need to ensure a steady cash flow and invest in new equipment in order to win EC-financed projects is expected to encourage other construction companies to join the stock market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- The hunger strike staged by  representatives of the villages over flooded by the lake of the  Fierza Hydro-Power Station entered in its sixth day. The health  state of the strikers is getting worse. According to Doctor  Azem Brasha, many of the strikers are suffering from bronchitis  and two of them have been hospitalized. The unsuitable hall in  which the strikers are placed has its own effect on the  worsening of their health.    Meanwhile, in front of the building of the district council,  where the strike is being staged, crowds of people gather time  and again in support of the strikers. The chairman of the  commission of the strike, Jahir Trota, told ATA that the  strikers are determined to welcome Premier Meksi in Kukes and  are delighted that the president and the government consider  their demands as right.    In the meantime, the political forces and local government  keep constant contacts with the strikers in order to find a way  out to stop the strike and start dialogue regarding their  demands. The strikers refuse to evacuate the building of the  district council, an unlawful act, and continue the strike in  another place because they are afraid the state bodies will  continue to be indifferent towards them.</p>

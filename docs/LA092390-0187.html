			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE STATE OF THE EARTH ATLAS EDITED BY JONI SEAGER  (TOUCHSTONE: $13.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> This atlas of environmental problems is more interesting for the way the  authors slant the information toward the "Green" point of view than for the  data it offers. Despite the blurb on the cover about being up to date, some of  the information is no longer valid: Love Canal is described as "uninhabitable,"  although homes there were recently approved for sale.  </P> <P> Some of the authors' assertions would be difficult to defend in a serious  debate: "The deterioration of the global environment has less to do with  population growth than with industrial economies and priorities."  </P> <P> Editor Joni Seager and the various contributors often seem so eager to score  ideological points that they blithely present untenable propaganda as fact. The  destruction of endangered species is described as a "male activity" because  most hunters are men and "it is men who purchase the animals and their  by-products." Which gender wears more fur coats, exotic leather, ivory jewelry  and feathers?  </P> <P> The rhetorical overkill in "The State of the Earth Atlas" may ultimately harm  the Green cause by fueling the anti-conservationist contention that  environmental activists exaggerate the gravity of the ecological crisis.  </P> <P> THE WALNUT KING &amp; OTHER STORIES By John Mort (Woods Colt Press: $8)  </P> <P> </P></p>

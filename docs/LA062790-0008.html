			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: MICHAEL HAGUE CREATES A PICTURE-PERFECT WORLD FOR CHILDREN;  </P> <P> ART: THE STORYBOOK ILLUSTRATOR'S WATERCOLOR UNIVERSES ARE IN DEMAND BY GROWN-UP  COLLECTORS. HIS PAINTINGS ARE BEING SHOWCASED IN HOLLYWOOD.  </P> <P> A grinning triceratops lumbers down a flagstone path, guided by a pajama-clad  teddy bear; goggle-eyed "zizzy" bugs flit on zigzag legs; under a midnight-blue  sky, fragile-winged fairies in 18th-Century dress watch over a unicorn world.  </P> <P> Michael Hague, one of America's foremost children's book illustrators, creates  watercolor universes that appeal not only to readers of all ages, but to adult  collectors looking for investments in a blossoming children's art market.  </P> <P> Blending fantasy and realism, he illustrates original works and offers  eye-catching new takes on children's classics from "Peter Pan" to "The Wizard  of Oz."  </P> <P> A sampling of Hague's paintings, soft and vivid watercolors finely detailed  with pen and ink strokes, is being showcased at the Every Picture Tells A Story  gallery in Hollywood through July 11.  </P> <P> Hague, 41, a compact man with shoulder-length, graying brown hair and intense  blue eyes, was on hand for the opening of the exhibit.  </P> <P> "I don't ever remember wanting to be anything but an artist or a baseball  player," he said. "I was just better at drawing than I was at baseball."  </P> <P> As a child, Hague's favorite artists were turn-of-the-century children's book  illustrators: W. Heath Robinson, N.C. Wyeth and Arthur Rackham, among others.  Disney was also "a great influence," as were "Prince Valiant" comic strips.  </P> <P> But creating a new look for characters made famous in the drawings of Tenneil  or in Disney cartoons is a challenge.  </P> <P> "The movie versions in particular are so familiar," Hague said. " 'The Wizard  of Oz" or 'Peter Pan' -- you can't keep that out of your consciousness, but you  try to re-read the book with a fresh mind and think (for example), 'What else  could Alice (in "Alice in Wonderland") look like?' "  </P> <P> Hague's approach seems to strike a chord with buyers. Marc Cheshire, Hague's  agent in New York, said that sales of his client's 21 titles for Henry Holt and  Company, "his main publishers," have reached 1.8 million "which for children's  books in the $16.95 to $18.95 range is extraordinary."  </P> <P> With Hague's paintings individually valued up to $4,500, there's an  "established market for Michael's work," Cheshire said, "but he doesn't want to  see tremendous jumps in his prices. He has loyal collectors and he doesn't want  to make it unaffordable for them."  </P> <P> Abbie Phillips is co-owner of Every Picture Tells a Story, which exhibits only  original children's book art. "We're still at the ground floor of what's going  to be happening in this market," she said. "It's one of the last frontiers of  collectible art forms. Within the last six months, prices have almost doubled;  the year before that they'd increased 150%."  </P> <P> Phillips sees Hague as "preeminent in reaffirming the classic tradition. So  much of what's happening in children's illustration is pushing a limit with  experimentation, techniques and levels of abstractions we've never seen  before."  </P> <P> Besides paintings and sketches, the gallery also carries several thousand books  -- "as an art form in themselves," Phillips said, "and a reflection of what's  happening on the walls."  </P> <P> A graduate of the Los Angeles Art Center College of Design, Hague worked as a  greeting card designer and in advertising until the demand for his book art  took off "seven or eight years ago." Now, he lives and works at home in  Colorado "on the side of a hill in the woods," with his wife Kathleen -- an  author with whom he often collaborates -- and their three children, ages 6 to  15.  </P> <P> Last year, Hague's career took on a new dimension. When an ABC  "thirtysomething" plot line made one of its female leads a children's book  illustrator, the show needed to provide quality work that would be seen  onscreen.  </P> <P> "The script said the paintings should be 'Michael Hague'-like, and I guess they  figured since he's still alive, why not give him a call," Hague said. He has  done six paintings and sketches so far, "in various stages -- pencil and ink  drawings and partial and finished color."  </P> <P> To help make the character believable as an artist, producers often ask Hague's  advice. "But they don't pay any attention," he said good-naturedly, pointing  out that the character's desk remains neat and "mine is so messy."  </P> <P> Publisher interest in his "thirtysomething" paintings of a comical troll and a  little knight errant may result in a book. Meanwhile, the latest classic to  receive the Hague treatment is Thorton W. Burgess's "Old Mother West Wind" and  Hague has several other projects in the works, including illustrations for a  new version of James Michener's "South Pacific."  </P></p>

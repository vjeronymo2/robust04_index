			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Management: Cut the dividend not the development - Christopher Lorenz urges companies to improve the quality of their spending on R&amp;D As Britain plunged into recession two years ago, a waggish Australian colleague quipped that 'short-termism' might turn out to be the only growth industry for the next few years. He was half-right, but he may also prove half-wrong. There are some indications that companies stinted on long-term investment in 1991 to bolster their dividends; such suspicions are always hard to prove, but the Bank of England hinted as much in its quarterly statement last week. More predictably, the dying National Economic Development Office said last month that cash which should have been spent on innovation has been diverted into dividend payments over a number of years. On the other hand, leading companies have certainly created another growth industry over the past few months: dividend cutting. Investment institutions are divided over its pros and cons, but the signs are that there is plenty more of it to come. This is not the first time that top British companies have slashed their dividends in a profits or cash squeeze. In the last recession, ICI and several others did so. But various things are different this time: First, with the recession worse and more prolonged than in 1980-81, the number of dividend-cutters looks like being far larger. Second, the ignominy associated with the practice is likely to be less. And third, the nature of the 'short-termism' debate has shifted. Last time, most critics of those companies which maintained (or increased) their payouts in the face of falling profits were worried that this was at the expense of capital investment; now the concern is over research and development. In financial theory, well expounded recently by Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School*, companies never need to face a choice between dividend and investment levels; if they are short of retained earnings for investment, they can raise outside finance. Yet this is not the way that many companies, and even some investment institutions, perceive the situation. Instead they complain about the unbalanced trade-off that tends to be made in the UK between dividends and investment. There are several reasons why more concern is being shown this time about research and development than capital investment. Firstly, Marsh's own studies have shown that few sophisticated companies take capital expenditure decisions on financial grounds alone; long-term strategic factors also weigh heavily. Research and development - or R&amp;D, as the two activities are often misleadingly bracketed - is quite another matter. There have been few academic studies of how 'R' and 'D' decisions are made. My general impression is that they are still too often treated as dispensable items of annual expenditure, to be trimmed or slashed the moment profits slide. Another reason for the emergence of R and D as such an issue has been the belated realisation that human knowledge nowadays often adds greater competitive value and advantage than do mere machines and mortar. The government-backed Innovation Advisory Board has banged the 'R&amp;D' drum especially noisily. Its most useful act has been to initiate the compilation of an annual 'UK R&amp;D Scoreboard' for over 300 companies, complete with (mostly damning) international comparisons. This year's list, published in June, contained for the first time each company's dividend payout - revealing some fascinating cases where R&amp;D expenditure and dividend outlays were almost identical. Needless to say, the total value of dividends grew rather faster in 1991-92 than did that of R&amp;D. The third reason for the new focus on 'R&amp;D' has been this summer's attempts by the Institutional Shareholders Committee and the Accounting Standards Board to persuade companies to disclose more information to the stock market. The ISC's proposals are especially sensible. First, they propose that disclosed expenditure should be divided clearly between pure research, applied research, and product or process development. This overdue splitting of 'R' from 'D' would, as the ISC says, be helpful since each's time horizons, risks and potential returns differ. Moreover, it is in development rather than research, that UK industry needs to put much more effort. Second, the ISC's 'development' category would be much wider than the current official accounting standard for R&amp;D, and would include all development of existing products and processes, no matter how minor. The all-important question of expenditure definitions has yet to be resolved. But if companies want stock market support, they should applaud the ISC's initiative, and not - as some have done - turn coy about making further disclosures. Rather than merely complaining about continued pressure for unrealistic dividends, they should put their own house in order. The best way to do that is not to cut R, and certainly not D, but to increase the productivity of both. This is neither a short nor an easy task, but many Japanese and a few US companies have shown it can be done. * FT August 12.

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Impeachment judge quits MR Justice V. Ramaswamy of the Indian Supreme Court, who survived a politically charged attempt to impeach him on corruption charges, announced yesterday he would resign, Reuter reports from New Delhi. 'The defeat of the impeachment motion against me in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) has vindicated my stand,' Mr Ramaswamy said. It had also 'safeguarded for the future fearless and independent judges from scurrilous attacks and calumny from motivated persons'. Charges had been brought against him by a fellow Sup-reme Court judge, a state chief justice and an eminent jurist.</p>

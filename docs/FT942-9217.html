			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise renews onslaught on Lasmo Enterprise Oil yesterday sought to step up the tempo of its hostile Pounds 1.5bn bid for rival explorer Lasmo by casting doubt on the credibility of the target's management. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and chief executive, called on Lasmo shareholders to ask whether the group would ever pay 'a meaningful dividend'. He quoted management statements since 1991 committing the group to at least a stable dividend when, in fact, the pay-out has fallen from 8.5p to 1.3p. Mr Hearne also urged shareholders to question Lasmo's financial position, and sought to imply gearing could reach unacceptable levels as a result of the Pounds 800m investment programme. Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo's chairman, rejected Mr Hearne's claims - in particular, the references to gearing. 'Enterprise takes no account of Lasmo's operating cashflow over the next three years,' Mr Agnew said. Mr Hearne's letter also said Lasmo's defence document misled shareholders. He denied the company's claim that the offer's unusual equity structure would make second class citizens of shareholders and, in effect, force them to inject cash into the enlarged group. Enterprise is offering 27 A shares, with limited dividend rights, and 12 warrants exercisable at 470p for every 80 Lasmo shares. 'The two elements of the package are separately tradeable and shareholders will not need to subscribe cash to realise the warrants' value,' he said.</p>

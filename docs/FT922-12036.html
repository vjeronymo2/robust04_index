			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Abortion issue again before Supreme Court: Controversy is heightened in election year THE US Supreme Court today once again turns its attention to the controversial question of abortion. Whatever it determines when it hands down a judgment in two or three months' time will certainly have an impact on a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. It may even affect the outcome of this year's presidential election. The court is to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a 1989 law passed in Pennsylvania, a strongly Catholic state. This places several restrictions on the right to abortion, including waiting periods and obligations on doctors to advise of alternatives, on minors to obtain the consent of at least one parent or a judge and, in most cases, on women to notify their husbands in advance. The Bush administration has already filed briefs with the court in support of the law. It is opposed by the pro-choice movement, which fears that the right to an abortion, laid down in the landmark Roe vs Wade ruling of 1973, is in the process of being legally whittled into extinction. Roe vs Wade established the 'fundamental' constitutional right. It also stipulated that any restrictions on abortion imposed by the states would be subject to 'strict scrutiny'. Subsequent legal challenges have been designed to test this framework, rather than the principle, and this appears to be the case with the Pennsylvania law, though President George Bush is on record as wanting Roe vs Wade overturned. The composition of the nine-member court has changed greatly since 1973, when Roe vs Wade was passed by seven to two. Of the current justices, only Harry Blackmun, a Nixon appointee and author of the judgment, and John Paul Stevens, elevated under President Gerald Ford, have consistently come out in favour of the basic right to an abortion. The other seven, all but one Republican appointees, are presumed to favour restrictions, if not necessarily outright repeal of the law. Mr Bush has made a pro-life commitment a requirement of any judicial nomination he makes. His administration has also withdrawn US funding for several international family planning programmes. The record of the court in recent years has been not to make sweeping law but to claw back through narrow interpretations some of the more interventionist legal edicts handed down in its great liberal activist years, which began with its school desegregation order of 1954 and lasted through the mid-1970s. In general, the court has preferred to cede authority to the states, as it did in several rulings on Monday. Most experts, therefore, expect the court to uphold the Pennsylvania law, but not to bite the bullet of repealing Roe vs Wade outright. This would eventually lead the court to considering several other cases involving state restrictions on abortion now working their way through the lower courts. If it took the course of throwing out Roe vs Wade, probably at least a dozen states would pass laws banning abortion outright. Congress would then almost certainly get into the fray by seeking to pass a law negating the repeal, thus inviting a presidential veto and provoking a constitutional crisis. Either way, the issue will be elevated into even greater public consciousness, if that is possible. Washington this month saw a great march, of as many as 1m people, in favour of a woman's right to choose; yesterday, Buffalo, New York, was braced for possible violence as the pro-life movement began picketing an abortion clinic in the city. Though abortion has long been a question provoking passion on both sides, it has not been a big determinant in presidential elections. However, this year an uncertain electorate looking around for reasons to vote one way or the other may consider it more important than in the past. The political divisions are clear. All those who have competed for the Democratic party's presidential nomination believe in choice, as does Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is expected to run as an independent. The Democratic party will go into the election campaign with this commitment in its platform. The provisional Republican party platform, echoing that of 1988 and, now as then, mostly drafted by the right wing, calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortion, which is probably rather further than some of Mr Bush's more cautious political advisers would like to go. A floor fight at the party's nominating convention in August might harm the president. Both sides claim polling evidence that a majority of the country supports, or opposes, abortion, but there has been little real evidence of voter preference either way in this year's primary elections. However, several prominent Republicans, such as Robert Taft, the former senator from Ohio, and Ann Stone, of the Republicans for Choice organisation, have warned of the electoral dangers of seeking to ban what many Americans now consider to be acceptable, if not desirable. Ms Stone is particularly concerned about the defection of women voters to the Democrats. In this respect no justice will be under greater scrutiny in the Pennsylvania judgment than Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation to the court last year was surrounded by charges of sexual harassment and indisputably unpopular with women of left and right. His vote in court could indeed affect the way the country votes later.</p>

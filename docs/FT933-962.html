			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Consumer spending in France declines FRENCH CONSUMER spending fell sharply last month, undermining hopes of a rebound in household demand, according to statistics released yesterday by INSEE, the national statistics office, writes John Ridding in Paris. The INSEE figures, which showed a 2.8 per cent fall in household spending on consumer goods in August, were compounded by a survey of business leaders. The survey, also by INSEE, showed that despite expectations of a slight rise in industrial output in September, consumer demand was expected to remain depressed. French government officials and private sector economists believe a revival in demand, particularly in consumer spending, is the most important condition for a recovery in the economy, forecast to contract by almost one per cent this year in terms of GDP. Consumer spending recovered slightly in the second quarter, rising by 0.4 per cent. But the impact of higher taxes on income, petrol and alcohol which took effect in July, appears to have prompted renewed weakness in expenditure last month. The fall in consumption in August included a fall of 7.8 per cent in durable goods. New car sales fell by 15.3 per cent in August, compared with July.</p>

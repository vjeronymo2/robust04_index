			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSPAPERS AND YOUNG READERS  </P> <P> Unfortunately, newspapers are a victim of our "fast-food" society. People lead  their lives through 12-minute attention spans; I like to call it McLife. We eat  McFood (dishes ready in under 10 minutes), watch McTV (sitcoms, tabloids, and  soaps), and receive our McNews through USA Today and 15-second sound bites.  </P> <P> We look for quick solutions and all too often believe the best packaged to be  the best. I chalk it up as a legacy of the Reagan years. I just hope, for all  our sakes, that the nation outgrows it -- quickly.  </P> <P> ARUN BAHETI  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

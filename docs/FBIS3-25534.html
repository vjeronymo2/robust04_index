			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Tanzania Government has refuted press reports  that 61 soldiers out of its contingent of about 800 soldiers who  are in Liberia for a peace-keeping force mission have died. The  minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation, the  Honorable Joseph Rwegasira, who was in Liberia for a three-day  visit, told journalists in Dar es Salaam that the reports which  were carried in some private local media were baseless. He said  contrary to the reports, he found all the soldiers healthy and  in high spirits, apart from only one soldier who is hospitalized  following a leg injury in a football match. He said Tanzania's  move of sending its soldiers to Liberia was a move of  implementing the Cotonou Accord brokered by Economic Community  of West Africa States, ECOWAS, OAU and the United Nations that  called for, among other things, an expanded peacekeeping force  to include peacekeepers from Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.</p>

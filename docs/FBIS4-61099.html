			<p>BFN     [Text] Leonid Kravchuk has issued an instruction  introducing changes and amendments to the directive on measures  to reduce cash circulation. Under the directive, with the aim  of normalizing monetary circulation and reducing the rate of  monetary emission growth on the territory of Ukraine, all mutual  one-off payments for goods, work, services and securities to the  value of more than six minimum wages that are effected by  corporate bodies, regardless of their forms of ownership and  kinds of activity, and by Ukrainian citizens, foreign citizens,  and those without citizenship who carry out entrepreneurial  activity, are to be solely non-cash. Commercial banks are to  provide cash only on condition that there are appropriate  grounds, and are to control its use in order to ensure that it  is used for the declared purpose.</p>

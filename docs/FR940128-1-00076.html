			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA also invites comment on the effect of using a modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach on the regulation of imports, especially with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the types of products described in item (5) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Exempting Small Firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA invites comment on whether small firms should be exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the proposed regulation. Even if exempted, these firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would still be subject to the requirements of current food safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law and to inspection by FDA and State authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated earlier in this preamble, small operations are the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> norm in the seafood industry. A significant majority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors have total revenues of under 1 million dollars. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small firms are to be exempted, FDA invites comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria that should be used for exempting them, including how a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small firm should be defined for purposes of an exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of HACCP may be more burdensome for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms than for large firms. Large firms tend to have quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control personnel already in place. In addition, many regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are less burdensome for a large firm in proportion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to output than they are for a small firm. On the other hand, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is taking steps, such as the preparation of its HACCP guidance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to minimize the cost of these regulations for small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, such an exemption may not be needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also points out that, because many large firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already have quality control systems, an exemption for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business would appear to result in requiring HACCP for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> segment of the industry (i.e., large firms) that needs it the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least. Large processors, moreover, tend to process relatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low risk products, such as breaded fish and shrimp and raw fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blocks. Many high-risk processors, such as processors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooked, ready-to-eat products, tend to be small, and processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of raw molluscan shellfish tend to be very small.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonetheless, an exemption for small business could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to those small businesses that produce low risk products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and FDA invites comment on this approach. As stated earlier,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, the criteria for determining low as well as high risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not clear, due largely to the limitations of the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foodborne illness reporting system. Moreover, a case can be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that risk also relates to the margin for error in a processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation and to the consequences of failure as well as to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual occurrence of illness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With these points in mind, FDA invites comment on how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define ``low risk.'' FDA also invites comment on what the nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the exemption should be. Should a firm be exempt from all or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the HACCP requirements? As circumstances change, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP-based analysis of risk by a firm might reveal that the firm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has become a high risk processor rather than a low risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor. In addition, FDA invites comment on whether such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption should be obtained by petitioning the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, even if an exemption were to be adopted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule based on the comments received, the agency would still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage voluntary adoption of HACCP systems by exempted firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The advantages that HACCP is expected to provide in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer confidence, control of process, and access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international markets warrant adoption of this system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jackie Horne in London] </F>   [Text] The Chinese government, in a move likely to stun the  Asian banking community, is believed to have drawn up a third  list of about 50 state enterprises that it wants to seek  listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.    Speculation concerning such a list, which according to a  high-ranking, Shanghai-based official will be made public in  full at the end of the year, may heighten frequently expressed  concerns about the level of fund-raising by Chinese companies  over the next 12 months.    The current batch of 22 Chinese enterprises is in the  process  of listing offshore are hoping to raise about HK$8 billion, in  the face of an increasingly bearish international investment  community.    Such an ambitious number of companies slated for  international flotation will also call into question the Chinese  government's ongoing efforts to develop its domestic stock  markets to their full potential.    Although plans have been announced to double the number of  listed B shares by the end of the year, expanding market  capitalisation by a further U.S.$2 billion (HK$15.6 billion)  with a string of mainly infrastructure-related listings,  international investors will have even less reason to shift  their focus from the rapidly expanding H share market,  especially while there remains no securities law in China.    The continual flow of new listings (nearly 2.5 billion new  shares have come on to the Shanghai bourse during the first half  of this year) has also been said to be one of the main causes  behind the collapse of confidence at both the Shenzhen and  Shanghai exchanges.    The fallout reached a new low point on Monday, when the  Shanghai A share market fell below 500 points for the first time  in more than a year and the foreign investor-driven B share  market dropped to 71.13 points.    In Hong Kong, on the other hand a Peregrine-led offering of  186 million shares for China Pharmaceutical was an encouraging  three times oversubscribed by the time it closed this week.    Investment bankers said that the varying fortunes of  China-related companies trading in Hong Kong reflected  increasingly sophisticated investor appraisals of individual  companies.    Shares in Dongfang Electric, the last of the original nine  companies to be listed outside China, have traded up to a 12 per  cent premium over the listing price last week. Its less well  received predecessor, Tianjin Bohai, continued to languish at a  discount.    Bankers are also wary about the impending flotation of the  first company from the new batch of 22 intended overseas  listings, Luoyang Glass, which is due for launch next week.    "Sentiment is not that great," banker said.    "At the US roadshows, investors asked quite searching  questions and didn't get very consistent answers," he said.    Luoyang is being pitched at a price-to-earnings ratio of 13  but many believe that it will come to the market at a softened  level of 10 or 11.    With between $912.5 million and $1.2 billion being raised in  total, about 25 to 30 per cent would be raised in Hong Kong.  The international issue will be in the form of American  Depository Receipts listed on the Nasdaq system.</p>

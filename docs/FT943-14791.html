			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Mandarins angered by ministerial numbers Whitehall's mandarins are up in arms. They have too many ministerial masters. On the eve of a white paper foreshadowing more cuts in civil-servant numbers, the mandarins are complaining that ministers have exempted themselves from the Conservative drive to reduce the size of the state. A handful of optimists in Whitehall are suggesting that Mr John Major, the prime minister, might use the forthcoming reshuffle to practise what the government preaches and cut the number of jobs for the boys - and girls. Realists predict the prime minister will be more concerned to maintain the fragile peace on the Tory back benches, so patronage will again come before principle. The Treasury estimates that privatisation and contracting out has cut the size of the government by about a quarter since the start of the Thatcher revolution in 1979. Civil-service numbers have fallen 24 per cent from 732,000 to 554,000. Today's white paper will forecast another fall to below 500,000. But ministers have made sure that they are insulated from the chill winds of competition. Comparison of the official lists shows that there were 81 ministers and 21 paid government whips in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first administration. Now there are 87 ministers and the same number of whips. If these well-heeled ministers had suffered the same squeeze as their mandarins, the number chauffeured to and from their plush offices at taxpayer's expense would have fallen to a mere 62. The cost is not borne only by the taxpayer. Superfluous ministers add to the workload of their civil servants. Each demands a private office of high-flying officials. Many more are deployed in keeping them out of mischief or finding them something to do. A random survey of top officials yesterday revealed that the problem is spread right across the government. For all his managerial expertise Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, apparently needs six ministers to help him spend one of the smallest budgets in Whitehall. At the Treasury Sir Terence Burns, the permanent secretary, has slashed the number of top officials. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has four ministerial helpers. The Department of Transport has separate ministers for roads and for public transport in spite of its promise of an integrated transport policy. At Environment Mr John Gummer has five middle-ranking and junior ministers to help him contemplate the future of the planet. Nor can these myriad parliamentary under-secretaries, ministers of state, solicitors-general and economic secretaries claim their Westminster workloads have increased. Responses to MPs questions more often than not consist of referrals to the relevant agency or privatised business.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment noted that the list of agencies or administrations which receive and act upon incident reports contained in this section should not include areas of the world not traveled such as Asia and Europe for U.S. coastwise vessels. They believe that only rescue coordination centers should be listed. The Coast Guard requires that ship owners or operators whose vessels operate exclusively within U.S. coastal waters include in the list of coastal state administrations the agencies or officials of only those coastal states reasonably expected to be affected in the case of a spill. However, the Coast Guard has not changed the requirement to provide this list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-mandatory provisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Five comments indicated that the non-mandatory provisions should remain non-mandatory and in accordance with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. However, six comments argued that the non-mandatory provisions should become mandatory and not be left to the discretion of the owner or operator. Additionally, one comment noted that plan exercising should be the only element of these provisions that should be mandatory. One comment contended that the non-mandatory provisions of Regulation 26 should be completely withdrawn from the final rule. One comment advised the Coast Guard to change certain terminology to make section 151.26(b) ``advisory'' instead of mandatory. The Coast Guard has determined to keep the non-mandatory provisions voluntary. To better clarify this point the word ``should'' in &sect;151.26(b)(7) has been replaced by the word ``may''. The Coast Guard encourages ship owners or operators to include non-mandatory provisions in their plans. This information is only intended to assist in an emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment, in favor of making these provisions mandatory, made several specific recommendations as to what each section should describe and include. One other comment recommended that it be made clear that a point of contact must be established on board to coordinate response activities. Also, according to this comment, the onboard coordinator should have the authority to commit to the hiring of resources in a timely manner. As previously stated, the Coast Guard has added designation of an Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) and an Individual Qualified to Respond to the list of non-mandatory provisions. Additional information can be included in plans submitted if desired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Plan Submission and Approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eight comments discussed the time-frame for submission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans for initial review, reapproval, or for corrections to deficiencies in the plan. Five of those comments questioned whether 60 days is adequate time for the Coast Guard to review the plans. Three comments discussed expanding the time limit. Their suggestions included expanding the deadline from 60 days to 6 months, 120 days, and 60 days prior to April 4, 1995. Two comments urged the Coast Guard to make provisions to allow vessels that have submitted plans by the required 60 days prior to April 4, 1995, but who have not received Coast Guard approval by April 4, 1995, to continue operating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard has modified the time-frame for submission of shipboard oil pollution emergency plans in response to these comments. The rule has been revised so there will be adequate time for the plans to be reviewed. Plans must be submitted for new ships 90 days before the ship intends to begin operations. Existing ships are required to submit plans no later than January 4, 1995 (90 days prior to April 4, 1995). The Coast Guard will make determinations on all submitted shipboard oil pollution emergency plans meeting this deadline. Because the April 4, 1995 deadline is fixed, the Coast Guard encourages ship owners or operators to submit their plans as soon as possible, in case subsequent revisions are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard recognizes that there is a possibility that a plan received by January 4, 1995, may not receive Coast Guard approval by April 4, 1995. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to develop a policy of conditional acceptance, whereby plans having a completed review by April 4, 1995, would be subject to a preliminary review checklist. If the plan meets the criteria of the preliminary review, a letter would be sent to the shipowner or operator authorizing continued operations until the Coast Guard completes its final review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut  issued a statement on 2 April in which he expressed opposition  to the Thai Government's immediate repatriation of some 30,000  Cambodian refugees to areas under Khmer Rouge control. He said  he strongly protested the incorrect move taken by the Thai  Government. He said it constituted a real violation of human  rights. The statement was addressed to Sadako Ogata, the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.    Ogata, the Washington government, and humanitarian  organizations formally protested the repatriation to the Thai  Government but Thai leaders denied the allegation.    Cambodian refugees, mostly women and children, fled the  fighting in Pailin after government forces took over the Khmer  Rouge stronghold in the province on 19 March. The Thai  military, however, insisted that the Cambodian refugees wanted  to return to their respective areas under Khmer Rouge control.  Nobody has been allowed into the area for observation.    The Cambodian foreign minister said that he profoundly  regrets the Thai Government's inhuman act, which contradicts  efforts by human rights organizations to achieve equality and to  find a solution to human rights abuse. During his visit to  Thailand last week for talks with the Thai Government on the  problem of Cambodian refugees, the Cambodian foreign minister  adopted an entirely different attitude regarding his reproach of  the Thai Government.</p>

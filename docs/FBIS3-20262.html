			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christophe Boltanski: "Diplomacy: Paris and </F> Baghdad Plan for After Embargo"]    [Excerpts] The setting was a function room in Paris. A  number of businessmen mingled with Arab and French diplomats and  political leaders, mostly of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] or  associated groups. In total, some 50 guests attended what  looked very much like a gathering of "Gaullists," nostalgic for  "France's Arab policy," including former representatives of  companies in Iraq who have been silent since the Gulf crisis.  Now "attitudes are changing. This evening proves it,"  according to one of the organizers.    The visit to France by an Iraqi parliamentary delegation  provided the opportunity for a dinner-cum-debate. A deputy from  the Baghdad Parliament sat in the room, as did the  representative of the Iraqi interests section in Paris,  al-`Azzawi [name as transliterated]. The invitation was issued  by the Fifth Republic Christian Movement (MCVe), whose chairman  is Michel Grimard. The organization is closely associated with  Jacques Chirac's RPR.    When he invaded Kuwait in August 1990 Saddam Husayn fell  into  an American "ambush," the assembled company was told by Roselyne  Bachelot, the RPR's deputy for Maine et Loire. "It is certain  now that Baghdad received assurances from the highest diplomatic  level that the United States would not oppose their troops'  crossing the border." The deputy, who is chairwoman of the  National Assembly's France-Iraq group, developed the conspiracy  theory at some length before demanding "the opening as soon as  possible of an economic interests section in Baghdad, the  release of Iraq assets held in French banks for the purchase of  food and pharmaceuticals supplies, and a more flexible policy on  visas."    In solemn tones, Paul Depis, a former ambassador to Baghdad,  recalled the golden years of Franco-Iraqi cooperation. French  enterprises "invested 130-150 billion francs" from 1973 through  1989. Above all, he said, by advancing beyond the Euphrates,  France succeeded in encroaching on "a British reserve."    Having long been in the minority, the advocates of a new  Paris-Baghdad axis -- if not political, then at least economic  -- can now count on the support of part of the Balladur  government. Thus Daniel Garrigue, another RPR deputy, expressed  satisfaction with France's action within the UN Security  Council. For the first time since the Gulf crisis, its  representative in New York on 17 March publicly opposed the  United States and Britain over the renewal of the international  sanctions against Iraq.    As it does every two months, the United Nations had to renew  the oil and military embargo and the measures to freeze Iraqi  assets abroad. This time Paris, backed by China and Russia,  urged that recognition be given for the "progress made by  Baghdad." The destruction of its chemical, nuclear, and  biological weapons is being completed. The long-term monitoring  of Iraq's arsenal of death is being established. According to  French diplomats, these "efforts" deserve to be encouraged.    The United Nations is giving itself six months in which to  establish an adequate surveillance system. France is pleading  for the lifting of the oil embargo as soon as this trial period  is over. It accuses its former allies of trying to impose on  Iraq conditions not envisaged by the UN documents. The English  [as published] and British consider this too short a time and  are refusing to grant Baghdad a blank check. They maintain that  Saddam Husayn is simply trying to allay suspicion. He has not  recognized the new line of the Iraqi-Kuwait border and is still  violating human rights. [passage omitted]    Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, welcomes  France's new stance. The Balladur government "can persuade the  other sides, including the United States and Britain, to lift  the embargo," he told us Friday [25 March]. Western diplomats  do not fear a French defection, but do consider the policy a  dangerous one, "because it threatens to mislead the Iraqis into  believing that the Western camp has weakened." Already on the  eve of the UN vote, Saddam Husayn adopted a louder tone and  massed troops near Iraqi Kurdistan, in the belief that he could  thus bring pressure to bear on the Security Council.</p>

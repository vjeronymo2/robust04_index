			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix A_Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public notice of the draft permit reissuance was published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 59 FR 47862 (September 19, 1994). Additionally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit was publicly noticed in five (5) major cities in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State of Florida on September 16, 1994, (Public Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Number 94FL0167), to allow comments from interested parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would be considered in the formulation of a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision regarding reissuance of the proposed draft NPDES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Permit No. FLG830000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following parties responded with written comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reissuance of the proposed NPDES general permit: Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Chevron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research &amp; Technology Company, Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius, Mobil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oil Corporation, Exxon Company, Walt Disney World Company,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Florida Chemical Industry Council and the United States Fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Wildlife Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 1: The Florida Department of Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection (FDEP), Bureau of Waste Cleanup, submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments by letter dated October 3, 1994, which commented on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part I.A.3 of the general permit. The FDEP wanted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification concerning the intent of Part I.A.3. FDEP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the statement on Page two (2) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction states that `` Except for facilities meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions of Part I.3, written notice of intent to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the reissued NPDES general permit shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to the Permit Issuing Authority prior to initiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of discharge to waters of the United States,'' implies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this includes subparts of Part I.3., including I.3.(a), (b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (c). FDEP stated that this implies that for discharges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are either uncontaminated or are contaminated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum only and are treated, notification to EPA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required. It was stated that this is not consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the phrase under I.3(a) which states ``upon receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written EPA notification of coverage that the Notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intent (NOI) request is complete, these short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharges may commence.'' The State mentioned that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implies that not only must prior notification be given by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA for the short-term discharges from sites contaminated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum only, but that the person responsible for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge must wait for a reply from EPA, and this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistency should be reconciled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: EPA agrees that the referenced statement on page  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 of the introduction is incorrect. It has been corrected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to read, ``except for facilities meeting the conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part I.A.3(c), written NOI to be covered by the reissued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit shall be provided to the Permit Issuing Authority.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 2: FDEP stated that it is not reasonable to wait  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a response from EPA in order to initiate a short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge for the following reasons: (1) Chapter 62&hyph;770,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) be submitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FDEP within 2 months of approval of a Contamination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment Report (CAR), and that it is routine to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pump tests to design information for the RAP, plus identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquifer characteristics. FDEP stated that it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable to delay the RAP by requiring prior approval from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA of these simple 8 hour pump tests. (2) Due to varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrogeological conditions in Florida, local departments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commonly perform dewatering activities in their right-of-way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of previous retail service stations, plus have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information before commencing these activities on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of petroleum contamination. FDEP stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these construction projects should not be delayed for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended period to wait on response from EPA, since mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment units can be deployed and designed to meet EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge limitations in the NPDES general permit. (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During dewatering for construction and replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underground storage tanks, FDEP mentioned that it was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable for the tank installation to be delayed for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended period of time; especially since discharges from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these operations only last for a few hours at a time and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile equipment used is very reliable in achieving EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

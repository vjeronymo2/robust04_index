			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Arkadiy Sidoruk] </F>   [Text] Washington, 19 Mar -- A document was signed in the  U.S. capital on 18 March that defines the mechanism for  monitoring deals involving supplies to the United States of  Russian Uranium, and its sale on U.S. and world markets, an  ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from Russian diplomatic  sources.    The "Protocol on Transparency" concluded by the Russian  Federation Atomic Energy Ministry and the U.S. Department of  Energy outlines practical ways to implement the earlier signed  bilateral agreement between Russia and the United States on  highly-enriched Russian Uranium extracted from dismantled  nuclear warheads. It will be degraded and delivered to the  United States in the form of lowly-enriched Uranium to be sold  to U.S. and other consumers.    A senior Russian diplomat said in a conversation with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent that the U.S. Government now has  guarantees that the lowly-enriched Uranium coming from Russia  has originally been extracted from nuclear warheads. The U.S.  side is providing the Russian side with guarantees that the  Russian lowly-enriched Uranium will be used exclusively for  peaceful ends, not only in the United States, but also in cases  of its re-export to other countries.</p>

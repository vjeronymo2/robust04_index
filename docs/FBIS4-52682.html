			<p>BFN     [Text] The government plans to ease foreign exchange  regulations next month to liberalize current-account  transactions to the level of advanced nations and capital  movements to a lesser extent.    Restricted current-account transactions will be reduced from  the current 109 categories of 61, the Ministry of Finance said  yesterday.    The planned reduction of categories on the "negative list,"  from the current 109 to 61, will enhance the liberalization of  current-account transactions to the level of members of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a  grouping of advanced nations, the ministry said.    Of the 34 categories of current-account transactions  requiring approval from the Bank of Korea, the ministry said,  the central bank will entrust commercial banks with the  authority to validate 25 categories.    The central bank will continue to retain the authority to  approve nine categories of current-account transactions for fear  that they may be exploited as channels of illegal foreign  exchange out-flow, the ministry said.    Categories of current-account transactions requiring the  approval of the Bank of Korea is rarely, if ever, permitted by  the central bank, said an official from the ministry.    They include payments for overseas travel in excess of  $5,000  and remittances in excess of $5,000 as gifts, the ministry said.    Categories that will remain on the negative list include  current-account transactions relating to gambling and drug  trafficking, the ministry said.    The liberalization of capital movements, which will add 15  new categories of capital movements to the "positive list" of  103 categories of capital movements that can be conducted  without the approval of the Bank of Korea, will ease  restrictions on borrowing money abroad, the ministry said.    Domestic businesses will be allowed to borrow money abroad  to  finance their overseas advertisements, the ministry said.    Last year, domestic businesses spent $200 million in  overseas  advertisements, all of which was brought from their headquarters  in the nation because of the regulations on capital movements,  the ministry said.    The government will also permit domestic businesses to  borrow  money abroad to explore oil and other resources in foreign  countries, the ministry said.    To borrow money abroad for such overseas projects, it said,  domestic businesses are required to have those projects  validated by their designated domestic banks.    Overseas branches and locally incorporated subsidiaries of  domestic corporations will be allowed to borrow money abroad to  make commissions or advance payments for their trades in  overseas futures markets, the ministry said.    But the government will strengthen its supervision on  overseas financing to prevent funds raised abroad from being  brought into the nation, the ministry said.    Among the new 15 categories of capital movements that will  no  longer require approval from the central bank are debt-payment  guarantees by domestic exporters to foreign importers seeking to  borrow money from domestic banks, and loans provided in Korean  won by a resident to a resident and payable in foreign  currencies.    The central bank will entrust commercial banks with the  authority to approve 13 of the 26 categories of capital  movements that currently require approval from the central bank,  the ministry said.    They include transactions conducted between residents and  involving the movement of $100,000 or less, including the trade  of bonds payable in foreign currencies, the ministry said.    The government will ease restrictions on the settlement of  exports and imports, the ministry said.    Domestic exporters will be allowed to receive advance  payments for their exports beyond the set limits on condition  that excess advance payments are deposited with overseas  branches of domestic foreign exchange banks, the ministry said.    Currently, the government restricts such advance payments to  10 percent of the value of exports in the previous year for  small- and medium-sized companies and 3 percent for large  corporations.    The government is restricting advance payments on the  grounds  that they are no different from bank loans from abroad, the  ministry said.    In view of growing bilateral trade and exchanges between  Korea and China, the ministry said, the Korean government will  add the Chinese currency to the list of "designated foreign  currencies" for freer conversion into and from the Korean  currency.    The government will no longer distinguish 589 Class A  foreign  exchange banks, permitted to engage in all types of foreign  exchange business, from 2,009 Class B foreign exchange banks  which are restricted to domestic foreign exchange business, the  ministry said.    Banks will be allowed to choose foreign exchange business  areas for their branches on their own discretion, the ministry  said.    The government will allow resident individuals to buy  foreign  currencies within the limit of their foreign currency sales  during the previous three months, the ministry said.    But the daily limit to foreign currency purchases by the  same  person will be $50,000, the ministry said, adding that  individuals will be allowed to hold an unlimited amount of  foreign currencies on condition that they report foreign  currency holdings in excess of $450,000 to their foreign  exchange bank.</p>

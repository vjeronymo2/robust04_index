			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs put Atkins in red Exceptional costs left Atkins Group, the Leicestershire-based textile company, in the red for the six months to October 2. On turnover 15 per cent up at Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 7.69m) pre-tax losses were Pounds 96,000 (Pounds 16,000 profits). Losses per share were 2.1p (0.33p earnings) but the interim dividend is raised to 3.85p (3.6p). The sales improvement noted at the annual meeting continued and operating profits advanced 33 per cent to Pounds 138,000 (Pounds 104,000). However the Pounds 281,000 cost of ending fabric dyeing, which was less than estimated, less Pounds 113,000 surplus on sale of plant resulted in an exceptional charge of Pounds 168,000, against profits last time of Pounds 48,000.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by reporter Raul Rene Trujillo from </F> Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, including interjections by  announcer Javier Zabludovsky in XEW studios in Mexico City; from  the "24 Hours" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Announcer Zabludovsky] Hello, Raul Rene.    [Trujillo] Good evening. This is to report that a few  minutes ago President Carlos Salinas de Gortari left Cartagena  to return to Mexico.    [Zabludovsky] At what time did he leave?    [Trujillo] He departed at 2040, sir, from the presidential  hangar. We asked him two questions. He said that Latin  American integration is truly progressing. He termed his visit  to Colombia and Cuba as very fruitful, an example of which he  said was the free trade agreement signed by Mexico, Venezuela,  and Colombia. That is the report, sir.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As we have already reported, Yevgeniy Saburov,  former Russian minister of the economy, has been offered the  post of prime minister of the Crimean Government. At the  moment, Saburov is a director of the Center for Information and  Social Technology under the Russian Government, and intends to  remain in this post. Our correspondent Irina Akhiyeva got in  touch with Saburov on the telephone and asked him to say to whom  -- the Ukraine or Russia -- will Crimea chiefly direct its  economic policy?    [Begin recording] [Saburov] Crimea will direct it in such a  way as will be best for the Crimean population from an economic  standpoint.    There is no question of a secession or a withdrawal from  Ukraine. It is a question of using Crimea's economic potential  to the utmost and to improve the well-being of the people living  there. Naturally, all these actions of Crimea's will be  directed, as they always have been, toward all the republics of  the CIS -- people from the Baltics have come to us and have been  pleased, and if any other countries come to us, then that will  be even better.    [Akhiyeva] But Crimea will require a great deal of money for  this.    [Saburov] Of course. That is why it will welcome any  investments, wherever they may come from.    [Akhiyeva] You submitted your economic program to the  government. Will you try and implement this program in Crimea?    [Saburov] Crimea is not a separate country and it does not  have its own monetary system. Therefore, the opportunities to  work in this direction are extremely limited in Crimea. As far  as the Russian program -- of which I am the author -- is  concerned, it is directed toward an instant halt in inflation.  It is being examined at the moment in a pretty serious way; it  has, in my view, very great purpose. Indeed, it is my firm  conviction that there is no other way for us, and we will have  to do this in any case, and the sooner the better. This is an  unpopular belief.    [Akhiyeva] What do you mean by an instant halt in inflation?  Today, straightaway?    [Saburov] Yes.    [Akhiyeva] Let us put it this way: I am an ordinary citizen,  how will it affect me?    [Saburov] The standard of living will fall, in the first  instance. Incomes (?will rise). Then there will be no  inflation and life will be normal. It is not very pleasant, but  there is no other way to go. Otherwise, we will just have  disastrous unemployment. [end recording]</p>

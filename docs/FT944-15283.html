			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Observer: Loose Heron Memo to Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade. Best keep an eye on Michael Heron, chairman of Britain's Post Office. As an ex-Unilever marketing man he has competed with the best and has been given the job of exposing the Post Office to the winds of competition by taking it into the private sector. So what was he doing seemingly rubbishing market forces in a speech to the 25th anniversary dinner of the renamed Institute for Employment Studies? Heron concluded that there was not much difference between the market and the law of the jungle or the behaviour of baboons. It cannot solve most of the fundamental problems facing society. That sort of stuff might be music to the ears of a bunch of soft personnel managers but it is not going to impress Her Majesty's Treasury. Perhaps you need to be a bit more generous with the proposed share options for Heron and his chums.</p>

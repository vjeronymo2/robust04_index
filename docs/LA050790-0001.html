			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THE PETTER PRINCIPLE;  </P> <P> MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN FIND ANIMALS A SOURCE OF LOVE AND THERAPY  </P> <P> In a classroom at Camarillo State Hospital, an 11-year-old boy with sad, dark  eyes sat in a corner, quietly petting his friend Echo, a golden retriever.  </P> <P> "Echo takes away my sad feelings," said the boy, who is confined to a ward for  mentally ill children. "And I've learned that animals have more feelings than I  thought."  </P> <P> Teachers and psychologists at the hospital, which has about 1,200  developmentally disabled and mentally ill patients, say they are using animals  more and more in therapy.  </P> <P> Although there is no structured pet therapy program at Camarillo, the idea of  allowing patients time to cuddle animals is quickly catching on. About half a  dozen teachers and psychologists bring their pets to work every day, a practice  encouraged by hospital officials. A few other employees have adopted cats that  have wandered onto the spacious grounds.  </P> <P> "It's something they can cuddle and love," said Dee Press, a special education  teacher who owns Echo. "A lot of the kids we have here have been abused  mentally and physically. An animal is non-threatening."  </P> <P> Employees stay close by when patients are with the animals.  </P> <P> "We're very careful not to leave them alone. Some of the patients would kill  the animals," said Jerry Scheurn, coordinator of volunteer services at the  hospital.  </P> <P> But no abuse has occurred yet, he said.  </P> <P> Press, who teaches children ages 8 through 13, said she is delighted with how  her students react to her dog. She has been bringing Echo since the 7-year-old  retriever was a puppy, she said, and she is always impressed with her students'  reactions.  </P> <P> "I've had kids who don't talk very much," Press said. "But sometimes when the  kids are sad they will ask to spend a little time with Echo."  </P> <P> One time a young boy was visibly upset when he came to class but he refused to  discuss his troubles. When Press allowed the child to pet Echo, the boy started  to hug the dog and cry.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Why don't you tell Echo what's wrong?' " Press said. The boy quietly  explained that he was afraid his mother would forget to visit him at the  hospital.  </P> <P> Camarillo hospital is not alone in using animals during psychiatric treatment.  It is becoming a common practice in hospitals throughout the state, and  Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena even has a team of trained therapy  dogs.  </P> <P> Westwood therapist Janet Ruckert describes "petcology" the value of using pets  to help people overcome their anxieties -- in her book titled, "The Four-Footed  Therapist."  </P> <P> According to Ruckert, animals are natural therapists. By being warm and  sympathetic listeners, they allow a patient to express deep emotions and needs.  </P> <P> The Camarillo hospital has a petting zoo with a goat and rabbits, but the  children visit them sporadically. Therapists say patients relate better to cats  and dogs because they usually are more affectionate.  </P> <P> Connie Westphal, a special education teacher at the hospital, said her students  get upset if she doesn't bring her dog Frankie, a dachshund, to class.  </P> <P> "They want to know where he is," Westphal said. "They seemed to have bonded  with him."  </P> <P> A white and gray cat, often found under a tree outside the children's ward,  constantly receives attention.  </P> <P> "She does stuff that's neat," said a blond 11-year-old boy, scratching the cat  behind the ears. "She rolls around in the grass and she catches mice. But the  kids like her because she respects us. That's important."  </P></p>

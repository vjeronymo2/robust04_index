			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: Tradition and invention - Eating Out / Giles MacDonogh enjoys Michel Bruneau's Norman restaurant CAEN HAS its moments, but on the whole it is not an attractive place. Like much of Normandy, the city was heavily fought over in the weeks following D-Day in 1944 and Allied bombing ripped out the heart of Caen. The present centre with its uniform blocks looks rather east European, even if it lacks the Stalinist frigidity of, say, Le Havre. Pockets of old Caen remain, however; and it is in one of these pockets that Normandy's best restaurant is to be found. La Bourride is owned by Michel and Francoise Bruneau. Michel has occasionally been called the 'Paul Bocuse of Normandy' after the chef who revived Lyonnais cooking. Normandy needs its Bocuse: gastronomically speaking it has little of the cachet of Burgundy or the Rhone Valley. Most of its one star restaurants, like the Lion d'Or in Bayeux, for example, have a jaded, dowdy air. There are no Michelin three-star restaurants: La Bourride has two, and two is as good as you will get in Normandy. In one of those defamatory statements which levels itself at the eating habits of various French regions - elsewhere in Normandy there are mangeurs de choux (cabbage-eaters) and even mangeurs de corbeaux (crow-eaters) - Caen is written off as 'Caen-les-Tripes.' The famous bowl of tripe a la mode de Caen cooked with carrots, cows' feet and a dash of calvados, is not on the menu here; but that does not mean that Bruneau shuns the earthier legacy of Norman cookery. Andouilles and andouillettes (respectively dried or fresh tripe sausages) are also part of the culinary vocabulary of the region and Bruneau uses andouilles either pickled in cider or as copeaux: slices arranged round a timbale of potatoes and leeks on a cider-based beurre blanc. Bruneau is happy to use local ingredients whenever he can, from the newly launched Norman foie gras to the rather better known products of local pasture and shore-line. More exceptional perhaps, is his tolerance of cider drinking in his restaurant. Good Norman cider forms a pleasant half-way house between the sort of lip-puckering brews which win prizes in the English west country and the sugary, carbonated, semi-fermented apple-juice which passes for cider elsewhere in Britain. A farmhouse cider like that from Courtemanche we tasted at La Bourride can have a touch of sweetness to it when the fermentation has not altogether come to an end. Cider fermentation can go on for a year. A fully fermented cider like that from Desfrieches has 'breed' but its bone-dryness might put some English people off drinking it. Fresh fish is naturally popular in Normandy. There are numerous preparations in the classic cuisine which adopt the names of Norman ports such as Dieppe or Trouville; or indeed, served with a sauce of white wine and cream and labelled a la Normande. Bruneau eschews the creamy, Norman style. A turbot aux cepes relied more on the exactitude of its cooking and the full flavour of the ceps. Elsewhere on the menu, La Bourride offers both a menu entirely composed around scallops and another made up of three courses of lobster. Lentils and truffles figure on both menus. Normandy's most famous meat is the salt-meadow lamb of the Cotentin and the Avranchin. Bruneau cooks the local lamb in a Moroccan-inspired dish with dates and lemon. A better kept secret is Norman beef. Here the fillet is served with a sauce made with dark rum. The cheeseboard is a considerable test of quality in a modern restaurant when the laws of most countries require cheeses to be kept at temperatures which inhibit ripening. Bruneau had a beautifully ripe Camembert from Carrel with a good cabbagey pungency and a rather milder Pont l'Eveque from Levallier. The cheese board comes into its own from May onwards. One of the most interesting desserts chez Bruneau (if you have any appetite left by this stage) is the Symphonie autour d'une pomme, which we might translate as 'symphonic variations on the theme of an apple', where all manner of appley puddings are served up. A less lyrical apple souffle with calvados proved a mite dry. Whether you have the symphonie or not, an array of petits fours comes with coffee: little choux pastries, pralines, tiny cakes etc. La Bourride is an intelligent blend of local, Norman tradition and culinary invention. Michel Bruneau needs just a little more brilliance in his combination of these delicious ingredients to carry him up to the higher reaches of the firmament.

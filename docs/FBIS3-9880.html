			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Central  American economy and commerce ministers today analyzed the  impact that the North American Free Trade Agreement will have on  the region, it was reported in this capital.    Having established a Tariff and Customs Council, on  Wednesday  the ministers will approve the proposed tariff rates for some  products and on Thursday, as members of the Economic Council,  they will discuss the mechanism for joining the trade agreement.    A source close to the meeting said that "the region paid  $1.6  billion in tariffs in recent months."    Economy Ministers Delmer Urbizo of Honduras, Enrique Cordova  of El Salvador, and Pablo Pereira of Nicaragua participated in  the discussions. Costa Rican Economy Minister Roberto Rojas and  Guatemalan Economy Minister Eduardo Gonzalez also participated,  and they will discuss options to negotiate a trade agreement  with the United States, which could begin with parity for some  benefits of the North American treaty.    The ministers will analyze the report titled "Commercial  Relations Between Central America and the United States," to  which NOTIMEX had access. The report establishes the  negotiation of "parity" for some benefits or "full-rights"  participation in the trilateral treaty. According to the report  prepared by consultant Harold Rodas upon request from the UN  Development Program (UNDP) and the Secretariat of Central  American Economic Integration (SIECA), "the United States'  commercial policy towards the region is not clearly defined."    The area's concern is apparent, and that is why efforts are  being made to maintain the tariff benefits received from the  United States and even to expand them in view of the benefits  Mexico obtains by commercial agreements since NAFTA became  effective in January.    The report asks: "When will Central America break the chains  of dependency on a preferential system? Is the region prepared  for the challenges of reciprocity?" According to Rodas, these  questions arise because there "is an abyss between the political  will and factual reality."    Regarding the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP),  through which the United States imports 4,300 duty free products  from 139 countries and territories, the officials will review  the 15-month extension approved by the United States which ends  on 30 September. This preferential scheme seeks to sponsor  beneficiary countries' economic and industrial development, and  its legal base on a worldwide level is derived from Article IV  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The  beneficiaries can export eligible products duty free to the  United States, as long as they comply with norms of origin  requirements -- above all having a national value-added rate of  35 percent and a certificate of origin.    The UNDP-SIECA report, presented to the ministers on  Wednesday, also examines the so-called Caribbean Basin  Initiative sponsored by the United States. The initiative's goal  is to increase local and foreign investments in non-traditional  sectors, support economic diversification, and expand exports.  The preferential system is more extensive than the GSP because  no conditions are set on competition or graduality. However, the  initiative excludes certain important categories, such as  textiles, oil and oil derivatives, canned tuna, shoes, and  leather articles. A country can lose its Caribbean Basin  Initiative benefits by not cooperating in the struggle against  drug trafficking, being communist, or expropriating U.S.  citizens' assets, businesses, societies, or associations. The  benefits may also be lost if a country does not maintain an  extradition treaty with the United States.    The Central American economy ministers will analyze measures  against disloyal competition implemented by different countries.    The officials began talks on Wednesday following a detailed  report by SIECA Secretary Rafael Rodriguez Loucel on the 31st  SIECA Directors Meeting, which ended yesterday.</p>

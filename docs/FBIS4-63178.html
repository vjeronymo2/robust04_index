			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F> rubric: "Moscow Chekists Came Close to Losing Their Head"]    [Text] MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from reliable  sources that yesterday the president turned down a resignation  request from Major General Yevgeniy Savostyanov, chief of  Moscow's directorate of the Russian Federation Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS].    Rumors of Savostyanov's imminent resignation had been around  for several weeks. The request was finally written but turned  down. Various things are being said about the major general's  wish to resign. According to one guess, Savostyanov decided to  go into politics. Many staffers in his directorate however  think their boss is simply in a hurry. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS  has information that Sergey Stepashin, FCS director, would like  to see Cherkasov, the current chief of the St. Petersburg FCS  directorate, occupying the Moscow directorate. Stepashin has  been friends with Cherkasov for a long time and he interceded  for him at the time of the repeat certification procedure.</p>

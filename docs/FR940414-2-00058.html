May, M.D.; Denial of Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 16, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued an Order to Show Cause to Robert W. May, Jr., M.D., of 200 South Tennessee Street, Cartersville, Georgia 30120. The Order to Show Cause sought to deny Dr. May's pending application for a DEA Certificate of Registration. The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. May by registered mail. The return receipt was never forwarded to DEA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an effort to ensure that Dr. May was aware of the Order to Show Cause, two DEA Diversion Investigators traveled to Dr. May's address in Cartersville on July 1, 1993. A DEA Diversion Investigator handed Dr. May another copy of the Order to Show Cause and explained its significance to him. Dr. May replied that he had indeed received the original Order to Show Cause but had thrown it in the trash because he did not want to fight the Federal bureaucracy. As of March 1, 1994, Dr. May had not requested a hearing nor had he filed any statement on his behalf. Consequently, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), Dr. May is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. The Administrator now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file as is provided for in 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. May's registration with the DEA would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). The investigative file reveals that on December 19, 1986, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Dr. May was convicted of fifteen counts of distributing and dispensing controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1), and forty counts of aiding and abetting the same in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. 2. Dr. May was placed on probation for a period of five years and was prohibited from prescribing Schedule II and III controlled substances during the probation period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The investigative file further reveals that the Composite Board of Medical Examiners (Board) issued a Consent Order, effective February 16, 1988, suspending Dr. May's medical license for thirty days. The Consent Order also placed his medical license on probation for a period of five years, to run concurrently with the probation imposed by the United States District Court, required Dr. May to provide at least 500 hours of free medical services to the community and ordered Dr. May to partake in 250 hours of continuing education. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Consent Order precluded Dr. May from applying for renewal of his DEA Certificate of Registration without the prior written approval of the Board. The Board stipulated that such approval would not be granted until Dr. May had complied with all the conditions of his probations, including specified continuing education requirements. As of February 1994, Dr. May had not received such approval from the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 823(f) of the Controlled Substances Act lists five factors which are to be considered when making a determination as to whether a registration would be in the public interest. These factors include: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. The Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks, M.D., 52 FR 41030 (1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Administrator concludes that Dr. May's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. The Administrator finds that due to Dr. May's past practice of distributing and dispensing controlled substances in the absence of a legitimate medical purpose, Dr. May cannot be entrusted with a DEA Certificate of Registration. His criminal conviction for this conduct and the action taken against his state medical license by the Board provide ample foundation for this conclusion. Dr. May's failure to respond to the Order to Show Cause, either by requesting a hearing or by submitting a written statement, indicates that he is either unwilling or unable to proffer support for his application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 21 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that Dr. May's application for registration with the DEA as a practitioner be, and it hereby is, denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This order is effective April 14, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas A.

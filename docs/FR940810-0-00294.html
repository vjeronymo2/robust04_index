			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) In addition to the above selection criterion, the employer shall provide a half-mask air purifying respirator, other than a disposable respirator, equipped with high efficiency filters whenever the employee performs the following activities: Class II and III asbestos jobs where the employer does not produce a negative exposure assessment; and Class III jobs where TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM is being disturbed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) In addition to the above selection criteria, the employer shall provide a full facepiece supplied air respirator operated in the pressure demand mode equipped with an auxiliary positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus for all employees within the regulated area where Class I work is being performed for which a negative exposure assessment has not been produced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Respirator program. (i) Where respiratory protection is used, the employer shall institute a respirator program in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134(b), (d), (e), and (f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The employer shall permit each employee who uses a filter respirator to change the filter elements whenever an increase in breathing resistance is detected and shall maintain an adequate supply of filter elements for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Employees who wear respirators shall be permitted to leave work areas to wash their faces and respirator facepieces whenever necessary to prevent skin irritation associated with respirator use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) No employee shall be assigned to tasks requiring the use of respirators if, based on his or her most recent examination, an examining physician determines that the employee will be unable to function normally wearing a respirator, or that the safety or health of the employee or of other employees will be impaired by the use of a respirator. Such employee shall be assigned to another job or given the opportunity to transfer to a different position the duties of which he or she is able to perform with the same employer, in the same geographical area, and with the same seniority, status, and rate of pay and other job benefits he or she had just prior to such transfer, if such a different position is available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Respirator fit testing. (i) The employer shall ensure that the respirator issued to the employee exhibits the least possible facepiece leakage and that the respirator is fitted properly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Employers shall perform either quantitative or qualitative face fit tests at the time of initial fitting and at least every 6 months thereafter for each employee wearing a negative-pressure respirator. The qualitative fit tests may be used only for testing the fit of half-mask respirators where they are permitted to be worn, or of full-facepiece air purifying respirators where they are worn at levels at which half-facepiece air purifying respirators are permitted. Qualitative and quantitative fit tests shall be conducted in accordance with Appendix C. The tests shall be used to select facepieces that provide the required protection as prescribed in Table 1 in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Protective clothing_(1) General. The employer shall provide and require the use of protective clothing, such as coveralls or similar whole-body clothing, head coverings, gloves, and foot coverings for any employee exposed to airborne concentrations of asbestos that exceed the TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, or for which a required negative exposure assessment is not produced, and for any employee performing Class I operations which involve the removal of over 25 linear or 10 square feet of TSI or surfacing ACM and PACM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Laundering. (i) The employer shall ensure that laundering of contaminated clothing is done so as to prevent the release of airborne asbestos in excess of the TWA or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Any employer who gives contaminated clothing to another person for laundering shall inform such person of the requirement in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section to effectively prevent the release of airborne asbestos in excess of the TWA and excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contaminated clothing. Contaminated clothing shall be transported in sealed impermeable bags, or other closed, impermeable containers, and be labeled in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK shares hit new high as economic outlook brightens Shares in London closed last night at another record high, boosted by hopes of steady economic growth next year with inflation staying weak. The FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks climbed 25.9 to finish at 3,337.1, for a 76-point rise on the week. Since the day before the Budget on November 30, share prices have gained 7 per cent. UK government bonds also continued their good run, with prices driven up by low inflationary pressures and expectations of a cut in interest rates early in the new year.

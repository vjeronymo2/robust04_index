			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOMEFED'S RATING DOWNGRADED; $110 MILLION IN DEBT AFFECTED;  </P> <P> FINANCE: THE MOVE IS A REACTION TO CONCERNS ABOUT REAL ESTATE AND NONPERFORMING  LOANS.  </P> <P> Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded HomeFed Bank's subordinated  debt and deposit ratings, a move that affected about $110 million of long-term  debt.  </P> <P> Moody's linked the rating downgradings to an increase in foreclosed commercial  real estate and nonperforming loans.  </P> <P> "We're disappointed by the downgrade," HomeFed spokeswoman Kaye Rowan said  Tuesday. "But we understand that the purpose of these (ratings) agencies is to  be conservative."  </P> <P> Moody's expects that HomeFed, like most of California's major financial  institutions, will experience further deterioration in the quality of its real  estate loans.  </P> <P> Any additional deterioration could force the S&amp;L to take additional  reserves, a move that would further reduce the S&amp;L's profitability,  according to Moody's.  </P> <P> Moody's downgraded HomeFed's ratings for long-term deposits to B-1 from BA-2.  Moody's downgraded the thrift's rating for subordinated debt to CAA from B-1.  </P> <P> Moody's, which on Tuesday also downgraded debt and deposit ratings for Coast  Federal Bank, recently had downgraded ratings for several other large  California financial institutions.  </P> <P> Stock in HomeFed Corp., the parent company of HomeFed Bank, closed up $.25 at  $6.625 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L's stock has drifted up in recent days following word that a group  led by Idanta Partners, a La Jolla investment group, had acquired 7.2% of  HomeFed Corp.'s shares. HomeFed had traded at $5 or less immediately before the  Idanta group's investment became public.  </P> <P> Idanta founder and general partner David J. Dunn has described his group's  investment in HomeFed as a "long-term" venture.  </P> <P> Dunn, in a recent interview, said he does not foresee an immediate turnaround  in California's sluggish real estate market.  </P></p>

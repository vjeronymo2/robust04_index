			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Marling cuts deficit to Pounds 9.6m - Disposal of Spanish arm and acquisition in Germany completes refocusing IN A busy period of rest-ructuring and rationalisation, Marling Industries reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 27.9m to Pounds 9.6m in the year to March 31. The new management team, led by chief executive Mr David Abel Smith since January 1992, has been refocusing the group on its core activities of safety belt webbing and industrial textiles. It has engineered the real reduction of employee numbers across the group by 25 per cent to 678 jobs; it has completed the planned disposal programme with yesterday's announcement of the sale of Murtra Group, its principal Spanish businesses, for a nominal Pta1; and has simultaneously moved the group into a new, though related, product area with the DM7.4m (Pounds 2.9m) acquisition of Muller Group. Muller, which is based in central Germany, makes elasticated products for the 'growing' incontinence products market as well as sports bandages and knitted elastic bands. The cash acquisition is being funded by a 1-for-10 rights issue of up to 16.1m new ordinary shares at 19p apiece. This is the second cash call in a year - the first was for Pounds 18m to fund restructuring. As part of the purchase Marling is to refinance DM10m of Muller's debt at 7.25 per cent (currently 10.75 per cent). Earlier in the year Boalloy, the commercial vehicle body maker, was sold to certain of its managers, and the automotive safety airbags joint venture has been sold to Electrolux Autoliv, Marling's partner. Yesterday the group finished clearing the decks with the disposal of Murtra. Mr Abel Smith cited other UK companies withdrawing from Spain - Amstrad and British Vita - and explained that the Spanish economy had collapsed since the Barcelona Olympics. Marling had already largely reorganised Murtra, but it would have still needed 'significant cash injections'. It was the poorest performing part of the group, incurring operating losses of Pounds 1.7m and a deficit of Pounds 2.6m before tax. Marling stands to gain deferred consideration of up to Pounds 1.5m depending on its future profitability. Mr William Rollason, finance director, pointed out that Marling's earnings per share from the continuing businesses - excluding Murtra and 'non-operational items' (Pounds 581,000 on the sale of a German property, Pounds 6.32m provisions for the Spanish operations, and Pounds 1.4m for Boalloy) - were 1.54p, against losses of 11.3p last time. Under the same calculations, turnover grew to Pounds 54.7m (Pounds 52.3m), operating profits were Pounds 4m (losses Pounds 1.6m) and pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.1m after interest payable of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.2m). He added that as the cost reductions from productivity and efficiencies started to take effect, the operating profit margin improved to 7.4 per cent. However, the official figures, compiled on an FRS 3 basis, show that turnover declined from Pounds 102.7m to Pounds 79m, with continuing operations contributing Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 74.8m). Total operating profits amounted to Pounds 2.09m (losses Pounds 6.4m): here continuing operations pitched in Pounds 2.37m (losses Pounds 2.46m). Interest payable took Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 3.47m). Borrowings before the Murtra sale were Pounds 15.8m and, after losing its Pounds 3.1m debt, gearing will stand at 69 per cent. Losses per share were 7.8p (69.55p). On the basis of continuing operations, a final and only dividend of 0.65p is proposed (0.3p).</p>

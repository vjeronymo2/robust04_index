			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / BAe and Matra set to merge missile units BRITISH Aerospace is on the verge of merging its Dynamics missiles subsidiary with the guided weapons business of the French Matra-Hachette conglomerate, creating one of Europe's largest guided weapons companies. The two companies are expected to announce this week agreement to form a joint company combining their respective guided weapons operations. The new company's annual turnover will be in excess of Pounds 1bn. According to today's issue of Flight International magazine, the British and French governments are 'aware of the situation' and are likely to give their blessing. The merger is a significant step in the consolidation and rationalisation of Europe's defence and aerospace industry, accelerated by the reduction in government defence spending since the collapse of the eastern bloc. BAe, one of Britain's largest manufacturing companies, had wanted to form a partnership with other European defence groups for its missiles operation as part of its recovery and restructuring strategy. Two years ago BAe sought to merge its lossmaking guided weapons business with that of the French-based Thomson-CSF group, but the deal collapsed. Thomson-CSF has since linked up with Short Brothers of Belfast to develop short-range ground-to-air missiles. BAe was in talks with the private Matra group last year for a possible sale of its space activities to the French company, but the two failed to agree on a price. However, they maintained close contact and have been negotiating a merger of their missiles businesses for some months. With 5,000 employees, BAe's Dynamics division is the larger employer, but the two missiles businesses have about the same turnover. Matra's missile sales totalled around FFr5bn (Pounds 600m) last year while BAe's Dynamics subsidiary had annual sales of around Pounds 500m. Matra has long wanted to forge a European partnership for its defence activities in preference to taking part in a restructuring of the French domestic missiles industry with the state-controlled Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF. The BAe/Matra move coincides with an intensification of missiles collaboration talks between Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF, as well as between Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace. It is also in line with a wider BAe strategy of strengthening its aerospace activities through overseas partnerships. It recently merged its regional jet activities with Taiwan Aerospace, and is engaged in talks with Casa of Spain and other manufacturers about rationalising its turbo propeller commuter aircraft business. BAe declined to comment on reports of the merger.</p>

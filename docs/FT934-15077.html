			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News (Europe): Frankfurt slips gently below 2,000 level ACTIVITY was muted yesterday in many of the senior bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT slipped below 2,000 again, the DAX index closing 12.41 lower at 1,998.61 in what was described as a much needed consolidation after five consecutive record highs. Turnover fell from DM8.5bn to DM5.6bn. Most blue chips fell by 1 per cent or more but there was resistance at the top of the market where Daimler rose 50 pfg to DM741.50, Volkswagen by DM2.50 to DM376, Deutsche Bank was just pfg 60 lower at DM741.50 and Siemens fell DM3.50 to DM709.50. The pharmaceuticals company, Schering, saw more profit-taking as it fell DM22 to DM1,019; and the chemicals group, Hoechst, had a similar slip, dropping DM6 to DM285.50 as analysts continued to say that the bid for 51 per cent of the US generic drug maker, Copley Pharmaceutical, looked expensive. The biggest blue chip loser was the tyremaker, Continental, down DM6.40, or 2.8 per cent to DM225.60 after a MM Warburg Investment Research report forecasting a savage drop in 1993 net profits. PARIS remained a seller of Eurotunnel with the shares losing a further 7.4 per cent as the shares slipped FFr3.10 to FFr39.00. The market is expecting a rights issue from the group, probably at the start of next year. The CAC-40 index lost 11.87 to 2,126.85 in turnover of FFr2.8bn. Further rumours swept around Euro Disney as the stock lost FFr1.55 to FFr50.35, while, among the gainers SocGen put on FFr9 to FFr698. Trading in both Suez and UAP was suspended in preparation for an announcement, long heralded, on Groupe Victoire. MILAN turned its attention to the savings shares of privatisation candidates after Credito Italiano and BCI announced share exchange schemes late on Monday. The broader market, however, was unable to make progress and the Comit index shed 4.81 to 579.94. News that Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, had withdrawn his resignation, submitted after a row about the privatisation programme, failed to impress investors. One analyst commented: 'The government's cohesion has been damaged by this episode and the questions that it raised about the privatisation programme have not gone away'. BCI's ordinary shares lost L132 to at L4,466 while savings shares soared L425 to L4,070. Credito Italiano ordinary shares fell L163 to L2,315 but savings shares gained L205 to at L1,995. The switch into savings shares was also evident among other companies slated for privatisation as investors thought that they might follow the same course. Sip savings shares added L74 to L2,890 while the ordinary shares fall L124 to L3,426. Fiat 's L3,234bn rights issue, scheduled to begin on Friday, continued to weigh heavily on the market. Fiat shed L117 to L5,710: at a meeting with analysts on Monday, the group stressed cost cutting measures already introduced while yesterday, it announced temporary lay-offs of between 13,450 and 38,250 workers in November. ZURICH turned back from its best levels of the day as banking and insurance issues ran into profit-taking. The SMI index finished 4.0 higher at a record 2,552.5 after an intraday high of 2,565.9. Roche certificates, SFr40 higher at SFr5,450, and CS Holdings, SFr25 ahead at SFr3,175, headed the active list. Zurich Insurance ended SFr1 lower at SFr1,348 amid reports that one small Zurich bank was swapping Zurich shares for CS Holding. Ciba-Geigy registered shares rose SFr3 to SFr720 ahead of results today which analysts expect to show a small fall in turnover. Swissair fell SFr15 to SFr720 as officials met executives from the other three airlines involved in the Alcazar alliance project. AMSTERDAM was supported slightly by dollar strength and the CBS Tendency index added 0.2 to 128.7. Among the internationals Unilever rose Fl 2.10 to Fl 200.70. STOCKHOLM remained firm helped by foreign interest in Astra and Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 11.0 to 1,363.8, in turnover of SKr1.4bn. Ericsson B's added SKr2 to SKr434 helped by news that it had been awarded a SKr1bn order to supply a mobile telephone network in Malaysia.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 12                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      11.30       12.00      13.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1315.41    1313.79     1313.76    1315.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1396.01    1394.29     1395.07    1393.19  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               14.00      15.00       16.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1314.61    1316.03     1315.15    1315.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1392.68    1393.47     1393.55    1393.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 11     Oct 8     Oct 7     Oct 6     Oct 5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1319.96   1321.16   1317.76   1321.84   1313.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1401.02   1405.46   1401.97   1403.39   1391.47  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1316.28; 200 - 1396.25 Low/day: 100 - 1313.16  200 - 1392.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

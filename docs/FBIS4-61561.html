			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own information" report: "Ames Instilled Fear"] </F>   [Text] As has already been reported, the (recently)  high-ranking CIA staffer Aldrich Ames has been sentenced to life  imprisonment. This, it is said, is for his link with the  Russian special services, which caused unprecedented damage to  U.S. security. We have managed to obtain some of A. Ames'  statements from competent sources. Here they are -- at first  hand, as the saying goes.    In a statement in court Ames sharply criticized the  government in connection with the fact the unprecedented  pressure which it brought to bear on his wife, Rosario Ames, in  fact pushing her to perjure herself. (It is known that the  authorities tried to accuse her of complicity in espionage).  Noting that he deeply regrets the grief he has caused his  family, Ames said: "I managed for seven and one half of my 10  years' cooperation with the KGB and the Foreign Intelligence  Service to conceal the fact successfully from my wife. When  Rosario, as a result of a mistake I made, found out about my  criminal activity, she demanded I break off relations with the  Russians. I was able to put the necessary pressure on her,  right up to blackmail, to defer that step."    Explaining the reasons why he passed on to the KGB  information about CIA agents and other intelligence departments,  Ames noted:    "First at the time I disagreed with the strengthening of the  extreme right-wing forces in our political spectrum and with  U.S. policy in the field of ensuring national security and in  the international sphere. Second, I had reached the conclusion  that espionage as it was practised by the CIA and some other  U.S. departments has been and remains cheating in the interests  of a group of careerist bureaucrats who are successfully  misleading several generations of U.S. politicians and citizens  regarding the need for and value of their work. There has not  been and is not any justifiable need to have thousands of  intelligence officers and tens of thousands of agents throughout  the world, particularly in friendly countries. The information  received by our vast network of agents at the cost of  considerable human and moral efforts is mostly of no special  importance and does not meet politicians' requirements.    "Thanks to the efforts of the CIA and the FBI the leadership  had a very good idea of the real state of affairs in the special  services of the 'Soviet bloc' countries. Nonetheless, on the  pretext of the need to conceal from the enemy the true scale of  our agents' penetration of those states' special organs, for  decades it instilled unbridled hysteria over the aggressiveness  of their intelligence services."    Does that mean that CIA supermen exist only in movie  thrillers? After all, Ames alone instilled such fear that the  entire "collective" of the formidable department was forced to  take a lie detector test. You feel sorry for the boys....</p>

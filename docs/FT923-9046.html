			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Political punters buy Bush to win: US market that trades shares in candidates WANT to know what Americans really think about their presidential race this year? Have you watched the polls fluctuate wildly and wondered what is really going on? Four professors at the University of Iowa say that you can find out - and even bet on the results - at the Iowa Political Stock Market, the only public US market that trades shares in political candidates. The IPSM began four years ago when three professors of economy, Mr Robert Forsythe, Mr Forrest Nelson and Mr George Neumann, and one of political science, Mr Jack Wright, were griping about the inaccuracy of political polls for predicting election outcomes. They devised the market over a weekend in March 1988 and launched it in June that year for the US presidential race. Since then, they have run markets in eight more elections, including parliamentary races in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey. Once just an experiment with students, the IPSM has grown into a fully fledged public market. And its creators believe it has proven their hypothesis that the market is a more accurate indicator of political outcomes than opinion polls - because you have to put your money where your mouth is. For this year's presidential contest, the IPSM is operating 24 hours per day. It has some 510 traders, with a total Dollars 34,000 invested. That may not be much, but the initial deposit for a trading account is only Dollars 5 and accounts are limited to Dollars 500. But, says one punter, Mr Steven Maravetz, a University of Iowa official: 'People take it very seriously. If you had made all the right moves till now, you could have parlayed Dollars 5 into Dollars 1,000.' Mr Nelson says that he expects the amount invested will at least double by election day, November 3, and that it may reach Dollars 100,000. Since the start of the year, the IPSM has run markets in the Democratic presidential nomination, the Democratic vice-presidential nomination (both of which are now closed), the two-party (now Bush-Clinton) race, a three way plurality contest that includes Mr Ross Perot, and a three candidate vote share. Its latest product is a market in 'presidential derivatives,' or the vote shares above and below a designated percentage for President George Bush. The entry of Mr Perot as a possible presidential contender has made for some exciting moments. After responding to a clamour to create a Perot share, the IPSM watched Perot investors get skinned when he withdrew from the race and his shares dropped from 29 cents to 4 cents. They still trade, but at a tenth of a cent. Although the name suggests a stock market, the IPSM is closer to a futures market. Earlier this year, the IPSM won recognition from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, as an experimental, non-profit market. This prohibited IPSM from advertising itself or charging transaction fees and commissions. All revenues must be distributed after the presidential election on November 3. Trading accounts can be opened with a telephone call to the university. After receiving a traders' instruction manual and making a Dollars 5 deposit, traders can log onto the computer and start buying and selling shares. Credit trading and short selling are not allowed. A typical first move might be to enter the two party market with a purchase of five Dollars 1 'unit portfolios' each consisting of one share of Bush and one share of Clinton. While payout formulas vary, at the close of this market the trader will receive Dollars 1 times the percentage of popular vote for each candidate share. If, for example, the election is 51 per cent Bush and 48 per cent Clinton, and a trader was holding 50 Bush and 10 Clinton, the pay-off would be Dollars 30.30, plus whatever was left over in the trader's cash account. Other formulas work on a winner takes all basis. About 80 per cent of the traders are students and faculty at the University of Iowa and 64 other universities, but, since some publicity about the market in the spring, several professional traders have joined in. Mr Boaz Weinstein, a trader at a top Wall Street investment bank, said he jumped into the Democratic vice-presidential market, and 'did pretty well.' Mr Weinstein believes that Wall Street and other professional traders do not have that clear an advantage in the market. The students learn quickly and the market is efficient, he said. It also cannot be cornered. Mr Weinstein and other professional traders also say they think it is a better gauge of the political climate than polls. For example, the surge in favour of Mr Clinton after the Democratic convention, did not even register in the IPSM, where Mr Bush has been the favourite since January. Mr Clinton's shares have, however, gradually improved in price to about 48 cents currently. Mr Bush's shares are running at about 52 cents.</p>

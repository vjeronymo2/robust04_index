			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Now maybe he'll get a promotion.  </P> <P> Actor Don Johnson, who has played Sonny Crockett on "Miami Vice" for more than  four years and is still a detective, got his man -- but with no cameras  rolling.  </P> <P> This time it was for real, when Johnson went back to his suite at the Hotel  Bel-Air shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday and found a man allegedly pawing through  the purse belonging to Johnson's once and future wife, actress Melanie  Griffith.  </P> <P> The couple surprised the man in mid-rifling before he could lift the costly  jewelry in the handbag, police say. Johnson -- obviously a method actor --  dropped into character, blocked the man's exit, told him to stop what he was  doing, patted him down to make sure he was unarmed and held him until a  policeman working as a hotel security guard arrived. Booked for investigation  of attempted burglary was David Johnson, 34, no relation to Don.  </P> <P> Guy probably didn't recognize Johnson if he wasn't wearing aqua.  </P> <P> It's lonely at the top -- or wherever.  </P> <P> In 1985, newspeople cast about for a convenient name for the perpetrator of a  series of grisly murders, for which suspect Richard Ramirez went on trial  Monday.  </P> <P> For a time it was the "Valley Intruder," or "Valley Invader." When the killings  went statewide, the monikers came down to two: "the Night Stalker," ultimately  used by most news agencies, and "the Walk-In Killer," employed by KNBC News,  period.  </P> <P> On Monday, even the mother ship, NBC, reported on the "Today" show on the  opening day of trial for the suspected "Night Stalker" -- moments after KNBC  noted the opening day of trial for the suspected "Walk-In Killer."  </P> <P> You might think two different guys are on trial for the same crimes.  </P> <P> Unbowed, KNBC is pledging to keep its lonely vigil. Says news director Tom  Capra, mindful that it was a KNBC camera that recorded Ramirez's arrest, "We  always kind of considered him to be our story."  </P> <P> And you thought the presidential campaigns went on forever.  </P> <P> Nearly 13 years after a Torrance City Council candidate was elected, a huge  billboard exhorting voters to cast their ballots for him somehow turned up in a  vacant lot in Lincoln Heights, more than a dozen miles away.  </P> <P> Constituents complained to Los Angeles Councilwoman Gloria Molina about the  "incredible eyesore," said spokeswoman Alma Martinez. Dan Walker -- still in  office -- declared he had rented the sign briefly, just before the 1976  election, and not seen it since. Still, Walker was "the most visible owner" --  in letters several feet high, Molina said.  </P> <P> Plan One -- hauling the 15-by-25-foot billboard to the steps of Torrance City  Hall -- was abandoned. "We were concerned of being accused of the same thing  we're accusing Mr. Walker of," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Plan Two -- bureaucracy -- prevailed. The sign, its ELECT DAN WALKER TORRANCE  CITY COUNCIL still legible and apparently owned by a billboard advertising  firm, was ticketed and given 10 days to get out of town.  </P></p>

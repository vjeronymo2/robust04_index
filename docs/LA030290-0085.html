Coast Guard officials in New York said they had reopened the Kill Van Kull  waterway, between Staten Island, N.Y., and New Jersey, after Wednesday's spill.  In the later spill, more than 500 gallons of heavy crude oil spilled from a  Texaco barge into the Arthur Kill waterway off the Exxon Bayway refinery in  Bayonne, N.J.  </P></p>

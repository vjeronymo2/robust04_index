			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Luxottica sees a vision of world domination  - The expansion plans of Italy's leading maker of spectacle frames Few Italians would recognise Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio if they met him in the street. Yet mention his name and most would immediately recall the modest man from a Milan orphanage who is Italy's biggest taxpayer. Luxottica, his company, is the world's leading maker of spectacle frames. Its international market share is estimated at almost 9 per cent. One in five Americans who wear glasses is a customer. In Italy, the proportion is one in three. Though the business may seem mundane, margins are high enough to generate net profits of L67.5bn on sales of L523bn in 1992. Results for 1993 should be even better when released next early month. Boosted by the lira devaluation, sales rose by about 24 per cent to more than L640bn (Dollars 375m), while net profits should maintain the 12 per cent growth of the previous year - in spite of recession. About three-quarters of output is exported. The surge in profits and turnover, which grew 8 per cent even allowing for exchange rate changes, should also be reflected in the dividend, likely to rise in proportion to earnings, says Mr Del Vecchio, Luxottica's founder and controlling shareholder. Such buoyant figures, continuing a steady growth since the company listed 25 per cent of its shares in the US in 1990, help to explain why Luxottica remains among Italian analysts' preferred stocks. Its prestige may grow even more if Mr Del Vecchio pulls off a number of acquisitions believed to be in the pipeline. Although he declines to identify the candidates, Luxottica's strong balance sheet leaves it well placed to reinforce its international dominance through further takeovers. Recognising the need for integration in a traditionally fragmented business has been Luxottica's trump card. The world market for spectacle frames is divided among dozens of companies. Now, four, led by Luxottica, which produced 10.4m pairs in 1992, head the pack, with a myriad of smaller manufacturers dividing the rest of the market between them. Many smaller players seem destined to disappear as other manufacturers follow Luxottica's path. Beginning as a sub-contractor of delicately-engineered spectacle parts, it gradually encompassed the entire manufacturing process for glasses in metal and plastic and wholesale distribution in large markets. Its international position has been consolidated by acquiring local distributors or setting up its own distribution arm where necessary. That has helped it capture about 22 per cent of the market in Canada, 9 per cent in the UK and 6 per cent in France. Early recognition of the trend towards more expensive 'designer-label' eyewear has been its other asset. While cheaper eyewear was left to low-cost Asian producers, it was only in the mid-1980s that the market for dearer, Dollars 100-Dollars 350 designer brands, was developed. Luxottica makes glasses under licence for seven design labels, including leading lights such as Armani and Valentino. Expansion of the core range has been accompanied by a diversification into sunglasses. They now account for 24 per cent of sales, up from 10 per cent when introduced five years ago. Mr Del Vecchio denies sales and profits may have peaked. Demand in the US, the biggest market, continues to grow. Meanwhile, spectacle-wearing in other countries, even western Europe, is not up to US levels, while there is huge untapped potential elsewhere, he argues. Demographics help: as populations have grown older with improved medical care, the need for corrective lenses has increased steadily. He is also convinced the industry is set for further rationalisation. The recession has accelerated the shake-out, he believes. 'Those companies which were badly managed in terms of production and distribution, or were in poor financial shape, have seen profits fall,' he says. Mr Del Vecchio says gaining exclusive distribution was vital to raising sales so sharply in the US. The focus is now on repeating that in other developed countries where Luxottica's market share is still only about 2-4 per cent and can at least be doubled, he believes. Product diversification is also on the cards. The designer brands still have room for further development, he believes. Expansion into branded sunglasses, which now account for 24 per cent of turnover, also seems likely. The challenge of contact lenses - once thought insuperable - is also dismissed. The main reason why 98 per cent of US spectacles have to come from abroad is that domestic manufacturers believed in the late 1960s that traditional glasses had no future and concentrated instead on contact lenses. 'Experience has shown people want both,' he says. But perhaps the best measure of confidence in Mr Del Vecchio comes not from the chairman or the analysts who regularly tip Luxottica's stock. As part of the licensing deal with Armani, Mr del Vecchio included a 2 per cent stake in the company. Since then, Mr Armani is believed to have purchased further stock, taking his holding to almost 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Exxon income soars 75% to record EXXON, the world's biggest oil company, posted record earnings in the first quarter due to unusually wide refining margins. Despite a halving in income from US exploration and production operations, earnings soared by 75 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn, or Dollars 1.78 a share, from Dollars 1.3bn (Dollars 1.01 a share) a year earlier. Revenues grew by almost 15 per cent to Dollars 30.7bn. The amount of oil that Exxon refined edged up by only 3.5 per cent in the past three months. But, like other US oil companies, it benefited handsomely from high refining margins, especially outside North America. Earnings from foreign refining and marketing operations surged fivefold to Dollars 1.1bn, compared with Dollars 219m a year earlier. US operations turned to a profit of Dollars 256m from a Dollars 28m loss. The foreign component includes Dollars 160m from the sales of an Australian refinery and a supertanker. The huge first-quarter refining profits were caused by a coincidence of factors, including loss of capacity in the Middle East, falling crude oil prices and high winter production of heating oil rather than high-octane grades. Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman, noted that refining profits began to shrink during the first quarter, and were approaching more normal levels. However, Mr Ivan Obolersky, analyst at Shields &amp; Co in New York, predicted that the industry's margins would be underpinned for some time by the trend towards low-pollution, high-octane fuels. Low crude oil prices also helped Exxon's chemicals business, where earnings jumped by 23 per cent to Dollars 223m, despite a 5 per cent fall in sales volumes. The company cautioned that some softening in margins was apparent at the end of the quarter. Higher sales of petroleum products also contributed to the surge in earnings. The sharp fall in earnings from US exploration and production was ascribed partly to write-downs on properties earmarked for disposal. North American natural gas output slipped to 2.2m cubic feet a day, from almost 2.5m cu ft.</p>

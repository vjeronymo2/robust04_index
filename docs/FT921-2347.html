			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Risky seats win Olympian cash gifts - North-West: The region's electoral importance IF THE government could be accused of trying to bribe any group of voters close to the election, those in north-west England are a likely nomination. The Pounds 55m for the Manchester-led bid for the 2000 Olympic Games, Pounds 50m to improve areas near Olympic sites and Pounds 27m for the Halle orchestra's new concert hall emphasised the region's electoral importance. It contains more than 20 of the Conservatives' 100 most vulnerable seats, the largest number of any region other than London. Labour has 38 of the north-west's 79 constituencies, the Conservatives have 37 and the Liberal Democrats four. To win an overall majority Labour needs a nationwide swing of about 8 per cent. In north-west England this would give it 19 Tory seats. Davyhulme, which is held by Mr Winston Churchill, would fall at 8.1 per cent and Blackpool North at 8.5 per cent. Mr Kinnock will need such gains to realise his hopes of a 20-seat working majority. The region is the UK's second biggest after London and the south-east, and accounts for a tenth of gross domestic product. Generally, Labour holds the inner cities and towns, while the Tories are safest in places such as Crosby, Wirral West and Wirral South on Merseyside, Macclesfield, Eddisbury, Congleton and Tatton in Cheshire, and Fylde in Lancashire. Wallasey has the smallest majority of any Tory seat in the region. Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, won by only 279 votes in 1987. There is a cluster of nine marginals in Greater Manchester and north-east Lancashire. In places like Hyndburn and the Rossendale Valley, working-class owner-occupation is high but the mainly terraced houses formerly enjoyed low rates. Thousands who voted Conservative in such marginal constituencies in 1987 have been poll-tax losers. The marginals with the region's worst unemployment are in the Wirral and Chester travel-to-work area, where nearly 26,000 were jobless at Christmas - a rate of 12.2 per cent. The Tories are at risk here in both the city of Chester and in Ellesmere Port and Neston, as well as in Delyn on the Welsh bank of the River Dee.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              MARGINALS LABOUR MUST CAPTURE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greater Manchester &amp; north-east Lancashire                             Labour swing needed (%) Bolton North-East               0.9 Hyndburn                        2.3 Pendle                          2.6 Bury South                      2.6 Stockport                       3.1 Colne Valley**                  3.7 Bolton West                     4.1 Rossendale &amp; Darwen*            4.2 (David Trippier) Bury North                      6.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Wirral, Cheshire &amp; north Wales                             Labour swing needed (%) Wallasey*(Lynda Chlker)         0.3 Delyn                           1.2 Ellesmers Port &amp; Neston         1.6 Warrington South                3.1 City of Chester                 4.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lancashire &amp; Cumbria west of M6 &amp; M61                             Labour swing needed (%) Lancashire West                 1.1 Barrow &amp; Furness                3.6 Chorley                         6.7 South Ribble*(Robert Atkins)    7.1 Lancaster                       7.1 Blackpool South                 8.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Denotes ministers at risk **SDP/Lib Alliance secured in 1987  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

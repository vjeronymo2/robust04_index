For already the fifth day, cargo vehicles from Macedonia  [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], but also from a  number of European Union member states, are waiting to exit  Greece. The measure introduced by the Greek Government have  grounded vehicles transporting a range of goods.    What will happen to them will be known after the European  Union meeting, as there are no official explanations from the  Greek side, which only adds to the indignation of the drivers.</p>

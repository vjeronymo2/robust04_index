This SIP revision approves a maintenance plan for the Huntington area including contingency measures which provide for continued attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The intended effect of this action is to approve a redesignation request and maintenance plan for the Huntington area. This action will also remove any sanctions imposed on the Huntington area under section 179 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act). On November 12, 1992, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor and Environmental Resources; Division of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) submitted a request to redesignate the Huntington portion (Cabell and Wayne counties) of the multi-state Huntington-Ashland moderate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment. On November 12, 1992, the WVDEP also submitted a maintenance plan for the Huntington area as a revision to the West Virginia State Implementation Plan. On February 22, 1994, and August 10, 1994 WVDEP provided clarifying revisions to its maintenance plan. The Kentucky portion of the Huntington-Ashland nonattainment area includes Boyd County and a portion of Greenup County. Kentucky's request for redesignation and the maintenance plan for the Ashland, Kentucky portion of the nonattainment area has been submitted to EPA and is the subject of a separate rulemaking document. This action is being taken under sections 107 and 110 of the Act. In this action, EPA is redesignating the Huntington moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment and is approving the maintenance plan submitted by the WVDEP as a SIP revision to the West Virginia SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will become effective October 21, 1994 unless before October 6, 1994 adverse comments are submitted.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1990 the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Under section 107(d)(1) of the Act, in conjunction with the Governor of West Virginia, EPA was required to designate the Huntington area as nonattainment because the area violated the ozone standard in 1987&hyph;1989. Under section 107(d)(1)(C), EPA designated Boyd County of Kentucky as nonattainment by operation of law with respect to ozone because the area was designated nonattainment before the date of enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act. The nonattainment area was expanded to include portions of Greenup County of Kentucky per section 107(d)(1)(A)(i) (See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.318.) Furthermore, the Huntington-Ashland area was classified as a multi-state moderate ozone nonattainment under section 181(a)(1) of the Act. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.349.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air quality monitored data recorded in the West Virginia portion of the area met the ozone NAAQS from 1989&hyph;1991 and has subsequently continued to indicate attainment and maintenance through 1993. West Virginia submitted an ozone maintenance SIP and redesignation request on November 12, 1992. The Kentucky portion attained the ozone NAAQS, based on air quality data from 1991 through 1993. West Virginia submitted a revision to its maintenance plan on February 22, 1994. This revision was done to include ambient monitoring data from 1991&hyph;1993 indicating attainment throughout the entire nonattainment area including Kentucky's portion. A second revision to the maintenance plan was provided on August 10, 1994 which clarified the procedures for implementation of the contingency measures of West Virginia's maintenance plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Review of West Virginia's Submittal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following is a brief description of how the State of West Virginia's November 12, 1992 submittal along with the additional revisions to the maintenance plan of February 22, 1994 and August 10, 1994 fulfill the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. A Technical Support Document (TSD) has also been prepared by EPA on these rulemaking actions. The TSD is available for public inspection at the EPA Regional office listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

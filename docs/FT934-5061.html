			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tax philosophy lost among the politics - John Plender says the chancellor's plans may be seductive but are marred by fiscal brutalism Politically effective it may have been. But from a fiscal point of view the Budget was a vintage mixed bag. The chancellor revealed himself to be a man with one big idea - knocking the public finances back into shape - and an alarmingly motley collection of small ideas. If he succeeds in his main economic objective, it will be at the cost of any coherence in the tax system. The aspiration to tax reform, which rode high under Nigel (now Lord) Lawson and survived in diluted form under his successors John Major and Norman Lamont, must be counted well and truly dead after yesterday's performance. It would be pointless to search for an underlying philosophy of taxation in Mr Clarke's speech. Nor would he, one suspects, wish to be accused of entertaining so grandiose a notion. To the extent that there was a logic to it all, it was purely political: a classic exercise in shifting the share of taxation among different groups in order to minimise political damage and maximise potential advantage. In short, the fiscal lollipops were dispensed and withdrawn with great abandon. Fiscal neutrality - the doctrine that taxation should not unduly influence decisions about saving, working and spending - did not get a look in. That goal, the cornerstone of the 1980s tax reforms, has vanished. Nor did Mr Clarke show much respect for his predecessor's efforts. Mr Lamont's reform of the married couple's allowance earlier this year has now been superseded by another measure whereby the relief will be restricted to a wholly arbitrary 15 per cent. On this basis allowances no longer bear any obvious relation to the broader structure of income tax. Those that lack political appeal will presumably be adjusted henceforth to whatever rate will maximise revenue at an acceptable political cost. That appears to be the fate of mortgage interest relief, which Lady Thatcher fought so ferociously to preserve against the Lawson onslaught. Policy under Norman Lamont had already moved beyond the approach of permitting the relief to 'wither on the vine'. By restricting the relief to 15 per cent when the housing market is depressed Mr Clarke has, in effect, signalled an earlier death for this anomalous relief. That is all to the good. The relief was always capitalised in the value of the existing owner's home, thereby discriminating against the first-time buyer it was supposed to help. How far the new move will offend existing mortgagors may depend on the readiness of building societies to reduce rates further. There remain, admittedly, some modest echoes from the reformist period. Mr Clarke's reshuffling followed the tried and tested pattern of broadening the tax base, increasing indirect taxation, and restricting or reducing allowances and reliefs in the income tax system. But it was more form than substance. There was little attempt to reduce economic distortions, except in the form of clamping down on tax loopholes - an expedient that carried a political bonus by permitting a sideswipe at the opposition leader John Smith, who claims to see outsize gains for the Exchequer in anti-avoidance provisions. And by freezing allowances the Chancellor inevitably brings more people into the tax net, which is hardly desirable, even if the political consequences are not particularly harmful. None of this means that the specific measures in Mr Clarke's package are without their individual merits. The cuts in employers' national insurance contributions are a modest start in addressing a genuine labour market problem, by making it easier for employers to take on more people. There is no doubt administrative logic, as well as cost savings, in the decision to combine the operations of income support and unemployment benefit. And while the credit for introducing resource accounting into Whitehall really lies with Mr Clarke's predecessors, it is no less welcome for that. A more sophisticated approach to accounting for public sector capital spending has been long overdue. At least Mr Clarke has been prepared to risk unpopularity as well as to court approval from groups such as pensioners whose problems with VAT on domestic fuel have been addressed with specific palliatives. It is not merely the novel decision to announce continuing 3 per cent increases on tobacco excise in real terms. Equalising the pension age at 65 will alienate many female voters under the age of 40. By far the most interesting omission was the failure to impose a further cut in the tax credit on dividends received by pension funds. Clearly the pensions lobby has scored a victory in the short term. But in the longer run the chancellor has entrusted his financial secretary Mr Stephen Dorrell with a review that will look into the impact of taxation on savings. That is overdue - not least because Mr Lamont's attack on the pension funds removed all coherence from one of the few parts of the income tax system that made much sense. The one thing that is clear from both the cuts in reliefs and allowances, and the new taxes such as the one on insurance premiums, is that Mr Clarke has left himself considerable latitude to raise more from tax in future. Fiscal brutalism might be the appropriate motto for a Budget that very much reflects the man.</p>

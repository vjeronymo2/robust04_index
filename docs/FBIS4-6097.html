			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata indirectly called on veteran conservative politician Michio  Watanabe on Monday [18 April] to leave the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) to break the political stalemate. Hata said at a  press conference that it is up to Watanabe himself to decide on  his actions but things will not "make progress if he is within  the LDP."    Watanabe, a former foreign minister, said Sunday he will  leave the LDP as early as Monday, hoping to run for the  premiership following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  announcement that he will resign.    However, Watanabe, in talks with LDP President Yohei Kono  earlier in the day, said he still needs more time to decide  whether he will leave the main opposition party. Hata said if  Watanabe, 70, had decided on his actions earlier, he could have  won "understanding from various people."    Hata was apparently referring to a number of LDP members who  were thinking about following Watanabe in leaving the LDP,  delivering a serious blow to the party.    Hata is considered the top candidate to become the next  prime  minister.</p>

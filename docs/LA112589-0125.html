			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: WHAT'S IN A NAME -- AND A DECADE?  </P> <P> An editor for one of those trend-setting, Manhattan-based glossy women's  magazines called with a question:  </P> <P> What did I think would be a good name for the '90s?  </P> <P> I thought I might have misunderstood. "The '90s haven't even started yet," I  said.  </P> <P> "We know that," she said. "But we are asking several people to come up with a  name for it."  </P> <P> "What kind of a name?" I said.  </P> <P> "Anything you want to name it," she said. "Sort of like the 'Me Decade,' but  for the '90s."  </P> <P> "No one even has any idea what's going to happen in the '90s," I said. "Usually  people wait until a decade is over -- or at least until it's been around for a  few years -- to give it a name."  </P> <P> "Yes, but we want to get this into our January, 1990 issue," she said.  </P> <P> I began to understand. In this hurry-up world of intense media competition, no  one wants to be last -- or even second -- to hit the airwaves or the public  prints with a concept. Granted, no one has any idea what the '90s will be like,  but if you wait until 1998 or 1999 to name the decade, you're going to be  standing at the end of a very long line.  </P> <P> Which brings us to the real point here: if you think of the '90s as a person,  you've got to feel a little sorry for the poor guy. Born into a world he never  made, he's facing disadvantages that the decades preceding him could not have  even imagined.  </P> <P> Most decades are allowed to be born, to feel their way around for a couple of  years, to develop a personality, to mature and then to fade peacefully away.  The '90s, though, are going to have to hit the ground running. As a matter of  fact -- thinking again of the '90s as a person -- this poor baby has been  forced to sprint full speed while he is still in the womb. I think it was 1987,  maybe 1988, when magazines started heralding "the end of the '80s." The decade  was over, or so we were told, even though the calendar indicated otherwise.  </P> <P> Part of this was based on societal trends; the pundits had decided that greed  and ruthless acquisitiveness, which they associated with the '80s, were going  out of fashion -- a questionable assertion at best, but one from which the deep  thinkers extrapolated the idea that not only was greed dead, but so was the  whole decade. Thus, for the last couple of years, we seem to have been living  in the '90s -- or so you would believe if you keep up with the popular press.  </P> <P> Any new performer, politician, or "personality" who comes along is referred to  as "the (pick your noun) of the '90s." No matter that we're not there yet. The  most obvious example is Arsenio Hall, who has been called "the talk-show host  of the '90s" so many times that he would have every right to dread the stroke  of midnight this New Year's Eve. Having been credited with conquering the '90s  before the decade is even a day old, Hall has nothing to gain and everything to  lose when the first day of 1990 actually rolls around.  </P> <P> The same with the Oakland A's ("the baseball team of the '90s"), Michelle  Pfeiffer ("the actress of the '90s"), Infiniti ("the car of the '90s") and all  of the other people, places and things who have, before the fact, been chosen  to epitomize the decade. They are all part of an era that has become so  impatient with today that tomorrow must be willed into existence well in  advance.  </P> <P> Save your true compassion, though, for the '90s itself. Thinking of the decade  once more as a person, the poor, puzzled fellow is going to arrive right on  schedule -- only to be greeted by a nation that will gaze upon him and think,  "You again?" The '90s have been with us in spirit for so many months now that  when the decade actually shows up, much of the country will be bored with it  without knowing precisely why.  </P> <P> But back to the magazine editor from Manhattan, and her request for a name for  the '90s. She did not seem interested in hearing reasons why it makes no sense  to name a decade before the decade starts; she seemed interested in getting a  name for it. Just doing her job.  </P> <P> "All right," I said. "The '90s is the last decade of the century, right?"  </P> <P> "That's right," she said.  </P> <P> "Then how about something along the lines of 'Get Us Out of Here'?" I said.  </P> <P> "The 'Get Us Out of Here Decade'?" she said.  </P> <P> "It's just a thought," I said. Happy New Year, everybody.  </P></p>

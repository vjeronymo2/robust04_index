			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Nigerian contender agrees to stay away NIGERIA'S interim government said last night the thwarted presidential contender Moshood Abiola had agreed not to return home as planned so as not to disrupt public order, Reuter reports from Abuja. A statement said Mr Abiola had agreed not to return tomorrow as planned after contacts with interim head of state Ernest Shonekan. Earlier, Nigeria's electoral commission and the country's two political parties agreed to hold a fresh presidential poll on February 19, just over a month before the military-appointed interim government is due to relinquish power. The statement said: 'Both men agreed the progressive return of normalcy is essential for the political and economic wellbeing of Nigeria, and anything that will disrupt the peace should therefore be avoided.' Mr Abiola, regarded as the winner of a June 12 presidential election annulled by former military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida, has been abroad mobilising support for his claim to the presidency.</p>

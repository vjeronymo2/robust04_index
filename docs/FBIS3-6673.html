Kim Ki-nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the  Workers' Party of Korea, in his speech at the meeting said that  Yi In-mo's return to the socialist homeland with an unshakable  faith and will for the party and the leader was a historical  event which demonstrated the brilliant victory of Korean-style  socialism centred on the popular masses over capitalism.    "Yi In-mo could fight resolutely with an unshakable faith in  the party and the leader, unflinchingly defending the principle  of a member of the Workers' Party of Korea, not yielding to the  sufferings in prison for 34 years in South Korea, because he  revered the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the mental pillars of the Korean  people, the speaker said, and stressed:    "Through Yi's destiny, the Korean people have become more  convinced and keenly felt that the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il is the destiny of our country and nation, the destiny  of socialism and a great symbol of all our victory, glory and  happiness".    Yi In-mo said that it is the dear leader who has brought him  back to life from the jaw of death and extended warm thanks to  the dear leader who has brought him the happiness today. He  said he came to the meeting with a floral basket, wishing the  great leader President Kim Il-song and general Kim Chong-il a  long life in good health.    Yi Hyon-ok, daughter of Yi In-mo, referring to the loving  care shown by the dear leader to her father, said that the dear  leader is the destiny and a tender-hearted father of all our  people.    Yi In-mo and his family sang a song overflowing with deepest  reverence for the dear leader to the accompaniment of the piano  sent by him.    Poems written by Yi In-mo in praise of the greatness of  general Kim Chong-il were read at the meeting.    Anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and workers, farmers,  youths and students of the new generation present at the meeting  said that they would defend and glorify Korean-style socialism,  loudly singing the song of faith that we would certainly win in  any difficulty because we are guided by supreme commander  general Kim Chong-il.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- American professor of  Chicago University Bruce Cumings said at an academic seminar on  the theme of "nuclear war crisis in Asia" that the United States  should strive to pull nuclear weapons out of South Korea with  the responsibility for its introduction according to NEW KOREA  TIMES, a paper of overseas Koreans.    It is, he said, for a political purpose to keep up the cold  war in the Korean peninsula that the United States is putting  pressure on North Korea while keeping itself from making an  official utterance on the introduction of nuclear weapons in  South Korea.    Criticising the one-sided press attitude of the American  media gossiping about "nuclear suspicion" in North Korea, the  professor said that for the elimination of nuclear arms in the  Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification, it is  preferential to have a correct understanding of the starting of  the June 25 war, the U.S.-South Korean military tieup, the South  Korean authorities' attitude towards the North, etc.    It is proper for the United States to solve the "nuclear  issue" by means of dialogue with North Korea, not by military  means, he stressed.</p>

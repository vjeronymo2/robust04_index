			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: Lucerne Easter Festival Is there room for yet another event on Europe's crowded festival map? The answer after the inaugural Lucerne Easter Festival must be a guarded 'yes'. Long ago, Lucerne boasted a lively tradition of Passion plays at Easter, dating back to the Middle Ages. Over the past 50 years it has developed one of the most successful summer music festivals. The new festival aims to build on these twin pillars. The danger was that it would turn out to be nothing more than a miniature replica of the summer event - or worse, a copy of Salzburg's Easter Festival, which has little to do with the people of Salzburg and even less to do with Easter. Lucerne has avoided that. After an initial tussle with the city's church and musical establishment - which feared that its own Easter celebrations would be overshadowed - the festival drew up a programme which struck a balance between local and international forces, between spiritual and secular. The first part, from Maundy Thursday to Easter Sunday, was devoted to sacred music, shared among Lucerne's magnificent churches and in some cases dovetailed into Easter worship (and therefore free). Philippe Herreweghe conducted a period instrument performance of the St Matthew Passion, and Andrew Parrott a Schutz programme. Local forces contributed Honegger's early Easter Cantata, suggesting that Switzerland at least is not ignoring his centenary. This contrasted with the final three evenings of expensive concerts in the Kunsthaus, where the London Symphony Orchestra under Mariss Jansons and Michael Tilson Thomas explored the more earthly visions of Honegger's Pacific 231, Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique and Mahler's First Symphony. The centrepoint of the festival was an Easter Vigil in the Hofkirche, a twin-spired Roman Catholic church with the architectural dimensions and acoustical spaciousness of a Gothic-Romanesque cathedral. Guillaume de Machaut's 14th century Messe de Nostre Dame formed the main structure of the service, interspersed with extracts from Messiaen's Messe de la Pentecote for organ and a selection of 12th century songs by Hildegard von Bingen (the latter evoking the same mystical spirit as the birdsong in the Messiaen). For those primarily interested in its devotional aspect, this was a mass of unusually pure musical dimensions. The four voices of the Taverner Consort, filling the darkened nave in the solemn opening Kyrie, showed their mastery of Machaut's unpredictable rhythms and harmonic modulations. Emily van Evera delivered Hildegard's unaccompanied songs with the same simple radiance as the candles held by the congregation. The priest, Father Gerold Beck, was in no way outclassed in his vocalisation of the Gregorian Lumen Christi, and of course the crowded congregation were able to join in the sung responses. For those who went for the music alone, the benefit of hearing it in this atmospheric, incense-filled context was offset by the amount of liturgy on offer - the service lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours - and Machaut's Gloria was spoilt by the simultaneous clanging of church bells. A work commissioned from the avant-garde Swiss composer Klaus Huber did not materialise, and Krzysztof Penderecki's new Benedicamus Domino was so short and self-effacing as to be indistinguishable from the Machaut. And yet this was a genuine Easter celebration. The new festival director, Matthias Bamert, will doubtless want to explore a much wider spectrum of Easter activity in future, perhaps embracing scenic oratorio, church opera, dance and even film. But a useful start has been made. The production is sponsored by Swissair and American Express.</p>

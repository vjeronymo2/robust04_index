			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Plants may be left out of Daf rescue THE DUTCH and Belgian operations of Daf, Western Europe's sixth-largest truckmaker, may be demerged into a specially created company, financed by local banks and the Dutch government. The UK operations would not be transferred to the new company, senior bankers said yesterday. Much of the UK's operations, which employ 5,500 people, could close. Bankers said that the main truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire might be sold to management, but the Birmingham van plant and Glasgow axle plant were at risk. They added that Daf's administrators - appointed on Tuesday under Dutch insolvency law - are working on the demerger proposal with local bankers and government officials. Any demerger would need to be approved by the group's banks, principally a consortium of nine led by the Dutch bank, ABN Amro. A formal proposal should be submitted in the next three weeks. New startling details also emerged yesterday about the extent of the truckmaker's financial problems. A confidential report by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, prepared for Daf in the past few weeks, estimated that the company's 1992 losses were in excess of Fl800m (Pounds 304m). Coopers was studying the financial implications of a restructuring plan based on work by both Daf and the consultants Arthur D. Little. Under this plan, Daf would have abandoned van manufacturing and sought an outside partner in light trucks. Vans are made at a Birmingham plant with 2,000 employees and light trucks are assembled at the Leyland plant, which has 2,200 employees. The biggest portion of last year's estimated loss stemmed from Coopers' estimate that the company should make a charge of Fl580m to cover the costs of restructuring its operations. Trading losses were more than Fl200m. In order to carry out the reconstruction, Coopers estimated that Daf needed to raise Fl800m of new finance in 1993. In 1994, a further Fl500m would have been needed plus another Fl250m in 1995. Under the rescue plan, this external finance would have come from three main sources: Daf's commercial banks. The Dutch government and the Flemish regional authorities. Holders of Daf's preference shares and debentures. The scale of the new money required demonstrates why three UK banks and Generale de Banque of Belgium refused on Monday to accede to a last-minute demand from the Dutch and Flemish governments that the main providers of finance should back the medium-term rescue plan. These banks - whose UK members are National Westminster, Lloyds and Barclays  -were prepared to put up funds only for the businesses' immediate requirements. But they repeated their earlier demand that outside accountants should verify Coopers' hastily prepared estimates of Daf's future financing needs. Not all the new money would have come in the form of new bank loans. Much of it would have been conversions of debt into equity or injections from the two governments. Nevertheless, banks had already lent Fl900m to Daf's manufacturing operations, plus a further Fl2bn to its finance companies. They were therefore reluctant to give a commitment to put in hundreds of millions more, until they knew how much was required. Coopers said that if the restructuring was carried out, Daf would break even in the current year. It also forecast a profit of Fl150m in 1994 and profits of Fl200m in 1995. The proposed restructuring was radical. In order to keep Daf's 1,300-strong dealer network supplied with light commercial vehicles, the company had planned to seek to purchase vans from another producer and then re-badge them with the Daf name. The Little study also concluded that Daf's position in the light truck market was not strong enough to justify continuing to make these vehicles on its own in Lancashire. Daf would have searched for another partner in this business, such as MAN of Germany or possibly Mercedes-Benz. Talks had been taking place with Mercedes-Benz since last autumn about a possible exchange of components or products. However, the study concluded that Daf had a strong position in heavy and medium size trucks and that an independent future manufacturing these was possible. It recommended that the company should buy a greater proportion of its components and parts from outside manufacturers and should abandon its integrated approach to manufacturing - it makes its own engines and axles. Little said that in general the company needed to change the emphasis of the business from volume manufacturing to profitability. The restructuring proposals stemmed from a general analysis of Daf's strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses included the following: Daf is the smallest of the full-line truck makers in Europe and the only non-car maker with a van line. It is too dependent on the UK, where margins on big trucks are the slimmest in Europe and which has been hardest hit by the recession. Its presence in Germany is far too small. It tries to make too wide a range. As a result, the investment programme required to keep it competitive is far too expensive, given its limited financial resources. Its interest burden, running at around Fl20m a year, is too high. On the other hand, some strengths were listed: It has the second newest range of truck models in Europe after Iveco (though this advantage is about to disappear, as rivals introduce new models). It is relatively good at serving customers, with an effective sales/service network. Though sales volumes have slumped, margins have held up relatively well. Daf also confirmed yesterday that it had received a short-term bridging loan from its banks and the Dutch government to allow it to continue trading for a month. It has received a loan of more than Fl100m, including Fl60m from the banking consortium. Mr John Talbot, the administrative receiver for Leyland Daf in the UK, is expected to meet the Dutch administrators for the first time today in the Netherlands.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Unofficial reports have stated that Paraguayan  Foreign Minister Dr. Luis Maria Boettner Ramirez and Uruguayan  Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla have drawn up a bilateral  policy for Mercosur [Common Market of the South] to partly  counterbalance the differences existing with Argentina and  Brazil. Yesterday, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Dr. Luis Maria  Boettner Ramirez denied, however, that Paraguay and Uruguay have  formed a front or drawn up regional strategies.    Negotiations to establish a common external tariff have  exposed disagreements among the four Mercosur countries.  Paraguay and Uruguay want low tariffs to develop their  old-fashioned industries while Brazil prefers to keep high  tariffs to protect their high technological production.  Argentina is pursuing an intermediate and rather reconciliatory  stance.    Three significant meetings to discuss the common external  tariff issue are planned. The economy vice ministers of the  four Mercosur countries will meet on 17 June, the Mercosur  foreign ministers will meet on 9 July, and the presidents of the  signatory countries will meet on 10 July.    With this in mind, it was unofficially mentioned that  Paraguayan and Uruguayan officials, headed by their respective  foreign ministers, have drawn up a bilateral policy to  counterbalance the Brazilian stance of keeping their tariffs  high. During the most recent meeting on 9 May in Buenos Aires,  representatives of Itamar Franco's administration were  unyielding on reducing their tariffs.    The Uruguayan foreign minister returned to Montevideo  yesterday. He denied that his visit to Paraguay was specifically  to form a bilateral bloc within Mercosur. He noted that his  visit to our country sought to enhance bilateral trade. He  added that when Mercosur was discussed, they sought to enhance  the integration process, bearing in mind that it will be  implemented within seven months (on 1 January 1995).    Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner agreed with his Uruguayan  counterpart. He said they thoroughly reviewed bilateral  economic issues. The Paraguayan foreign minister added: "This  is why our talks, which have been extremely useful, lasted two  days (24 and 25 May). I believe that on very few occasions have  we thoroughly reviewed all bilateral and multilateral issues."    The Paraguayan foreign minister noted that when Mercosur was  discussed, an effort was made to strengthen it because a  political decision has been made by the four governments to  implement the integration process. He said: "We have combined  strategies, but in no way have any blocs been formed between our  countries. We are all together in the Mercosur."</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures mostly marked time in line with the cash market, drifting slightly higher in continued low trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown. There were 10,862 contracts, up from 8,091 on Monday. But some 2,000 of this was spread trading as investors moved from the December to the March contract, so underlying volume was little changed. At the official 4.10pm close the FT-SE 100 December contract had clawed back above the 3,070 critical chart level to end at 3,072, up 11 points. The premium to the cash market was 10 points, with fair value around 7.5 points. There was some excitment in the early morning when the market appeared to take a serious run at cash equities on the back of rumours of an imminent rise for base rates. But this fizzled out by mid-morning and the session took on a slightly unreal atmosphere with very little business being done either way. However, sentiment picked up towards the close, with Wall Street showing signs of a strong rally, and traders were hopeful of continued upward momemtum today. Turnover in traded options rose to 28,478 lots after 21,113 on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business totalled 16,500 lots. Lonrho stood out among individual stock options with 4,230 dealt. Cable and Wireless and ICI were active.</p>

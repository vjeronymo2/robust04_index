			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASURE M'S IMPACT ON COUNTY'S TRAFFIC, TAXES  </P> <P> Sharen Heath opposes Measure M (Oct. 22) because it uses a sales tax to raise  revenue instead of a gas tax.  </P> <P> I agree that we should be paying for streets, roads and highways with an  increase in the gas tax. But does she realize that it would take about a  50-cent increase, (up from the present 9 cents per gallon), to raise the same  amount of money as a half-cent sales tax increase? I think anyone would  recognize that a 50-cent increase in the gas tax for Orange County alone would  place an intolerable burden on our retailers of gasoline.  </P> <P> I am a strong advocate of an increased gas tax at the state level. This does  not mean that Orange County can fail to pay its fair share. We are surrounded  by counties that have already enacted a half-cent sales tax for transportation.  We will be unable to compete for state and federal matching funds if we defeat  Measure M.  </P> <P> California was once a leader in transportation in the nation. We are now ranked  50th, the bottom, in per capita spending for transportation. Orange County  ranks 43rd out of 58 counties in the state in per capita spending. It is time  to stop blaming others, assume responsibility and pay for what we get. So far  we have paid for congestion and a disintegrating infrastructure.  </P> <P> FLORENCE CAVILEER  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

A special HOSPODARSKE NOVINY correspondent in Brussels spoke  with Sir Leon Brittan, the present deputy chairman of the  European Commission and commissioner for trade, about the  relations between the Twelve and the states of Central and East  Europe and about the prospects for an eastward expansion of the  EU.    [Sklenka] It has been frequently heard that, while on the  one hand the EU officially calls for trade cooperation, on the  other hand it closes its markets. Particularly now, at the time  of an economic recession, criticism is often heard from the East  of the protectionist trade policy not only of the Union but of  all the advanced industrial countries in general. How does  Brussels intend to help this region without harming the West  European economies?    [Brittan] The liberation of trade exchange has increased  markedly the volume of mutual trade, which undoubtedly can be  regarded as favorable. At the same time, however, it burdened  the balance of the East with a substantial deficit. From the  point of view of stability in this part of Europe, this adverse  trend is a very dangerous phenomenon. The EU endeavors to aid  the economic and political transformation in Central and East  Europe by all available means. Our hope is to reinforce  concurrently political and economic relations in harmony with  the integrated European policy of the Union that already  incorporates the entire Central and East European region.    [Sklenka] Nevertheless, it seems as if the EU lacks a  sufficiently clear strategy of expanding cooperation with  Central and East European countries, a will to open itself more  to these countries.    [Brittan] The development of any type of closer cooperation  in the spheres of the economy, politics, trade, or culture is  clearly defined in the association treaties and in the statement  of last year's Copenhagen EU summit. To date, the Union has  signed six of these treaties, and the Polish and Hungarian ones  went into effect in February. It is well known that these  documents, which are the first step of the associated states  toward full membership in the EU, have an asymmetric character  in the trade sphere, which gives an advantage to the East  European countries.    [Sklenka] Under the present conditions of a global economic  recession, however, the expansion of trade relations frequently  leads to accusations raised against the East European countries  by the EU of so-called social dumping, and their access to the  markets is even hindered.    [Brittan] It is necessary to find a model of trade and  economic cooperation that would enable East Europe to take  advantage, above all, of its natural advantages resulting from  low wages and production costs. On the other hand, the Union  must protect itself against unfair competition, exports of  commodities which frequently are subsidized disproportionately  at home. This refers particularly to the so-called sensitive  sphere, like agriculture, for instance, or steel and textile  manufacture, where we are still searching for a common language.  Under the conditions of an economic downturn and generally  growing unemployment, exports of such items to the EU further  disturb the generally valid principles of free economic  competition in the common market, and therefore must be subject  to antidumping arbitration, customs surcharges, or other forms  of protection.    [Sklenka] Regarding the entry itself of these countries into  the EU, is there a clear idea of their gradual integration into  the Brussels organization?    [Brittan] The point of departure for the EU is the idea of  building a joint federal Europe. Although for the time being we  approach the East European states as a single group -- because  under present circumstances and with respect to their past it  simplifies and accelerates the process of joining the East with  the EU -- the actual talks about the entry of each individual  country undoubtedly will take place separately. It will depend  a lot on their economic and social development.    [Sklenka] How important is the speed of submitting the  official application?    [Brittan] The application for admission to the EU is only a  partial step towards full membership. The acceptance of new EU  members will not depend on the date of the application but  rather on the readiness of the particular country, i.e., on the  fulfillment of preset conditions beginning with the  stabilization of a pluralistic democracy and a market economy  through the observance of human rights and rights of ethnic  minorities, reform of the present legislation, and ending with  the fulfillment of the convergence macroeconomic criteria. It  is obvious from this vantage point that the entry of these  countries will probably differ in time. One can already see  quite a marked difference in the progress of the reforms in the  Czech Republic as compared to some other countries.    [Sklenka] The culminating talks on the expansion of the EU  by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway indicate that the main  problem remains, above all, the institutional questions. Is an  estimate possible of the date for the expansion of the EU  eastwards?    [Brittan] It is not the same thing to maintain the viability  of the organization with 16 or 24 members as in its present  12-member composition. One has to start from the assumption,  however, that a start of any official talks regarding the entry  of the East European countries is completely unrealistic before  1966, when an EU intergovernmental conference will take place,  which is to determine further proceeding in the expansion of the  EU eastwards. Their admission as full members will be possible  somewhere around the year 2000. Nevertheless, it cannot be  ruled out that time will require the establishment of an  intermediate stage between associate and full memberships for  those who satisfy all the preset conditions first.</p>

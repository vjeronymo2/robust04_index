			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES TO LIMIT CONTEMPT JAILINGS  </P> <P> The Senate voted to limit civil contempt of court jailings in the District of  Columbia, a measure designed to free a mother jailed more than two years in a  child custody dispute. The bill, drawn to deal with the case of Dr. Elizabeth  Morgan, was passed by the House on Wednesday and now goes to President Bush.  Rep. Stan Parris (R-Va.), who introduced the latest version of the measure,  said: "I haven't spoken directly with the President, but we're told he is  sympathetic and that the White House staff will encourage him to sign it." The  case that inspired the bill involves a mother who was sent to jail in August,  1987, after refusing a judge's order to produce her daughter, Hilary, for  court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, her ex-husband and the girl's  father. Morgan has alleged that Foretich sexually abused the girl. Foretich has  denied those charges.  </P></p>

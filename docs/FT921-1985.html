			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sheafbank incurs Pounds 993,000 loss Sheafbank Property Trust, the property investment and financial services group, ran up a loss of Pounds 992,778 pre-tax for the year to March 1991 after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 950,000. The delayed results compared with profits of Pounds 500,891 for the 1989-90 year. The exceptional item represented a provision against the carrying value of the company's investments in financial services. The delayed results were due to changes on the board which took effect following the year-end and the inclusion of audited information on major corporate investments. As a consequence, the directors are recommending that the current accounting period should cover the 15 months to end-June 1992. Losses per share emerged at 6.19p (earnings 2.48p). A final dividend of 0.1p makes a 0.2p (0.75p) total.</p>

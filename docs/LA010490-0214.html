			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'ISLAND SON' UNDERGOING SOME SURGERY  </P> <P> Richard Chamberlain's Hawaii-based medical series is undergoing cosmetic  surgery to make it more attractive to the audience.  </P> <P> In the near future, his character of Dr. Daniel Kulani in "Island Son" will  spend more time away from the hospital and become more involved with people.  </P> <P> The CBS show also has new opening credits and new music. That went into effect  when "Island Son" moved from Tuesday to Thursday in mid-December.  </P> <P> "When we go back into production after the first of the year, we'll open up the  show and spend more time out of the hospital," said Chamberlain late last  month. "You'll see those changes around February."  </P> <P> Chamberlain said this will take "Island Son" closer to its original concept of  a man who was educated in modern medicine yet still honors the Hawaii  traditions and folk medicine of his upbringing.  </P> <P> "These are things we've been asking for for a long time," he said. "The drop in  the ratings seems to support me.  </P> <P> "Even doctors have a life outside the hospital, which may come as a surprise to  some people. I'll be involved in closer relationships with the residents, and  some surprising things will happen in my life. My ex-wife is going to come back  and cause me some severe emotional difficulties."  </P> <P> Besides family and human relations, the show will have fast cars and martial  arts.  </P></p>

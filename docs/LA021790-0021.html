			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY HAVE POINTS TO MAKE AFTER 102-24 PREP GAME  </P> <P> Mike Downey's column defending the South Torrance coach illustrates that he  knows nothing about Ocean League girls' basketball. Morningside, a perennial  girls' power, is stuck in the extremely weak conference.  </P> <P> It's not its fault it has incredible talent such as Lisa Leslie.  </P> <P> Morningside shows mercy all season, every season, against every ailing league  opponent. This is the first time Coach Scott actually let his team loose in  league play this season. They're going to the playoffs, Mike, and they have to  practice going hard.  </P> <P> It is truly pathetic when a hotshot columnist at the Times writes about a team  he knows nothing about and probably hasn't even seen play, just because  something big like this happens.  </P> <P> TARA FLANAGAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and Fung Wai-Kong] </F>   [Text] China could promise in principle to grant land  along the airport railway for auction, but it should be included  in the annual disposal programme, senior Chinese representative  of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, Guo Fengmin, said  yesterday.    Britain wants to see the 62 hectares granted in one go.    "We have adopted a positive attitude towards the land  disposal programme. But this is not what they called granting  in one go," Mr Guo said.    The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, Lu Ping, has said China can agree to grant the  land along the airport railway over the next three years.  However the final annual land grant had to be approved by the  Land Commission.    But Mr Guo was optimistic. "I think an agreement will be  reached very soon," he said.    Pressure for a deal will increase next week, when the  influential Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce visits Beijing  to put across the importance of an early agreement on the  airport's financing.    "We will explain the adverse impact on the Hong Kong economy  and that of southern China by delays to Hong Kong's vital  infrastructure projects," said the leader of the delegation Paul  Cheng Ming-fun.    Delay in the completion of Chek Lap Kok would result in lost  revenue of $5.8 billion in 1997 alone, he said. The chamber  will also argue for an early decision on the construction of  Container Terminal No 9.    Mr Cheng said growing concerns about the slow progress of  the work of the Joint Liaison Group, especially on the  localisation of Hong Kong laws, would also be raised.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from Dinh Khai in Rangoon] </F>   [Text] Dear friends: Senior General Prime Minister Than  Shwe and his wife gave a grand banquet on the evening of 11  April in the capital city of Rangoon in honor of Prime Minister  Vo Van Kiet, his wife, and members of our government delegation  on their official friendship visit to the Union of Myanmar  [Burma]. Also attending the function on the Myanmar side were  Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw and many high-ranking Myamar  government officials.    In his speech at the banquet, Prime Minister Than Shwe said:  [Begin Than Shwe recording, in Burmese fading into Vietnamese  translation] Your Excellency Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Madame  Vo Van Kiet, distinguished guests, and friends: On behalf of the  people and government of the Union of Myanmar, I would like to  extend our warmest greetings to His Excellency Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet and distinguished members of the Vietnamese delegation.  My wife and I are honored and pleased to welcome the delegation  headed by Your Excellency on its visit to Myanmar and to host  this banquet in honor of Your Excellency.    The Union of Myanmar and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam  [SRV] are two regional countries linked by traditional  friendship. From the efforts made by leaders of both countries  to restore independence, we still remember the lasting  friendship fostered through the traditions of mutual assistance  and understanding. During the Cold War era, ours were among the  developing countries that participated in the Nonaligned  Movement [NAM]. We have shared similar views on regional and  international issues. We have also shared almost similar views  on ways of building each country into a modern nation, while at  the same time making efforts to improve the people's living  standards and contributing to regional stability.    Now that agricultural countries have shifted to  market-oriented economies, I follow with keen interest the  considerable achievements by Vietnam within a short time in the  framework of its market-oriented economic policy. The  application of knowledge acquired from each country's  experiences and the promotion of cooperation for mutual benefit  will help us bring about lasting stability and prosperity in  each country, and thereby contributing to regional prosperity.    Your Excellency: The relations between Vietnam and Myanmar  are based on friendship, goodwill, and mutual understanding.  Those relations have been consolidated and strengthened through  exchanges of visits by leaders of our two countries. I am  convinced that your visit will further consolidate the existing  friendly ties between our two countries. I am pleased to say  that during your current visit, we can exchange views on  regional and international issues of common concern. I am  positive that through straightforward and open-minded exchanges  of views, we can further enhance the traditions of mutual  respect, mutual understanding, and friendship between our two  countries. Based on that willingness to share, the traditions  of mutual assistance, goodwill, mutual understanding, and  cooperation will become dynamic in our Southeast Asian region.  Prompted by that spirit of mutual assistance, let us be  determined to work toward the birth of modern and prosperous  countries.    Excellencies, distinguished guests, and dear friends: I  would  like to invite you to a toast to the lasting friendship between  the Union of Myanmar and the SRV as well as for the good health  and happiness of His Excellency Le Duc Anh, president of the  SRV; His Excellency Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his wife, our  distinguished guests; and all of our distinguished guests and  friends present here this evening. [end recording]    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet then delivered his reply speech.  He said:    [Begin Vo Van Kiet recording] Your Excellency Prime  Minister,  ladies and gentlemen: I am delighted to make my first visit to  the friendly neighboring country of Myanmar, a country with a  rich cultural heritage reflected in the well-known Golden  Temple, and to meet the warm-hearted, diligent, and friendly  people of Myanmar. I am deeply moved at the memory of our late  beloved leader President Ho Chi Minh, who visited your country  36 years ago and opened a new stage for the relationship between  our countries. I would like to express our sincere gratitude  for the warm and solemn reception that Your Excellency Prime  Minister and Madame Than Shwe and the people of Myanmar have  given me and my delegation in our official and friendly visit to  Myanmar. I would also like to thank Your Excellency for your  fine statement about the country and people of Vietnam, as well  as on the traditional and friendly relations between the two  peoples.    Vietnam and Myanmar are both located in Southeastern Asia  and  share numerous similarities in culture and history. The two  peoples have traditional, long-lasting relations during our  struggles for independence. People of Vietnam never forget the  valuable support that the government and people of Myanmar gave  us from the very early years when our republic was still in its  infancy. Rangoon was the first gateway for Vietnam to reach the  rest of the world during the time Vietnam was isolated during  the 1940's. Vietnam and Myanmar were shoulder to shoulder in  the Afro-Asia Solidarity Movement against colonialism during the  1950's. We are happy to see that in the new situation, our fine  traditional relations, which had always been heartily fostered  by the two peoples, are now developing along with our sincere  cooperation in the aim to bring prosperity for each of our  countries. I share with you the joy of seeing the great pace of  positive changes which are taking place in your beautiful  country, and I sincerely wish the people of the Union of Myanmar  stability and prosperity.    In recent years, with our correct renovation policy, the  people of Vietnam have made important achievements, and are now  entering the first stage of industrialization and modernization  aimed at reaching the objectives of being a wealthy people, a  powerful country, and an equitable and civilized society. Our  achievements are also closely connected with our independent,  self-reliant, open, and diversified foreign policy, with the  active cooperation of friends, far and near alike, including  Myanmar, a neighbor country which always have friendly  sentiments towards Vietnam.    On this occasion, I would like to affirm to Your Excellency  that the government and people of Vietnam always regard highly  the development of multi-faceted and friendly cooperation with  Myanmar on the basis of respect for independence, sovereignty,  non- interference in each other's internal affairs, equality,  and mutual benefit. We consider this a positive contribution to  the development of our countries and also an important  contribution to the cooperation developing in Southeast Asia.    I am pleased with the results of our meeting this afternoon,  and with our joint statement affirming the scope of cooperation  and direction for development of our relations, our trade  agreement, our tourism cooperation agreement, and our agreement  on establishment of the joint cooperation committee. I think  that this is an important new step in the relationship between  our countries, and I believe that our official visit to Myanmar  will contribute to further accelerating the friendship and  cooperation between our countries for the interests of the two  peoples, and for peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity  for Southeast Asia.    In this warm and friendly atmosphere today, I would like to  propose a toast for the happiness and prosperity of the people  of Myanmar, for the good health of Your Excellency Prime  Minister, Madame Than Shwe, and the leaders of Myanmar, and for  the ever-developing friendship and cooperation between Vietnam  and Myanmar, and for the good health of all guests and friends  [end recording].    Dear friends: After the solemn banquet, Prime Minister Vo  Van  Kiet, his wife, and members of our government delegation viewed  an interesting concert program performed by Burmese artists.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, THE INSIDER, WILL FORGO THE USUAL KITCHEN CABINET  </P> <P> Don't look for a Kitchen Cabinet from George Bush.  </P> <P> When Bush takes the oath of office today, he will become the first new  President in many years who will not have an inner circle of advisers -- former  business associates, card-playing cronies, Army buddies and the like -- who  serve as an informal but indispensable corps of non-governmental advisers.  </P> <P> Unlike Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, his two predecessors, Bush has himself  been a Washington insider for most of the past two decades. He has retained a  few friends from his earlier days as a Texas oilman -- notably James A. Baker  III, Nicholas F. Brady and Robert A. Mosbacher.  </P> <P> But they will be in the real Cabinet, not the Kitchen Cabinet: Baker as  secretary of state, Brady as Treasury secretary and Mosbacher as Commerce  secretary.  </P> <P> The close associates whom Bush has developed more recently have worked in his  vice presidential office and on his presidential campaign, and they too will be  part of the government. These include C. Boyden Gray, formerly counsel to the  vice president and soon to be chief White House counsel; David Bates, deputy  chief of the vice president's staff and soon to be Cabinet secretary; Chase  Untermeyer, a longtime personal aide who is soon to be personnel director, and  Andrew Card, a campaign operative who will be a top deputy to the White House  chief of staff.  </P> <P> "I don't see any evidence so far of any kind of insiders' group," said  Alexander B. Trowbridge Jr., head of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, a  longtime acquaintance of Bush's from the business world and a former Commerce  secretary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reflection of Style  </P> <P> "All the people he's picked for the main economic policy areas seem to have a  longstanding close relationship of trust with George Bush," Trowbridge said.  "These are people he's been talking to for years, and they've been on a  first-name basis with him for years. But they also know their way around  Washington and the ways of government. That makes a potent combination, and we  haven't had that for a while."  </P> <P> The absence of a distinct outside advisers clique is a reflection of Bush's  management style.  </P> <P> When Bush wants another viewpoint on an issue, he is more likely to call on a  wide array of acquaintances than a few longtime cronies, those close to him  say.  </P> <P> "He's a very open and approachable person," said Richard Rahn, chief economist  at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and husband of Bush's key speech writer, Peggy  Noonan. "He sure makes a lot of phone calls. He touches base with an enormous  number of people. That's always been his habit, and it was even more so in the  campaign. We're not going to have one of those presidencies where the man in  the White House cuts himself off. It won't be like Johnson, Nixon, Carter, even  Reagan -- who all had their barriers."  </P> <P> If Bush did have a Kitchen Cabinet, former White House National Security  Adviser Richard V. Allen said in an interview several months ago, "the numbers  would already be in three digits, maybe four."  </P> <P> That is a sharp departure from his immediate predecessors, who came to the  White House as outsiders intent on changing the Washington way of government,  and relied on longtime friends for advice on doing it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influence Over Appointments  </P> <P> Eight years ago, when Reagan swept into office promising to curb an entrenched  government bureaucracy, considerable influence was vested in a shadow cabinet  of conservative Western businessmen: Holmes Tuttle, Joseph Coors and Justin  Dart among them -- who provided suggestions and observations.  </P> <P> In fact, Reagan's pre-inaugural Kitchen Cabinet is believed to have been behind  some of the new President's initial Cabinet appointments.  </P> <P> During his term, Carter depended heavily on a tight inner circle, largely drawn  from the political and business world in Georgia, where he had been governor.  Some critics blamed the outsiders' sway for the problems Carter had in making  Washington's government machinery work for him.  </P> <P> The last previous elected chief executive before Carter, Richard M. Nixon,  plotted his moves with a coterie of Southern California public relations men  and political tacticians who were little known until the Watergate scandal  exposed his presidency's inner workings.  </P></p>

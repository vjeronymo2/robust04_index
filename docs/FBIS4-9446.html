			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 22 (BTA) -- "I am happy that my  appointment as Macedonia's first ambassador to Bulgaria  coincides with the visit by Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov,  which is an expression of the highest degree of good relations,"  the newly appointed Ambassador of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to Bulgaria, Georgi Spasov, told  a news conference today. The president of Macedonia will pay his  first official visit on April 25-26 this year at the invitation  of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev.    "The presidents of Bulgaria and Macedonia will consider the  situation in the Balkans after NATO's military intervention in  Bosnia Herzegovina and the acceleration of economic ties between  Bulgaria and Macedonia," Mr. Spasov said. In his opinion, there  is a high degree of agreement between Bulgaria and Macedonia  about the problems of all-Balkan policy. Asked about his  opinion on the idea of an all-Balkan peace conference, Mr.  Spasov stated that the peace conference idea is acceptable for  Macedonia, provided all the Balkan countries take part in it.    "The Macedonian president will come to Sofia accompanied by  the two vice presidents, Jovan Andov and Riste Ivanov," Mr.  Spasov said. "As the time for arranging the visit is short, the  experts will not be able to prepare the agreements on the  encouragement of investments and the avoidance of double  taxation for signing at a governmental level," he explained. In  Mr. Spasov's view, although the agreement on the construction of  a railway line between Bulgaria and Macedonia as part of the  East-West trans-Balkan highway will not be signed too, its  construction is expected to begin in May and be finished in  about a year. There is no railway between Bulgaria and  Macedonia, they are connected only by three motor roads.    Bulgaria and Macedonia raised their diplomatic relations to  the level of embassies in December last year. Until then they  had consulates general in Sofia and Skopje respectively.  Bulgaria was the first country in the world which recognized  Macedonia's independence in February 1992.</p>

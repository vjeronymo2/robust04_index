			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Scotland to upgrade Higher examination Scotland is to upgrade its Higher examination for secondary school leavers, James Buxton writes. The Higher is to be modified to include vocational subjects, and longer teaching time will be allocated to the exams, which pupils take one year after they sit the standard grade exam - equivalent to the English GCSE. There will also be a new advanced Higher involving a two-year course instead of the one-year Higher course. Pupils aiming at advanced Highers will not usually sit the normal Higher, making the advanced Higher somewhat similar to English A-levels. The changes, taking effect from 1997, were announced by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, in response to the 1992 report by Professor John Howie which said the Higher should be replaced for more academic pupils by a 'baccalaureate' which would provide greater depth and breadth.</p>

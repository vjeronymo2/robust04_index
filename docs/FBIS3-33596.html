			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Minister  Elcio Alvares estimates that the draft patent law, which will  regulate the protection of industrial property in the country,  will not be voted on by Congress until the second half of 1994.  The United States is threatening to impose trade sanctions on  Brazil if measures designed to protect industrial property are  not approved by 28 February.    The Brazilian Government is seeking to avert U.S.  retaliatory  measures by proposing amendments to the draft patent law, which  has been sitting in the Senate for eight months. Alvares is  scheduled to talk tomorrow with Senator Beni Veras (Brazilian  Social Democracy Party -- Ceara State), who was confirmed  yesterday as rapporteur of the draft law at the Senate Economic  Affairs Committee, to persuade him about the need to introduce  changes to the draft approved by the Chamber of Deputies in June  1993.</p>

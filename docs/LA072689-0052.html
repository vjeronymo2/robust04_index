			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS $60-BILLION DEBT CEILING HIKE  </P> <P> The Senate Finance Committee approved a $60-billion increase in the nation's  debt ceiling Tuesday, the first in two years, amid warnings that Social  Security and other benefits will not be paid in September if the increase is  rejected.  </P> <P> The panel approved a hike to $2.86 trillion from the current $2.8 trillion to  let the government pay its bills through Oct. 31. If the measure is approved by  the full Senate and House, the debt ceiling will have to be increased again  this fall.  </P> <P> Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) proposed the three-month rise  instead of an increase approved on May 17 by the House as part of its budget  plan. The House proposed increasing the ceiling by $322.7 billion to $3.12  trillion.  </P></p>

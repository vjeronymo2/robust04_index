			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 2 (XINHUA) -- Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet arrived here today on a two-day official  visit aimed at boosting friendly relations and cooperation  between the two countries.    A high-ranking Cambodian official said that Vo Van Kiet will  also discuss how to solve border and immigration issues with the  Cambodian leaders.    The Cambodian national radio reported today that the  Vietnamese side will make an emergency demand to the Cambodian  side that some 30,000 Vietnamese emigrants should be repatriated  to Cambodia. The Vietnamese emigrants fled to Vietnam from  Cambodia in March, 1993 and are currently gathering in two  countries' border areas.    As to the Cambodian-Vietnamese border issue, the Cambodian  Constitution provides that any solution should be based on the  Cambodian domain before the year of 1969.    Vo Van Kiet is visiting at the invitation of Norodom  Ranariddh and Hun Sen, co-prime ministers of the Royal Cambodian  Government which was formed in November last year.</p>

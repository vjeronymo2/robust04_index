			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: European bond unit trust - At a glance Barclays Unicorn is launching a new European Bond unit trust on Monday. It will be the first onshore unit trust aiming for total return rather than income to invest exclusively in European markets. According to BZW Investment Management, which will manage the trust, the high real yields available in Europe at present are attractive (see accompanying graph), and there is a hope of capital gain if yields converge towards German levels. The capital value of the fund should also benefit from cuts in German base rates, if and when they happen. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 30 per month. Initial charge is 3.5 per cent (with a 1 per cent discount during the offer period which lasts until January 29), and annual charges are 0.75 per cent. Income is distributed in March and September, and the projected initial yield is 3.5 per cent.</p>

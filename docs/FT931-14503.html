			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Butte agrees to ADollars 3.5m bid for Australian subsidiary BUTTE MINING, which is claiming damages of at least Dollars 325m (Pounds 214m) in the US against more than 70 former directors, advisers and investors, has agreed an ADollars 3.5m (Pounds 1.6m) offer for its 77 per cent-owned Australian subsidiary, Perserverance Corporation. The offer is from Central Queensland Gold Mine, which is 45 per cent-owned by Waverley Mining Finance, the Edinburgh-based investment company, with Westralian Resources Projects owning the rest. Waverley also owns 10 per cent of Westralian and 7 per cent of Butte. Butte and its other Australian subsidiary, VAM, have given irrevocable undertakings to accept, subject to there being no higher offer for Perserverance before CQGM's one of 12 cents a share becomes unconditional. Perserverance and VAM, two small gold mining companies, were taken over by Butte in 1990 and Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman of Butte, said if the CQGM offer succeeded, Butte would have to write off about Pounds 12m in connection with these acquisitions. However, the deal would relieve Butte of certain guarantees and the proceeds of the sale would be used to reduce indebtedness. Mr William McLucas, managing director of Waverley, said the deal would enable his company to get back most of a loan made to Butte.</p>

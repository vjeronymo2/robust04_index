			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with TEC member Joe Slovo by announcer Astrid </F> Ascar on the "Newsline" program -- live]    [Text] [Ascar] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] is  behind some of the moves as it today sent its delegation into  the area. Now to give us the TEC perspective we have in the  studio Mr. Joe Slovo. Good evening, Mr. Slovo, and welcome to  Newsline.    [Slovo] Good evening, Astrid.    [Ascar] Zam Titus of the TEC delegation said today that the  situation in the Ciskei is firmly in control. What do you  interpret that to mean?    [Slovo] I interpret it to mean that in contrast to  Bophuthatswana [Bop] in the early stages the process so far has  been a completely peaceful one, and we can only hope that it  remains a peaceful one. From the news reports, it seems that  the delegation from the TEC was well received, was welcomed, and  it bodes well for the coming few days.    [Ascar] What will the TEC's official response be to claims  that the ANC [African National Congress] and its affiliates are  attempting to purposefully destabilize the situation in  homelands and independent states that are not ANC affiliated?    [Slovo] The TEC has not addressed that question yet. Let me  give my own view, and that is that there is absolutely no  substance to that allegation. Neither in Bophuthatswana nor in  the Ciskei was the trigger of events based on any ANC  incitement. Indeed, in the case of the Ciskei. We were sitting  at the TEC yesterday afternoon and we received a request from  Mr. Mickey Webb on behalf of Brigadier Gqozo, asking the TEC to  take over the Ciskei. So I don't believe there is any substance  whatsoever in that suggestion.    [Ascar] To whom would the TEC be accountable?    [Slovo] Well, the TEC would be accountable in terms of its  powers under the act to the law, and to the people of the Ciskei  and to the people of South Africa.    [Ascar] There has been reports that the TEC would be able to  guarantee in some way or ensure that the pension funds will in  fact be there--people do not need to fear that they will lose  those funds after the elections. How will it ensure this?    [Slovo] Well, we had the same problem in Bophuthatswana. One  of the origins of the conflict there between the civil servants  and Mangope was precisely this point, and it spilt over into  other areas. We have managed to get across to the civil  servants in Bophuthatswana the perception -- which is a correct  perception -- that their pensions are guaranteed, their jobs are  guaranteed, and they need fear nothing from the transformation.  This is a problem which, of course, not only affects  Bophuthatswana and the Ciskei, but is simmering in many other  areas of South Africa and is obviously an issue which the TEC  will have to address in earnest.    [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, when you say it's simmering in many other  areas of South Africa, could I ask you to be more specific?    [Slovo] Well, one has heard reports of some activities in  Lebowa and other homelands, where the civil servants are  beginning to fear that perhaps the existing administrations will  either run off with their cash, with their pension funds, and  that there will be no guarantee that they will eventually get  what they expect to get and what they are entitled to get. And  I believe this problem is something which will have to be  addressed across the board.    [Ascar] Reports in the press today alluded to the TEC going  into kwaZulu. Will you be referring to kwaZulu at all?    [Slovo] Well, the TEC has not taken a decision to go into  kwaZulu. The TEC has taken a resolution calling upon the  kwaZulu government to allow free and fair election in its area  and calling upon them to allow all buildings, police stations,  etc., to be used for purposes of election and to allow the  Independent Electoral Commission to operate there as they are  operating in other parts of South Africa. No decision has been  taken by the TEC as to any specific action which will be taken.  And of course, depending upon the response of the kwaZulu  government, the whole question of what the TEC does about it  will have to be addressed and will have to be addressed very,  very urgently. Indeed, the management committee of the TEC is  meeting tomorrow afternoon to consider the kwaZulu response to  the Johann Kriegler delegation from the IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission] which is there today. I have not yet  heard a report of whether he has succeeded or not, but depending  on what the IEC says, the Transitional Executive Council and its  management committee will have to consider what action is  necessary in the circumstances.    [Ascar] All right, the TEC is considering what action will  be  necessary in kwaZulu. It did go into Bophuthatswana, and it has  gone into the Ciskei. Surely there is a pattern emerging here.    [Slovo] Not really, because in the Ciskei we were asked to  take over by Brig. Gqozo. In the case of Bophuthatswana, we  know that government had collapsed, the BDF [Bophuthatswana  Defense Force] and the police were in revolt, there was a  situation of chaos, and Mangope, if he ever had the confidence  of any section of the people, had lost it completely. The  situation was completely ungovernable, and it was necessary for  the TEC to do something about the citizens in that country  because they are South African citizens, and we were called  upon. It would have been utterly irresponsible for the TEC to  fold its arms and to do nothing about it. So there is no  pattern. The only pattern that is asserted by the TEC is a  pattern that every South African citizen -- whether in Bop or  whether in Ciskei or whether in kwaZulu has an absolute right to  take part in the election without hindrance, without [word  indistinct] by any authority. And that applies to Bop, to  Ciskei, and must apply to kwaZulu as well.    [Ascar] Does the TEC, Mr. Slovo, have adequate resources to  deal with all these situations that are arising?    [Slovo] Well, it hasn't got an army. It hasn't got its own  cash to dish around, but it has got the power to call upon the  South African Government as it did in the case of Bophuthatswana  -- as it might have to do if things turn badly in the Ciskei --  for the forces under general control of the TEC and the  government to ensure that the situation remains stable.    [Ascar] Does the TEC feel at all that it would have to deal  with any resistance coming from people living in those areas?  How would it deal with resistance coming form those people -- a  kind of impression that: Well, these are outsiders. What would  it do in that situation?    [Slovo] I don't think that we can expect much resistance in  the Ciskei, and we know that the only resistance really that  occurred in Bop came from the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and  from Terreblanche's rag bag army, which tries to come in and  take over the place. And I don't believe that there will be  resistance in the Ciskei, at least one hopes not.    [Ascar] What will the TEC directive be to the two point  administrators that have been appointed?    [Slovo] If we'd follow the pattern of Bophuthatswana, it  will be that they should establish an administrative council  representing all sectors of Ciskei society, that they must  regulate the affairs of Ciskei during the transition, that they  must immediately facilitate the work of the Independent  Electoral Commission and the Independent Media Commission and  the Independent Broadcasting Commission, and the TEC, that they  should meet the traditional leaders in order to inform them of  the changes that are taking place, and assure them of their  salaries and so on, and that they must take immediate steps  obviously to assert financial control over all government funds  and secure all government property. But also the key question,  which the TEC in the case of Bophuthatswana made absolutely  clear, is that we must reiterate that all public servants -- the  police, the army, including those dismissed, and there have been  some in the Ciskei by the former head of the Ciskei state -- are  guaranteed their jobs, are guaranteed their salaries, are  guaranteed their pensions. And that is one of the key questions  we know at the moment in the Ciskei.    [Ascar] You said that includes those who have been  dismissed?    [Slovo] Yes, there's a running sore in the Ciskei of  thousands of civil servants who two years ago were dismissed and  are still out of their jobs. That's an issue which will have to  be addressed.    [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, how do you think this will affect Brig.  Gqozo's participation in the election?    [Slovo] Well, it's up to him. If he thinks he can get any  votes, he should have the complete freedom to participate in the  election, and I don't believe he has any support whatsoever in  the area. The decision to step down yesterday was perhaps the  wisest decision he has ever taken in his life, and of course the  election should be free and fair, and everybody including  Mangope, including Gqozo, have the right to take part in the  election as long as they don't use illegal means in the process.    [Ascar] Have you had any reports about any looting or any  incidents of violence in Ciskei at all?    [Slovo] None at all up to now, and that is the most  gratifying thing about the turn of events there, and one can  only hope and pray and see to it that there is no violence, and  that there is no repeat of some of the negative events which  occurred for example in the early stages in Bop.    [Ascar] Mr. Slovo, we thank you for your participation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "State Council's Work Group Arrives in Guangdong </F> To Guide Anti-Flood Work Along the Bei Jiang"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 20 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- The joint work  group sent by the State Council and led by Hou Jie, minister of  construction, and He Jing, vice minister of water resources,  arrived in Guangzhou yesterday. They went to the areas that are  heavily guarded against the flood -- the Zhaoqing area along the  Xi Jiang and the large dam on the Bei Jiang, to give guidance  and make arrangements for the work to combat the floods and deal  with emergencies. The group feels that, so far, the work of  preventing floods and providing relief to disaster-hit areas has  been successful in Guangdong.    The group inspected the condition of the disaster in the  flood-prevention areas of Yunan County and Fengkai County along  the Xi Jiang in Zhaoqing and called for the local government to  try every possible means to help more than 50,000 people  besieged by the floods get through their difficulties.    The group praised the people in Daqiaowei, Deqing County,  for  their meritorious deeds in combating the floods, as more than  10,000 local cadres and masses struggled for three days and  nights to build an embankment of sand bags one meter high and  seven km long to rein in the flood water overflow and secure the  lives and properties of some 100,000 people in five townships  and towns. The group also carefully inspected Fengle County in  Dinghu District of Zhaoqing, which is a "difficult place to  fortify against the flood."    Yesterday, the group hurriedly left Zhaoqing for Lubao Town,  the front-line flood control command post of the Bei Jiang Dam,  to inspect the three dangerous sections in Xialingzhou.</p>

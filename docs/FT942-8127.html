			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Travel (France): The land people cannot change - Nicholas Woodsworth meets the inhabitants of the Cevennes Robert Louis Stevenson crossed the Cevennes in 11 days with a donkey named Modestine, and found enough of interest in the trip to write a book about it. I did not have that kind of time, and I did not have a donkey. I had a Peugeot, and was concentrating on coaxing her on a day trip down the frightening roads of the Vallee Francaise, a valley as steep-sided and sharp-cornered as any in the heart of the Cevennes. But when I stopped the car and climbed up the hillside to the Canourgue tower, I began to understand Stevenson's attraction to the region. Sitting on a rocky outcrop and poking up out of a thick forest of holm oak and chestnut, the tall stone tower provides a bird's eye view of the Cevennes countryside. In Stevenson's time this was one of the wildest and least developed areas left in France. It still is. It is not hard to see why. This is a tortured, rugged, broken landscape, a great mass of elevated rock jutting out into the Mediterranean plain from the southern end of France's massif central. The Cevennes impresses not with its height but with its depth. Where further north the massif is gentle and rolling, here it is deeply cut by narrow valleys and ravines that plunge towards small, fast rivers snaking far below. There is little flat land to speak of. Heavily forested, subject to snow in winter and torrential rains in spring and autumn, the Cevennes accepts a human presence with barely a flicker of acknowledgement on its great weathered brows. Yet man is here. When war, pestilence, brigandage or political strife threatened security on the broad plain below, the Cevennes became a place to hide away deep in the folds of the earth until the trouble passed. Trouble has been such a permanent feature of history here that for a tiny population the Cevennes became a permanent if demanding home. The Canourgue tower is more than 1,000 years old. Commanding a view of the Vallee Francaise down its entire length, it was used to watch for the approach of marauding bands or invading armies. But it is not the only construction in sight. Scattered up and down the valley, perched high on rocky spurs or sitting on whatever flat land exists at the valley bottom, are the isolated slate houses and hamlets of the inhabitants of the Cevennes. There is little here to tell you that this is the 20th century. Until well into the 1900s, the Cevenols depended for their survival on the forests surrounding them. The great chesnut plantations that still cover much of the Cevennes provided everything in their diet, from soup to nuts, including the flour with which they made their bread. The forest also provided mulberry leaves, the food of the silk-worm, and no Cevenol house was without a vast third floor full of racks of wriggling, ravenous, cocoon-spinning worms. For centuries, chestnuts and silk were the strange and fragile twins that supported Cevenol life. Existence is almost as precarious today, and depends on a resource equally as odd. Down by the Gardon River, on the narrow floor of the Vallee Francaise, I met Claire Rosier, keeper of 115 goats. Without the small, round, salty goat cheeses known as pelardons, there would be little to keep the Cevennes going. Every day, to a great clanging of goat bells, Madame Rosier herds her charges along the road to the narrow meadows beside the river. To summer visitors basking by swimming holes through long afternoons, or fishing for trout in the still, early evening, it all looks idyllic - goats bleating in flower-filled meadows, attentive dogs splayed on the cool ground, Madame Rosier sitting in the shade of a tree. But seen from the Rosier farmyard, life is somewhat more exacting. Like most of the residents of the valley, the Rosier family is Protestant, and has been ensconced by the river for centuries. They came not for the quality of life but to escape Catholic persecution. Even deep in the remote confines of the Cevennes, the Protestants were chased and harried for centuries. The early 1700s saw the invasion of Catholic armies, open warfare and the wholesale destruction of farms, hamlets and villages. The Protestants affirmed their faith all the more vigorously, went underground - and survived. Such a past forged a people who today remain hardy, determined and resistant. Although life could be easier for them after generations of toil, the Rosiers remain as frugal and hard-working as ever - goats, a saw-mill, a vast vegetable plot, bee-hives, fruit orchards, rabbit hutches and dovecotes keep them as self-sufficient as is possible. All that is missing is the time to laze in the swimming hole below the house along with the holiday-makers. But peasant life in the Cevennes means more than austerity. The locals' strongly-held faith also teaches open-mindedness, a questioning of the moral order, and refusal to accept authority blindly. Perhaps it is because of these traditions that the remnants of a later protest generation, the defenders of the 1968 Paris barricades, also chose the Cevennes as a retreat. I met Janine Berder at the weekly market in Saint Croix, a village which, with two bars, two restaurants, two shops and a bakery, is the largest in the Vallee Francaise. In another life, Janine was a teacher of Latin and Greek, une intello, as the French like to say. But 20 years ago she exchanged that appellation for another. Along with large numbers of other young urbanites she became a neo, a newcomer to the life and culture of the Cevennes. Most of the now middle-aged men and women selling goat cheese, honey and jars of preserves on the little bridge that crosses the Gardon in Saint Croix come from that generation. But many neos did not make it. They knew more about Mao's Little Red Book than they did about country living or hard physical work. The communes broke down, the co-operative farms foundered, and for many, back-to-the-earth was followed by back-to-the-city. Those who have stayed have adapted to local ways, and learned to use their hands. Today Janine gardens for summer residents and works a vegetable plot as vast as Claire Rosier's. In the long winter months she works at a loom with her partner, Pierre, a professional tapestry weaver, in her stone house not far from Saint Croix. Did she not miss civilisation, I asked. Civilisation is not so very far away, she laughed. Her isolationist period came to an end after her first 10 years in the Cevennes. These days, she said, she likes to drive down to Nimes, 90 minutes away, for dinner with friends, an evening at the theatre, or a browse in the bookshops. But she also enjoys coming home. She is happy in her world of forests, rivers and tiny villages. She is not resentful that the larger world is coming to the Cevennes. Wasn't she afraid it would spoil things, I wondered. Not at all, she laughed again. The country is too wild, too overpowering, its inhabitants too unbending. People do not change the Cevennes. The Cevennes changes people.</p>

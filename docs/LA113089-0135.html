			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CROWLEY LAKE;  </P> <P> PELICAN DEATHS TIED TO VARIETY OF CAUSES  </P> <P> No single cause has been found in the deaths of 400 white pelicans at Crowley  Lake in Mono County, the state Department of Fish and Game said. The pelican  deaths, which happened over a two-week period in mid-October, may have been the  result of changing environmental conditions elsewhere in the West, the  department said. Starvation was the apparent primary cause of death in half the  birds examined, but many also suffered intestinal infestations of parasitic  worms severe enough to kill them. And some of the carcasses taken from the  eastern Sierra lake contained high levels of mercury in the livers believed to  be caused by increased exposure to an accumulation in the environment.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Italian Christian Democratic </F> Center leader Pierferdinando Casini in Rome; date not given:  "Casini: `He is Prime Minister, but on the Antitrust Law...'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr.  Casini, [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi is raising his price,  saying the League must be the one to designate the prime  minister. Whom do you want to see in the Palazzo Chigi  [government seat]?    [Casini] The demands made of [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi, who leads the coalition, must be possible, not  patently absurd. We CCD [Christian Democratic Center] members  are asking him to follow in the footsteps of Antonio Segni  [former president and 1950's agriculture minister], a rich  landowner who pushed through the agriculture reform. Berlusconi  must form the government and put the antitrust law issue on the  agenda. Having said that, he may count on our full support.    [Correspondent] But Bossi says that the League is the first  party, so it is not a foregone conclusion that Berlusconi will  necessarily be the next prime minister. You are in the same  alliance, what is your answer to that?    [Casini] It is news to me that Bossi has 51 percent of seats  in parliament. When the head of state summons the parliamentary  groups, each one will put forward its nominee. We will be  putting forward Berlusconi's name.    [Correspondent] What does the CCD want for itself in the  next government?    [Casini] First of all, we are going to aim for inclusion in  the program a number of essential conditions which are close to  the hearts of Catholics: concrete legislation in favor of the  family, pluralism in education -- with equal treatment for the  public and private sectors -- and a real boost to political  commitment in favor of the south. Naturally, we will also aim  to safeguard another principle: National unity cannot be  questioned. I have also heard talk of purges in the civil  service and the RAI [state broadcasting corporation]. While  those who are clearly inept and dishonest must of course go,  there should be no discrimination of any sort against those who  are honest and professionally competent.    [Correspondent] You say that national unity as a principle  is not open to discussion. That will set you at loggerheads  with the League, even though that party is one of your allies.    [Casini] We refuse to question the nation's indissolubility.  On the other hand, for example, fiscal federalism supplemented  by a solidarity fund is part of our program.    [Correspondent] Those are your demands as far as the program  is concerned. Now, I agree the DC [Christian Democratic Party]  is finished... but you cannot expect me to believe that the CCD  does not want any ministries for itself.    [Casini] Our demands will be in proportion to the expertise  we can provide and our weight in terms of numbers... To give  you an example, I notice a number of newspapers mention my name  as a candidate for the health ministry, which is unquestionably  a sector of primary importance. Apart from the fact that I am  not at all willing to take on a government post, I would not  dream of becoming a public health hazard. I know absolutely  nothing about health.    [Correspondent] So who will be joining the government from  the CCD? Mastella, Fumagalli, D'Onofrio?    [Casini] I have no specific names in mind, but there is no  point in discussing them yet anyway. The best thing is for the  prime minister designate to decide on the composition of his  government.    [Correspondent] You did not show all this sense of fair play  when you were in the DC. You must have some preferences at least  as to which ministries you would like.    [Casini] Those which have some relevance to our values. I  could mention institutional reform, education, or defense, where  I am against the idea of placing any generals. Generals are  just fine inside the officers' mess or helping parliamentary  committees with their expertise.    [Correspondent] [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini  has repeated that "[former Fascist dictator] Mussolini is the  greatest statesman of the century." What is your response to  that?    [Casini] I am in total disagreement with Fini over that, at  least as much as I agree with many of the other opinions he has  expressed in the past few days. In fact I will be even more  explicit. I can see Fini and us working together over the next  few years to finally build a popular, moderate, political  grouping. But for my money, the greatest statesman this century  was [postwar DC leader] De Gasperi...    [Correspondent] Do you see Fini renouncing Fascism?    [Casini] What I saw in Fini was a break with the past when  the National Alliance was created. Besides, I notice there is  no "Fascist Renewal" in Italy, while there is a Communist  Renewal.    [Correspondent] Mino Martinazzoli's Popular Party is in a  crisis. Are they waiting for somebody to go knock on their door?    [Casini] That is of no interest to us. What is of interest  to us, on the other hand, is that the Popular Party [PPI] should  change course. Indeed many PPI members tell us: You made a  mistake, but you were right. I answer that we still disagree  over the method, but I hope to see a rapprochement between them  and the pole for freedom.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / BA to face 'dirty tricks' case in US MR RICHARD BRANSON last night launched a near-Dollars 1bn anti-trust law suit against British Airways for its 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic Airways. The action was filed in New York citing 'unfair and illegal activities' and accused BA of attempting to impede Virgin's growth and trying to 'destroy it with targeted predatory anti-competitive practices and acts'. Virgin's move will now re-open the wounds between the two UK carriers and revive the highly publicised 'dirty tricks' affair. Mr Branson said last night: 'Airing another airline's dirty linen in front of an American audience is not something I would normally choose to do. However, in the aviation business there is no UK legislation to protect smaller carriers against anti-competitive and monopolistic behaviour.' BA paid Pounds 610,000 in libel damages to Virgin in the High Court in London in January after accepting that Virgin 'had reasonable grounds for serious concern about the activities of a number of BA employees'. But the two airlines failed after lengthy negotiations to agree on financial compensation for Virgin. Mr Branson said he had hoped after the High Court case that the affair could have been settled without the need for further action. Virgin had been willing 'to accept a token sum in recognition of the misdeeds of the past'. He added that BA has had long enough to take 'positive measures' to prevent the need for last night's action. 'Not only have they not done so, but we have found ourselves the target of new monopolistic abuse,' he said. Virgin is claiming Dollars 325m (Pounds 218.5m) in damages, but said any award would be trebled up to Dollars 975m by a US court. It is also seeking an injunction to prevent BA from continuing what it claims are activities which distort competition and are designed to 'damage and discredit' Virgin. Virgin specifically claims that BA is attempting to monopolise the transatlantic market; using its dominant position at London's Heathrow airport to distort competition on north Atlantic routes; guilty of a variety of 'dirty tricks' aimed at Virgin and its passengers; and using its equity position in USAir and agreements related to it to distort competition for passengers flying between the US and UK. BA said last night: 'The complaint filed by Virgin in the United States . . . is a 50-page litany of old grievances which will be appropriately dealt with in court by our US counsel.'</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Cooper Cos. reported a $115-million fourth-quarter loss, compared to a loss of  $4.8 million a year earlier. Sales fell to $160.2 million, down 9%. The quarter  includes a $59-million provision for losses on a planned divestiture. The Palo  Alto-based medical products firm posted a $207-million loss for the year,  contrasted with net income of $52 million in 1987. Sales jumped to $611.31  million, up 72%. Results aren't directly comparable, the firm said, because  figures from Cooper Technicon are included in full-year 1988 results but are  included only in the last four months of the previous year.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 8  </P></p>

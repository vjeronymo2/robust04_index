			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Diary of a whisky salesman - Michael Cassell follows J&amp;B's market manager from the Scottish highlands to the nightclubs of Spain The Brodie of Brodie, 25th laird and master of Castle Brodie, a romantic monument to Scottish highlands' history, wears the same, weary expression as his Labrador dog. His library is crammed with chattering Spaniards; there are some outside the window suspended under a hot air balloon and others lining up to be measured for a kilt. Tomorrow, they might throw a haggis. The Brodie of Brodie, turned 80, has seen it all before. So has Jonathan Stordy, the adrenalin-fired market manager for J&amp;B whisky who is 50 years his junior. Serious business is at stake for Stordy, who has to ensure the Scottish evening is a hit with his 50 important guests. Back in Spain, after all, they are at the sharp end of an increasingly cut-throat assault on the local whisky market by J&amp;B's owner, the Grand Metropolitan subsidiary International Distillers and Vintners. IDV is number one in what is its biggest market, each year selling at a premium price, 2.2m cases of 'smooth, soft aspirational' J&amp;B Rare, along with much smaller quantities of the deluxe labels J&amp;B Reserve, a blend at least 15 years old, and Knockando, a Speyside single malt. Stordy and his colleagues have to fight local whisky producers and rival, international brands such as Ballantines and Johnny Walker Red Label to sell every bottle. Mixing it in the marketplace gives the biggest buzz to a man who once dreamed of becoming a professional golfer and who joined IDV two years ago after a spell as a Unilever brand manager, promoting shampoo in Ecuador and washing powder in Egypt. But the ceilidh at Brodie Castle is still a very important part of his present job. The morning after the night before Spanish VIPs go to the Knockando distillery for lectures on whisky-distilling and blending. Stordy, in impeccable Spanish, shows videos which mix action-packed images of youthful, sporting prowess with the J&amp;B brand. He is careful to stress the concept of responsible alcohol consumption. In Spain - where there are 13 measures to the bottle against 36 in the UK - J&amp;B customers are told: 'To know how to drink is to know when to stop.' Half of them already take it with Coca Cola or water and ice. The Spanish visitors are impressed by the riverside distillery, if a little alarmed to hear that the equivalent of three and a half bottles of Scotch - 'the angel's share' - evaporate each minute from the large, bonded warehouses. Within days of the Scottish visit, Stordy is in Spain to do what he loves best. He regards himself, primarily, as 'a champion of J&amp;B's long-term strategy, closest to the marketplace', acting as a bridge between J&amp;B in Britain and its Spanish consumers but working closely with Anglo Espanola de Distribucion (AED), the Madrid-based national marketing company which IDV acquired in 1990. Apart from policing the quality of local marketing operations, Stordy's objectives include tailoring J&amp;B's global strategy on issues such as premium pricing, presentation and image to match local conditions. He tries to help Scotland deliver improvements in customer service, speaks regularly to the 40-strong network of Spanish distributors and keeps close tabs on the competition. It is all, he says, about adding value. Stordy will not criticise the team in Scotland but is clearly frustrated at times by their reluctance to accept what they are told by people on the ground. Knockando, he says, is being outsmarted in the quality gift market by brands such as Chivas Regal and Cardhu. He is pushing his UK colleagues to retaliate with better packaging. Images of the Scottish highlands are not good enough. His overriding mission is to keep J&amp;B in pole position in Spain, which means a very traditional drink bearing the royal warrant of no fewer than six British kings and two queens 'must stay exciting to the young'. 'We must be number one in the night,' he insists, as he begins a marathon 'on-trade' tour to bars, nightclubs and discos. At the Honky Tonk bar Stordy chats with Jose Luis Salto, the 'nightman of Madrid', who works across the city until dawn ensuring J&amp;B is on show and in demand. On to a J&amp;B open-air party at the Boulevard bar where clumsy clowns push the product. J&amp;B supports 4,500 such parties every year at some of Spain's 300,000 bars, each event graded into A, B and C events, depending on how many cases each outlet normally sells. Next stop for Stordy and Javier Barruetabena, AED's sales director, is Joy Aslava, the top night spot where hundreds dance to music which thumps the chest while drinking Scotch at Pounds 6 a slug. Stordy is 'pacemaking', handing out luminous, bottle-shaped lapel badges which create instant interest. There are, however, too many bottles of Ballantines around for his liking. Next day, to the airport, where J&amp;B has its revenge. After 15 meetings, Barruetabena has finally persuaded the airport bar concessionaire to replace Ballantines with J&amp;B. Stordy is impressed. On to Barcelona - which consumes 10 times more bottles of J&amp;B than the entire UK - for an important meeting with Caprabo, a supermarket and hypermarket operator ordering 10,000 cases of J&amp;B a year. The government welcomes hypermarkets because price-cutting helps curb inflation. Suppliers such as J&amp;B are more cautious, required to remain competitive but determined not to degrade the quality image. Off-trade sales are increasingly vital but J&amp;B must keep within the clearly defined price bands which define its market. There is a late-night dinner with Vicente Estruga, a large, genial man who runs local distributor Dicom. More club visits follow and, in one, a reveller sings the praises of J&amp;B over the bar. He wins a luminous badge. The night ends early at 3am, with an earnest, pavement conversation about promotional packs and point of sale material. Stordy is still firing on all cylinders but finally concedes: 'It's not a party. It's a bullfight.'</p>

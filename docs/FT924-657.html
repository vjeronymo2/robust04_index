			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Better late than never for big stores: Neil Buckley visits Wimbledon to see how Christmas is bringing out the shoppers IF THIS Christmas sees the beginning of a consumer-led recovery, some believe it may be sparked by men's guilt. Ms Khym Hauxwell, department manager for cosmetics at Debenhams in Wimbledon, says men shop on Christmas Eve 'slightly drunk after a few drinks at the pub, with a huge guilt complex. They spend a fortune on perfume and underwear for their wives and girlfriends.' Even before Christmas Eve, men are more malleable, more easily persuaded by a sales pitch. Women 'know what they want and tend to stick to it'. Ms Hauxwell last week persuaded one man who thought he had come in for a bottle of perfume for his wife to buy a Pounds 285 gift set. But guilt-stricken men do not make a Christmas. Retailers are hoping for a rush of buying this week to make up for what most agree has been the late arrival of Christmas. At Debenhams in Wimbledon, the chain's newest store and its showcase, there was a sense of expectation as the shutters went up on Monday and the sunlight and piped Christmas muzak flooded in from the recently opened Centre Court shopping centre. Mr Steven Gaunt, 39, store manager and veteran of three store launches, will get little rest until Christmas day. Mr Gaunt says this is his 24th Christmas in the retail trade. By 8am he and his deputy are at their desks reviewing the trading figures for the day before. The figures are a closely guarded secret, but the managers seem pleased. The first hour is quiet. Grandmothers with toddlers and pushchairs form the mainstay of the shoppers. Many head for the restaurant, where a full English breakfast for 99p is one of the best bar-gains. Behind the scenes, in the storeroom with its yards of clothes racks and hydraulic shelves, Christmas is in full swing as staff sort through the first of the day's deliveries - 126 sets of men's clothing each containing between three and 20 garments. Most of the year there may be two deliveries a day from Debenhams warehouses and several others for concessions within the store. In the weeks before Christmas there may be twice as many, each three times normal size. Mr Gaunt makes a detailed tour of the store. Fixtures are straightened, displays prodded and tweaked. A table short of stock is viewed with a mixture of satisfaction and disapproval. He can tell at a glance what people are buying. Women's wraps did well yesterday; so did slipper socks and men's casual shirts. Upstairs in the toy department are other big sellers - Trolls, dolls with elfin faces and clumps of brightly coloured hair, and, in what is normally the hi-fi listening room in the electrical department, video games and home karaoke machines. By the time of the management meeting at 11am, the store is starting to buzz. Mums are led by the hand by small children whose want lists are blissfully unaffected by the recession. An hour later, they are joined by workers on their lunch hour. Queues form by the checkouts; there are smiles from the manage-ment. As buying begins in earnest, Mr Gaunt reviews the socks and underwear department. Marks are awarded for presentation and layout; even in the Christmas rush retailing is an exact science. There is time only for a microwaved cottage pie in the self-service canteen before the managers head out to snoop around the shelves of their competitor, Elys, the independent department store. On the way there is a chance to review trading elsewhere in the centre. There are encouraging signs. In spite of the recession, more than 65 per cent of space in Centre Court has been let, with 70 per cent expected by the end of January. Shops such as Athena and the Body Shop are teeming. 'People are out today,' Mr Gaunt says with approval. But few shoppers are carrying the bulging plastic bags traditionally associated with Christmas. Elys is full of shoppers, but lightly laden ones. The Debenhams spies learn little except that Elys plans to open on Sunday, January 3. Debenhams does not. Back for the afternoon staff meeting, and there is something of a lull in trading before the next peak around 5pm, when commuters start pouring in from Wimbledon station. The last three hours could be the busiest of the day. By 6pm, Khym Hauxwell is smiling again. She has just persuaded a man to part with Pounds 585 on perfumes and cosmetics for his wife and daughters. Even in the depths of a recession, old-fashioned selling skills can pay off. Retailers are wondering whether those skills will be enough.</p>

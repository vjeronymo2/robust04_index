			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Italy lifts credibility as a borrower with Dollars 1.5bn FRN THE Republic of Italy made substantial progress in restoring its credibility as a borrower in the international capital markets, with the launch of its Dollars 1.5bn issue of five-year floating-rate notes yesterday. Italy's debt has taken a battering in the secondary markets in the last year due to concerns about its creditworthiness, which were exacerbated by the country's political instability. The latest downgrade by Moody's to A1 excluded a further group of investors, including many central banks, who are not allowed to buy debt rated less than AA. However, sentiment towards Italy may have turned, with expectations that political reform will gain momentum under the new government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former central bank governor. The pricing of Italy's notes at a margin of 25 basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor) represented a tightening of the spread which investors are willing to accept for Italy paper - and a cost saving for the republic. Italy's fixed-rate five-year Eurodollar bond offering, also via Morgan Stanley, was launched last month at a yield spread of 65 basis points over the comparable US Treasury, which represents a margin of around 40 basis points over Libor, if swapped. The discounted margin over Libor of 30 basis points for the latest floating-rate note issue therefore represents a reduction in funding costs. Houses holding senior syndicate positions on the transaction reported strong demand for yesterday's issue from an unusually broad range of investors, including bond fund managers, who are not normally buyers of FRNs. Recent strong US economic data has strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon move to raise interest rates, encouraging investors to hold at least some portion of their portfolios in floating-rate assets, they said. However, some other dealers said that sales were rather slow, due to a lack of focus on the deal by investors still expecting Italy to launch a global bond offering. Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of foreign borrowing at the Italian Treasury, pointed out that foreign currency debt, while important to debt management policy, totals only 3 per cent of the republic's outstanding debt. At the start of the year, Treasury officials said they planned to raise Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn in the international bond markets; close to Dollars 6bn of foreign currency debt has been issued. The Bank of China is preparing to launch a Dollars 200m issue of five-year floating-rate notes today, via Credit Suisse First Boston. The notes will be priced at 50 basis points over Libor.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Olivier Revelant: "Fourth Framework </F> Program: A Difficult Birth"]    [Text] European research has just had a close shave.  Against the backdrop of the Treaty of Maastricht, the  persistent disagreement between the European Parliament and the  Council of Ministers almost sabotaged the implementation of the  fourth framework program for research and development. It came  within an inch of seeing its coffers empty at the start of 1995.    The formal proposal and the content of the specific programs  of the fourth framework program for technological research and  development were approved by the European Commission 6 October  1993. The total sum proposed for life sciences amounted to 1.265  billion ECU [European Currency Units]. This represents 10  percent of the total framework program budget -- 13.1 billion  ECU -- to which we should add the 600 million ECU earmarked for  the Community's joint research center whose status is currently  under discussion. The joint research center consists of four  structures located in Ispra [Italy], Petten [Netherlands,  Institute of Advanced Materials], Geel [Belgium, Institute of  Measurement and Reference Materials], and Karlsruhe [Germany,  Transuranian Institute]. It is directed by Jean-Pierre Contzen.  We must bear in mind that the budget for the third framework  program was only 6.6 billion ECU. However, the budget has not  risen significantly: The two framework programs differ in that  now no Community research can be carried out outside of the  framework program. In this context, the budget for the fourth  framework program has risen by no more than five percent.  <H5>  General Content of the Program </H5>   According to the most recent estimates, the life sciences  budget will be split up as follows: 46 to 50 percent to the  biotechnologies sector; 15 to 19 percent to biomedicine and  health; 33 to 37 percent to the application of living sciences  to agriculture and fishing (this sector also includes  agro-industries, forestry, rural development, and food  technologies), and 4 to 8 percent on cross-disciplinary  demonstration activities. The aim of these activities is to  establish the technical feasibility of new approaches: They  must simplify the transfer of technology to the users. Lastly,  one to three percent of the budget will go to finance legal,  ethical, and social aspects in order to improve dialogue between  the main national and sociopolitical viewpoints. The subjects  examined will include the problems raised by biodiversity, organ  transplants, the confidentiality of genetic information, genetic  therapy, and genetic fingerprinting. This activity concerns the  three domains of biotechnology, biomedicine and health, and  agro-industrial research.    For biotechnologies, the priorities will range from the  "cell  factory" (combining biological approaches and engineering  dedicated to solving industrial problems), to the molecular  biology of plants, cellular communication in neuroscience  (cooperation with the international Human Frontiers program  should in particular be strengthened), and genome analysis. It  should be noted that the Commission's proposal once again refers  to the analysis of genomes, and not merely to the human genome,  contrary to the heading of the first version. AIDS, infectious  illnesses (tuberculosis), cancer, and pharmaceutical and  chemical research (in particular in vitro toxicity tests and the  development of new animal models) will receive Community funding  in the biomedicine and health sector. Finally, where the  application of living science and technology to agriculture and  fishing is concerned, the Community will focus its efforts on  creating projects that affect all aspects of the transformation  process for the main crops and products (from agriculture to the  finished product, food and otherwise).  <H5>  A Complex Decisionmaking Process </H5>   The delays noted in setting up this fourth framework program  are mainly due to the coming into force of the Maastricht Treaty  which ushered in European Union on 1 November 1993. To provide  for this delay, the third framework program budget was extended  in June 1993 by 900 million ECU. The Treaty on European Union  considerably alters the Community decisionmaking processes: The  European Council, after consulting the parliament, votes by a  qualified majority on specific programs. Thus, 23 programs  figured in the Council's last version, while the Commission was  proposing 18. The establishment of programs, whether under the  Single European Act or the Treaty of the Union, is a two-stage  procedure: one stage for the program and another stage for  specific programs. However, while for the third framework  program the specific programs were approved by the qualified  majority vote of the Council after consulting the parliament,  the fourth framework program must be approved unanimously by  both the Council and the European Parliament (the coordination  procedure). In the event of disagreement, and unlike the  procedure under the Single Act, the program may be read a third  time before parliament with the prior constitution of a  conciliation committee.  <H5>  Delayed Approval </H5>   In this new decisionmaking framework, most Member States  supported the Commission's proposal at a meeting held in  Luxembourg on 11 October 1993. However, the main capital  providers -- France, Germany, and the United Kingdom -- found  the total sum a bit steep and would be happy with a total budget  of just 10 billion ECU. The Council in particular considered  the increase in the grants to the IT and communications  technologies sector and to the energy sector to be too high  (from four to seven percent and from one to four percent  respectively). It is clear that this three-way opposition was  vital to keeping to the schedule for program implementation, all  the more so since certain countries, after having given their  support on 11 October, were on the point of backing down. On 18  November, at the second reading, the parliament decided to test  out the new powers granted to it in the Treaty on European Union  and voted for a budget higher than the one proposed by the  Commission (13.7 billion ECU with an unchanged global budget for  life sciences) after having made some 140 amendments, most of  which originated with the Energy and Technological Research  Commission [CERT]. For the parliament, the extra monies were  justified by the fact that certain programs (Thermie, for  example) now fall under the auspices of the program, and by the  need to finance the socio-economic measures (100 million ECU).    The finale came on 6 December, when the Council submitted a  new proposition to the parliament. An agreement was reached on  the distribution of the funds, but not on the total: the  Council proposed a budget of 11.5 billion ECU. Biology was  particularly well funded, with a budget representing 15 percent  of the overall total. The framework program is split into four  subprograms: technological R&amp;D and demonstration; cooperation  with third countries and international organizations; the  distribution and use of the results of Community research; and  the training and mobility of researchers. The life sciences  budget represents 13.1 percent of the first subprogram which  itself represents 27.8 percent of the total, a higher figure  than that proposed by the Commission. This boost to the life  sciences budget received the strong backing of Portugal, Greece,  Ireland, and Spain since it includes the agriculture and fishing  sectors. We should note that the industrial technologies budget  has also been raised (16.2 percent) while the budget for  information technologies has been cut (28 percent). The  parliament will not be able to examine this proposal until  February 1994. The logical hypothesis is that it will again  amend the text before ratifying it, which would constitute a  rejection, since the text must be approved in the same terms by  both structures. It is nonetheless possible that agreement will  be reached on a budget of about 13 billion ECU -- which would  suit the parliament -- one billion of which would be frozen --  which would suit the Council. This proposal has received the  backing of all countries except for Germany (for technical  reasons). The Treaty of the Union favors this type of solution  since it imposes a review of financial perspectives in 1996.  France also proposed that the Heads of State decide on the  budget total at the European Council meeting of 10 and 11  December, since all negotiations have to be completed before the  end of the current legislative term in June 1994. Agreement was  finally reached on a high total: 12 billion Ecu plus 1.12  billion ECU in reserve. The Council of Ministers ratified this  decision at its meeting on 22 December. It suggested that 5.9  billion ECU be assigned in the first two years with 6.1 billion  ECU for the following two years (while holding back the frozen  one billion ECU). The joint research center would benefit from a  budget of 875 million ECU. In the best possible hypothesis, the  parliament would rule on the dossier in the last week of January  and the whole thing could be approved according to Parliamentary  procedure A, i.e. without a plenary session debate and with an  almost automatic vote. This agreement, obtained in extremis,  would make it possible to avoid the coffers of European research  being empty on 1 January 1995 and Greece, which is to take over  the EC presidency from Belgium on 1 January 1994, will not then  inherit this thorny issue.</p>

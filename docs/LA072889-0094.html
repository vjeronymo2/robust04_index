			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Senate Judiciary Committee postponed until next week a vote on whether  William Lucas should head the Justice Department's civil rights agency so that  a key member, Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), could study new material. Heflin,  considered a pivotal vote, did not say what the new material was, and committee  workers involved with the nomination declined to comment. Republican members  tried to force a vote so that the nomination could be brought to the full  Senate before Congress' Aug. 5 recess but Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.),  chairman of the committee, rescheduled a vote for Tuesday. Lucas, 61, has met  opposition from some civil rights groups and liberal lawmakers who question his  qualifications and his knowledge of recent Supreme Court decisions they  consider anti-civil rights.  </P></p>

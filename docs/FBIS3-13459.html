			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second and final installment of interview with former Prime </F> Minister Gen. Michel 'Awn by Bisharah Shirbil in France; date  not given]    [Excerpts] [Shirbil] How does General 'Awn feel five years  after the liberation war? And has his assessment of the bitter  experience the Lebanese went through changed? What has changed  since that war?    ['Awn] Without doubt, the atmosphere of the general crisis  Lebanon went through has not changed. However, big changes have  occurred inside the Lebanese people, in their awareness of the  problem and view of the future, that is if they can participate  in achieving this future. They can now determine their choices  clearly, whether inside the country, with neighbors, or with the  world. This view is now very clear, because the liberation war  has removed all the masks from the faces of regional and  international players and accentuated the realities through the  experience which the Lebanese people witnessed after 13 October  1990. There are no longer false slogans that can be sanctioned  in Lebanon, nor international stances that deceive citizens.  The Lebanese now know when a major international authority is  lying and when he is telling the truth. They can tell whether a  regional authority is really an enemy of their traditional enemy  or a friend of his, pretending to be their friend merely to  implement certain schemes. The Lebanese people are now very  vigilant, and their experience -- however harsh -- is useful  with regard to future choices. [passage omitted]    [Shirbil] Are you preparing for a new liberation war?  Assuming you arrived in Lebanon now, would you launch a new  liberation war?    ['Awn] The situation is different now. We are in a pressing  regional situation. Lebanon is occupied. Elements should be  different....    [Shirbil] As resistance is the principle, if you consider  Lebanon occupied, then a new liberation war is a natural  outcome....    ['Awn] Of course. But that depends on the balance of power.  Lebanon is now in an unstable position, but this position does  not prompt armed resistance, because there is regional and  international pressure on the region. They do not want anything  to sabotage the peace process. Lebanon has now been handed over  to others, and I am out of the game. [passage omitted]    [Shirbil] Are there any political messages between you and  the Syrians?    ['Awn] Many of the visitors who deal with them offer me  plans which I consider imperialist. And I conclude from them  that the Syrians still have the mentality of the seventies.    [Shirbil] Did anyone bring you a real offer?    ['Awn] I received many offers, but I do not believe they are  serious as long as there are no direct contacts between me and  them.    [Shirbil] Are you willing to deal with the Syrians if they  open up to you?    ['Awn] On one condition: One thing is not negotiable  between me and them, and that is Lebanon's independence and  sovereignty. Anything else can be discussed. The sovereignty  and independence condition cannot be subject to interpretation.    [Shirbil] Those who support the Syrians in Lebanon say that  the Syrian presence secures sovereignty and independence...    ['Awn] Many people talk about modesty when they are  themselves naked.

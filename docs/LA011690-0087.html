			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPHEAVAL IN THE SOVIET BLOC;  </P> <P> REFORMER ELECTED LITHUANIA'S PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Algirdas Brazauskas, the charismatic leader of the Lithuanian Communist Party,  was elected president of Lithuania on Monday -- a strong vote of confidence in  his defiant assertion of the Soviet republic's desire for independence.  </P> <P> Brazauskas, 57, was elected by a vote of 228 to 4 with 19 abstentions in the  Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, the Baltic republic's legislature, according to  Tass, the official Soviet news agency. He succeeds Vytautas Astrauskas, 59, who  resigned because of poor health.  </P> <P> Although two candidates of the Lithuanian Sajudis nationalist movement were  also nominated, Brazauskas' popularity ensured his election.  </P> <P> Brazauskas, who has been first secretary of the Lithuanian party since October,  1988, strongly supported its decision last month to break from the Soviet  Communist Party and seek the restoration of Lithuania's sovereignty.  </P> <P> Despite warnings from Moscow that this split -- the first real break from the  Soviet Communist Party since the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917 -- would  undercut President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his reform program, Brazauskas  passionately defended the move as Gorbachev argued for its reversal in  Lithuania last week.  </P> <P> Brazauskas' election as president had been planned in order to strengthen his  position in dealing with Moscow by dramatizing the personal support he has and  by giving him additional stature as head of the state as well as the party.  </P> <P> The step also ensures that if the Soviet Communist Party should expel  Brazauskas in an attempt to halt the Lithuanian pullout, as demanded by  conservative members of its policy-making Central Committee, he will still be  president of Lithuania.  </P> <P> Brazauskas, an engineer, worked on a number of major construction projects in  Lithuania before becoming the republic's construction minister in 1967, then  first deputy chairman of the government planning commission and later a party  secretary overseeing the republic's economy.  </P> <P> As Sajudis began in mid-1988 to organize Lithuanians into one of the strongest  political movements in the Soviet Union outside the Communist Party, Brazauskas  began to reposition the Lithuanian party to respond to the same popular demands  for national sovereignty, economic autonomy, environmental protection and  greater democracy.  </P> <P> Since taking over the party leadership from men opposed even to Gorbachev's  more gradual reform, Brazauskas has put Lithuania in the forefront of the  Soviet Union's political and economic transformation as well as pursuing  Lithuanians' dream of recovering their independence.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The final rule clarifies that an owner who makes the elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference election must be able to produce, if challenged, all relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation in the owner's possession that pertains to the original design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the project, not only the evidence that was ``supporting evidence'' as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language read in the interim rule. (See &sect;880.612a(a)(2)(i) and comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections in other parts covered by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The final rule clarifies that the primary source list in the rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not limited to underwriting or financial documents. (See &sect;800.612(a)(b)(1)(i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The final rule clarifies that in discussing project unit mix with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher percentage of efficiency and one-bedroom units, higher percentage means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than fifty percent. (See &sect;880.612a(b)(1)(ii) and comparable sections in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other parts covered by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The final rule clarifies that the requirement to make vacant units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to otherwise eligible families if there are an insufficient number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of families qualifying for the elderly preference or for the reserved units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for non-elderly disabled families (or qualifying for the near-elderly disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family secondary preference if adopted) applies to owners of covered projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who make the elderly preference election, and not solely to owners who elect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the elderly preference and elect also the secondary preference as the May 3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 interim rule indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The final rule clarifies that projects under National Housing Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and receiving section 8 assistance may be subject to preferences in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to those contained in the section 8 regulations. (See &sect;880.612a(g)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exception of these eight changes, the final rule remains the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same as the May 3, 1994 interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following section of the preamble provides a summary of the issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised by the public commenters, and HUD's response to these issues. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only six commenters commented upon the May 3, 1994 interim rule (also referred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to as the subtitle D rule) by the end of the public comment period on July 5,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, the six commenters raised a number of issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that interim rulemaking was inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the subject matter addressed by subtitle D, and HUD should have solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance public comment before issuing the subtitle D rule for effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier in this preamble, and discussed in more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detail in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule (59 FR 22921&hyph;22922),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very little in HUD's subtitle D rule would be altered by public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the system of occupancy preferences established by subtitle D allows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD little discretion to expand or depart from this system by regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore advance public comment would not have been practicable or necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, as noted in the preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD, in issuing the subtitle D rule, had the benefit of public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received on the rule that implemented subtitle B of title VI of the HCD Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 (59 FR 22921&hyph;22922). Subtitle B provides public housing agencies (PHAs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the option, subject to certain requirements, to designate public housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects, or portions of these projects, for occupancy by elderly families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled families or elderly families and disabled families. HUD's final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing subtitle B was published on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17652). To the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that the subtitle D rule which concerns section 8 housing, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle B rule which concerns public housing, address similar issues, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comments on the subtitle B rule were taken into consideration in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of the May 3, 1994 interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that given the recent publication of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice revising HUD's Occupancy Handbook for multifamily projects, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 3, 1994 interim rule, project owners are confused about their obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and responsibilities to persons with disabilities, and further clarification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The notice of the revision to Chapter 2 of HUD Handbook on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21992) advised that Chapter 2, as revised,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would remain in effect pending issuance regulations for subtitle D, at which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time further revisions to Chapter 2 would be issued. Those revisions are now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in preparation. Chapter 2 remains in effect to the extent that it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contradicted by the interim rule, and until such time as the next revision to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this chapter is issued. The Department also intends to issue further guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on subtitle D and the issue of mixed populations in the form of technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter expressed concern that HUD has not issued its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule that would revise the terms ``families'' and ``elderly person,'' among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others, in HUD's section 8 regulations to reflect the changes made to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms by section 621 of the HCD Act of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definitions of these terms in section 621 of the HCD Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1992 are applicable without issuance of a HUD regulation. On April 10,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 (57 FR 12686), before enactment of the HCD Act of 1992, HUD published a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule that would revise, among other things, the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``family'' in parts 812 and 912 to reflect changes made to this definition by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub.L. 101&hyph;625, approved November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28, 1990). Rather than issue separate rulemaking to revise the definitions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts 812 and 912 to reflect the changes made to certain definitions (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``elderly person,'' ``person with disabilities'') by the HCD Act of 1992, HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to make these changes at the time of issuance of the final rule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the April 10, 1992 proposed rule. HUD anticipates publication of this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule by December 1994. Again, however, the definition changes made by the HCD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1992 are currently applicable despite the absence of a final rule that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amends parts 812 and 912 to reflect these definition changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

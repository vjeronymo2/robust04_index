			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / CDU proposes an EU top five: Italy, Britain and Spain would be excluded from centre of Community Italy, a founder member state of the European Union, as well as Britain and Spain, would be excluded from the five-nation 'hard core' of a future flexible Community, according to a top policy document published yesterday by Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU), the leaders of the country's coalition government. Their vision of an EU of 'variable geometry' would be centred on only five of the original founding members - France and Germany, as well as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. However, the reformers say their plan does not imply abandoning hopes that Great Britain will assume its role 'in the heart of Europe', as Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said in Bonn three years ago. Rather, they hope that by forcing the pace of European integration, Britain will in turn be forced to 'clarify its relationship' with the rest of the EU. The five-nation future core would be expected to co-ordinate ever more closely not only on monetary policy, in keeping with the plans for economic and monetary union, but also on fiscal, budgetary, economic and social policy. The future structure of an expanding EU, to include not only the Scandinavian countries, but also the emerging democracies of central Europe, was spelt out yesterday by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrats, and the second most powerful man in Germany's ruling party after Chancellor Helmut Kohl. For the first time, they have openly stated their view that Italy can no longer qualify to be a member of the inner core if the EU inevitably moves to multiple speeds, or variable geometry. The expressions mean that different groups of the member states will co-ordinate their policies in different ways, depending on the subject concerned: some will opt for monetary union, others for a common foreign and security policy, and yet a third combination for a common social policy, for example. 'For the formation of European policy this is a period of many crises but also of many chances,' Mr Schauble said. 'Variable geometry . . . gives us better chances to complete this process, given the different, sometimes competing views. We must accept that not every member can accept every step at the same time.' Along with the CDU's sister party, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU), Mr Schauble presented a comprehensive five-point programme for the next phase of radical reform of the EU, intended to reconcile the conflicting demands of ever closer integration with continuing enlargement towards eastern Europe. This includes the overhaul of all the main EU institutions, granting still more democratic control to the European parliament, while limiting the authority of the Council of Ministers, in which the governments of the member states are represented. Apart from the reinforcement of the 'hard core', it also involves ever closer co-ordination between France and Germany, 'raising the quality of relations to a new level'. 'Germany and France form the core of the hard core,' the document, called Reflections on European Policy, says. 'Their special relationship faces a stiff test because it too is beginning to show signs of differentiation of interests and perceptions, which might cause them to drift apart.' It suggests that the two must overcome their differences of opinion on 'fundamental issues of economic policy', including industrial policy and competition, as well as, by implication, trade protectionism. There must also be a debate on the long-term objectives of the common agricultural policy, and on basic features of the future financial system. The other key points in the plan are the reinforcement of the EU's common foreign and security policy, and its enlargement to the east. On foreign and security policy, it stresses the priority needs for a common policy on stabilising central and eastern Europe, development of relations with Russia, and a common policy towards the Mediterranean region, including north Africa. It also singles out development of 'a strategic partnership' with Turkey.</p>

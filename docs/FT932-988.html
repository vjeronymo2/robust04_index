			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Low take up for Blenheim cash call SHARES IN Blenheim, the exhibition organiser, fell to a 16-month low after the company announced a poor response to its Pounds 75.8m convertible preference share issue, launched three weeks ago. The company said that only about half the shares available had been taken up by existing shareholders or placed firm, leaving the balance with conditional placees. Under the structure of the issue, shares were conditionally placed with investors but subject to clawback from ordinary shareholders. Excluding Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Blenheim's largest shareholder, only 20 per cent of existing shareholders had chosen to claw back shares from the conditional placees. Blenheim's shares fell 23p to 425p in light volume. The shares have now fallen 22 per cent, from 542p, since the issue was announced. The issue was unpopular with analysts who said Blenheim had no apparent need for the money. They said the issue, combined with more planned acquisitions, would further cloud Blenheim's underlying earnings, already under scrutiny following a change in financial year end. The take up rate compared unfavourably with a similar issue launched earlier this year by Airtours, the holiday company. In that case, shareholders clawed back 67.5 per cent of their entitlement.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Anglovaal advances to R48.6m ANGLOVAAL, the South African mining company, announced a rise in combined taxed profits for its four gold mines to R48.6m (Dollars 15.4m) in the quarter ending June 30, compared with R42.3m in the preceding quarter, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. The rise was due to improved tonnages and grades at three of the four mines, as well as cost-cutting measures. The group's gold production rose to 10,408 kg from 10,190 kg. Loraine Gold Mines was the only mine to report a loss, which was the result of retrenchment costs of R4.8m. Hartebeestfontein was the only mine to pay tax.</p>

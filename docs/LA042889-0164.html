			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> PUBLIC, WILLING TO WAIT AND SEE, GIVES BUSH A 'C'  </P> <P> Americans are giving President Bush only a "C" grade for his first 100 days in  office, according to the Los Angeles Times Poll.  </P> <P> People are not very excited about the new President. But neither are they  really upset with him. They basically are reserving judgment until later and  not paying a lot of attention at present, the Times survey found.  </P> <P> "Give him a chance," people told the Times poll. "He wants to do the right  thing."  </P> <P> So far, however, Bush's marks are not as high as Ronald Reagan's were at this  comparable stage in their presidencies. The public graded Reagan with a "B"  after 100 days, the poll found eight years ago.  </P> <P> Reagan had been shot 70 days after entering the Oval Office and his ordeal  boosted his popularity. But the assassination attempt accounts for only part of  the difference in attitudes toward the two presidents, various surveys have  indicated. For example, a Times poll a few days before Reagan was shot found  that the public's impression of him even then was higher than it currently is  of Bush.  </P> <P> One of the raps on Bush has been that his Administration is "adrift." And the  poll found evidence that Americans tend to agree with this criticism, with  two-thirds saying the President's "goals are not very clear."  </P> <P> The Times poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, interviewed a random sample of 2,160  American adults by telephone for four days ending last Tuesday night. The  margin of error for this size survey is 3 percentage points in either  direction.  </P> <P> When people were asked, "What kind of report card would you give President  Bush?" the result was a "C" average, with only 11% awarding him an "A." By  contrast, Reagan after 100 days was given an "A" by 35%.  </P> <P> Offered eight comments about Bush and asked to name the one or two best suiting  him, people mostly chose this statement: "We ought to give him a chance." Next  came the observation: "He wants to do the right thing." After that, far down  the list, a relatively small percentage of people chose such comments as: "He  doesn't seem to know where he's going," "He's a nice person" and "He doesn't  care about people like me."  </P> <P> Overall, the people have a positive impression of Bush -- 67% favorable, 20%  unfavorable and 13% not sure. But at this stage eight years ago, when Bush was  merely the vice president, people had an even higher impression of him. It was  86% favorable then.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Lewis Law  </P> <P> "This is a near-perfect example of Lewis' law, which says that if you don't  know much about somebody, you like him," pollster Lewis said of Bush's higher  popularity during the early months of his vice presidency.  </P> <P> During that 1981 period -- 100 days into Reagan's first term -- 83% of those  surveyed held a favorable impression of Reagan, illustrating that he was  considerably more popular than Bush is now. And as an example of the contrast  in excitement levels generated by the two men, twice as many people had a  "very" favorable impression of Reagan as now do of Bush.  </P> <P> Less than half the people interviewed by The Times (47%) "approve of the way  George Bush is handling his job as President." Only 18% disapprove, but 35%  have not formed an opinion about how the President is doing.  </P> <P> At this juncture of Reagan's Administration, by comparison, more than  three-fourths of the people (80%) approved of the President's job performance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oil Spill Seen Hurting  </P> <P> One recent event that probably led to a slippage in Bush's stock was the  Alaskan oil spill. Critics accused the Administration of dragging its feet  before taking control of efforts to clean up the 11 million gallons of crude  oil that leaked into Prince William Sound when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran  aground on March 24. The public generally agrees with the critics, the poll  found.  </P> <P> Of those surveyed, 52% disapproved "of the way President Bush has handled the  oil spill." Only 25% approved and 23% weren't sure.  </P> <P> Also, public suspicion about Bush's involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal has  increased during the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North, the poll  showed. More than one-third of the people say the trial has convinced them that  Bush was more involved than they previously thought. And roughly half believe  the President "has told lies" about the scandal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 75% Like Bush Personally  </P> <P> Although Americans tend to like Bush -- three-fourths say they like him  personally and almost half say they like him now better than during the  election campaign -- they are not especially impressed with his initial moves  as President.  </P> <P> When asked "all things considered" whether they think Bush "has gotten off to a  strong start or a weak start," the vast majority (61%) described the start as  "somewhere in-between." About twice as many people characterized it as weak as  did strong.  </P> <P> Only roughly one-fourth (26%) said they "have a good idea where George Bush  wants to lead the country." About two-thirds (65%) lamented that "his goals are  not very clear."  </P> <P> People are inclined to think that Bush "is continuing the policies of Ronald  Reagan" rather than leading the country in a new direction. But two-thirds said  that Bush, indeed, "should point the country in a new direction."  </P> <P> On some specific issues, people indicated they do not have a lot of confidence  in the new President but their feelings are not strong.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handling of Economy  </P> <P> For example, only one-third approves of Bush's "handling of the nation's  economy." But less than one-fourth disapproves. The biggest block of people,  nearly half, have no opinion at all.  </P> <P> By contrast, two-thirds of those surveyed in a similar Times survey eight years  ago approved of Reagan's handling of the economy, which then was suffering from  high inflation and was about to begin plunging into a deep recession.  </P> <P> The public seems ambivalent about the present economy. Nearly one-fourth says  it is "good," a little more than one-fourth describes it as "bad" and roughly  one-half puts it "somewhere in-between." However, people tend to be pessimistic  about the future economy. Roughly twice as many believe it will be worse next  year as think it will get better.  </P> <P> Nearly two-thirds of the people said they have no confidence that Bush "will be  able to make significant reductions in the federal budget deficit."  Interestingly, almost half those surveyed eight years ago were confident that  Reagan actually would be able to balance the annual budget, which was only $79  billion in the red when he took office and more than twice that when he left.  </P> <P> In the latest poll, three-fourths also doubted that Bush will be able to avoid  asking for a tax increase, despite his repeated "read my lips -- no new taxes"  pledge during the campaign.  </P> <P> On a related matter, those surveyed more often than not regarded the  much-ballyhooed 1986 tax overhaul as "a bad thing." Three times more people  told interviewers they are paying higher income taxes than said they are paying  less.  </P> <P> But again illustrating their fuzziness about Bush, people basically either were  not aware or were divided in their views concerning the President's positions  on banning military-style assault rifles, bailing out troubled savings and loan  institutions and aiding the Nicaraguan Contras.  </P> <P> The jury also is still out on whether Bush will be able to keep his promises to  become "the education President," protect the environment and create "a kinder,  gentler America."  </P> <P> On foreign affairs, 40% approve of Bush's performance. But eight years ago, 68%  approved of how Reagan was handling foreign affairs.  </P> <P> Half of those surveyed felt that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has  "taken more forceful positions in foreign policy" than has Bush. Only  one-fourth believe that Bush has been the more forceful. But nearly two-thirds  think that Bush ultimately will sign an arms control treaty with the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> When asked, "What is the most important problem facing this country?" nearly  two-thirds answered drugs. But three-fourths lacked confidence that Bush "will  be able to bring the drug crisis under control."  </P> <P> Ranking next in importance, but far behind drugs, were the budget deficit and  the economy.  </P> <P> Comparing Bush to Reagan, people tended to think that the new President would  "know more about what's going on in his Administration."  </P> <P> But whatever problems with popularity Bush has pales when compared to his vice  president, Dan Quayle. The public's impression of Quayle is not very high --  31% favorable, 29% unfavorable and 40% not sure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EVALUATING BUSH'S FIRST 100 DAYS  </P> <P> Americans generally have an open mind about George Bush....  </P> <P> Q. What phrases best fit President Bush?  </P> <P> We ought to give him a chance: 50%He wants to do the right thing: 34He doesn't  seem to know where he's going: 15He's a nice person: 15He doesn't care about  people like me: 13He's too close to special interests: 9He doesn't tell the  truth: 9He's a great leader: 7(Adds up to more than 100% because of multiple  responses)  </P> <P> ....but he has yet to win major support on many specifics.  </P> <P> Q.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarussian [Belarusian] First Deputy Prosecutor  General Vladimir Kondratyev said that a criminal case would be  open on the incident involving Aleksandr Lukashenko, MP and  presidential candidate.    Police guarding the government building injured Lukashenko  as  he was going to his office. An ambulance team certified this.    Kondratyev told INTERFAX that, following additional  preliminary inquiry a criminal case would be open within three  days, as required by Belarussian legislation. His office had  received an explanation from the police involved in the  incident. They said that Lukashenko had torn off buttons on  their uniforms.    Lukashenko is now able to go to his office which he had as  chairman of the parliamentary anti-corruption commission.    As a presidential candidate Lukashenko is guarded by  officers  of the Interior Ministry's State Guard Department as well as his  bodyguards.</p>

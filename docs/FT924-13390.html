			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Waste Management up 62% WASTE Management International, the UK-listed arm of Waste Management of the US, yesterday reported a 62 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 40.1m for the three months to 30 September. Most of the rise reflected acquisitions as the company expanded its operations rapidly, although there have also been gains from new business and price increases. Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the company had started to feel the impact of recession in some of its European markets, but economic downturn was also providing new opportunities for acquisitions. Turnover increased 41 per cent to Pounds 210.9m while operating profits increased 48.8 per cent to Pounds 35.4m. During the quarter the company made acquisitions throughout Europe. Net interest charges were Pounds 827,000 (Pounds 463,000). But other income, which includes dividend income from the company's 15 per cent stake in Wessex Water, and foreign exchange earnings increased from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 5.51m. Earnings increased to 6.1p (4.7p). As indicated when its US parent demerged Waste Management International and sold 20 per cent of the shares in April, the company is paying no dividend for the first three years. For the nine months to September 30, turnover increased 34 per cent to Pounds 592.8m, pre-tax profits gained 55 per cent to Pounds 102.7m and earnings increased 34 per cent to 16.8p.</p>

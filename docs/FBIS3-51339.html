According to the report, Chester has reportedly exerted  pressure to have Deputy Carlos Acevedo excluded from the list  headed by Vinicio Villar on which he appeared as a candidate to  the post of first vice president of the Legislative Branch.    It was confirmed that the U.S. official went to the  Legislative Palace yesterday afternoon and sat in the diplomatic  box, where he talked with several deputies, including Cesar  Porres and Rafael Rottmann of MAS [Solidarity Action Movement].  He was also seen talking with Carlos Acevedo shortly before  Acevedo declined to run for first vice president.    The U.S. veto has reportedly occurred because Acevedo was  included on a list of 16 deputies to be purged, and his election  to such an important directorate board post would be considered  "terrible."    When asked about this subject, Acevedo admitted that, in  fact, he had been notified that the U.S. Embassy did not approve  of his election, and that is why MAS demanded he decline the  nomination, but he rejected the speculations, which caught most  of the deputies' interest.    He believes "it was a false alarm, because I personally  spoke  with Mr. Chester and he assured me the embassy did not exert  pressure." Besides, he said the diplomat told him he came to  Congress only to observe the elections, to ascertain they were  carried out within a democratic framework.    Acevedo has said he declined simply to remove an obstacle,  to  avoid being an obstruction, and to allow the negotiations to  continue appropriately. Besides, he believes he has good  relations with the U.S. Embassy, because he has even been  praised for promoting the Narcotics Law and has been invited on  numerous occasions to visit that North American country.</p>

Explains in Detail the Three Great Change Factors That  Will Decide the Future Political Situation, and the Eight  Different Outlooks Stemming From Different Combinations of  Strengths and Weakness of the Three Change Factors"]    [Text] The author of this article is an assistant  professor at the CPC Central Committee Party School who uses a  pen name for reasons that may be inferred. This article makes a  rather brief, complete, and factual exposition of the social and  political situation on the China mainland. The models for  forecasting the post-Deng political situation are also  scientific and fresh. They provide a rare analysis from within  the CPC for the discussion of the post-Deng political situation  that follows.    When people speculate about whether the Chinese political  situation will become chaotic once Deng Xiaoping passes away, I  first define "chaotic" as social and political disorder  resulting from the intensification and eruption of various  social and political contradictions when cohesiveness is lost.  <H5>  Three Great Change Factors That Will Determine the Future </H5> Political Situation    It is apparent from this definition that there are three  main  variables that will determine whether the political situation in  China becomes chaotic once Deng Xiaoping passes away. The first  is the socio-political contradictions (the kind and the  intensity) that accumulate while Deng is still alive; the second  is the degree of cohesiveness and the possibilities for  cohesiveness within the party when Deng passes away; and the  third is economic factors. The correlation among these three  variables is as follows: 1) The correlation between  socio-political contradictions and institutional cohesiveness  is: the higher the degree of cohesiveness within the system, the  more easily social and political contradictions outside the  system can be surmounted. Conversely, the lower the degree of  cohesiveness within the system, the less easily social and  political contradictions outside the system can be surmounted.  2) The correlation between the economic situation and  institutional cohesiveness is as follows: the better the  economic situation, the more easily cohesiveness can be  achieved. Conversely, the worse the economic situation, the more  difficult the achievement of cohesiveness. 3) The correlation  between the economic situation and social contradictions is as  follows: the better the economic situation, the fewer the  contradictions, meaning that even though contradictions may  exist, they will not easily intensify. Conversely, the more  readily contradictions may arise and be difficult to surmount.    This article analyzes the three variables that will  determine  the Chinese political situation after Deng passes away, and it  arranges them to form eight models that show eight possible  scenarios that may unfold.  <H5>  Vermin Who Become Wealthy Overnight Intensify Social </H5> Contradictions    1. Socio-political contradictions    The first important variable determining China's political  future is the social and political contradictions that have  piled up by the time Deng passes away. So-called social  contradictions means the contradictions between unorganized  social forces, such as contradictions between peasants and  urbanites, and contradictions between working people and corrupt  officials or profiteering parvenu merchants. These  contradictions usually stem from unfair distribution or other  inequities or injustices. They are rooted in the distribution  crisis, which is one of the five kinds of political crises that  a society in transition must go through according to the  American Comparative Government Committee (The five are  administrative crisis, participation crisis, legitimacy crisis,  identity crisis, and distribution crisis). By so-called  political contradictions is meant contradictions among organized  political forces (or semi-organized political forces such as  social movements). Contradictions among organized political  forces include contradictions between civil rights forces and  the CPC, as well as contradictions between ethnic separatist  forces and the government. The former example is a manifestation  of the participation crisis; the latter is a manifestation of  the identity crisis.    Since 1984, the contradictions between ordinary and wage and  salary workers and corrupt officials and profiteering parvenu  merchants have become more and more serious. If one acknowledges  that prior to 1989 corrupt officials gobbled up the property  belonging to the whole people through graft, bribe taking,  diversion of public funds for private use, and taking trips at  public expense, then the situation during the past several years  has reached open looting proportions. The contract operating  system, development of the joint stock system, and the formation  of enterprise partnerships and mergers all provide corrupt  officials opportunities to embezzle state-owned assets. Some of  them misappropriate state-owned and collectively owned assets by  colluding with accounting offices, auditing agencies, and notary  organizations to arrange false evaluations, false audits, and  false notarizations. Some misappropriate, illegally divert, or  swindle state or collectively owned property in the name of  contracting. Others insert themselves as middlemen in commercial  and trade activities to get a share of profits that should go to  state-owned or collective enterprises. Still others abuse their  official position to make a profit, gaining equity rights  without paying for them in the course of share system reform,  share listing, and share trading. Some enter into collusion all  around, arrange under-the-counter deals, practice bribery and  get kickbacks for facilitating loans, helping get licenses,  assisting with court cases, assisting press operation, assisting  household registration, and helping handle title deeds. Some  resort to falsification of exports to cheat on tax rebates. Some  abuse their authority to set up private companies abroad, or  engage in off-the-books operations inside China, falsely using  the name of a unit operating abroad or a foreign firm to make  illegal profits... The methods are unusual and varied.    A November 1993 Central Television Broadcasting Station news  report said that 200 billion yuan worth of state-owned assets  had been lost somehow. Some experts estimate that the amount  should have been no less than 300 billion. Where did these  assets go? The fact is they flowed through the hands of corrupt  officials into their own, or their children's and relative's,  pockets. These tremendous assets make them China's new  bourgeoisie in fact as well as in name. While these vermin are  getting rich overnight, or carousing around, betting huge sums  on the roll of the dice, being social butterflies, or throwing  stock markets and exchange markets into turmoil, how many  peasants can get only an IOU for the grain and cotton they sell  the state! How many children cannot attend school because they  are unable to afford 300 yuan for books! And how many  intellectuals, working masses, retired and separated cadres and  workers who have just a few hundred yuan in wages or pension  bemoan the steady rise in prices.    The dissatisfaction of the masses toward corrupt officials  and rich merchants and tycoons is bound to translate into  dissatisfaction with the CPC and the government because, in a  certain sense, this state of affairs might be said to be  directly or indirectly attributable to certain CPC distribution  policies or government's feeble withholding capabilities. What  is more, when the rural price index exceeds the city price index  for the first time, the peasants will want to go after the  government about the various kinds of taxes, assessments and  fines levied in the name of the law. No wonder that during a  visit to a certain county in Hunan Province, when Jiang Zemin  asked a peasant what he needed most, the reply he received was,  "What I need most is Chen Sheng and Wu Guang."    Once social contradictions intensify, they generate a large  scale popular reaction that is bound to create a revolutionary  situation. Whether this revolution is benign (constructive) or  malignant (purely destructive) depends on whether at the time  the revolution occurs a political organization can be formed  that is sensible and that is guided by reform and modernization.  <H5>  The CPC Has Itself Created a Huge Opposition Faction </H5>   The conflict between the civil rights movement and the CPC  has gone on for 15 years since 1979. If one says that the CPC  has been unable to bring corrupt officials to heel, it has also  never been soft on the civil rights movement, not to mention  that since thousands of resisters have been cruelly butchered or  jailed since 4 June 1989. Who knows how many civil rights  movement personnel were jailed in 1989 alone?    Since Wei Jingsheng was sentenced to 15 years in prison in  1979, virtually no one who founded a civilian publication or  held a responsible position in one has escaped misfortune. In  1981 alone, the following people were sentenced to prison or  labor reform: In Beijing, Xu Wenli [1776 2429 4539] and Chen  Erjin [7115 1422 2516] of SIWU LUNTAN [JUNE 4TH FORUM], to 15  and 12 years respectively; in Guangzhou, Wang Xizhe [3769 1585  0772] and Xu Yongliang [1776 3055 5328] of XUEXI TONGXIN [STUDY  COMMUNICATIONS], to 14 and 10 years respectively; in Guangzhou  again He Qiu [0149 3061] of RENMIN ZHI LU [THE PEOPLE'S ROAD],  to 10 years; in Shanghai, Fu Shenqi [0265 3947 1142] of MINZHU  ZHI SHENG [THE PEOPLE'S VOICE], seven years (Released from  prison in 1986, he was jailed again in 1991. He was let out of  jail in February 1991 only to be sentenced to three years labor  reform in 1993). Sun Weibang [1327 4850 6721] of HAILANGHUA [SEA  SPRAY] in Qingdao was sentenced to one year (Following the 4  June incident, he was sentenced to an additional 12 years). In  Wuhan, Qinu Yongmin [4440 3057 2404], Zhang Minpeng [1728 2404  7720], and Zhu Jianpin [2612 0256 2430] of ZHONG SHENG [BELL  SOUND] were sentenced to a respective eight years in prison,  three years in labor reform, and six years in prison. In  Hangzhou, Shen Jianmin [3088 0256 3046] of ZHI JIANG was  sentenced to four years. In Tianjin, Tang Gedan [3282 2047  2481], Liu Shixian [0491 1102 6343] and Lu Honghe [0712 3163  0735] of BOHAI ZHI BIN [SHORES OF BOHAI] were sentenced  respectively to 4 1/2 years imprisonment and three and three  years of labor reform. In Chongqing, Liang Junxi [2733 0193  6007] of GONGMIN BAO [CITIZENS NEWS] was sentenced to an unknown  number of years imprisonment. In Anyang, Liu Eran [0491 0059  1344] of MINZHU ZHUAN [DEMOCRATIC BRICKS] was sentenced to one  year.    Even those members of the civil rights movement who were not  sentenced to jail have been treated with prejudice. An example  is Hu Ping [5170 1627], the editor-in-chief of the former WOTU  [FERTILE EARTH], who was stripped of his masters degree and not  assigned to a job for two years. Following graduation from  university, poet Bei Ling [6296 1545], a member of the editorial  committee of the first issue of the former ZHONGGUO RENQUAN  [CHINESE HUMAN RIGHTS], was deprived of his right to work for  two years following graduation.    Following Deng's remarks during his travels in south  China, the mainland civil rights movement once again became  sctive, and tended toward reasonableness. Its "Peace  Constitution" expressed support for CPC reforms and called for  social reconciliation.    Thanks to the campaign to eradicate spiritual pollution of  1983, the anti-bourgeoisie liberalization campaigns of 1981 and  1987, and the large scale massacre, large scale arrests, and  large scale purges of 1989, the CPC created with its own hands  an enormous opposition faction. This opposition faction includes  not only the activists of the Democracy Wall and election  campaign period, but also those who supported Hu Yaobang's  "Lilun Wuxu Faction" [3810 6158 0523 5711 3175] (people such as  Yan Jiaqi [0917 1367 0366], Zhang Xianyang [1728 7359 2254], Su  Shaozhi [5685 4801 2535], Yu Haocheng [0060 3185 2052], Yu  Guangyuan [0060 0342 6678], Hu Jiwei [5170, 4958 0251], Wang  Ruoshui [3769 5387 3055], Wang Ruowang [3769 5387 2598], Xu  Liangying [6079 5328 5391], Li Honglin [2621 3163 2651], Li Shu  [7812 3412], Guo Luoji [6753 5012 1015], Wu Mingyu [0702 2429  3842], Ge Yang [2047 2254], Ruan Ming [7086 6900], Sun  Changjiang [1327 7022 3068], and Li Rui [2621 6904], plus Zhao  Ziyang's braintrust, the members of the "three institutes and  one association." If one says that each of these civil rights  forces was fighting its own war prior to "June 4th," the "June  4th" repression made them unite and set up a "civil rights  association front" overseas.    The civil rights movement in China is fairly quiet today  because of severe repression and strict control, but it does not  lack a small number of courageous people who have established an  underground organization to carry on resistance activities.  Examples include the "Chinese Freedom and Democracy Party," the  Chinese Free Trade Union Preparatory Committee," and the "China  Progressive League," which the Chinese Communists apprehended in  1991. They were preparing to use a model airplane to scatter  leaflets over Tiananmen Square on 4 June that year calling on  the people not to forget "June 4th." When the incident came to  light, scores of people were arrested, 16 of them in Beijing  including Hu Shigen [5170 4258 2704], Kang Yuchun [1660 3768  2504], Wang Guozhai [3769 0948 7872], Lu Zhigang [7120 2535  0474], Liu Jingsheng [0491 0079 3932], Gao Yuxiang [7559 3768  4382], Wang Tiancheng [3769 0160 1813], Wang Peizhong [37690150  1813], Chen Qinglin [7115 7230 2651], Chen Wei [7115 5898],  Zhang Chunzhu [1728 4783 2612], Rui Chaohuai [5360 2600 2037],  Xing Hongwei [6717 1347 0251], Li Quanli [2621 0356 0448], Xu  Dongling [6079 2639 1545], and Zhang Guojun [1728 0948 6874].    In June 1992, Wang Shengli [3769 0524 0448] and Liao Jian  [1675 0679 1344], Chinese People's University students, were  arrested by the CPC for "counterrevolutionary propaganda  instigation" because they had organized a student's society  called "Book Reading Society" and published a magazine titled  DAJIA [EVERYBODY].    Following Deng Xiaoping's remarks during this travels in  south China, the civil rights movement became active on the  mainland once again, but tended toward reasonableness. The  "Peace Constitution" issued by nine people including Qin Yongmin  [the editor of the former Wuhan magazine, ZHONG SHENG, and Yang  Zhou [2799 0719] expressed this trend. While calling upon the  CPC to release political criminals, abolish counterrevolution as  a crime, and accelerate political system reform, this  constitution also called for peaceful reform. In this regard, it  expressed support for the CPC-led reforms, and called for social  reconciliation. The Chinese Communists response to this moderate  manifesto was to arrest Qin and Yang. This action was tantamount  to refusing to join hands with the civil rights movement on  reform for a peaceful transition to a modern society. It also  stifled the possibility of a benign revolution and avoidance of  the prospect of a destructive, malignant revolution should a  reckless and large scale popular uprising occur.  <H5>  News of Bloody Clashes in Southern Xinjiang and in Lhasa </H5>   The contradiction between the minority nationalities and the  Han nationality is not just a social contradiction. In Xinjiang,  Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, it has become a political  contradiction as well. For many years, organized ethnic  separatists have fought for the independence of Xinjiang and  Xinjiang. Their political goal is the establishment of a  Turkestan and Turpan republic. Despite the strict news blockade,  one still hears about bloody clashes in southern Xinjiang and  Lhasa. The 22 November 1985 demonstration and presentation of a  petition by more than 3400 Uygur students from all Beijing  institutions of higher education opposing the government's use  of Xinjiang as a nuclear weapons test range, and as a place for  the banishment of criminals is well known.    The intense ethnic conflicts and bloody clashes in Inner  Mongolia are apparently not as serious as those in Xinjiang and  Tibet; nevertheless, the Mongol hatred of the Han and their  anti-foreign sentiment is no less than that of the Uygurs and  the Tibetans. The source of the trouble is the purge of the  Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party [MPRP] during the  Cultural Revolution. This party was originally a Mongolian  anti-Japanese resistance organization, which was subsequently  merged with the CPC. During the Cultural Revolution, acting on  orders of the CPC Central Committee, the MPRP Central  Committee's first secretary, chairman of the revolutionary  committee, and commander of the military region, Teng Haiqing  [3326 3189 3237], said that an MPRP whose goal was the merger of  Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia still existed in Inner  Mongolia, and that ethnic Mongolians in the CPC were members of  this party. Thus a mammoth, pervasive, and sustained campaign of  "ferreting out and purging" was launched. During the course of  this campaign, 100,000 ethnic Mongolian Party cadres were  arrested and locked up, and more than 10,000 were beaten to  death. Most of those doing the beating were ethnic Han who used  extremely brutal medieval torture implements, such as drilling  holes into people's bodies with a red hot iron chopstick, or  suspending a large iron cauldron filled with water on steel  wires from the neck of a person being interrogated, then making  him stand arms stretched sideward on a high bench at the end of  a fire pit, the cauldron hanging in a roaring fire until the  water in it reached a rolling boil and scalded the person being  interrogated till he had no choice but to confess. Many people  died from this torture because they refused to confess. To this  day, whenever the term "ferret out and purge" is mentioned,  ethnic Mongolians gnash their teeth, and when Teng Haiqing is  mentioned, they would like to eat his flesh and skin him.  <H5>  Three Large Chinese Communist High Level Factions </H5>   2. Cohesiveness Within the System and Ability of the System  To Maintain Cohesiveness When Deng Passes Away    The second important variable determining China's political  future is cohesiveness within the system and the ability of the  system to maintain cohesiveness. There are four groups whose  cohesiveness must be maintained: all party factions, local power  factions, civil rights forces and ethnic separatist forces, and  various mass organizations and social forces.    1. All Party Factions    The main high level factions in the CPC today are as  follows:    (A) The main line faction of which Jiang Zemin is the  "nucleus," which is now being built and whose perimeters are as  yet undemarcated. Since becoming CPC Committee secretary  general, Jiang has made no contributions to ideological theory  or to modernization plans or lines, but he has put a lot of  effort into accumulating strength and gaining power. He knows  very well the importance of military support. In contrast to  Zhao Ziyang, who never concerned himself with military affairs  when he was vice chairman of the Military Affairs Committee,  Jiang seeks out persons in charge in all sectors of the Military  Affairs Committee and military regions for individual chats. He  has also transferred to Beijing his old comrade-in-arms and  former Shanghai garrison commander Ba Zhongtan [1572 0022 6151],  promoting him to commander-in-chief of the People's Armed  Police. The incumbent chairman of the CPC Office, Zeng Qinghong  [2582 1987 4767] is also a secretary who Jiang Zemin brought  from Shanghai. In addition, CPC Propaganda Department director  Gong Xinhan [7895 1800 3466], Chinese Social Sciences Academy  deputy director Liu Ji [0491 0679], and RENMIN RIBAO deputy  editor-in-chief, Zhou Ruijin [0719 3843 6855] are all people  Jiang transferred to important posts from Shanghai.    This shows somewhat that he subconsciously fears a  repetition  of the 1976 Hua, Ye, and Wang seizure of the "gang of four." If  one says that prior to 1992 Jiang's work emphasis was on  opposition to the right and prevention of peaceful evolution,  since the remarks of Deng Xiaoping during his travels in south  China, one must admit that he has suddenly changed into a  vanguard for reform. He is currently employing the three volumes  of Deng's selected works as a banner for increasing cohesiveness  in order to consolidate his own "nuclear" position in the hope  of creating a mainline faction within the party. Whether such a  mainline faction can be formed and its ability to achieve  cohesiveness with other factions holds great importance for the  future stability of the political situation. However, the most  unfavorable factor for the formation of this mainline faction  and its cohesiveness is Jiang himself. Possibly as long as Deng  lives, he will be found hand and foot, but whatever the case,  his left lining and his mediocre performance since 1989 have  left an indelible impression in people's minds. Unless Jiang and  his faction can do something spectacular in the days immediately  following Deng's demise, one can imagine how weak his ability to  achieve cohesiveness will be.    B. The leftist faction united around the person of Deng  Liqun  [6772 0500 5028]. Historically, the persistence of leftism in  the CPC has been an extremely serious ailment. The power of the  leftist faction is deep-rooted. Even during the decade of reform  and opening to the outside world, the leftist faction has been  able to organize forces to make three major comebacks in 1981,  1983, and 1987. The power of the leftist faction increased  greatly in the wake of "June 4th." Not only did it take the  opportunity to settle scores with the reform faction, but it  also took back many important powers from the central government  to local governments, and from party affairs to the government.  It also used the public opinion and propaganda power it held to  instigate a constant leftist clamor, even going so far as to say  that the seizure of the capitalist roaders during the Cultural  Revolution was correct (a speech that Deng Liqun made  commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the  CPC). "The theory of continuing revolution under the  dictatorship of the proletariat remains the touchstone for  differentiating true and false Marxism" (State Education  Commission document written to provide guidance to professors at  East China Teachers College in Shanghai). It said that it is  necessary to "seize the initiative in handling contradictions"  anew. (An article written by Deng Liqun published in the 23  October 1991 issue of RENMIN RIBAO). In order to seize this  initiative, this faction is preparing to do battle with the  reform faction after Deng passes away. It is collecting and  collating all sorts of typical materials to criticize Deng's  rightist errors.  Zemin is using the three volumes of Deng's selected works  as a banner to increase conformity and consolidate his own  "nuclear" position in the hope of shaping a future mainstream  faction within the party.    C. The reform faction. The people generally regarded as  comprising the reform faction include incumbent Politburo  members Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Tian Jiyun, former  Politburo members Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili, and former  Secretariat secretaries Zhu Houze, Yan Mingfu, and Rui Xingwen.  Their reform orientations are not entirely the same. For  example, Zhao Ziyang not only advocates market-oriented economic  reforms, but also stands for a considerable degree of opening to  the outside world, democracy, and freedom. Some of the others  may want to build a market economy first and then talk about  freedom and democracy. Some only approve of a market economy,  but basically do not agree with espousing freedom and democracy.  These differences mean that although the CPC high level reform  faction can maintain unanimity in the face of leftwing faction  attacks on reform and opening to the outside world, it may split  on political reform issues. Reportedly, Zhao Ziyang and others  are pondering the problem of how to redress the June 4th events.  Once Deng passes away, the NPC and the CPPCC, which Qiao Shi,  Tian Jiyun, and Li Ruihuan head may become bases for  consolidating the reform faction and for pushing ahead with  reform and opposition to the counterattacks of the leftist  faction.  <H5>  Three Main Ways of Gaining Cohesiveness Within the CPC </H5>   Once Deng dies, no matter whether the leftist faction first  rises in revolt or whether the reform faction, which advocates  political reform, rises in revolt, a clash between the two  factions will surely be difficult to avoid. What role elder  statesmen like Chen Yun and Bo Yibo will play in this clash at  that time is also difficult to estimate. Generally speaking the  tactics that the CPC has used to produce conformity within the  party have been the leaders (personal charisma), the system, and  ideology. When Mao Zedong was alive, all three of these  methods played a role; consequently, cohesiveness within the  party was extremely high at that time. Since the advent of  reform and opening to the outside world, a unified ideology has  become virtually useless in achieving cohesiveness, and the  system cohesiveness that Deng has always hoped to build has yet  to be realized. Thus, all that is left is the cohesiveness that  the leaders individually can bring. Even during Deng's lifetime,  his record, ability, and charisma could not bring cohesiveness  within the party. (During "June 4th," Deng's personal ability to  bring cohesiveness was also in danger; he could maintain his  authority only by relying on military force, and it was not  until after his remarks during the visit to south China that his  charisma and legitimacy revived). Once Deng dies, there will be  no one having a record (Jiang became a party member only in  1947). Furthermore, once Jiang, who lacks ability and charisma,  has lost the means to use ideology and the system, will he be  able to harmonize and reconcile clashes within the party?  <H5>  Local Power Faction Too Cumbersome To Be Effective </H5>   2. The Local Power Faction    Thanks to the delegation of legislative authority, authority  over the assignment of people, and fiscal authority during the  past decade, local governments' power and financial resources  have increased greatly. It is on this foundation that local  power factions that are too cumbersome to be effective have  taken shape. In recent years, some local legislation has dared  to defy central government legislation. When central government  policies and directives reach local governments, they are either  not implemented or their emphasis or flavor is changed. Zhu  Rongji's macroeconomic regulation and control (the 16 articles),  of June 1993 aimed at getting rid of "local princelings" policy  making, but the abortion of this effort was announced after just  three months, thereby showing that the central government is  unable to impose cohesiveness in the face of local power  factions opposition.    Ever since institution of the system of dividing revenues  and  expenditures between the central government and local  governments and holding each responsible for balancing its own  budget in 1980, the central government's financial resources  have fallen seriously. The state's percentage of fiscal revenues  declined from 31.2 percent in 1978 to 14.7 percent in 1992.  During the Seventh 5-Year Plan (1986-1990), the ratio between  central government fiscal revenues and local government fiscal  revenues declined further to 40:60. If unbudgeted funds are  figured into fiscal revenues, the central government's fiscal  revenues amount to only one-fifth of total revenues. In some  western countries, coordination of the relationship between the  central government and local governments depends largely on some  effective institutions such as Congress or the Bundesrat. In  China, the central government's main instruments for bringing  local governments into line are fiscal authority and the  authority to allocate resources. When the central government  regularly has to beg from local governments to get by, one can  imagine how much power it has to bring local governments into  line.    Another example that reflects the increase in strength of  local power factions versus the central government is the  increase in the number of local representatives in the  Politburo: Before 1982, not a single one of the 12th Party  Central Committee's 28 Politburo members and candidate members  was a local cadre. In the 1987 13th Party Central  Committee-created Politburo, four of the 18 members and  candidate members were local representatives; and in the  Politburo that the 14th Party Central Committee produced in  1992, six of the 22 members and candidate members were local  representatives.    In order to increase the central government' financial  resources as a means of keeping local governments in line, the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee  decided to institute a tax division system beginning in 1994,  the central feature of which was readjustment of the taxation  structure. Customs duties, bank financing insurance taxes, and  income taxes paid by post and telecommunications and railroad  enterprises would be given to the central government, and income  taxes from ordinary enterprises would be given to local  governments. At the same time, the Bureau of Taxation would be  divided into a central government bureau and a local government  bureau, each of them collecting its own kinds of taxes. This  measure was designed to ensure the central government's fiscal  revenues. Had it been possible to institute these measures, they  would truly have increased the central government's authority;  however, the central government's existing authority had to be  relied on to put these measures into effect. This gave rise to a  contrary theory. Reportedly, a report from the Chinese Academy  of Social Sciences warned the Central Committee: Institution of  a tax division system in China in 1994 would produce social  instability.  <H5>  The Armed Forces Are Absolutely Not Willing Suppressors </H5>   3. Civil Rights Forces and Ethnic Separatist Forces    In order to enforce cohesiveness, a political system has to  be able to incorporate newly emerging social forces and  political groups into its own system as they appear. This means  that institutionalized channels for participation must be set  up. In modern political science terms, this denotes  institutional expansion and development of the ruling party's  power. However, the Chinese Communists promote a  self-contradictory policy. During the past 10 years, they have  steadily promoted a splitting up of the social and political  structure (a structural split is bound to create a pluralization  of social interests and a pluralization of social groups);  however, they have refused and restricted the demands for  government participation of the newly emerging social and  political forces that splitting of the structure generates. A  steadily increasing participation crisis has been the result.  Moreover, when a participation crisis occurs, the CPC not only  does not readjust its own policies but uses force to repress it.  Thus, not only are the contradictions not resolved, but they  steadily intensify and accumulate. Chinese Communist political  thinking has always maintained that the urban society and that  society's representatives -- the civil rights forces -- brought  about by the split are antagonistic forces (when actually this  is not necessarily so; the civil rights organization could play  a role within the system of a loyal opposition), and that the  spontaneous participation of civil rights groups is "causing  trouble."    The Chinese Communists also believe that dialogue and other  forms of equality are something that the civil rights forces may  not enjoy. They can only use force to wipe out the civil rights  movement. However, the fact is that force has not been able to  wipe out the civil rights movement. During the past 10 years the  civil rights movement has developed and grown stronger. It  became so strong that the Chinese Communists had to use  conventional forces and tanks to deal with it. However, history  has shown that armed forces positively are not a willing  suppressor. Deng is the only person who can use the armed forces  against their own will. Once Deng is gone, should another civil  rights movement storm arise, will Jiang Zemin, in his capacity  as chairman of the Central Military Affairs Committee, be able  to for the armed forces to aim their muzzles on the public?  Might not the armed forces split when faced with such an order?  <H5>  Chinese Communist Organizational System Lax and </H5> Disintegrating    4. All Kinds of Mass Organizations and Social Forces    Aside from the methods cited above for enforcing social  cohesiveness, namely charismatic leaders, Marxist-Leninist and  Mao Zedong Though ideology, and force, the Chinese Communists  must rely largely on strict party organization and a pervasive  organizational system from top to bottom. In the rural villages,  this is communes; in cities, it is "units."    Some people believe that China has no society, just "units."  This is because society is within "units." Every commune and  "unit" is a small society. This analysis makes very good sense.  Since communes and "units" perform social security and social  supervision functions, they play a role in social cohesiveness.  However, following reform and opening to the outside world, the  separation of government administration and social management,  and the separation of government administration and enterprise  management has enabled society to begin to separate from the  state. Development of a market economy will further accelerate  this trend; thus, society will develop in the direction of a  pluralization of interests, and a pluralization of blocs.  Simultaneous with the trend toward disintegration of the  communes and "units" that formerly enforced social cohesiveness,  new social organizations able to take over the communes' and  "units'" cohesiveness functions, namely mass organizations, will  be in a state of either no healthy development or atrophy (like  after "June 4th"] owing to strict Chinese Communist restrictions  (the need to have approval from and be controlled by a higher  level administrative authority and a civil government  department). Thus, full and correct expression and coordination  of social interests will be difficult. The weakness of social  self-rule and the ability of self-rule organizations, as well as  the current increase in the crime rate and the chaotic state of  social order foreshadow future social unrest.  <H5>  Ordinary People's Income and Prices Cause Popular Revolt </H5>   3. Economic Situation    The third major variable determining China's political  future  is the state of the economy when Deng dies. How well the economy  does is not only the foundation for the legitimacy of the  Chinese Communist's role, but also directly affects the degree  of cohesiveness within the system, and the intensity of social  contradictions and social conflicts. Many political crises stem  from economic crisis. One need look no farther for examples than  the 1988 collapse of the effort to battle down prices, which led  to major central government personnel and policy readjustments,  and the campus unrest of 1989. The Chinese Communist's reason  for doling out huge amounts of money since 1989 to subsidize the  losses of state-owned enterprises in violation of market laws is  fear of an economic decline (depression) that might bring about  civil unrest.    When we regard the economic system as a variable affecting  China's political future, our focus is mostly on superficial  factors such as income and prices that can cause public anguish  and a sense of frustration, and only secondarily on policy  issues such as the speed, or the regulation and control of  development and reform that can cause splits within the party.  <H5>  2. Eight Political Situation Prospects After Deng </H5>   Eight models can be derived by grouping the foregoing three  variables that will determine government in China after Deng.  These eight models show eight possible scenarios for the Chinese  political situation after Deng dies. (See table). However, they  are all only starting points for changes in ;the Chinese  government after Deng; they are not the final results.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Outlook for the Chinese Political Situation                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Degree                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The three variables that |Strong                   |Weak                     |  |will determine China's p-|                         |                         |  |olitical prospects after |                         |                         |  |Deng                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Degree of cohesiveness w-|1                        |4                        |  |ithin the system, and sy-|                         |                         |  |stem cohesiveness possib-|                         |                         |  |ilities                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Social-political contrad-|2                        |5                        |  |ictions                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Economic situationx      |3                        |6                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Ideal Political, Economic, and Social Outlook, After Deng </H5> <H5>  The key variable among the three variables affecting the </H5> future is the degree of cohesiveness among the top echelons of  the CPC. If the CPC dares to carry out political reform, China's  outlook will be extremely optimistic.    Model 1 (1+3+5): Stable Model    Sustained and consistent growth of the industrial and  agricultural economy, with more rational readjustments of the  industrial structure accompanying economic growth; more  pervasive reform of the economic system; establishment of a  market system; formation within the CPC of a mainstream faction  in which Jiang Zemin is the nucleus, and whose authority is  stable, with Jiang continuing Deng's line of reform and opening  to the outside world, and receiving major support from within  the party. Despite clashes between left and right wing factions,  the general welfare is not impaired; the armed forces are  stable, and they continue to play a role in backstopping reform  and opening to the outside world. Smooth implementation of the  tax division system increases the cohesiveness of the central  government, and localism is curbed. Despite the existence and  frequent occurrence of socio-political contradictions, and  although they produce large scale social tumult, they pose no  threat to Chinese Communist rule. Agriculture's increased output  and the increased income it provides, a rise in prices paid the  peasants for grain and cotton, and payment of money [rather than  IOUs] for grain purchases permits the peasants to maintain their  income at the level of previous years or increase it. The  development of township and town enterprises absorbs large  amounts of surplus agricultural manpower, thereby reducing  pressures on the cities from drifters. Growth of industry and  price stability or a rise in the income of urbanites that excess  the degree of rise in prices calms urban sentiment. Crackdowns  on graft and corruption promote social justice, thereby  increasing the legitimacy of the regime. All these events play a  role in stabilizing society. Although a small number of civil  rights groups and civil rights movement people constantly call  for the release of political prisoners in order to redress "June  4th" and quicken political reform, not only is this difficult to  do on a very large scale while the CPC is in process of changing  from force to a policy of limited opening up, but it might lead  to the development of an opposition faction within the system.    All the foregoing is an ideal social, economic, and  political  scenario after Deng passes away. However, realization of this  scenario will depend, first of all, on how many more years Deng  lives so that his authority may be relied upon for completion of  the building of a market economy to enable Jiang Zemin to  fashion a mainstream faction, and to be able to bring the armed  forces and local governments in line. Second, it depends on  Jiang Zemin's policy innovations such as continuing reform and  opening to the outside world, not yielding to or compromising  with the leftists, cracking down severely on graft and  corruption, accepting modern political concepts, gradually  opening the way for democracy, and bringing opposition factions  outside the system into the system as an opposition faction.  Third, it depends on the favor of heaven to bring in continuous  bumper harvests.    Since these objective conditions are not likely to be in  being at the same time, the prospects for model 1 are not great.  <H5>  A Transition to Stability or Turmoil </H5>   Model 2 (1+2+3): Model for a Transition to Turmoil.    Jiang Zemin's mainstream has taken shape and his power has  been consolidated. Within the party, a strong consensus exists,  the degree of cohesiveness is high, and the CPC's cohesiveness  with local governments, the central government, and society is  very strong. The good economic situation has further enhanced  the legitimacy of the CPC regime, and it has improved unity  within the party and within the armed forces, and between the  CPC and local governments. Despite severe social contradictions  and CPC clashes with forces outside the systems, these are of  short duration. Unrest is quelled very quickly. The civil rights  movement is either suppressed or brought within the system.    Model 3. (3+4+5): Model for A Transition to Turmoil.    Economic growth continues; the people's livelihood is  relatively stable; and contradictions between society and  government are not severe. However, Jiang Zemin's mainstream  faction and the cohesiveness of all factions in the party could  not be achieved while Deng was alive. Jiang's authority fails of  recognition. Temporary stability cannot last for long. Clashes  may erupt at any time among factions within the party, between  the central government and local governments, and between the  CPC and forces outside the system. Model 3 is a short-lived  transitional stage.    Model 4 (1+5+6): Model for a Transition to Stability.    A mainstream faction has taken shape within the party; Jiang  Zemin's authority has been consolidated. Cohesiveness within the  party is fairly high, and the system is quite cohesive. Although  conflicts between society and the government occur at times,  they pose no threat to the system. Despite some problems in the  economy, the CPC and the government have the will and the time  to solve them to realize the model 1 scenario. This situation  does not rule out two other possibilities, namely a worsening of  the economic situation as a result of policy mistakes, social  turmoil occurring as a result, or intensification of political  contradictions with forces outside the system, the country  ending up with the model 5 scenario. If economic factors and  socio-political contradictions cause further clashes within the  party, the CPC will lose its existing cohesiveness advantage.  The state will sink into a tumultuous model 7 scenario to face a  revolutionary situation.  <H5>  Benign or Malignant Revolution </H5>   Model 5 (1+2+6): Clash and Confrontation Model    A mainstream faction has taken shape in the party; Jiang  Zemin's authority has been consolidated; cohesiveness within the  party is high; and cohesiveness with forces outside the system  is also fairly strong. The economy has regressed; agriculture  has atrophied; industrial concerns are operating under capacity  creating an increase in the number of drifters and the  unemployed; income has decreased; there is inflation and prices  have soared; and the renminbi has been devalued provoking cries  of discontent all around. Collapse of the stock market causes  stock market turmoil. Popular revolts break out; and the civil  rights movement surges. The CPC and its system face a strong  challenge from social and civil rights forces. This  confrontation may last for a fairly long time, and may lead to a  split within the party. Two outcomes are possible: Either the  party's reform faction seizes control and reaches an agreement  with the civil rights movement, China thereby taking a political  reform road, or the party's conservative faction comes to power  and uses force to put down the civil rights movement and  uprisings, China regressing to a sealed off and conservative  state. No matter which occurs, the attitude of the armed forces  will be decisive.    Model 6 (2+3+4): Benign Revolution Model    The economy continues to grow with no large scale outbreaks  or reckless and destructive uprisings. Within the party,  cohesiveness is low, and the system's ability to bring  cohesiveness is poor. Factional fights and power struggles  within the party are intense. Local "princelings" have much  strength; and graft and corruption are serious. The public makes  a huge outcry as centrifugal forces in the party grow. At the  same time, another surge occurs in the civil rights movement,  which is becoming organized and cohesive. This scenario is a  benign revolution scenario whose most likely outcome is a link  up between the reform faction within the party and the civil  rights forces to bring down the conservatives and gain power to  put China on a democratic reform path.    Model 7 (2+4+6) A revolutionary model (in which the outlook,  whether benign or malignant, is uncertain)    Both cohesiveness within the system and the system's ability  to bring cohesion are very weak. Contradictions between society  and government are very grave. This turn of events is  strengthened by deterioration of the economy. Consequently,  China faces a revolutionary situation. The key element at this  time is the degree of organization of the reform forces (the  reform faction within the party and the civil rights forces).  Whether the revolution will be benign or malignant will depend  on this.    Model 8 (4+5+6) A revolutionary transitional model.    In this scenario, both the government and society are very  weak. Factions within the party overlap and fight for power.  Local "princelings" are very strong; "independent kingdoms"  exist. The economy is in depression. Clashes between society and  the government are quiescent, but this scenario cannot last for  long, because deterioration of the economy is bound to intensify  social conflicts. Splits within the party also provide  development opportunities for the civil rights movement, the  prospects for which may be those given in model 7.  <H5>  The Key Lies in the Cohesiveness of the CPC Upper Echelon </H5>   The foregoing eight models show that the key variable of the  three major variables affecting China's future political outlook  is the degree of cohesiveness of the upper echelon of the CPC.  To a very large extent, the extent to which other conflicts may  intensify and produce a crisis depends on whether a compromise  may be reached among the contending factions within the CPC to  produce a consensus and produce cohesion. If clashes do not  intensify between the ultra-leftist faction and the reform  faction within the party, and if the upper echelon of the CPC  does not split, the local "princelings" will find it difficult  to grow in power, and ethnic separatism will not succeed. In  that case, even if an economic crisis occurs, it can be handled;  and should uprisings occur, they can be very quickly quelled.    Everyone remembers that the Democracy Wall movement of 1979  developed out of a crevice in the struggle between the reform  faction and the whatever faction. The campus unrest of 1989 also  developed into a nationwide democratic movement against a  background of struggle between Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng. If the  CPC mainstream faction can produce policy innovations at the  same time that a high degree of cohesiveness exists within the  system, not only will there be economic development in the midst  of stability but political system reforms can also be ventured  while controlling the situation. Thus, party factions can  operate within the law; fights within the party can play out  within the rules, the armed forces can become nationalized, and  the government structure can be federalized. Thus, the NPC and  the CPPCC will be able to play a greater role in supervising the  government and political life, establishing a senate-like  structure to coordinate the interests of the central government  and local governments, and the interests of one local government  and another. Then, prohibitions on speech, the press, and party  can be gradually removed, and non-violent civil rights movements  can be brought within the system. In this way, organic  cohesiveness founded on modern principles can be attained. At  that time, China's prospects will be extremely optimistic.</p>

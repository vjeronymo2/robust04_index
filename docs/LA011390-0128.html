			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FRUSTRATED HART DROPS 4TH IN A ROW, 82-63  </P> <P> Despite a starting lineup that includes no player over 6-foot-1, a pesky  Alhambra High squad proved to be too much for Hart, whose starters average  6-foot-4.  </P> <P> Alhambra handed Hart its fourth consecutive loss, 82-63, Friday night in a  Foothill League boys' game at Alhambra.  </P> <P> Hart (11-6, 0-2) let its frustrations show as the Indians were called for five  technicals. Micah Ohlman and Chad Hourigan were ejected.  </P> <P> Hung Duong led Alhambra with 24 points and Hon Trieu added 22 off the bench.  Hart's Marty Downen scored 12.  </P> <P> Alhambra (14-2, 2-0) held a 34-25 advantage at the half, but blew the game open  in the third quarter, outscoring Hart, 25-11. Alhambra led by as many as 28.  </P> <P> The Moors scored the first 12 points of the second half before Hourigan hit a  short jump shot with 4:39 to play in the third period.  </P> <P> Hart led, 18-15, with 6:12 left in the second quarter but Trieu hit three  consecutive three-point baskets. The Moors never relinquished their lead. KIRBY  LEE  </P></p>

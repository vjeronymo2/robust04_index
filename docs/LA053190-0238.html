			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> S. CAROLINA U. PRESIDENT RESIGNS  </P> <P> The president of the University of South Carolina has resigned after weeks of  criticism about lavish spending on fund-raising trips and hiring of celebrities  as visiting teachers, officials said today.  </P> <P> James B. Holderman, 54, who has headed the 40,000-student state university  since 1977, will step down July 1.  </P> <P> Holderman made no reference to the controversy when he announced his  resignation Wednesday, and declined to answer reporters' questions.  </P> <P> Holderman regularly used luxury hotels while on fund-raising trips; hired  $35-an-hour chauffeured limousine services in Washington, and frequently  chartered jets or flew first class, records showed.  </P> <P> Jihan Sadat, widow of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, was paid $200,000 to  teach a course in Egyptian culture for three semesters in 1985 and 1986.  </P> <P> More recently, the school has drawn criticism for paying actor-director Robby  Benson $158,367 to teach filmmaking and $15,600 for rent, with Holderman  kicking in $10,000 from his discretionary fund for travel and moving expenses.  </P></p>

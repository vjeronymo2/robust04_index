			<p>BFN     [Text] Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani has accused  Golboddin Hekmatyar, the prime minister of that country, of  triggering the current round of fighting and the war during the  past two years. He reiterated that he would not accept the  opposition's request to give up power.    According to a Central News Unit report from Kabul, Rabbani,  who was speaking during 'Id al-Adha prayers among his supporters  in Jabal Saraj, north of Kabul, claimed: The government's  resignation today would lead to chaos in the country. At the  same time, the Afghan president said that if a grand council  [shuray-e bozorg] were to be formed by the representatives of  the people of Afghanistan, he would unconditionally accept the  decisions of that council on selecting a president and a  cabinet. He called for the cooperation of all factions for the  formation of such a council in 40 days' time, when his term of  office comes to an end.    The rival factions in the Afghan war are observing a  cease-fire on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha. Kabul and the rest  of Afghanistan's towns and cities have been calm so far.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / US oil import fee unlikely this year The US government says it is unlikely that an oil import fee will be included in any measures to help the domestic petrol industry deal with weak oil prices this year. Mrs Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, told the Financial Times that the fee, which some members of Congress say is needed to prevent cheaper imports from displacing some high-cost domestic production, is not 'do-able this year'. But she didn't want to crush the enthusiasm of those advocating such a policy, and the idea would be assessed along with other proposals to help the US industry. The administration is considering the energy department's proposed natural gas and oil initiative, which would help keep marginal wells in production. A final decision on the initiative is due on May 7. Various congressional proposals, including one which would reduce the royalty rate on domestic petroleum production, are also being considered. Mrs O'Leary said the criteria for all proposals are 'what does it cost, what are the benefits in terms of more production and reserves, and how can we offset it', so that it did not affect budget deficit reduction targets. A separate assessment was being made of the merits of offering special help to high-risk oil exploration projects in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico. The assessment should be completed next month. She said 'taxpayers should not subsidise' projects that could be profitably undertaken by oil companies. However she favoured a flexible approach that would help projects in frontier areas which might otherwise not be developed.</p>

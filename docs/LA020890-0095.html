			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST HOLLYWOOD CALLS FOR END TO SPRAYING OF MALATHION  </P> <P> The architect of West Hollywood's "cruelty free zone" for animals failed to  persuade the City Council on Monday night to make the city a "malathion free  zone."  </P> <P> But City Councilman Paul Koretz did persuade his colleagues to unanimously  approve a resolution calling for an end to aerial spraying of the pesticide in  Los Angeles County until it is proven not harmful to humans.  </P> <P> Malathion is the pesticide used by state agricultural officials in recent years  to attempt to eradicate the crop-destroying Medfly.  </P> <P> "They are routinely spraying this substance that can rust the paint off your  car," said Koretz, author of the resolution. "How safe can that be for your  lungs?"  </P> <P> Koretz, who works for the California League of Conservation Voters, an  environmental protection lobbying group, admits that the malathion resolution  is little more than a symbolic gesture, but he said he hopes the action sends a  message to state legislators.  </P> <P> "I guess there's not much we could really do if they wanted to spray us again,"  he said.  </P> <P> The West Hollywood City Council at times is criticized by residents of the  1.9-square-mile city for supporting resolutions that have little concrete  effect.  </P> <P> In recent months, Koretz has authored resolutions banning the use of  steel-jawed traps on animals in the heavily urban city, creating a "cruelty  free zone" for animals, and urging a moratorium on the cutting of old-growth  redwood trees. Koretz was not able to persuade council members and city staff  Monday night to go further than a symbolic gesture. His original resolution  called for the drafting of an ordinance that would have banned all malathion  spraying within West Hollywood's borders.  </P> <P> But such a ban would have been superseded by state law and would have been  unenforceable, City Atty. Michael Jenkins said.  </P> <P> West Hollywood, though not known for the agriculture that attracts Medflies,  from time to time has endured aerial bombing of malathion -- most recently in  October, 1988. City officials are worried about health hazards from the  pesticide.  </P> <P> "Some studies show that AIDS sufferers might be particularly susceptible to  deleterious effects of malathion," Koretz said. A substantial number of the  county's patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome live in West  Hollywood.  </P> <P> In an interview Monday, one of the authors of a 1980 state study used to  demonstrate the safety of malathion disavowed that report's findings. Marc A.  Lappe, a professor of health and ethics at the University of Illinois, who was  part of a 1980 state risk-assessment team, said the pesticide may pose a danger  to infants, the elderly, and the sick.  </P> <P> Though West Hollywood's malathion resolution is unlikely to persuade state  officials to halt malathion spraying, the city is jumping into the fray just as  the idea of a ban is gathering steam across the state.  </P> <P> In passing the resolution, the council was responding to the most recent  assault on the crop-destroying pests by state agriculture officials. While  Californians in spray areas have long complained that the sticky, yellow  pesticide ruins car paint, several residents groups in recent weeks have voiced  concerns that the pesticide may pose greater health hazards than state  officials admit.  </P></p>

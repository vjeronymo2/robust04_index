			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Markets may yet trump Spain's ace / Assessing the reaction to the reimposition of capital controls SPAIN'S decision yesterday to reimpose capital controls less than eight months after triumphantly lifting them could damage its decade-long campaign to streamline its domestic financial markets and present itself as a modern, transparent, place of business. Until yesterday morning the markets might have expected the Spanish authorities to do two things to protect their currency from the speculative turmoil in European currency markets - seek an official or unofficial devaluation, or raise interest rates. Instead, the Bank of Spain has resorted, it insists temporarily, to the administrative regulatory mechanisms reminiscent of the days when economic policy was designed to keep foreigners away. On the face of it, triggering such thinly-disguised exchange controls by the Bank of Spain is a desperate attempt to avoid the orthodox. By introducing highly punitive measures against all who take positions against the peseta, Madrid's monetary authorities have ostensibly fired a broadside at speculators who have been hammering the currency for a week. 'Essentially Madrid told the money markets: 'Don't think you have got all the aces up your sleeve, we have some too',' said Ms Wendy Niffiker, chief European economist at James Capel in London. And according to Mr Anthony Wands, director general of pension fund managers, Pastor Alliance, in Madrid: 'The effect is that years of careful grooming of the Spanish markets as they come of age has now been reversed. We are back in the stone age as a result of a transitory measure aimed at stopping those who hammer the peseta.' Official interest rates in Spain stand at 13 per cent and the government is already desperately trying to staunch huge budget over-runs through a mixture of tax increases and spending cuts. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, must call a general election within a year and while two weeks ago analysts were confidently predicting a fall in interest rates next year, an increase now, or a further inflationary devaluation, could seriously threaten the government's already shaky credibility. The speculators have clearly homed in on a depressing set of Spanish fundamentals. Leaked portions of the 1993 budget draft forecast GDP growth of just 0.7 per cent year and unemployment of more than 3m or over 20 per cent of the labour force. Central bank intervention, meanwhile, had come to be viewed as providing the markets with a one-way bet. The reasoning is that if the D-Mark zone currencies are discounted, together with the franc, because they have support and if the marginal currencies are ignored, then the peseta emerges as the prized target in every speculator's viewfinder. 'The peseta is the most 'attackable' currency right now,' said Mr Francesc Guardans, chief executive of Societe Generale's Madrid broking firm. The government accordingly turned on the speculators. Since the weekend, Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, has taken time off from the IMF meetings he was attending in Washington to denigrate especuladores. They have become what the 'gnomes of Zurich' were to Britain in the 1960s. But investors might come back for revenge. Yesterday's Bank of Spain decision came just as a Dollars 1.5bn Kingdom of Spain Eurobond issue began to be traded on the markets. Directors of the issue were expecting retail and institutional purchasers in Spain but this is unlikely now. And with the Spanish treasury needing to raise a total of Dollars 55bn before the end of the year, some Dollars 17bn of it in net new financing, in order to service the budget deficit, the markets seem to hold a few aces too.</p>

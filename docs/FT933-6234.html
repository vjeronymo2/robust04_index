			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Travel: Art deco at the end of the earth - John Westbrooke visits New Zealand's answer to Bath GO TO the end of the earth, turn east, and what do you find? Answer: a gem of a collection of art deco buildings. Napier, a city of 50,000 or so on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, is the home of a remarkable example of town planning: half-a-dozen blocks, most of its commercial heart, built at the same time and in the same style - a Bath for the 20th century. There is a melancholy reason for this. Early this century, Napier was a Brightonesque seaside resort, noted for its bracing sea air and its long marine parade looking out towards. . . well, Chile is the next stop. Its buildings were characteristically Victorian, several storeys high, lined with fretwork verandas. Then on February 3 1931, the region was struck by an earthquake. In effect, the whole country is a fault line rising from the Pacific, but this was by far the deadliest of its many 'quakes, 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll was 258 and the subsequent fires razed the middle of Napier. So it all had to be rebuilt at once, and the city fathers decided that the new art deco look was the one best suited to a community trying to overcome tragedy and turn firmly towards the future. It was not the only style used - you can see hints of classical, Spanish mission (the main influence in the rebuilding of nearby Hastings) and Frank Lloyd Wright - but it was the main one, and Napier is clearly, as it claims, Art Deco City. The architects - Louis Hay, a Wright devotee, and E A Williams were the busiest of them - learnt lessons from the disaster. Buildings were to be low-rise, with less masonry to fall on passers-by; two storeys is standard. Services went underground. Many of the street-level shopfronts have been renovated, but turn your eyes up and the city's uniqueness becomes apparent. Everywhere you look you see the straight lines and sharp angles of art deco. Typical decorations involve sunbursts, chevrons, zigzags, even stylised Maori motifs. Most have been sympathetically painted in soft pastels, standing out against the bright blue sky. The best are to be found on the Countrywide Bank and the Daily Telegraph buildings, in pinks and oranges, the latter looking vaguely Egyptian, and on the Midland hotel, with a long, low, almost flat facade. But there are lots of small shops and offices, their architects often unknown, which go together to make up this unique cityscape. Europeans often think of art deco as an art form of the north. It was first unveiled at the International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris in 1925. But it has flourished best in the sun: fine collections of apartments and shops are on show in Miami and Los Angeles. Napier's collection is not as big as those, but it is notably compact: half-an-hour's stroll will take you past most of it. Oddly, it was only a decade ago that the locals realised just how unusual their town was. By this time, some buildings had already been pulled down, a process which is still occasionally going on, though today's replacements usually make a feeble attempt at the art deco look themselves. Since then, books and TV programmes have alerted New Zealanders to the value of Napier. Visitors can take guided tours of the town, while the museum offers audio-visual displays about the 'quake of '31. Information from Art Deco Trust, PO Box 248, Napier. Art Deco Napier, by Peter Shaw and Peter Hallett (Cosmos Publications, Napier, NZDollars 26.95), is a short, well-illustrated guide to the town's treasures.</p>

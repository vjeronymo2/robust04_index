			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Raglan cuts deficit to Pounds 1.6m PRE-TAX losses for the year to end-March at Raglan Property Trust were Pounds 1.6m, against Pounds 4m at the previous year-end. Turnover increased from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 9.49m. The pre-tax improvement was achieved after a reduced charge of Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 3.62m) for property write-offs. Losses per share were cut to 0.9p (2p). The directors said the company was continuing to reduce its indebtedness and to unwind outstanding development liabilities initiated in the late-1980s. Litigation with Security Pacific National Bank had been settled at a figure significantly below the claim and had been provided for in the 1991 accounts, they added. Having considerably reduced debt, the directors are addressing the task of restructuring the group's balance sheet. Discussions are under way with its three leading banks on a capital restructuring in order that negotiations with another party could be pursued.</p>

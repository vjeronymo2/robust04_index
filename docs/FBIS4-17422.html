			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Karlis Erglis: "Government Changes Law on </F> Foreign Citizens"]    [Text] Riga, 14 Apr -- During its session today, the  government adopted changes to the law "On foreign citizens and  stateless persons visiting and staying in the Latvian Republic,"  as well as supplements to the law "On police" concerning the  creation of an immigration police, within the framework of the  state police. As was explained by Inese Birzniece, chairman of  the Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights, the amendments  which have been adopted in accordance with Article 81 of the  Constitution, refer to people who have entered Latvia illegally,  and they have been adopted with the purpose of establishing  procedures for removing these people from the state.    The changes in the law, which are said to fully correspond  with the CSCE mission in Latvia, are not yet accepted in their  full form, therefore it was impossible to learn today the  precise procedure for deportations and possible appeals.  However, as we were told by I. Birzniece, "it is out of the  question that some mass deportations could take place." It is  stated in the amendments that they do not apply to people whose  legal status in Latvia is not clear, and regarding whom the  legislative process has not yet been completed. I. Birzniece  emphasized that the draft law on the status of noncitizens  should be accepted as soon as possible.    According to the changes, the border guards and state police  will have the sole right to deport the above mentioned people,  whereas these individuals shall have the right to appeal the  decision to the director of the Immigration Department or in a  court of law, I. Birzniece explained to DIENA.    According to a report by Edvins Inkens, the minister for  special assignments, at a press conference, 400 people were  deported from Latvia last year. There was not a single appeal  submitted in any of the cases, which proves that the  deportations were correct and well based.</p>

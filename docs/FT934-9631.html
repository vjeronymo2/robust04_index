			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK faces hard choice on Hong Kong WHEN a British cabinet committee overseeing policy on Hong Kong meets this morning, it will face a choice: to keep talking to China about the colony's political development in the hope of an agreement, or to go it alone with Governor Chris Patten's plans for expanded democracy. In 15 rounds of talks in Beijing over six months, there have been few signs of progress. But with Mr Patten's oft repeated warning that he will soon have to start putting electoral arrangements into law in time for elections next year and in 1995, China has hinted it may be prepared to agree to the less contentious aspects of his proposals. An offer to settle on issues such as the voting age and local government elections has not been formally made. But officials indicated yesterday that it would probably be enough to prevent Britain from deciding to break off talks immediately. However, ministers will demand that the next round of talks, scheduled to begin in Beijing on November 19, produces concrete evidence from the Chinese side that it wants to reach an agreement. 'It's essential that China does something in the next round of talks,' a senior Hong Kong official said. Before that meeting, Britain will inform the Chinese government of the outcome of today's deliberations, which will be chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and attended by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, as well as Mr Patten. Officials said China's latest move raises the possibility that some electoral arrangements could be put into law in Hong Kong while discussions on the most contentious issues continue in Beijing - though it is not known whether China would accept this. This would provide some extra time for negotiations, though Mr Patten has repeatedly said the electoral plans must be put to legislators soon in order to be ready in time and that this is a matter of weeks, not months. Officials in Hong Kong say the talks can only survive beyond the next round if Beijing can hold out the prospect of a workable deal on the main parts of Mr Patten's plans for broadening the franchise in 1995 elections to the 60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law-making body. This means allowing broader voter participation in 30 'functional constituencies' which represent business and professional groups, and a democratic structure for an election committee which will elect 10 LegCo members. Britain is also insisting on a 'through train' - that LegCo members elected in 1995 would serve through until 1999. Mr Patten has made clear that he regards avoiding what he calls 'rigged' elections in the functional constituencies to be of paramount importance. Officials fear that failure to expand the franchise would provide China with an easy method of controlling LegCo and that it would lose any semblance of an independent legislature. However, China has made equally clear its opposition to such changes. Mr Lu Ping, director of its Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said: 'We want no change. That (functional constituencies) was an idea given to us by the British and we accepted it. We want it to be done exactly as it was done before.' For Britain to go it alone - to seek to have electoral arrangements passed by LegCo without an agreement with China - would be a painful choice. It would mean ditching the policy of trying to ensure that arrangements survive the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997. China has threatened to overturn anything Britain does to Hong Kong's political system which does not have its blessing. Breaking off talks would also mean Hong Kong's hopes of building its new airport and developing its container port facilities would be put on hold. Although Mr Patten's personal popularity is still high, there is little consensus within the community about the appropriate course of action for the British cabinet to take. Hong Kong wants more democracy, but it also wants tranquil relations with Beijing. Past words and deeds of Chinese officials suggest that they are sensitive to opinion in Hong Kong as well as to the timetables set out by Mr Patten. Next week's talks in Beijing could indicate whether they will remain so. See Editorial Comment</p>

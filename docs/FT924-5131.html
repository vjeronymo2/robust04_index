			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Germany sets hurdles for power transfer THE MAIN political parties in Germany agreed yesterday that all future moves to transfer national sovereignty to the European Community must be approved by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament. It means that any future moves towards European union, in addition to the present Maastricht treaty, will be confirmed in Germany only if there is broad cross-party support. Such measures - for example, to agree a European defence union - must also comply with Germany's definition of adequate democratic control, which will now be written into the German constitution. The agreement, opposed by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, and his Free Democratic Party (FDP) as excessively restrictive on future progress towards European integration, was part of a compromise reached in order to press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the Bundestag next week. It was settled between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the special parliamentary committee set up to ratify the treaty. The SPD had argued in favour of a strict two-thirds majority being applied to all final parliamentary approvals. In exchange, the opposition agreed that the package of constitutional amendments tailored to ratification of Maastricht will come into effect, even if the Maastricht treaty is not ratified by all 12 EC member states. That means that whether Maastricht is approved by Denmark and Britain or not, the 16 German federal Lander represented in the Bundesrat, the upper house, will have much greater powers of involvement and oversight of proposed EC legislation. It will also establish a more powerful European oversight committee in the Bundestag, the lower house, which will have to be consulted by the government in advance of all EC negotiations. All the moves, which now seem certain to be approved by the full Bundestag on Tuesday, in spite of FDP opposition, have the effect of increasing German parliamentary control over decisions in Brussels, comparable to that in Britain and Denmark. Supporters of European integration fear that it will simply make all Brussels negotiations far more complex. There remains one potential stumbling block to ratification in Bonn. The Bundesrat is unhappy with the clause proposed for resolving conflicts on EC legislation between the two houses of parliament. Mr Florian Gerster, the European affairs minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate, said it was uncertain if the Bundestag would be able to approve ratification as planned on December 18. A conciliation committee might have to be summoned to resolve the conflict on conflict resolution.</p>

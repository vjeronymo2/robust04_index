			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Forlani adviser held in latest Italian arrests ITALY yesterday experienced another day of spectacular developments in corruption scandals with arrests in Milan, Naples and Rome involving more leading figures in politics and business. The most prominent political arrest was that of Mr Gaetano Amendola, the private secretary and economic adviser to Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the former head of the Christian Democrat party. Mr Forlani himself was advised on Monday that he was under investigation for alleged receipt of L1.2bn (Pounds 500,000) as a kickback on a roads contract near Florence. The contract was negotiated through Mr Giovanni Prandini in 1991, when the latter was minister of public works. Yesterday Mr Forlani's private secretary was arrested on the same charge, while Mr Forlani denied that he had received any funds. Investigations into illicit payments to obtain road contracts have now involved all the parties. Last week it was revealed that Rome and Milan magistrates had prepared a dossier on Mr Prandini alleging that through Anas, the state roads authority, he had collected a total of L25bn in kickbacks. In Milan yesterday, a major development emerged in the two-month inquiry into Eni, the state oil concern. Magistrates announced six arrest warrants had been issued for executives in Eni subsidiaries Snam (gas supplies) and Saipem (pipelines) for alleged falsification of accounts. The first arrest announced was that of Mr Goffredo Giuliani, deputy chairman of Metanopoli, the property development company of Snam. The second was of Mr Carlo Fiore, a board member of Saipem. Mr Giuliani is also managing director of Snam and has been involved in a big gas supply deal with Algeria. Milan magistrates are investigating alleged payments of bribes to foreign intermediaries and political parties on foreign gas contracts as well as more general use of Eni subsidiaries for alleged illicit funding of political parties. This has led to the arrest of four top Eni executives including Mr Gabrieli Cagliari, the chairman. In Naples magistrates announced a further unravelling of the links between politicians and businessmen over expenditure related to the 1990 World Cup football competition, a new mass transit system, the city's public transport corporation and the main local health authority. For the first time this involved local politicians of the neo-fascist MSI-DN party which has its strongest base in Naples. Magistrates issued 19 arrest warrants.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Armed Forces Chief General Luis  Alonso Discua Elvir said Friday that the latest actions of  President Carlos Roberto Reina regarding the Armed Forces are  correct and, therefore, must not surprise anyone.    Gen. Discua attended the inauguration of the first  industrial  park of Comayagua. There, he was asked his opinion of the  Executive Branch's decision to strip the Armed Forces of control  over Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise] and other  government institutions, as well as to establish voluntary  military service.    The military chief affirmed that those decisions do not  create differences between the Executive Branch and the Armed  Forces. "I think that what is being done is correct," Gen.  Discua explained.    Discua indicated that the agencies that were administered by  the military had always belonged to the Executive, adding "this  must not surprise anyone; these are just agencies that come  under the Executive, and the managers must be appointed by the  Executive."    In the meantime, Discua said he met with President Reina on  Wednesday afternoon to analyze the problem of the increase of  crime in the country. He concluded: "We have full support from  the Executive to face the wave of criminality that has emerged."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 11 April Colonel General Anatoliy Lopata, chief  of the General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces and first deputy  minister of defense, and Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan  Bizhan held a briefing for diplomats accredited to Kiev  concerning the incidents in Odessa 8-10 April. The generals  cited facts and documents proving that from the very beginning  Ukraine's Defense Ministry made every effort to avoid a  conflict. In particular, General Lopata sent a telegram to the  leaders of Russia's Defense Ministry in which he pleaded with  them to keep the ship in Odessa until the situation had been  clarified. Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy made a  number of unsuccessful attempts to contact his Russian  colleague, Pavel Grachev, by telephone. The minister then sent  a telegram to Grachev, in which he explained the main points of  the affair and the position of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense.  The reply from Russia's minister of defense revealed that he  was totally uninformed about the situation in Odessa and  deliberately ignored the facts.    Vitaliy Radetskyy said that the arbitrary actions taken by  the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet will be stopped in the  appropriate manner. He invited a competent commission to Kiev  which will ascertain all the issues relating to the Black Sea  Fleet. This commission has arrived in the Ukrainian capital.</p>

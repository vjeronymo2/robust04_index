			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alicja Ogieglo: "Who Benefits From </F> Privatization?"]    [Text] It is certain that Silesian Bank [BSK] employees  are delighted that their bank has been sold, just as the work  force of the Kwidzyn Paper Factory is pleased with the sale of  its plant to the Americans. Kwidzyn workers used the money from  the sale of their shares to take final leave of the old  realities of People's Poland: They bought apartments, cars, and  furniture. The crew of the Rafako manufacturing plant was  slightly less ecstatic in the last stages of the sale of its  enterprise because its shares did not make a profit as high as  those of the BSK. In this context, what can the remaining 80  percent of the Polish population say? So far, it has not had a  chance to snatch for itself even a tiny part of the  privatization profits.    At the same time, certain groups of politicians intend to  capitalize on the prevailing public mood and hamper the progress  of privatization while invoking the following maxim: "It is  preferable to carry it out slowly--but methodically and fairly."  Consequently, we will not see the issue of share certificates as  early as promised by the National Investment Funds Act. If we  did, might not pensioners and employees of the budget-funded  sector, who were supposed to be the first in line to participate  in and benefit from the Polish mass privatization program, get  too rich for someone's liking?    A new problem, which was demonstrated clearly by new  in-depth  social research studies carried out in 1993, is posed by  employees' growing discontent with working conditions provided  by private enterprise owners. There is also evidence of  increasing criticism of private owners based on dissatisfaction  with other factors besides poor working conditions, such as  management methods that undermine employers' dignity and  irrational economic and organizational decisions.    The traditional mistrust of foreign capital and prejudice  against foreign investors still persist, although, in practice,  firms that have accepted foreign capital tend to reserve higher  praise for it than for our own, domestic capital. Recently, it  has been recommended that a system of public monitoring and  control of the implementation of the privatization program be  introduced on a regular basis.    To begin with, the Mass Privatization Program [PPP] was  launched with a considerable degree of public approval (with a  mean value of 70 percent, obtained in a number of separate  surveys). It generated associated expectations of an economic  miracle and elevation of wide circles of society into the elite  realm of private property owners. Even after a notable fall in  share values in 1993, the level of public acceptance of the  privatization program was still relatively high. Consequently,  the minister for ownership transformations continued to enjoy  considerable public support. And so, once the Privatization Act  was passed by parliament in April 1993, the PPP could have  confidently "kicked off" on schedule. By now we would have been  approaching the stage leading to mass distribution of and  trading in share certificates.    First, the level of the PPP's public acceptance declined as  a  result of the election campaign. Even so, during Prime Minister  Pawlak's "honeymoon" period, public approval for privatization  still reached some 50 percent. At the same time, however, the  proportion of advocates of the view that privatization should be  carried out at a much slower pace than previously increased  sharply (to 47 percent). Representatives of opinions that deny  the sense of accelerating the privatization process do not  expect to get rich themselves. In their view, enterprises  should be sold exclusively to those buyers who will undertake to  maintain employment levels (60 percent).    In addition, the predominant view is that privatization  should start with enterprises that are in debt rather than with  those in sound financial condition. Recent opinions stressing a  growing degree of discontent with the effects of privatization  to date influence politicians in their negative view on the PPP  program as a whole. It is true that the recently appointed  Selection Committee, whose creation already involved  considerable difficulties, has set out on a course of talks with  the firms that took part in the initial sales tender, but it has  scheduled the completion of the selection process aimed at  identification of parent companies and candidates to the  position of members of National Investment Fund supervisory  boards for the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile,  enterprises that may even want to participate in the program and  that would regard it as a move in their own economic interest,  tend to attend more closely to matters of immediate importance,  such as local and employee interests. At the same time, many of  them suffer the consequences of a deteriorating financial  condition. It seems that the PPP program has become a scapegoat  here, as a victim of political maneuvering. Those who are  responsible for decisions in this area are probably hoping that  someone else will eventually pay for the consequences of the  delay in the introduction of the privatization program.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Socialists get poll boost in Portugal Portugal's opposition Socialists yesterday emerged clear victors from Sunday's nationwide municipal elections, inflicting a sig-nificant defeat over the ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Anbal Cavaco Silva. Mr Antonio Guterres, the Socialist leader, said the victory would help establish his party as a viable alternative government. But he reiterated his pre-election pledge that the Socialists would not call for an early dissolution of parliament based on the municipal results. The Socialists increased their share of the vote to 36 per cent from 32 per cent previously. The Social Democrats also increased their share of the vote from 31 per cent in 1989 to 34 per cent. But Mr Cavaco Silva acknowledged that the party had fallen short of its main aim of wresting control of a majority of the country's 305 municipal councils from the Socialists. Mr Jorge Sampaio, a Socialist, was re-elected mayor in Lisbon, at the head of a coalition with the hardline Communist party. This has raised the prospect of a broader Socialist-Communist coalition, which President Mario Soares, a Socialist, is reported to favour. The Communists polled 12 per cent of the total vote, the same result as in 1989. During the campaign, Mr Cavaco Silva had said he was alarmed by indications that the president might call an early general election before the next scheduled ballot in October 1995, if the opposition gained a major victory. The Socialists dismissed the prime minister's concern as scare-mongering. The Socialists strengthened their hold over Portugal's second city, Oporto, where they won with a majority of close to 60 per cent, and maintained control of several other major cities. The Socialists dominated in industrial areas, whereas the Social Democrats fared best in rural regions. The prime minister acknowledged that the results from Sunday's poll reflected mid-term dissatisfaction with the government, which is struggling to bring about economic recovery after an estimated 0.5 per cent decline in output this year. Unemployment and labour unrest are also rising, and reform legislation has brought the government into conflict with doctors, teachers, students and other professional sectors.</p>

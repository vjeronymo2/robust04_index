			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Racal depressed Racal Electronics was one of the Mid Cap 250's outstanding casualties, the shares meeting persistent pressure in the wake of stories of a profits downgrade by one of the market's leading agency brokers. James Capel was said to have lowered its current year profits estimate by Pounds 14m to Pounds 238m. Racal shares, which reached an all-time high of 261p on September 1, have fallen sharply in the past few sessions, and closed a net 11 lower yesterday at 240p. Turnover of 3.2m was one of the highest this year. There were a number of strong performers in the computer services sector, where Computer People, boosted by a NatWest Securities buy recommendation, moved forward 17 to 225p. MR Data Management advanced 13 to 127p after news that it had won a contract with the Metropolitan Police. Macro 4 edged up 3 to 438p after SG Warburg Securities, the group's broker, bought in a further 150,000 shares at 440p apiece via a series of agency crosses. Business support services group BET saw 12m shares traded and improved 3 to 114 1/2 p following a strong set of interim results which included a 20 per cent dividend increase. In spite of the clear two-way pull in the shares it looked as if most analysts were edging up their profits estimates for the full year. ICI was the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 list, the shares retreating 25 1/2 , or 3.2 per cent, to a session's low of 774p after keen selling of the stock overnight on Wall Street. Dealers said the shares had run out of steam after last week's interim figures. Turnover was a relatively high 2.7m shares. Northern Ireland Electricity was the pick of the electricity sector, the shares moving up 13 to 377p as the market reacted to the stock's recent underperformance against the English recs and also to hopes of electricity sales to the Republic in the wake of the recent peace moves in the province. Northumbrian Water outpaced the rest of a generally firm waters sector after broker buy recommendations. Northumbrian shares forged ahead 20 to 726p; the company is scheduled to announce interim figures a week from today. Royal Bank of Scotland shares touched their highest level since the end of February, with dealers citing talk of a chart break-out driving the stock forward to a close of 457p, up 8 on the session. Switching from National Westminster Bank and into Barclays cushioned the decline in the latter and left the former 6 weaker at 503p. Hoare Govett was said to have been a keen supporter of Lloyds Bank, which held at 572p. Cater Allen, the discount house, advanced 7 1/2 to 485p, with the market said to be increasingly optimistic about the interim results expected shortly. Bellway's preliminary figures, showing profits up 67 per cent and a 16 per cent increase in the dividend total, were given a warm reception by the market and saw the shares race up 14 to 208p. English China Clays firmed a penny to 360p in the wake of a UBS buy note citing the group's success in diversification into speciality chemicals, the strong balance sheet, secure yield and a falling price earnings ratio.</p>

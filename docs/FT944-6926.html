			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Private View: The mathematician in his cave - Christian Tyler meets a man whose beliefs about human understanding are causing scientific controversy Among mathematicians, Sir Roger Penrose is a caveman. I do not mean he is some snaggle-toothed evolutionary throwback - even if certain high priests of brain science would call him that. He is a caveman because he agrees with Plato, who first used the analogy that human beings are like prisoners in a cave who can see only the shadows of reality thrown on to the wall by the firelight. For Penrose, mathematical truths are part of reality: not human inventions, but pre-existing 'forms' whose existence we have to discover. He has reworked Plato's parable for the prologue of his second book, Shadows of the Mind, which restates and develops the controversial claim of The Emperor's New Mind that human understanding will never be explained in terms of computer-like calculations. Human consciousness cannot even be simulated by a machine. Furthermore, the scientific explanation for consciousness will depend on discovering new laws of physics. The cave of the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University is satisfyingly chaotic. Papers, books and correspondence crammed the room at the Mathematical Institute, a faded new block on St Giles. Adding to the jumble were old geometric models made of plaster, metal and wire which had been retrieved from some forgotten basement. A box of empty coffee jars and a broken percolator lay on the floor, next to a jigsaw puzzle of special difficulty based on one of Penrose's own geometric brainteasers. Symbols and equations ran riot on the blackboard behind his desk. Mathematics must be wired into the Penrose family. An older brother, Oliver, has just retired as professor of mathematics at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. A younger brother, Jonathan, is a chess grandmaster. A nephew teaches maths at Durham and a son is doing his post-doctorate in the subject. Penrose, whose special ability is spatial thinking, began constructing polyhedra (many-sided shapes) at the age of 10, when he regarded maths as a kind of game. 'An ability to do maths is not essentially different from ordinary thinking,' he said. 'One does it for fun, really. So you have to enjoy it to do it seriously.' Mathematics was discussed round the family dinner table. Penrose's father, a specialist in the inheritance of mental defects, would speculate on whether the brain was some sort of computer. However, he expected his son to become a doctor. 'I was actually, secretly, going to be a brain surgeon,' Penrose said. Another influence was a series of radio broadcasts by Professor Fred Hoyle (leading proponent of the 'steady state' theory of the universe). Lunching with his elder brother at Cambridge one day, Penrose impressed Denis Sciama, a cosmologist, by questioning Hoyle's description of galaxies disappearing over the horizon of the universe. 'I drew a picture to show it didn't make sense. I think Denis was quite struck by this and later when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student he took me under his wing.' As a student at London and Cambridge, Penrose took up, as sidelines, quantum theory, particle physics, general relativity and cosmology. He also studied mathematical logic, where he encountered Kurt Godel's revolutionary proof that in any logical system, such as that on which arithmetic is based, there are truths which cannot be derived from the axioms of the system. An interpretation of Godel's 'incompleteness' theorem underpins the controversial claims of Shadows. Penrose wrote these two 'popular' science books partly to convey his own sense of excitement, he says. To call them popular is misleading, however. Most of his supporting evidence is indecipherable to non-mathematicians. Even if the hypothesis is clear, the books are tougher to read than the best-selling Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, Penrose's opposite number at Cambridge and former collaborator on Black Holes. The books were to have been a retirement project. Then Penrose saw a re-run of a TV programme in which Marvin Minsky and another American pioneer of the 'hard' school of artificial intelligence made 'some very extreme remarks'. He added: 'From their very particular point of view what they said was logical. But I just don't believe it. As an undergraduate I had tried to build up logical systems which would reduce thinking to computation. Even then, in the middle of doing it, I had a suspicion that something was wrong and this wouldn't work.' Most people, I said, had never heard of Godel but would say it was obvious that consciousness wasn't just computation. Why did you need to demonstrate it? 'It's very curious. You find people on both sides who regard the other point of view as ridiculous. People say 'Why bother to write the book?' But what's not so obvious is that I am saying something stronger: that is, that you can't even simulate this activity. 'There is a view that a machine can act as though it sees red, feels pain, etc. My line is different. I'm saying it can't even act as though it has these qualities. There is something in our understanding which you couldn't even imitate . . . and, stronger still, you couldn't do it with presently known physics. 'The argument from obviousness is a good argument, but it doesn't get you anywhere. It doesn't tell you what to do.' Briefly, what Penrose tells us to do is look at the 'microtubules' in the neurons, or brain cells, for signs of quantum brain activity which could, with the missing physics, translate into non-computable consciousness. Are you envious of the computer's power? 'People often ask me that one,' Penrose replied. 'There is certainly an element of pride, I suppose, and not wanting to be outdone by a mere machine and that sort of thing. If computers get very good at chess I don't like the idea. But I'm pretty sure it's more than that. I don't think it's correct, that's all.' Do mathematicians like you feel left out of the argument? 'Certainly I feel there's an awful lot of very hard work, clever work, very important work which is almost totally ignored and dismissed, simply because it's not something that people understand and may not have any immediate value. Mathematicians tend to be modest. They work away in their corners and don't go and shout about things.' So you think computer science is hijacking maths? 'I think to some extent it has hijacked it. There's some interesting stuff, of course, and I don't want to denigrate it. But I don't think it should take over in the public's mind.' The pure mathematician is, of course, a species of philosopher. Whether Penrose's mathematical brilliance carries over to his philosophical reasoning is what his critics question. But in subscribing to a Platonic world of ideas, he is certainly not alone, even among mathematicians. The concepts, he says, are 'out there' in the sense of being independent of our perception of them. Does he mean that they exist like Plato's forms? 'Yes, very much so. But I get into a lot of trouble on that one. People will often go along with other things I say. But even the most sympathetic I find sometimes baulk at taking mathematical forms as really existing. 'The trouble is, if you don't take them as existing in some sense then the other mysteries become even more mysterious. The physical world behaves to such an extraordinary degree in accordance with highly sophisticated mathematics. It makes that mystery even more puzzling if the mathematics somehow isn't there, if it's our creation. 'Einstein's theory of general relativity is a wonderful example why that can't be the case. Newton's theory of gravity had been around for years and Einstein didn't need to produce a new theory for which there was anyway not much evidence at the time. 'But now it's become the most accurate theory known to science. And it was there all the time] It's not that somehow we've imposed our thinking on the way that space is constructed. It's out there.' Then why don't you just say that souls exist, too, and do our thinking? 'Well, I suppose one can say things like that. Certainly if one uses 'soul' to describe a person's consciousness I have no objection to that. It's just a word I tend not to like to use because it has unfortunate connotations. I suppose I don't find it very helpful.' Are you really a Pythagorean mystic? 'Sometimes people call me that. Labels are things which people put on me. Pythagorean mystic? I hate to use the word mystic. But I certainly have been called Pythagorean rather than Platonic as someone who believes in mathematics underlying everything.' I asked Penrose whether the controversy excited by his books was drawing him away from his chief activity, which is mathematical physics  - specifically, something called twistor theory which he has worked on for 30 years. 'I have other things I really want to get back to,' he said, 'although the question of the missing physics is something I want to think about more seriously. In a certain sense I regard all these other things as distractions from my work. But they're interesting distractions.'</p>

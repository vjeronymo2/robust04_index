			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Germany rejects US plan for ideas forum Germany yesterday rejected a US proposal at the Group of Seven jobs summit in Detroit to establish new G7 working parties to exchange ideas on unemployment, education and training. The proposal failed to find favour with the UK, too. 'This is superfluous, we can talk about these things through the OECD,' said Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister. He also rejected US pressure for further macroeconomic stimulus, saying Germany was already providing such stimulus through its huge investments in the east German economy. While stressing what Germany could learn from the more flexible and deregulated US labour market, German ministers also stressed Germany's model qualities, in particular in training. Mr Norbert Blum, German labour minister, said the US labour market model was not compatible with European social standards. But he also warned that 3m jobs for lower-skilled workers would disappear in Germany within eight years and that more creativity and flexibility was required in German companies. Mr Blum welcomed the recent flexibility shown by the German pay bargaining system and said the country had to move towards a system in which minimum rates were set at national level and wages were then topped up at plant or company level dependent on performance. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said that no country was doing more than Germany to consolidate its public finances. In due time this would allow further cuts in interest rates, he said. Mr Rexrodt stressed the closeness of US-German links, but, like other G7 countries, he was critical of the bilateral trade discussions between the US and Japan. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, rejected the idea that there was a significant gulf between British and US labour market thinking. 'We are very much in the mainstream of G7 thinking. US and UK policy is very close indeed. We are nearer to the Americans than the continental Europeans. But all of us are going to have to change,' he said. Speaking at a working session yesterday afternoon, the first day of the two-day summit, Mr Clarke stressed the importance of active labour market measures - including training and small business stimulation - as well as policies promoting labour market deregulation.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY WINS HIS 5,000TH IN CHURCHILL FEATURE  </P> <P> Jockey Pat Day rode his 5,000th winner in a feature race at Churchill Downs  Thursday, becoming the 12th jockey to reach the milestone.  </P> <P> The victory came in the $100,000 Falls City Handicap, a 1 1/8-mile race for  fillies and mares 3 years old and older.  </P> <P> Day was aboard Screen Prospect, which paid $5.80, $3.80 and $3.20.  </P> <P> "It was really special to win here. It would have been special anywhere, but to  win it here at Churchill Downs -- we've had such a tremendous amount of success  here and we've got such a large following as regards the fans," Day said.  </P> <P> "The only thing, I guess, we haven't done here is win the Derby and we're  looking forward to doing that in '91."  </P> <P> Day is Churchill Downs' all-time leading rider. The track will donate a total  of $5,000 to Sts. Mary and Elizabeth Hospital and to Kosair Children's  Hospital, both in Louisville, in Day's name, according to a statement issued by  the track.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE MAY CUT JOBS TO TRIM PROJECTED DEFICIT  </P> <P> Hawthorne will probably have to resort to layoffs to offset at least part of a  projected $2.5-million deficit in the city's $44.8-million budget for 1989-90,  City Manager R. Kenneth Jue has told the City Council in his annual budget  message.  </P> <P> The city's 1989-90 budget is "in serious trouble," he said.  </P> <P> The deficit occurred because the city received $1.1 million less in paramedic  fees and sales taxes than anticipated for 1988-89, and an equal shortfall is  projected for 1989-90, Jue said.  </P> <P> To offset the deficit, Jue has asked all city department heads to reduce  spending by 10% and has urged the City Council to increase revenues by raising  city fees.  </P> <P> Even with those measures, Jue warned in a somber, three-page letter  accompanying the two-volume budget document that he has "requested the  personnel director to research layoff procedures since it will probably come to  that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personnel Main Target  </P> <P> Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth said in a telephone interview Friday that the council  is "reviewing (Jue's) recommendations and considering the measures we will have  to take to make up the lost revenues." The council is expected to set the date  for a public hearing on the budget at its July 24 meeting, she said.  </P> <P> The city already has cut its capital expenditures, travel and supply costs, so  "personnel will be the main targets of any additional slashes," Jue said in his  letter.  </P> <P> Cutting personnel will mean cutting services, and he warned: "The reduction in  personnel will result in limited hours that staff will be available to the  public and will likely cause delays on construction inspections."  </P> <P> Hawthorne's per-capita expenditures are the lowest of 10 full-service South Bay  cities, Jue reported. A survey of 1986-87 figures, the most recent available,  show that Hawthorne spends $361 a year for each resident of the city, while the  per-capita expenditures of neighboring full-service cities average $545, he  said. A full-service city provides all of its own public services rather than  contracting for police and fire protection, for instance.  </P> <P> A committee of top City Hall administrators called together by the city manager  to advise on the budget recommended that the council approve fee increases  totaling $2,575,000 to resolve the deficit.  </P> <P> The need to increase fees or impose new ones "has never been more paramount,"  Jue said.  </P> <P> Proposed expenditures for 1989-90 reflect "zero growth" in all city departments  except the Police Department, which plans to hire five more sworn officers, Jue  said.  </P> <P> "One's immediate reaction to a budget deficit is to cut services," Jue said.  "However, I feel that we are operating all departments at minimum staffing  levels already, and we vitally need five additional police officers just for  starters." It will cost about $300,000 to hire five officers, Jue said.  </P> <P> Over the next several years, the city plans to increase the police force to 100  officers from 85, to cope with population growth and an increase in crime, he  added.  </P> <P> In 1988-89, the city had expected $700,000 in paramedic fees and received  $160,000, and anticipated sales tax revenues of $6.6 million but received only  $6 million, for a deficit of about $1.1 million, Jue said in his letter. A  similar shortfall in 1989-90 and the $300,000 for additional police services  makes up the $2.5-million deficit in the current budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REVENUES FROM PROPOSED FEE INCREASES  </P> <P> To help Hawthorne offset a projected $2.5-million deficit in the city's  $44.8-million budget for 1989-90, city administrators have proposed fee  increases yielding an additional $2.575 million in revenues. Here are the  additional revenues produced by city fees if the adminstrators' recommendations  are adopted.  </P> <P> Building, planning and engineering fees: $200,000  </P> <P> Development impact fees: $750,000  </P> <P> Sewer service, street cleaning and tree trimming: $720,000  </P> <P> Refuse collection: $550,000  </P> <P> Towing charges: $50,000  </P> <P> Police fees: $130,000  </P> <P> Airport hangar fees: $50,000  </P> <P> Water charges: $100,000  </P> <P> Recreation fees: $25,000  </P> <P> SOURCE: city of Hawthorne  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFLICTS SURFACE IN COMPTON AS LATINO POPULATION INCREASES  </P> <P> In the May 7 edition of The Times, two articles focused on minorities in  politics. One was general, analyzing barriers to electoral politics, the other  specific, contrasting black and Latino political strength in Compton.  </P> <P> Yet neither article addressed the complex impact that housing discrimination  has on political power. Entrenched patterns of segregation have operated to  limit the political power of minorities.  </P> <P> The term "block-busting" referred to in the article on Compton does not  describe the ruse minorities have had to resort to in order to purchase  property. On the contrary, block-busting is an insidious illegal practice real  estate agents have used to stimulate business by preying on racial prejudices.  Rumors that minorities are moving into a neighborhood en masse are spread,  whipping up racial hysteria, and causing a flurry of sales. Federal law has  outlawed block-busting since 1968.  </P> <P> Currently, blacks may enjoy greater political power than Latinos in Compton and  statewide. Yet the advantage is relative. Segregation relegates both groups to  designated pockets of communities, and pits them against one another. Before we  criticize the state of affirmative action in Compton, perhaps we should  evaluate the record of affirmative action and representative politics in  communities where both blacks and Latinos are in the minority -- such as Los  Angeles. Hopefully, both groups can come together in Compton.  </P> <P> MARY M. LEE, President  </P> <P> Fair Housing Congress of Southern Calif.  </P></p>

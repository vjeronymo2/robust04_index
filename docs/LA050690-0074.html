			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 3 CHARGED WITH FALSIFYING EMISSIONS CERTIFICATIONS  </P> <P> The two owners and an inspector at a Wilmington auto import shop face  misdemeanor charges for allegedly taking telephone orders for smog certificates  without ever seeing or inspecting the cars.  </P> <P> Officials from the state Bureau of Automotive Repair and the Department of  Consumer Affairs began investigating the trio after they received an anonymous  tip last year that ASP Imports at 841 W. Anaheim St. in Wilmington was selling  smog documents illegally, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for Los Angeles City  Atty. James K. Hahn.  </P> <P> Under California law, vehicles must pass an automated emissions test every two  years before their registration may be renewed.  </P> <P> Charged in the case are shop owners Shirin Niaki, 33, and her husband George  Albas (Johnny) Niaki, both of Park La Brea, and smog check inspector Sohail  Fahmian, 40, of Redondo Beach, who goes by the name Vincent Castagliola.  </P> <P> Each is charged with one count of falsifying smog certificates and one count of  issuing the falsified documents as authentic, according to Deputy City Atty.  Fay Chu. Each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of one year in county  jail and a $1,000 fine.  </P> <P> George Niaki said in a telephone interview that Fahmian leased space from ASP  Imports for his own smog certification business. Niaki said he and his wife  were not aware that there was any wrongdoing at the smog check station.  </P> <P> Fahmian could not be reached for comment. Niaki said Fahmian gave up his lease  at the shop a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> Undercover investigators made three purchases from ASP Imports, Qualls said.  During the first purchase, investigators reportedly bought two smog  certificates for $50. On the second trip, the officials bought five  certificates for $130, and on their third trip, they bought 10 certificates for  $260, Qualls said. Each time, he said, investigators telephoned the shop with  their vehicle information and then picked up the documents without ever taking  a car to the shop.  </P> <P> The three defendants are scheduled to be arraigned May 24 in Los Angeles  Municipal Court.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'NIGHT STALKER' JURY BREAKS FOR WEEKEND  </P> <P> Jurors deliberating the fate of convicted "Night Stalker" Richard Ramirez broke  for the weekend Friday without reaching agreement on whether to recommend that  he die in San Quentin's gas chamber or be sentenced to life in prison without  the possibility of parole.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Superior Court jury must decide between the two alternatives  during the penalty phase of the 13-month-long trial, after finding the  29-year-old El Paso, Tex., drifter guilty of 13 murders and 30 other felonies  during a seemingly random crime rampage in the spring and summer of 1985 that  terrorized Southern Californians.  </P> <P> The jury of seven women and five men began deliberations after listening  intently to arguments by both sides Wednesday. The prosecution urged them to  give the killer his "just deserts," while the defense asked for mercy.  </P> <P> The defense -- with Ramirez's agreement -- decided not to call any witnesses  during the penalty phase, saying that would prevent the prosecution from  putting on rebuttal witnesses, avoid putting the defendant's entire life on  display, and spare his family and childhood friends the ordeal of testifying.  </P> <P> Deliberations are scheduled to resume Monday morning.  </P></p>

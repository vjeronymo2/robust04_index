This is part of the IDF's redeployment in  anticipation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement with the  Palestinians. IDF sources stressed that the evacuation of  troops from refugee camps will be carried out concurrently with  progress in the talks with the PLO. Our Army affairs  correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda has more details:    Two bases have been evacuated within three days -- one in  Gaza's Rimal neighborhood two days ago, and another, a Border  Police base in Rafah, which was moved yesterday to the southern  sector headquarters from which the Border Police will continue  their operations in the Rafah area in the same scope of  deployment and activity. Army sources said that in the  framework of the numerous logistic changes carried out in the  Gaza Strip recently, buildings and troops have been relocated  and, in some cases, troops have been concentrated in one central  location from which they are to continue their operations before  and after the implementation of autonomy. The sources stressed  that the volume of the IDF's operations has not changed; on the  contrary, it has been increased recently, resulting in the  successful apprehension of many fugitives and the foiling of  terrorist attacks. The sources further emphasized that the pace  of troop evacuation from refugee camps will be tied to the  progress of the talks with the PLO. [passage omitted]    The structures from the two evacuated bases will be moved to  outposts currently under construction near Jewish settlements in  the Strip. It should be noted that the construction of these  outposts is at an advanced stage. The IDF preparations for  redeployment include the imminent transfer of several other  bases. Defense establishment elements stressed this morning  that the Gaza and Jericho redeployment can be completed within a  few weeks after the agreement is signed.</p>

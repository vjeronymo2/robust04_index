			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Council isolated on school test plan THE LONDON Borough of Wandsworth's plan to pay supply teachers to administer national curriculum tests, which face the threat of boycotts by teachers, seemed unlikely to be followed by other education authorities yesterday. Wandsworth is paying Pounds 20,000 out of its education budget to employ teams of supply teachers to invigilate and mark tests for 14-year-olds. Local education authorities in England and Wales have a legal duty to implement the tests for their schools, as do the heads and governors of grant-maintained schools which have opted out of education authority control. Wandsworth intends to pass the results of its tests to the review of the national curriculum being conducted by Sir Ron Dearing. He has said that he needs completed tests to improve them for next year. Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth, said it would be possible for other authorities to do the same. 'Ours is a local initiative, but obviously other authorities are in exactly the same position as we are and they've got to steer through this problem. There are probably enough supply teachers around,' he said. According to the Department for Education, there are about 300,000 inactive teachers in England and Wales, compared with about 400,000 working teachers. However, the National Association of Governors and Managers cast doubt on whether enough teachers with adequate specialist qualifications were available to allow all schools to take the same route. It said the Wandsworth plan was impracticable. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'It's a total misreading of the statutory assessment and testing arrangements to believe that you can pull in outsiders and expect them to undertake that job with the knowledge and the skill which would be brought to that task by the teachers in the schools themselves.' Mr John Patten, the education secretary, welcomed Wandsworth's move but stopped short of urging other councils to follow its lead. 'I applaud what Wandsworth has done. They are using their own resources. They're using their own school inspectors to go into the schools and make sure that the tests are taken,' he said, adding that it was up to individual councils to take similar decisions. Wandsworth only has four secondary schools, and larger education authorities might not have the resources. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Association of County Councils, which represent local education authorities, said none of their members planned to follow Wandsworth's lead.</p>

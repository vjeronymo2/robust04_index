			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shafiq al-Asadi] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi--Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Ahmad al-Mu'alla, the  planning minister in the United Arab Emirates [UAE], said that  the economy of the UAE grew at the rate of 2.4 percent in 1994  compared to 1993.    He said that the UAE was able to cope with the crisis caused  by the drop in oil prices in 1993 because of its strong economy,  which enabled it to absorb the shocks of the crisis and to adapt  to changes in the world oil market.    He stressed that 1993 will have seen a budget surplus,  similar to that achieved in 1992, due to a drop in allocations  for security, continued spending control, and an increase in  government sources.    The Planning Ministry said yesterday in press statements  that  the 1993 budget will achieve a surplus due to a drop in security  expenditures following the end of the Gulf war, continued  spending control, the combatting of waste, and the speed with  which efforts were made to renew and increase governmental  sources.    The expected budget deficit for 1993 of 1.7 billion dirham  [UD] failed to materialize, because state expenditures were less  than the approximately UD17.6 billion estimated in the 1993  budget, and less than state revenues, which totaled UD15.9  billion.    Financial sources expect this situation to continue in 1994,  when expenditures and revenues are expected to total about $17.6  billion and $16.3 billion respectively.    The government stresses, in the 1994 draft budget announced  last week, that the deficit fell by about UD1.3 billion, and  that the ministries' revenues from fees increased by UD500  million.    The approximately UD1.3 billion 1994 estimated budget  deficit  will also be imaginary. The 1994 budget is also expected to  realize a surplus, because the allocations provided in it are  not all expected to be implemented. Unspent allocations  generally pertain to investment projects that are not  implemented at the designated time.    The planning minister stressed that the UAE's economy will  experience a discernible recovery, and that the expansion that  began in 1992/1993 will continue in 1994 due to: the  government's promotion of new investments in different areas;  tangible development in private-sector activity, especially  production activity; and the trend toward regional stability.    The region is expected to see extensive trading activity in  which the UAE is expected to play a key role based on the  commercial and financial position it enjoys.    He said, "These expectations are based on the continued  remediation of the economic problems that have faced the UAE.  This remediation has resulted in a surplus in the general  budget, the development of the non-oil sectors in the economy,  the achievement of greater cooperation with the countries of the  Gulf Cooperation Council, the encouragement of investment  between the Gulf countries, the establishment of a securities  market, the establishment of unified customs, and the opening of  Gulf markets to each other, which will help achieve positive  growth."    He added that expectations of growth in the UAE are also  based on: the ability of the UAE's economy to absorb the effect  of the drop in oil prices; the UAE's joining of the GATT  agreement that will begin to be implemented in 1995; and the  achievement of greater cooperation with Gulf, Arab, and  developing countries.    He stressed that the UAE made a number of economic decisions  this year that have enabled it to cope with and surmount many  circumstances and to generate balanced development.    He said, "The UAE saw a tangible improvement in 1993. It  began to move beyond the effects of the Gulf crisis." He pointed  to a clear improvement in the gross product, current surplus,  and balance of payments, and to an increase in total fixed  capital formation. He said, "Many factors have helped improve  performance, including the recovery in the non-oil sectors, the  realization of a surplus in the general budget, and a drop in  the volume of transfers abroad, which had the greatest effect on  the balance of payments."    Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Ahmad al-Mu'alla stressed that the  government of the UAE was able in 1993 to overcome the obstacles  in its path, the most salient being the budget deficit that had  emerged in previous years. Due to the government's efforts, he  added, a surplus was realized in the 1992 budget. He expects  this surplus to continue in 1993 based on the emergence of  encouraging factors, e.g., a reduction in defense spending,  continued spending control, and an increase in government  sources.</p>

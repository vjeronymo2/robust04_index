			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: The London Sinfonietta explores 'Living Toys' Every year at about this time the London Sinfonietta mounts one of its 'Explorations': a collaboration with London schoolchildren in the form of an educational project with composers whose works are then exposed in a concert. On Friday the Barbican Hall stalls were pleasantly packed with the young people who over the past few weeks had been working with Thomas Ades and Robert Zuidam, two of the evening's four featured composers (Osvaldo Golijov and Julian Anderson the other two). The event itself, conducted by Oliver Knussen, was rather milder and more diffuse than the orchestra's self-advertisement suggested it would be. (It was made even longer by the last-minute addition of Chain 1, a memorial tribute to Witold Lutoslawski, who died last week and who was one of the Sinfonietta's household gods.) Most of the works lacked, in a word, necessity, that sense of artistic pressure - as distinct from intelligent calculation or even interesting sound-combination - forcing them into existence. The shining exception to this rule was the final item, Living Toys by Ades, a young (b. 1971) Englishman whose recent rise to prominence seems on this evidence entirely justified. The 17-minute piece for chamber orchestra, in spite of being decked in a tortuous programme-note, proved a quirky, radical and also an utterly fascinating explosion of ideas and sounds, drawn together with toughness, wit and personal accent. Divided by Ades's (incomprehensible) scenario into differently-paced linked movements, it gave the impression of a Ravellian toybox fantasia laced with infusions of strong Spanish flavouring and stiffened with Birtwistle-like dialectic. Unlike almost everything else on the bill - apart from Lutoslawski's wonderfully elegant invention - Living Toys suggested that a second hearing would be not only desirable but positively necessary.</p>

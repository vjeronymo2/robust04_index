			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking in the U.S. Senate in connection with a  debate on lifting the arms embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ejup  Ganic, vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, said  inter alia that the arms embargo against the legitimate and  recognized Government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic was the  policy aimed at the therapy that the international community has  been employing in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past two years in  response to the aggression. This therapy has led to a  catastrophe in my country. The therapy failed simply because  the patient is dying and it must be changed.    Repression and genocide against the non-Serb population are  part of the program of creating a greater Serbia on the basis of  the idea of ethnic cleansing. Unfortunately, 50 years later,  Europe is again witnessing the expansion of fascism. We are  asking you to lift the embargo so that we can exclusively defend  ourselves and ensure a lasting peace. We have not lost the war.  The Serbs have tried to destroy our country and us with all  available means, but they have not yet succeeded in this.    Our people are capable and knowledgeable, and with their  bare  hands they are still resisting and keeping our main towns and  vital industrial zones under their control. We are asking you  to lift the embargo to create conditions for peace and for talks  through balance in arms. We need arms in order to survive and  not in order to win, because our losses and the genocide we  suffered prevent us from speaking about victory.    For this reason we say it again and again: We are not asking  your troops to fight for us on the ground, this is our task, but  we are begging you not to use big words that translate into  small actions.</p>

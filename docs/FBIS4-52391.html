			<p>BFN     [Text] Those exporting products less than $20,000 will  not need government permits from the second half of this year.  At present, approval is granted to those who receive  irrevocable licenses of credit (L/Cs) less than the same amount  from foreign buyers.    The new step will reduce the financial burden on small and  medium business by encouraging small-value shipments.    This step was featured in a wide range of measures which the  Ministry of Trade, Energy and Trade announced yesterday to ease  regulations on trade, factory sites and distribution within the  year.    To expedite trade,the minimum amount for exports or imports  which is free of government control after approval is given will  be increased from the current $5,000 to $10,000 from the second  half of the year as well.    The permit system in the issuance of trade licenses without  any restriction will be changed into a report system, thereby  freeing small traders from paying commissions.    In the meantime, those who export industrial facilities will  be allowed to secure necessary equipment in the countries  concerned.    The collection of levies on exporters of industrial plants  will be abolished in order to enhance their international  competitiveness.    Some research equipment whose imports from Japan are banned  under the pretext of diversifying import sources will be lifted  to expedite corporate investment in the development of high tech  and high value-added products.    Imports of raw materials for export will be allowed to  purchase the amount which they apply to the government for.    With regards to easing restrictions on the distribution  industry, the minimum size of a retail or wholesale outlet  subject to city or provincial approval will be increased from  the current 1,000 square meters to 3,000 square meters.    A negative system will be introduced only to designate  business sectors whose operation in retail and wholesales shops  are prohibited.    Currently, the size in retail and wholesale outlets which  are  permitted for the service sector such as food and financing is  limited to 50 percent of their total floor space.    To remove obstacles to the opening of new wholesale centers,  the ratio of wholesale against their turnover will be decreased  from the 100 percent to 70 percent.    Those, who enter the wholesale business using rented  buildings, will be free from the obligation that they should use  more than 10 percent of their floor space.    The minimum floor space of department stores subject to  government approval for their opening will be raised from the  1,000 square meters at present to 3,000 square meters.    Their owners will be allowed to run 70 percent of the whole  size compared with the current 100 percent.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Russian troops deployed in Georgia RUSSIA deployed troops yesterday to guard rail and sea links in Georgia, as battered Georgian troops sought to take the offensive against rebel forces of the deposed president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The Russian foreign ministry in Moscow said troops were being assigned to guard a strategic railway that runs from Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti to neighbouring Azerbaijan and Armenia, in accordance with a request from Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader. Mr Shevardnadze had appealed on Tuesday for military help from Russia and other ex-Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, Russia made clear it would not get involved in the fighting. A presidential spokesman in Moscow said Russia's intervention was a peacekeeping action to protect transport and crucial supply lifelines and did not constitute interference in Georgia's internal affairs. Moscow expected units would also be sent by Azerbaijan and Armenia. A senior Russian official in Tbilisi said 20 truck loads of Russian soldiers had been sent to defend the railway from their base in Batumi, western Georgia, and had now taken control of part of the line to Tbilisi. Mr Gamsakhurdia's control over the railway has given him a partial stranglehold on the capital, where officials said food rationing would have to begin soon. The Georgian rebels advanced in recent days to within 12km of Kutaisi, the country's second city. Georgia's defence minister, General Georgy Karkiashvili, is in the city to organise his troops. In a possible revival of its fortunes, the Georgian government claimed its forces yesterday had retaken the port of Poti and two other towns, Lanchkhuti and Khoni, with hardly a shot fired. It also claimed to have repulsed an armoured assault by rebels trying to break through to Kutaisi. The loss of Kutaisi would be another serious blow to Mr Shevardnadze. The former Soviet foreign minister last month suffered the loss of the north-west province of Abkhazia to separatists.</p>

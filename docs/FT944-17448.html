			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UN troops expel Moslems United Nations troops yesterday drove Moslem forces from the Sarajevo demilitarised zone at gunpoint after Bosnian Serbs threatened revenge for a commando raid in which 20 Serb soldiers and women nurses were killed. Peacekeepers said they had evicted at least 550 men of the Moslem-led Bosnian government army from the Mount Igman area of the zone and destroyed their bunkers and trenches. UN commanders feared the Moslem attack, launched from the DMZ against a Bosnian Serb army command post, would wreck their efforts to lift a Serb blockade of aid for civilians. Angry Serb leaders had warned they might order UN peacekeepers off their territory, but the first UN aid flight to the city for 15 days touched down safely yesterday morning. The operation to flush the Moslems out of the DMZ, begun on Thursday and continued overnight, was to pre-empt any attempt by the Serbs to do the job themselves. UN envoy Yasushi Akashi made clear to the Moslems he would order Nato air strikes against them if they refused to obey.</p>

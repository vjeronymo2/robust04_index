			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNOCAL CONFIRMS DISCUSSIONS WITH VIETNAM  </P> <P> A major American oil company confirmed Thursday that it had conducted  exploratory business talks with Vietnam, even though the U.S. government has a  trade embargo against the Southeast Asian nation.  </P> <P> "A representative of Unocal Corp. did visit Vietnam in an exploratory meeting  several weeks ago," said Art Bentley, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based  company.  </P> <P> "There are no plans to proceed any further. That's about all I want to say  about it," he said.  </P> <P> He noted that the U.S. government has maintained an embargo on trading with the  former enemy since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, a senior Vietnamese economic official said two U.S. oil companies  had begun investigating the possibility of investing in oil exploration in  Vietnam with approval of the U.S. State Department.  </P> <P> The two companies were identified as Unocal and Sun Co., headquartered in  Radnor, Pa., by Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a member of the Vietnamese National Assembly  and an economic adviser to the government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Venture With Soviets  </P> <P> Sun denied sending any representative to Vietnam for talks.  </P> <P> Vietnam, in a joint venture with the Soviet Union, currently produces about  15,000 barrels of oil a day from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field off the coast  of southern Vietnam, a field that was discovered by American oil companies in  the waning days of the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> The Southeast Asian nation has signed exploration contracts with British  Petroleum, the French company Total, Royal Dutch-Shell of the Netherlands and  Petrofina of Belgium in the past year.  </P> <P> In Washington, a State Department official, who spoke on the condition that he  not be identified, said Wednesday that many U.S. companies call and are told  the U.S. embargo against Vietnam still stands.  </P> <P> "We tell them it's all right to go and talk business. But it's against the law  to do business," the official said.  </P> <P> Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia is the main roadblock to U.S. normalization  of relations and lifting of the embargo, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: New growth theory as the backdrop of policy initiatives Sir, Samuel Brittan's heavy-handed treatment of the new growth theory ('Endogenous growth - treat with care', March 4) misses the core of the debate. He implies that this is merely a re-run of a familiar (and intrinsically flawed) story stressing capital investments and government subsidies. This is incorrect. First, his summary of new growth theory as 'throw(ing) bricks and mortar, machinery or research laboratories at problems' as the 'key to prosperity' misses the stress on the interdependence of technology, training, trade and capital investment. Because investment in plant and equipment must be complemented by building up learning capabilities (that is, learning to learn, learning to borrow, learning to do and learning to use), history matters. Mr Brittan's reaction is to recall the role of entrepreneurship. However, the heroic Schumpeterian figure, and even more the Hayekian agent of arbitrage, is increasingly marginalised by developments in the global economy. The most dynamic firms are acquiring and improving their entrepreneurial capabilities in close co-operation with other firms and public agencies. Similarly, successful national development strategies have involved public support to learn, to experiment and to create. This is the essence of the lessons to be derived from the experience of rapid growth in east Asia, which belies many of the free market nostrums of the 1980s and highlights the importance of public and private co-operation. Second, while Samuel Brittan is still pondering the etiology of growth and investment, endogenous growth theory is capturing important changes in the global economy. In particular, the explosion in foreign direct investment, which has contributed significantly to the diffusion of technology, to new ways of organising business activity and to new forms of competition in the global marketplace, can now receive the attention it deserves. On all accounts, new growth theory has brought economists closer to decision-making in Seoul and Tokyo, and now indeed in Washington. This, rather than the spurious calculations of growth accountants, sets the backdrop against which much-needed new policy initiatives can be formulated.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Arts: A choreographer of human emotions SHADOWPLAY by Donna Perlmutter Viking Pounds 17.99, 420 pages Antony Tudor was one of the most significant choreographers of our century. He gave ballet its first clear awareness of psychology, showing how it might probe personality, and expose the essence of character. His reputation rests upon a handful of works created in the decade 1936-1945; with Jardin aux lilas, Dark Elegies, Pillar of Fire, a one-act Romeo and Juliet and Undertow, his place in dance history is secure. In these ballets Tudor explored human feeling through movement of extreme precision. The anguish in Jardin, the exquisite sweep of Romeo, the sexual urgency in Pillar of Fire, are as potent today as when they were first seen, and Dark Elegies, made in 1937 as a realisation of Mahler's Kindertotenlieder must still pierce an audience's heart while our civilisation sacrifices children to war and natural disaster. For a man so compassionate in his creations, Tudor was notoriously prickly, difficult in his relationships with dancers and collaborators. His affections were tenacious, but his tongue could be ungenerous in dealing with the often insecure psyches of dancers. Telling them the truth - his truth  - for their own good did not so much brace them as appear a bitter response to a need for help. Tudor's life must seem in many aspects that of a disappointed man. A self-created figure, he was transformed from William Cook, son of a butcher in Central Street, London EC1 and destined for the meat trade, into Antony Tudor, apprentice dancer at Marie Rambert's studio in 1928, and thence, thanks to Rambert's goadings and encouragement, into a choreographer of profound originality. There may have been difficulties in making his work known - it was hardly in keeping with an audience taste nurtured on Ballets Russes glamour or Vic-Wells classicism - but Tudor had devoted associates, notably the elegant, expressive Maude Lloyd; Peggy van Praagh; and the dancer Hugh Laing, who was his companion for more than 50 years. By the mid 1930s Tudor was making great things. In 1939 Tudor and Laing went to the US to join the newly-founded Ballet Theatre. For this company Tudor produced masterpieces - Nora Kaye his muse for Pillar of Fire, and Alicia Markova an exquisite Juliet in Romeo, with Laing a crucial figure in these, as in Undertow, which explored a murderer's psyche. Then the well-spring of inspiration seemed to dry. Brief sorties to New York City Ballet and to Sweden were neither fruitful nor happy. Ballets failed, and by the 1950s Tudor devoted himself increasingly to teaching in New York. Zen Buddhism seemed to bring further discipline to an already austere temperament, but there came an upsurge of creativity when Tudor returned to England for two visits to work with the Royal Ballet. He staged Shadowplay for Anthony Dowell at Covent Garden in 1967, and in the following year made Knight Errant for David Wall with the Royal Ballet's touring section. Two last works were made in 1975 and 1978 for American Ballet Theatre. Tudor died in 1987 at the age of 79, and a year later Laing, too, died. Such a man, and such a career, merits serious and searching biography, and now that need is the more urgent in the light of Donna Perlmutter's nugatory life of Antony Tudor. It is difficult to know how to qualify this vulgarly written exercise save as one of those books that demand to be thrown across the room in fury at their stupefying awfulness. I gather from the dust-jacket that Miss Perlmutter is a Los Angeles journalist. Her prose style contrives to be arch, strident, and given to a fearful sprightliness, as if afraid that readers might not otherwise reach the end of a sentence. That Miss Perlmutter has a taste for neologisms - 'policymeisters', 'spitework', 'dancewright', Tudor the 'interiorscape' and 'characterological' are a few choice specimens - is an incidental deterrent to her text. That she has subjected Tudor's work and his relationships to reach-me-down psycho-analysis is an abiding annoyance. As page succeeded hectic page, I gained an impression that Miss Perlmutter has failed to understand the nature of Tudor's ballets, or has much familiarity with the fabric of dance history. She believes that Tudor 'plucked' Anthony Dowell 'from the corps de ballet' for Shadowplay, ignorant of the fact that he was already a principal of the Royal Ballet. And to aver that Tudor cast the ballet with 'sensitive nobodies' may intrigue Dowell, Merle Park and Derek Rencher, the eminent and well-established principals of the first performance. She believes that Markova was a guest artist with Ballet Theatre at the time of the creation of Romeo. Dame Alicia's memoirs provide a different and more reliable account of the staging of a very beautiful ballet. Miss Perlmutter's view is that biography is means of re-hashing in lurid terms the stormier scenes of her subject's life. In the process, Tudor's art and genius are cheapened. Miss Perlmutter fails in matter of research by glossing over his Swedish visits, and certain other foreign journeyings, and fails even more significantly in her assessments of his creations. She prefers, instead, gossip and amateurish analysis, and the resultant portrait is as foolishly hectic as any back-stage chatter.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Investors wary ahead of April jobs data This week's calendar is dotted with important economic readings, culminating with Friday's report on April employment trends. With the Federal Reserve in the process of tightening monetary policy, and its next move to higher interest rates expected any day, the mood is wary. However, it is even more difficult than usual to forecast the direction share prices will take as Friday approaches. Yesterday's action revealed the market's mercurial bent. Cyclical stocks finished with solid gains, despite the flat reaction during the morning to a seemingly favourable report from the National Association of Purchasing Management. The NAPM's April survey showed the industrial sector continued to grow at a healthy pace in April, while prices were rising at more moderate rate than in the previous two months. 'Greenspan (the Fed chairman) told us basically in February to watch for any scrap of inflation information we can find, so that's what we are doing,' says Mr Donald Straszheim, of Merrill Lynch in New York. Looking ahead to the employment data, Mr Straszheim is forecasting that payrolls increased by 140,000 in April, a gain consistent with second-quarter economic growth of about 4 per cent. At first glance, the financial markets certainly seem inclined to accentuate the negative. Last Thursday, bonds were battered on the announcement that gross domestic product had grown at weaker-than-expected 2.6 per cent in the first quarter. Investors apparently suspected that the economy had accelerated as soon as the harsh winter weather lifted. Two worrying inflation readings included in the GDP report also weighed heavily in the fixed-income markets. 'The inflation figures scared people and so they figured the Fed is going to lean even heavier on the brakes and abort the recovery,' says Mr Alfred Goldman, of AG Edwards in St Louis. Spooked by the prospect of tighter money, equity investors ran scared. Or did they? Sure, the Dow industrials fell 31 points on the day, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was only marginally lower. 'In my opinion, stocks handled a very weak bond market very well,' says Mr Don Hays, of Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Norfolk. He characterises the session as 'neutral', pointing out that each successive sell-off since February's shift in monetary policy has been milder than the previous one. Mr Hays expects another steep decline in the next two or three weeks, probably when the Fed decides to tighten again. 'That will be the next little test of the market,' he says. But in the middle term, the analyst is bullish, predicting a big upturn soon after the Fed's next policy-making session on May 17. Mr Goldman holds much the same view. 'I'm looking for three or four more weeks of backing and filling - up a little, down a little - but basically building a base for an interim rally going into the summer,' he says.</p>

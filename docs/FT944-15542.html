			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Arts: An enlightened 'Euryanthe' - Opera in concert We are in debt to the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the South Bank's 'associate orchestra', for many enlightening performances. On Sunday, however, Carl Maria von Weber's opera Euryanthe came up like a revelation: who would have believed that it could be so stirring? Happily, the Queen Elizabeth Hall was packed out with the OAE's devoted audience - but it is a thousand pities that Euryanthe is not running for two or three evenings more. The 'Deutsche Romantik' series will be lucky to strike gold again with such eclat. Euryanthe came two years after Weber's Der Freischutz, and less than three before his Oberon for London and his untimely death here (he was not yet 40). Unlike the popular folk-tale Freischutz it has an old-fashioned chivalric plot, generally agreed to exceed the limits of preposterousness. (The story is so batty that even the programme was muddled about just whose suicidal sister's ghost needed laying.) That said, Weber set about animating every moment with direct, passionate feeling and a wealth of original resource. That was what we heard on Sunday: not just a performance that was often thrilling, but a proclamation that Euryanthe really is a magnificent operatic score. Everyone who collaborated in it was on peak form. A special mention is due to the bass-baritone Nicholas Folwell, who had learned the role of the villainous Lysiart at very short notice, and delivered it with grim confidence and a torrent of lustily rolled 'r's. The hapless heroine herself was Christine Brewer, who explored the surprising range and depth of her part with exquisite sensitivity. Nicely matched against her, Elizabeth Connell lent her familiar, formidable powers to the wicked Eglantine. Jon Garrison was a stylish hero, Adolar; in the lesser role of the King, young Nathan Berg's beautiful baritone reminded us that he is a star in the making; and in faceless small parts Elizabeth Woollett and Timothy Robinson made positive marks. The hero of the evening was nevertheless Mark Elder, conducting the OAE with tireless energy and imagination. Not only the main numbers, but all the fluid 'recitatives' - misleadingly so called, for scarcely any of them are mere declamation over chords: Weber - and Elder - shaped them lovingly, instilling them with moment-to-moment drama and dressing them often in unheard-of orchestral colours. In all that, the OAE's 'original'-style instruments came superbly into their own. Wonderful vox humana bassoons, dewy flutes, a clattery hubbub of horns, trombones with a hoarse, rousing blat that never domineer over the tutti sound. Perhaps half the problem with Euryanthe in this century has been that Weber understood his own instruments so perfectly, and deployed them so brilliantly, that modern playing-machines can never do him more than dusty justice.

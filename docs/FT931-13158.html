			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / NFC to sell waste management arm for over Pounds 100m NFC, the transport and logistics company, is about to sell its waste management division to Wessex Waste Management, the joint venture between Waste Management of the US and Wessex Water. The sale is expected to be finalised later this week. None of the parties would comment on the transaction, but it is understood the sale price is slightly more than Pounds 100m. NFC's shares gained 10p to 271p, prompted by a circular from NatWest Securities saying the sale was 'imminent'. Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, the circular's author, said the purchase was at a 'full price' but below NFC's original target of Pounds 160m. The deal would make Wessex Waste Management one of the UK's top five waste specialists, behind companies such as Cleanaway and Biffa. WWM has recently considered several potential acquisitions and wants to lift annual turnover to improve margins. WWM, which trades under the name UK Waste, was set up in 1991. Following the acquisition of Wimpey's waste division, it has raised annual turnover to about Pounds 45m. If the NFC deal is approved, the enlarged group's turnover would approach Pounds 80m, compared with Pounds 90m at Biffa, which is owned by water company Severn Trent. NFC's waste division, which is highly regarded, was started in 1962. It is one of the top 10 companies in the UK and especially strong in the north west. In the year ending September 1991, the division made operating profits of Pounds 3.72m on turnover of Pounds 29.8m. Following a review of strategy two years ago, NFC has regularly said the division is not core to its main businesses of transport, logistics and home services. Another non-core business, Pickfords Travel, was sold last year to Airtours for Pounds 16m. NFC is also keen to expand its logistics business and last year spent Pounds 75m on acquisitions in the US and Europe. This pushed year-end gearing to 55 per cent, which some analysts said was high and could hold back growth. According to one observer, NFC is selling because waste management is becoming dominated by large specialists who can afford heavy capital expenditure. 'Waste is long term and capital hungry so there are better places for NFC's money,' he said. Lex, Page 18</p>

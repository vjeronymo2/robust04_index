			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Serbia manages to silence the voices of hope Whenever Sarajevo was bombed by Serb forces, Azra Nuhefendic would run to the phone to find out whether her sister, trapped in the besieged Bosnian capital, was safe. From Belgrade her only link with her native city was a husband and wife team of radio amateurs, Dragan and Liljana Dimitrijevic. With telephone, post and road connections cut off, the Serbian couple have sent thousands of messages back and forth from people divided by the frontlines in Bosnia. For up to 15 hours each day, they would contact their ham counterparts in Bosnia, who in turn, would establish a radio to telephone link so that people could speak with each other in spite of the war. But, following a ban by the government in Belgrade, the Dimitrijevics, and up to 150 other ham radio operators, no longer transmit messages from Serbia or Montenegro which comprise what remains of Yugoslavia. They are at a loss to pinpoint the reasons behind the ban - speculation ranges from fears of espionage to outright cruelty. 'The army thinks that radio amateurs send coded messages. But there are 1,000 other ways if someone wants to transmit ciphers,' says Mr Dimitrijevic. His wife is less sanguine. 'I am so angry that people could forbid this humanitarian act,' she says, adding that, until the ban three months ago, people from all around the world would ring, anxious for news of their relatives in Bosnia. The Bosnian government was the first to ban direct telephone contacts - insisting that radio amateurs transmitted the messages by themselves rather than allowing a third party to speak. Amateur radio operators give examples of the types of messages that they used to send. 'Are you still alive?, What do you need? Enes is dead' - hardly examples of war-time treachery. Mr Milos Vasic, an editor of the independent Belgrade weekly Vreme, dismisses any suspicion that military secrets were transmitted - saying simply, 'the authorities want to forbid human contact.' While the Dimitrijevics have not yet managed to collect the ridiculous number of documents required to re-register their station, they have not had trouble from the authorities. But a Moslem radio amateur living in the Serbian capital said that one day, without warning, the police came to his door and took away his equipment. Radio operators have helped the outside world find out what was happening in the mostly Moslem enclaves. 'Many times I spoke with radio amateurs while their towns were under bombardment,' says Mrs Dimitrijevic. A devotee to her hobby for 38 years, who met her husband over the radio waves. But the crackling radio sometimes brought laughs amid the grief. 'One woman had not seen her husband in two years. Finally we established a telephone contact - but the voice was so distorted that she insisted that it was not her husband,' explained Mrs Dimitrijevic. 'When he started to curse she laughed and said, 'So it really is you'.'</p>

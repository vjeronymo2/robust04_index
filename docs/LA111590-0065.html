			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes.  </P> <P> Rated R. An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets' Society" and "Witness,"  this one is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish  while on a school outing. A psychedelic/supernatural story supposedly based on  an actual account.  </P> <P> "Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among  the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that  of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly  receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an  hour away. Intense, humorous and powerful. ERIK HAMILTON  </P></p>

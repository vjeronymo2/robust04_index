			<p>BFN     [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  described the NATO air strike against the Serb advance on the  east Bosnian town of Gorazde as "justified, necessary, and also  right." On Westdeutscher Rundfunk's morning magazine program  today, Kinkel expressed "hope that the Serbs will now come to  their senses; otherwise NATO may be forced to intervene there  again." This is possible according to UN Security Council  resolution 836. "We are dealing here with one of the UN's safe  areas which may be protected if force is used [against it]  without any further decisions [being necessary]," the foreign  minister stressed.    At the same time Kinkel spoke in favor of making further  progress in the political field. It is of prime importance that  the Russian side plays a part, he said. Kinkel called on Russia  to exert its influence on the Serbs.</p>

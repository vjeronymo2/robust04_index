			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Witnesses shall first be examined by their attorney and by opposing attorneys for their competency to support their written testimony and exhibits (voir dire). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Witnesses may then summarize, highlight or read their testimony. However, witnesses may not materially supplement or alter their written testimony except to correct it, unless the Panel expands the witness' testimony to complete the record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Parties are entitled to raise objections to evidence on any proper ground during the course of the hearing, including an objection that an opposing party has not furnished nonprivileged underlying documents. However, they may not raise objections that were apparent from the face of a written case and could have been raised before the hearing without leave from the Panel. See &sect;251.45(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) All written testimony and exhibits will be received into the record, except any to which the Panel sustains an objection; no separate motion will be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) If the Panel rejects or excludes testimony and an offer of proof is made, the offer of proof shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence which it is contended would have been adduced. In the case of documentary or written evidence, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of proof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Panel shall discourage the presentation of cumulative evidence, and may limit the number of witnesses that may be heard on behalf of any one party on any one issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Parties are entitled to conduct cross-examination and redirect examination. Cross-examination is limited to matters raised on direct examination. Redirect examination is limited to matters raised on cross-examination. The Panel, however, may limit cross-examination and redirect examination if in its judgment this evidence or examination would be cumulative or cause undue delay. Conversely, this subsection does not restrict the discretion of the Panel to expand the scope of cross-examination or redirect examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Documents that have not been exchanged in advance may be shown to a witness on cross-examination. However, copies of such documents must be distributed to the Panel and to other participants or their counsel at hearing before being shown to the witness at the time of cross-examination, unless the Panel directs otherwise. If the document is not, or will not be, supported by a witness for the cross-examining party, that document can be used solely to impeach the witness's direct testimony and cannot itself be relied upon in findings of fact as rebutting the witness' direct testimony. However, upon leave from the Panel, the document may be admitted as evidence without a sponsoring witness if official notice is proper, or if, in the Panel's view, the cross-examined witness is the proper sponsoring witness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) A CARP will encourage individuals or groups with the same or similar interests in a proceeding to select a single representative to conduct their examination and cross-examination for them. However, if there is no agreement on the selection of a representative, each individual or group will be allowed to conduct its own examination and cross-examination, but only on issues affecting its particular interests, provided that the questioning is not repetitious or cumulative of the questioning of their parties within the group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;251.48  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Rules of evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Admissibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In any public hearing before a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, evidence that is not unduly repetitious or cumulative and is relevant and material shall be admissible. The testimony of any witness will not be considered evidence in a proceeding unless the witness has been sworn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documentary evidence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence that is submitted in the form of documents or detailed data and information shall be presented as exhibits. Relevant and material matter embraced in a document containing other matter not material or relevant or not intended as evidence must be plainly designated as the matter offered in evidence, and the immaterial or irrelevant parts shall be marked clearly so as to show they are not intended as evidence. In cases where a document in which material and relevant matter occurs is of such bulk that it would unnecessarily encumber the record, it may be marked for identification and the relevant and material parts, once properly authenticated, may be read into the record. If the Panel desires, a true copy of the material and relevant matter may be presented in extract form, and submitted as evidence. Anyone presenting documents as evidence must present copies to all other participants at the hearing or their attorneys, and afford them an opportunity to examine the documents in their entirety and offer into evidence any other portion that may be considered material and relevant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documents filed with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or Copyright Office.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the matter offered in evidence is contained in documents already on file with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or the Copyright Office, the documents themselves need not be produced, but may instead be referred to according to how they have been filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public documents.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a public document such as an official report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic data, is offered in evidence either in whole or in part, and if the document has been issued by an Executive Department, a legislative agency or committee, or a Federal administrative agency (Government-owned corporations included), and is proved by the party offering it to be reasonably available to the public, the document need not be produced physically, but may be offered instead by identifying the document and signaling the relevant parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Introduction of studies and analyses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If studies or analyses are offered in evidence, they shall state clearly the study plan, all relevant assumptions, the techniques of data collection, and the techniques of estimation and testing. The facts and judgments upon which conclusions are based shall be stated clearly, together with any alternative courses of action considered. If requested, tabulations of input data shall be made available to the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statistical studies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Statistical studies offered in evidence shall be accompanied by a summary of their assumptions, their study plans, and their procedures. Supplementary details shall be included in appendices. For each of the following types of statistical studies the following should be furnished: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sample surveys.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A clear description of the survey design, the definition of the universe under consideration, the sampling frame and units, the validity and confidence limits on major estimates; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An explanation of the method of selecting the sample and of which characteristics were measured or counted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Econometric investigations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A complete description of the econometric model, the reasons for each assumption, and the reasons for the statistical specification; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A clear statement of how any changes in the assumptions might affect the final result; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

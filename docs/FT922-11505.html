			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris Czech deal approved PHILIP MORRIS, the US tobacco company, is to become the second largest foreign investor in Czechoslovakia. The Czech government yesterday approved its offer for Tabak, the former tobacco monopoly in the Czech republic. The US tobacco giant has pledged Dollars 395.8m in cash and capital expenditures to become the eventual majority shareholder of Tabak. Volkswagen of Germany last year offered to invest DM9bn (Dollars 5.40bn) by the year 2000 for Skoda, the local car manufacturer. Philip Morris will buy an initial 30 per cent of Tabak for Dollars 104.4m, and has offered a similar amount for another 30 per cent of the company. The US company has also pledged to invest an additional Dollars 187m in the local company. Under the terms of the tender, which attracted the world's biggest tobacco companies, the Czech National Property Fund, the state body holding Tabak's remaining shares, has the option to sell the additional 30 per cent to Philip Morris. The sale will be possible once a Monopoly Act dating from the Austro-Hungarian empire, and defining Tabak as a state-owned monopoly, is repealed. The Czech government could then allow Philip Morris to own 60 per cent of Tabak. This stake could also be raised to 65 per cent pending further negotiations. The choice of a final buyer comes after months of controversial negotiations over the sale of a former monopoly in the republic. International tobacco companies have bitterly complained about the recent government decision not to sell Tabak's plants separately to competing buyers. 'We have contractual guarantees that Philip Morris will maintain existing facilities and business operations for a number of years,' said Mr Bruce Bybee from Crimson Capital Corporation, the Czech government adviser.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Woolworth losses widen to Dollars 42m Losses at Woolworth, the beleaguered US retailer, widened still further in the second quarter to July in spite of the company's decision last year to close 970 underperforming general merchandise stores in the US and Canada. Net losses rose to Dollars 42m from Dollars 10m on revenues down to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 2.3bn. Losses per share rose to 32 cents from 8 cents and, as announced last month, the dividend has been slashed to 15 cents from 29 cents. Last year, Woolworth embarked on a restructuring to improve its poor financial performance. In addition to closing 970 variety stores, it sold its loss-making Woolco discount store chain in Canada to Wal-Mart Stores. Yesterday's figures showed that these moves had slightly improved the performance of its North American operations: operating profits in the US rose to Dollars 40m from Dollars 24m, and in Canada, the comparable quarter's operating loss of Dollars 19m turned into an operating profit of Dollars 1m. However, Woolworth's operations in the rest of the world, mainly comprising its specialty retailing chains such as Foot Locker and its general merchandise stores in Germany, increased their operating losses to Dollars 47m from Dollars 10m. Woolworth blamed weak economic conditions, particularly in Germany. The net losses also included a supplementary charge of Dollars 30m relating to the disposal of the Woolco chain. Last year Woolworth took a pre-tax charge of Dollars 168m for losses on the sale. Woolworth said if the discontinued operations were excluded from the comparable period's figures, revenues would have shown an increase of 4.1 per cent. However, the market, disappointed at the company's lack of progress towards profitability, marked the shares down Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 1/4 in early trade. The shares closed the day at 15 3/8 . For the six months to July, net losses rose to Dollars 80m from Dollars 34m in the comparable period, including the Dollars 30m charge. Leaving aside the two quarters last year in which Woolworth falsified its figures to create the illusion of profitability, the company has not made a profit since 1992.</p>

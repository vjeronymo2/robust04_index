			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Letter: Costs that influence central banks' mood for Maastricht Sir, There is evidence to support Observer's suspicion ('Banker's cutback', June 17) that some EC central banks are 'expensive'; or at least that their running costs vary widely. Using data from annual reports and information supplied by the central banks, Central Banking puts the operating expenses of five EC banks in 1990 as follows: Bundesbank DM2bn (Dollars 1.35bn); Bank of Italy L1,5l0 bn (Dollars 1.34bn); Bank of France FFr6.52bn (Dollars 1.28bn); Bank of England Pounds 170m (Dollars 294m); Netherlands Bank Fl 227m (Dollars 120m). Where possible these figures exclude the cost of printing bank notes. There are obviously historical reasons for these variations: staff numbers vary widely, from over 16,000 in the case of the Bundesbank and Bank of France to 1,500 in the Netherlands Bank, as do the functions performed by the banks. Nevertheless, central bankers are well aware that their costs will come under closer scrutiny as they travel down the road to Emu, which is one reason why some of them are less than enthusiastic about the Maastricht Treaty.

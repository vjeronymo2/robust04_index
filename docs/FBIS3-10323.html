			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement drafted and released by the Citizens of the East, </F> Center, and West: "The Embassy's Hand in the Court's Election;"  place and date not given]    [Text] Once again, the U.S. Embassy attempts to meddle in  our domestic affairs, as it has been doing throughout our  country's history. Not satisfied with bossing the Executive  Branch as it pleased regarding the peace agreements, this time  the embassy attempts to override the Legislative Assembly -- a  highly vulnerable branch, as has been demonstrated over and over  with the constitutional reform -- by trying to impose a Supreme  Court of Justice [CSJ] willing to bend at the slightest hint  from State Department officials.    A list with the names of candidates of various political  inclinations -- is the list the result of a consensus? -- which  did not even meet the requirements demanded by law. [sentence as  published] In addition, international news agency reports  announced to the world that Dr. Armando Calderon Sol had agreed  to negotiate the CSJ in exchange for the certainty that he would  win the presidency of the Republic in the March elections.    This nefarious meddling has been confirmed by the president  of one of the lawyers' associations that present lists of  candidates for the new CSJ. This person held the position of  minister of justice in the first Revolutionary Junta of the  Government, which came into being by the grace of the  indescribable embassy, after General Romero's overthrow. This  same minister was the originator, or at least the leading  drafter, of the Junta's historic decree that declared the 1962  Constitution in force "in everything not running contrary to the  Armed Forces' 15 October proclamation...." This legal  monstrosity of a decree can only be compared to another, which  said "for this once only," issued by the infamous Generals  Martinez and Castaneda Castro.    We are extremely concerned that this lawyer, who is also the  proxy of the multinational oil enterprise recently found to be  involved in a scandal because its president was arrested, is the  patron of the "No to Continuism" campaign, contrary to the  principle accepted by American law saying that magistrates  should be "left in their positions permanently" and even be left  therein for life for the sake of a healthy administration of  justice.    Finally, we wish to say that these impossible-to-understand  positions can only be explained by the obstinate and determined  position of the U.S. Government, which dared finance a Truth  Commission, whose exclusive role was to discredit and lash out  at the Judicial Branch for the sole reason that this branch  remained independent and resisted the pressure to make our  country more vulnerable to foreign interests.    We reject foreign interests and their well-paid lawyers! We  want magistrates to be appointed for their capabilities, not for  their interests or ideologies! Out with the foreign political  handling of the Judicial Branch!    [Signed] Citizens of the East, Center, and West.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Kamal] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mustafa Mashhur, the strong  man in the Muslim Brotherhood, denies any link between the group  and violence. In an interview with ROSE AL-YUSUF, he said: Our  method since we came out of prison has been not to participate  in any incident. Our connection with any extremist group has  not been proven, from Shaykh al-Dhahabi [murdered by the  Repudiation and Renunciation group], the Military Technical  School incidents, the assassination of [former president]  al-Sadat, to the Asyut incidents. We in fact have issued  several statements criticizing violence.    ROSE AL-YUSUF: The repentant al-Shawqiyun Group  leader has accused you of supporting terrorism with money.    Mashhur: I have no knowledge of that. Let them  investigate. If it is proven that Ahmad 'Ubayd (the man named by  'Adil 'Abd-al- Baqi in his confessions) or any one else has done  so, let them bring them to account. But the Muslim Brotherhood  has nothing to do with this.    ROSE AL-YUSUF: Don't you have any connection with  Ahmad 'Ubayd?    Mashhur: I mean that we have nothing to do with  the money, and Ahmad 'Ubayd has not informed us that he gave  money.    ROSE AL-YUSUF: Does the Muslim Brotherhood intend  to escalate the situation and declare civil disobedience in the  professional unions?    Mashhur: Our method is moderation, and not  violence, capitulation, and weakness. We are carrying out a  message. This is the right of every citizen. It is my right to  say that Islam is the solution, just as others say socialism is  the solution. Actually, we exist legally, but it is they [the  government] who do not want to recognize us.

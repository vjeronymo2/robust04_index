			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARCO AURELIO ROBLES; EX-PRESIDENT OF PANAMA WHO FLED AFTER COUP  </P> <P> Marco Aurelio Robles, president of Panama from 1964 to 1968, has died in a  Miami hospital after a long illness, his family said Sunday.  </P> <P> Robles was 84 and had lived in Florida since he turned the presidency over to  Arnulfo Arias Madrid in 1968.  </P> <P> Arias Madrid, however, was quickly ousted in a military coup led by Gen. Omar  Torrijos.  </P> <P> Robles' family said he died Saturday after a long illness but did not provide  details.  </P> <P> Robles was general manager of the Panamanian National Bank, minister of  government and justice, and a deputy in the National Assembly before becoming  president in 1964, in an election filled with charges of irregularities.  </P> <P> In 1965, after lengthy clashes between U.S. students and Panamanians over a  ruling that Panamanian and American flags be hoisted simultaneously at a school  in the Canal Zone, Robles signed a joint declaration with President Lyndon B.  Johnson agreeing to draw up a new Panama Canal treaty.  </P> <P> Robles' remaining years in office were filled with ongoing charges over the  supposed rigging of the 1964 election and other political infighting. He  survived impeachment proceedings but went into exile after his candidate for  the presidency, David Samudio, was defeated by Arias Madrid on May 12, 1968.  </P></p>

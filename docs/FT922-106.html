			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo eroded by rumour and higher yen THE erosion of the Japanese market continued last week, beginning with rumours of major difficulties in real estate and closing with a decline in blue chip electricals, sold on the potential effect of a higher yen. Europe was also depressed, weighed down by the UK, which was worried about the Wellcome share issue and staggered by the ousting of BP chairman and chief executive Mr Robert Horton. At least Denmark was 2.1 per cent better, enlivened in a week when the country's unfancied football team won the European Nations' Cup. With the US uncertain but neutral, perhaps ominously taking the view that bad economic data might be good for an interest rate cut and, therefore, the equity market, the World Index had nowhere to go but down, for the fourth week in succession. Hong Kong saw a renewed upsurge, taking its gain this year to 45.5 per cent. Hoare Govett Asia says Hongkong Bank's successful conclusion to its bid for Midland, of the UK, was one reason for the latest show of strength; in addition, there was a corporate takeover 'which set a new benchmark for rising office property values'. 'At a deeper level, however,' says the broker, 'the market's strength can be attributed to an environment of cheap money and political reform in China.' Mr David Pirkis, a director of Kim Eng Securities in London, elaborates on the real estate angle, saying the office and residential property markets have been 'out of synch' lately. Residential has been in the top quartile of its cycle with capital gains of between 70 and 80 per cent last year, while the office market only bottomed in the last quarter of 1991. This year, he says, end users and investors have been buying offices, the former thinking that rents will go up and the latter prepared to accept low yields in an environment of negative interest rates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**     sterling** US Dollars**             1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of  Start of    Start of                                           1992      1992        1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.03     -3.70    -19.78    +4.88     +1.85       +3.00 Belgium      -0.59     -3.97     -2.66    +1.06     -1.33       -0.21 Denmark      +2.14     -8.29    -13.78    -8.88     -9.62       -8.61 Finland      +0.15     -6.14    -23.39    +1.09     -1.46       -0.35 France       -0.22     -5.74    +10.22    +8.73     +7.68       +8.89 Germany      -1.45     -3.36     -1.09    +8.57     +5.82       +7.01 Ireland      -2.05     -3.74     -4.64    -4.58     -6.39       -5.35 Italy        -1.62     -7.37    -19.27    -6.19     -8.37       -7.34 Netherlands  -1.27     -4.06     +4.93    +7.47     +4.74       +5.92 Norway       -2.77    -10.71    -21.58    -1.32     -2.98       -1.90 Spain        -2.88     -7.49    -10.75    -1.28     -2.38       -1.28 Sweden       -1.08     -6.53    -11.36    +6.97     +5.88       +7.07 Switzerland  -1.26     -3.47     +9.81   +11.27     +7.72       +8.93 UK           -2.02     -6.70     +4.28    +2.53     +2.53       +3.69 EUROPE       -1.51     -5.72     +1.25    +4.17     +2.97       +4.12 Australia    +0.42     -2.43     +7.13    -1.31     -4.16       -3.09 Hong Kong    +5.61     +1.23    +69.48   +45.52    +44.80      +46.43 Japan        -2.95    -11.02    -33.15   -29.10    -30.28      -29.49 Malaysia     +0.32     +1.95     -8.01    +3.83    +11.35      +12.60 New Zealand  -0.73     -3.34     +2.47    -2.21     -2.66       -1.58 Singapore    -0.29     -2.77     +4.46    +1.60     +0.56       +1.69 Canada       +0.18     -2.22     -6.24    -5.28     -9.19       -8.18 USA          -0.15     -3.07     +9.32    -3.30     -4.38       +3.30 Mexico       -3.84    -15.12    +46.59    +2.60     -1.19       -0.08 South Africa -1.14     -2.59    +10.53    +6.01    -11.08      -10.08 WORLD INDEX  -1.12     -5.73     -6.34    -8.60    -10.05       -9.04  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on June 26th 1992.

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: West Lothian - Ballot Box With the creation of a Scottish parliament the flagship of Labour's policy for Scotland, it is remarkable that the party has not devoted any of its election press conferences in Glasgow to saying in detail what it proposes. We know from the manifesto that it would have power over internal affairs in Scotland and would be elected by an 'additional member system' of proportional representation. But Labour has not said publicly how many MPs it wants, how the electoral system would work and what the Scottish administration would look like. Privately it says that it would like between 120 and 140 MPs, the majority elected by the first-past-the-post system, topped up from party lists. There would be a Scottish chief minister with about 12 ministers (there are five Scottish Office ministers now). But Donald Dewar, who hopes to be secretary of state for Scotland, sounds uneasy when asked what he would do if and when there is a Scottish chief minister as well. And Labour has convinced few but its own supporters that Scotland should continue to have 72 Scottish MPs at Westminster (its population merits 58). Thus the real constitutional debate will begin when Labour, if it forms a government, publishes its Scottish parliament bill. English MPs of all parties will then want their say, just as they did the last time when devolution was debated at length in the late 1970s. In a hung parliament, no doubt a handful of Plaid Cymru members would want their say as well, not to speak of the Ulster MPs and, above all, the SNP who will watch the Scottish legislation like hawks. All of which makes for some late nights and much parliamentary bargaining to keep a minority government in office.</p>

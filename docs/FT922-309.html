			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: Alba applies to acquire Banco de Progreso CORPORACION Alba, the holding company controlled by Spain's wealthy March family, has applied to buy Banco de Progreso, the investment bank in which it has a 40 per cent stake. Alba plans to merge Progreso with Banco Urquijo, the medium-sized domestic retail bank also controlled by the family. Through indirect shareholdings, the March family owns about 70 per cent of Progreso. Alba will pay Pta2,700 a share, at a 12.5 per cent premium, for outright control valuing the bank at Pta20.1bn (Dollars 207m). The Madrid stockmarket commission suspended trading in Progreso following the announcement of the bid. The acquisition and the subsequent merger have been prompted by the breakdown of negotiations to sell Progreso to La Caixa, the Barcelona-based savings bank that ranks as Spain's biggest financial institution. La Caixa is understood to have objected to the concentration of Progreso's loans and to the Pta18bn to Pta20bn price placed on bank.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ibrahim Nafi': "Unemployment Facts in Egypt; </F> Accurate Figures, What is the Remedy?"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] What are the facts of the  situation in Egypt? During the past three years, I have tried to  obtain accurate figures on the size of unemployment in Egypt, as  well as the type of unemployment. I have obtained judgements and  estimates that do not inspire confidence, nor do they add  anything to the already dissimilar numbers and varying  estimates. Finally, I was asked to wait until registration was  completed, which is the first count of the unemployed in  cooperation between national and international experts. Finally,  last week, I received a report on the results of the  compilation, done by the cabinet's data center in all  governorates, in cooperation with the Ministries of Local  Administration and Manpower and Employment. It is a report that  contains most the important and precise details, since the  program used to prepare it confirms results reached through  scientific impartiality and tells the truth about the facts of  the issue.    1. Fact No. 1: This report gives us a sound basis for  objective dialogue and puts the true scope of the problem  squarely before us. It also presents extremely important data  for each Egyptian individual and family. It must attract the  attention of intellectuals, experts, businessmen, and the  ministry responsible for workers and labor, which is the  Ministry of Manpower and Employment. I ask the reader's  permission to present this data, as it came in this report:     -  Number of those entering the labor market between 1982 and  1993, and who are seeking work...4,841,000    -  Number of those trained for their jobs...3,415,887    -  Total number of unemployed university and school graduates,  who  graduated between 1984 and 1993...1,425,113    -  Percentage of those within the labor force...9.2    -  Majority having mid-level qualifications...1,098,909    -  Majority located in rural areas...1,007,356    -  31 percent of unemployed are married, and majority of them  are  female, or are males who have temporary jobs...435,066       2. Fact No. 2: The real size of the problem, and what must  be  dealt with, is the 990,047 persons who are looking for jobs. The  other part includes females who are married and want to work,  i.e., they have a family and, consequently, their need for work  is less than the need of others. Despite being close to 1  million, the number is completely at variance with the  philosophical judgements and claims to knowledge of those who,  for a long time, persisted in estimating that unemployment in  Egypt had reached several millions. I do not want to belittle  the size of the problem, but I also would like to put it in its  true perspective. I am pleased that I am the first to  participate, through the al-AHRAM organization, in the call to  formulate programs to ensure the reduction of this number to a  few thousand, and to participate in implementing these programs.  I believe that together--government, business organizations,  banks, trade unions, and intellectuals--we can formulate these  programs, arrange the funding required for them, and implement  them efficiently. Yes, all of us, if our intentions are sincere,  can put this issue on the agenda of all our leadership councils.  All of us must take part in resolving this problem.    All of us are responsible; the government is responsible for  operating the largest possible number of training centers, and  for giving direct incentives to those who absorb the unemployed.  Economic and service projects are responsible for expanding  their activities, opening new markets for their products, and  increasing use of capabilities available to them. Young people  are also responsible. They must accept jobs that may not be  compatible with their academic qualifications. They must be  persuaded that appropriate qualification is that qualification  that is needed and demanded by the market, and not necessarily  the qualification that they chose during their education.    3. Fact No. 3: For well-known reasons, the largest part of  unemployment is in rural areas. The most important reasons are:  the graduates' aversion to working in the fields after they are  educated; decisive expansion in machine use, in order to  increase production; and, limited growth in agricultural  production and certain integrated, peripheral activities.    The clear consequence of all this is the decisive need to  think about the future of Egypt's rural development, since it is  impossible to continue economic activities in a large number of  governorates that are restricted to agriculture. That will lead  to keeping the unemployed without work and will add to their  number new thousands of those who have had opportunities for  education and whose residence is in rural areas.    Yes, it is impossible to continue the course of development  as it is now in rural areas. There are certain successful  experiences in the world at this time with regard to  diversifying economic activities in the countryside, using  agricultural activity as a springboard for other activities.  Experiences in Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China deserve  close study. Therefore, I call on the government to form a team  of national experts who have had previous experience in the  business sector, and task them with going to these countries,  studying their experiences in comprehensive rural development,  obtaining all necessary details, and absorbing possible lessons  from these experiences. They should then formulate programs that  could be implemented in Egypt, defining the mechanisms of  implementation, resources required, and appropriate sources for  these resources.    4. Fact No. 4: Those with middle-level qualifications  represent the largest part of those seeking work (77 percent of  the total unemployed).    This clearly means that the market does not need their  skills. It is also clear that the holder of an industrial  diploma has not been trained to be a craftsman. The holder of a  commercial diploma has not been qualified to be a skilled  specialist in financial and accounting matters. The holder of  the skills acquired with an agricultural diploma is limited to  working agricultural jobs. If it is necessary to keep this kind  of education, it will be necessary to change the content and  method of preparation. The change should be radical. We all know  that this is not an easy matter. It requires time and resources.  However, we also know that keeping the situation as it is at  present is no longer acceptable. Every lesson learned from the  preceding experience of other countries tells us that they  abandoned the kind of education that is applied in Egypt, and  replaced it with vocational training. This vocational education  gives only one day of class work to every five days of practical  experience, that is training in the work place. Egyptian  education and instructional experts should repeatedly visit  those countries, in order to create a plan to introduce the  desired developments into our curricula in these schools and  vocational training programs.    I would also like to see intensified activity to breathe  life  into the nearly 450 training centers scattered throughout Egypt,  although the data available to me confirms that the biggest part  of them need radical development of their capabilities and  administration. Training technical cadres is one of the  principal pivotal points on the road to reducing unemployment.  We must give it special importance and maximum priority in our  concerns. The current picture needs changing. The time has come  to attract special attention from the ministers of industry and  the labor force.    The problem is urgent and its remedy requires both time and  money. Our sincere efforts on a sound basis will achieve  tangible results toward controlling the problem and limiting it.  Everyone must cooperate to attain this major goal.    I repeat once more: everyone, not just the government alone,  but also professional and labor organizations, investors, young  people searching for work who must develop their abilities, and  people of vision and ideas concerned with political and party  action.    Everyone is a partner in this responsibility; the issue is  everyone's issue, and not the issue of the government alone or  of any specific quarter.</p>

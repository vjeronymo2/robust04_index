			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Biao (7456 7374) of the Guangxi Provincial Commission </F> on Economic Restructuring: "Deng Xiaoping's Idea on Building  Special Economic Zones and His Strategy on Opening Border Areas  to the Outside World"]    I. The Great Significance of Practicing the  Strategy of Opening Border Areas to the Outside World    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of building special economic  zones [SEZs] constitutes an important part of his own theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the  guidance of his idea, China's SEZs, acting as the country's  "windows" to the outside world, have played a "vanguard" role in  reform and opening up, thus giving a tremendous impetus to the  process of reform and opening up throughout the entire country.  Through the practice of reform between the 1980's and the early  90's, a multilevel, multiform, and omnidirectional new setup of  opening up has taken shape, featuring the pattern of  SEZs--coastal open cities--coastal open economic zones--inland  and border areas. This new setup is the outcome, and also a  concrete embodiment, of Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs in  practice. Moreover, it is of great significance to our efforts  to bring a sustained, rapid, and healthy development to China's  national economy and to fulfill China's second-step strategy on  building socialist modernization.    Along China's 22,000 km border, most regions are inhabited  by  ethnic minority nationalities. Practicing the strategy of  opening border areas to the outside world is the continuance and  an inevitable outcome of applying in practice Deng Xiaoping's  idea on building SEZs; it is also an objective requirement for  us to help ethnic minority regions extricate themselves from  poverty, narrow the gap between the economically advanced and  less advanced regions, and bring joint development and common  prosperity to all nationalities in our country. Practicing the  strategy of opening up border areas and further expanding border  trade with neighboring countries is a major change in the  economic development pattern of China's border areas. It also  serves as an important way by which China's ethnic minority  regions can expand their economic and technological exchanges  and cooperation with other parts of the country and the world,  allocate major means of production in a more rational way,  improve their economic performance, enhance their ability to  compete in international and regional commodity exchanges, and  bring an overall development to their economy. China's  accomplishments in both the opening of coastal areas and the  opening of border areas, which are complementary to each other,  have added a new chapter to the annals of reform and opening up  and further enriched Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs.    Deng Xiaoping pointed out as early as 1984: "Special zones  serve as windows for the introduction of technology, management,  and knowledge; and also as windows for applying our  foreign-related policies. From special zones, we can introduce  technology and knowledge from abroad and learn and master  management skills. Management is also knowledge." (Footnote 1)  (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Vol 3, pp 51-52)  This celebrated thesis has already been proved correct in the  pioneering development of SEZs and coastal open areas and can  thus serve as important guidance for the opening up of border  areas. The move to turn open border areas into windows for the  introduction of foreign technology will surely give a tremendous  impetus to the development of inland and border areas in their  efforts to establish lateral ties with other domestic areas and  expand their contacts with foreign countries. The introduction  of advanced technologies from foreign countries is beneficial to  transforming existing traditional industries and products,  developing new technologies and products, improving the  technical level and the quality of products in enterprises, and  to building up advantageous and export-oriented industries which  enjoy a better ability to cooperate with other industries, cope  with contingencies, and to survive in competition. Moreover,  through the introduction of foreign advanced technologies, we  can upgrade the exploration for natural resources and  comprehensively turn the potential advantages of border ethnic  regions in natural resources into practical economic advantages;  push forward the technical progress of border areas; and  subsequently accelerate the rate of border areas in establishing  lateral economic and technological ties with other parts of the  country, thus giving form to a new-type regional economic  relationship under which border areas, inland areas, and coastal  areas supplement and help each other on a mutually beneficial  basis with a view to bringing about joint development and common  prosperity. Meanwhile, the move to turn open border areas into  windows for the introduction of management skills can surely  accelerate and deepen the economic structural reform of inland  and border areas. In the light of their realistic conditions  and in accordance with the requirement to establish a socialist  market economic structure, border areas can learn from and use  for reference the successful experience of advanced countries in  managing the socialized general production and in developing the  market economy with a view to transforming their economic  structure. The move to turn open border areas into windows for  introducing knowledge will undoubtedly promote the building of  the two civilizations in inland and border areas on a  comprehensive scale.    Through these windows, border areas  can obtain timely information on the latest developments in  technology, market, capital, and human resources in both  neighboring countries and the whole world; acquaint themselves  with the usual economic practices in foreign countries; learn  and master knowledge about international trade and banking;  nurture a large number of talents in all fields who are familiar  with international economic activities; and bring the markets in  border areas well in line with both the markets in neighboring  countries and the international market. The move to turn open  border areas into windows for applying foreign-related policies  will certainly enable inland and border areas to exert a greater  influence on their neighboring countries and regions.  Practicing the policy of opening border areas to the outside  world is beneficial to: Bringing into better play the  advantages of border areas in regional development and natural  resources, thus enabling border areas to have a greater appeal  to neighboring countries and regions; carrying forward the  historical tradition of China's border areas to keep contact and  do business with different nationalities in neighboring  countries and regions, thus augmenting their friendship with the  peoples of neighboring countries and promoting the economic and  technological exchanges and cooperation among them; and  beneficial to making China's border areas more complementary to  neighboring countries in terms of industrial structure, product  mix, and natural resources, thus rejuvenating the border  economy. As a result, border areas will eventually serve as  windows to the outside world showing that China has become  economically stronger and richer and is enjoying a sound social  order and a general unity among all nationalities. In this way,  China's influence and status in the international community can  be enhanced immensely.    In short, the strategy of opening border areas to the  outside  world is a continuance of Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs  in the practice of reform and opening up. So long as they  further use for reference and assimilate the successful  experiences gained by SEZs and coastal open areas, emancipate  their minds, make bolder explorations, and open up new paths,  China's inland and border areas can surely extricate themselves  from the current economic, technological, and cultural  backwardness; "gain dominance as newcomers"; and advance both  the economic development and the living standards of their  people to a new level.  <H5>  II. Current Basic Development Trends in China's Open Border </H5> Areas    The current domestic and international political and  economic  situations are truly favorable to our efforts to accelerate the  implementation of the strategy on opening border areas to the  outside world. Faced with such a rare opportunity to bring a  comprehensive development to China's inland and border areas, we  must enhance the sense of urgency in opening up border areas,  seize this favorable opportunity, and speed up the pace of  opening border areas to the outside world.    To successfully implement the strategy of opening up border  areas and keep abreast of the basic development trends in border  areas, we must acquire a correct understanding of the regional  features, development phases, and trading characteristics of  China's inland and border areas. There are altogether 143  border counties (cities) in China's inland and border areas,  which border on 15 neighboring countries. Alongside the  in-depth development of China's reform and opening up over  recent years, the State Council approved in 1984 the  "Provisional Management Regulations on Small-Volume Border Trade  Transactions," which was issued by the Chinese Ministry of  Foreign Relations and Trade, and decided, in 1992, to list four  more border cities as open cities, namely, Heihe and Suifenghe  in Heilongjiang Province, Yunchun in Jilin Province, and  Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia. After that, a number of border  cities and counties were opened to the outside world in turn,  including Pingxiang City and Dongxing Town in Guangxi Province;  Hekou County, Wanding City, and Ruili County in Yunnan Province;  Yining City, Tacheng City, and Bole City in Xinjiang; and  Erenhot City in Inner Mongolia. In addition, preferential  policies originally designed for coastal open cities were  applied to a number of provincial (regional) capital cities,  such as Nanning, Kunming, Urumqi, Huhhot, Changchun, and Harbin.  This is a major step which China has taken to accelerate the  pace of reform and opening up and marks the beginning of a new  development phase for China's drive to open up border areas.    At present, China has expanded its border trade with  neighboring countries in terms of business patterns, levels, and  scope and the economic cooperation between China and foreign  countries is being carried out on a more extensive scale.  China's current border trade with neighboring countries has the  following special features: The volume of border trade has  increased by a large margin, of which China enjoys a favorable  balance of trade while foreign trading parties have adverse  balances. While the border trade still relies mainly on local  trade, small-volume transactions, and commodity exchanges among  border residents, border areas have set out to develop a  comprehensive exchange and cooperation in the economic,  technological, and trading fields.    While the barter system  still remains a dominant trading form in border trade, a  financial market relying mainly on renminbi transactions has  taken shape, both the labor and tourist markets have  expereienced fairly large growth, and the border trade is being  carried out in diversified forms. In the past, the border trade  mainly took the organizational structure of a nongovernmental  trade; today, a simultaneous development has been registered in  both the nongovernmental and official trade, the number of our  trading partners is increasing on a constant basis, and the  border trade is developing into a diversified transregional and  transownership trading system. To promote their economic and  trade relations with neighboring countries, all border provinces  and regions have formulated a series of policies, rules, and  regulations; as a result, the once chaotic border trade is  moving toward a state of orderliness under the new environment  of competition. Our neighboring countries, for their part, have  also adopted a positive attitude in developing their border  trade with us. They have worked out a series of policies, rules  and regulations, and measures; and adopted more preferential  policies, striving for a faster growth in their economies. A  number of advanced countries in the West, including Japan,  France, and the United States, as well as countries like  Thailand and the regions of Hong Kong and Macao have also  stepped up their efforts to play a bigger role in China's border  trade with neighboring countries. Meanwhile, advanced areas  inside the country, such as the coastal areas of Guangdong as  well as the municipalities of Shanghai and Beijing, have made  thermselves more involved in border trade. All border areas  have taken positive measures to preserve their specific regional  advantages in competition.  <H5>  III. A Tentative Plan on Implementing the Strategy of </H5> Opening Border Areas to the Outside World    The whole country, central and local authorities alike, has  reached a consensus on the implementation of the strategy of  opening up border areas. All provinces and autonomous regions  along the border have also worked out their own policies and  regulations guiding the development of the border trade.  However, judging by the overall situation, an overall plan on  how the strategy can be implemented remains to be formulated.  Therefore, it has become a pressing matter of the moment to  adapt ourselves to the objective needs of the new situation  resulting from the opening of border areas and establish China's  strategy of opening border areas to the outside world. The  strategy of opening up border areas should embrace a guiding  ideology, a strategic principle, major tasks, a strategic  set-up, and key policies and measures.    The guiding ideology for the opening of border areas is as  follows: In the light of the realistic conditions of China's  inland and border areas, and in accordance with the requirements  set out in the country's macroeconomic policies, we must make  use of the current relaxed international political situation;  vigorously bring into better play the geographical, resources,  and economic complementary advantages of border areas; carry out  the strategy of opening up border areas which aims at  rejuvenating them and making their people rich; actively help  border areas step up their economic, trade, and technological  cooperation with neighboring countries; use opening up to  promote reform and economic development; enhance the overall  economic strength of border areas with a final aim of developing  the productive forces; bring about a comprehensive development  to the scientific and technological, cultural, and educational  undertakings in border areas; strengthen border security and  promote unity among all nationalities; and we must fulfill the  second-step strategic goal of our modernization drive and bring  about common progress and prosperity for all nationalities.    It is the strategic principle of the opening of border areas  to regard the border trade as a breakthrough point, use trade as  a guide, rely mainly on inland areas, focus our attention on  economic and technological cooperation as well as on the markets  of neighboring countries, and open up more international  markets. To fulfill the goal of rejuvenating border areas and  making their people rich, we will open border areas to the  outside world in a comprehensive way; introduce foreign  equipment, technology, and capital while establishing lateral  ties with domestic enterprises; and bring about a regional  association and integration between the eastern and western  parts of the country, with a view to bringing about a  comprehensive development.    The major tasks of the opening of border areas should  include  the following: We should readjust and optimize the industrial  structure and the product mix in border areas; set up more  production bases for exported commodities, and help border areas  develop their own highly competitive products for exports;  expand the commodity, technology, and equipment exports from  border areas; promote their exports of labor services; actively  introduce from abroad scarce resources, supplies, and raw and  semi-finished materials; improve the environment for investment;  accelerate the market building and perfect the market system;  and change the functions and roles of governments in border  areas.    The strategic set-up for the opening of border areas  requires us to further consolidate and perfect the opening belts  along the southwest, northwest, and northeast borders, thus  turning them into regional economic opening belts with their own  specific features. While further strengthening and improving  inland ports already approved by the central authorities, we  must build up a number of new inland ports in selected locations  in a planned way and enhance their fanning influence, giving  shape to a new opening set-up under which the experience of  selected units will be used to promote the work of the whole.    The key policies and measures guiding the opening of border  areas should embrace the following: First, more preferential  policies should be adopted. For example, we can set up  processing zones for the export trade from inland and border  areas, allow these zones to enjoy the preferential treatment  originally designed for SEZs, and grant them greater  decisionmaking powers as well as preferential policies in  operation. Second, we need to further readjust the industrial  structure and the product mix in border areas. Third, efforts  should be taken, through various channels, to promote  comprehensive exchanges and cooperation with neighboring  countries in the fields of economy, technology, trade, and labor  services. Fourth, advances need to be made to further change the  operational mechanisms of state-owned enterprises in border  areas and turn them into market-oriented enterprises. Moreover,  we need to make rational readjustments to the organizational  structure of medium and small enterprises, vigorously promote  the nonstate-owned economies, and accelerate the development of  township and town enterprises in border areas. Fifth, further  efforts should be made to perfect the market system in border  areas. Sixth, we must continue to reinforce and promote the  lateral economic cooperative relations between the eastern and  western parts of the country and further develop the economic  and technological cooperation in border areas with both inland  and coastal areas. Seventh, in line with the requirements to  establish a socialist market economic structure and to open  border areas to the outside world, we should actively explore  ways to reform the investment, financial, banking, planning,  circulation, and foreign trade structures in border areas.    Opening border areas to the outside world is the continuance  and development of Deng Xiaoping's ideas on building SEZs in the  practice of reform and opening up. Our current efforts to  expedite the opening up of border area will undoubtedly turn the  economy of China's inland and border areas into a new force in  China's economic development in the 1990's.</p>

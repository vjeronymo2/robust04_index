			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rita Grumadaite: "Number of Officials Assigned </F> to Land Reform to be Supplemented"]    [Text] Lithuania will remain a country using atomic energy,  at least until the year 2004-2007, when its exploitation will  end. This is foreseen in the Program for Restructuring the  National Energy Complex approved yesterday at a meeting of the  government leadership. Deputy energy minister S. Kutas, the head  of the program, indicated that measures would be implemented to  increase reactor operation safety during the period of time  foreseen for the operation of the Ignalina atomic energy  station. A decision on the continued use of nuclear energy is  expected to be made in approximately five years, when  international experience will have formulated a clear opinion  regarding the future of atomic programs and when very safe and  reliable nuclear installations will have been created.    Plans call for completion in 1994-1995 of formerly halted  construction on the third and fourth blocks and the upper  reservoir of the Kruonis power plant. As S. Kutas told LIETUVOS  RYTAS, the cost of this work is nearly $30 million. However,  this sum includes the amount already paid to purchase some of  the necessary equipment. There will also be incentives for  projects dedicated to the assimilation and use of water, wind,  and geothermal energy. In the coming two decades, specialists  are planning to decrease approximately by half the amount of  energy consumed to produce one unit of national production.    After the draft for a health insurance law was presented,  the  attendees of the meeting noted the absence of a financial  analysis for the draft. Prime Minister A. Slezevicius indicated  that "large amounts of money were involved and this threatened  an increase in taxes." The draft foresees two types of health  insurance--compulsory and voluntary--with supplemental health  care services compensation on the basis of a voluntary contract.    Because this version of the future law "takes into account  insurance traditions as well as the experience that the world  has gained in the past 100 years," as its authors noted, it  differs from the alternative drawn up by the Social Democrats.  L. Alesionka, a member of the Seimas Health, Social Affairs, and  Labor committee, also criticized that alternative version,  asserting that he supported the draft being presented at the  meeting "as a physician and a future patient", and proposed that  the working group give "a detailed explanation of the mechanism"  to the members of the leadership. The proposal was accepted and  the draft will be deliberated again in May.    167,600 litas from the government reserve account was  earmarked to increase the wage fund for the executive and  government institutions of cities and district local  governments, in order to be able to hire more workers at  agencies that are organizing land exploitation. According to  agriculture minister R. Karazija, one specialist is no longer  able to both prepare and record in time the legal documents  associated with land ownership and land use--"they are falling  behind because there are not enough workers." As long as the  right of ownership is not recorded and the lots are not marked  on the land cadaster map, the land market will not be able to  operate and there will be problems in resolving disputes.    Nationwide, 350,000 house possessions have to be  legitimized,  and about 50,000 farmers want to settle their land ownership  matters each year.    Transportation minister J. Birziskis responded: why should  the number of officials be increased, perhaps it would be  worthwhile to reassign them in a more efficient way? In  response, R. Karazija said that there is no precedent for the  case of returning all the land in Lithuania.    At the meeting, amendments were approved to laws allowing  citizens to receive monetary compensation for still existent  real estate that they had previously owned. However, Kaunas city  deputy mayor J. Vengraitis reiterated how urgent the problem of  recovering ownership of buildings is in the cities, especially  in Kaunas. Property owners there want to regain ownership of  about 1500 houses. If an incredibly large sum of money--10  million litas--were allocated each year to the local government  there, this process would take 18 years. He presented a radical  proposal by the Kaunas city council--to settle with the owner  for his property at the market price, but to discuss financial  issues related to the return of property after a corresponding  portion of state property had been privatized for cash.    Although finance minister E. Vilkelis--who was chairing the  meeting then in place of the prime minister, who had  departed--said that "the train had already left the station" and  that such a discussion should have taken place before the laws  being amended on this day were adopted, the proposal received  the support of industry and commerce minister K. Klimasauskas,  and subsequently also the support of others--"the train can  still be caught."    The minister believed that it would be worthwhile to try to  sell at least 10 percent of property for cash. The industry and  commerce ministry as well as the economics ministry were charged  with preparing drafts of such a proposal.    2 million litas in this year's state budget are earmarked  for  implementation of the Restitution Act. The constitution also  recognizes other traditional religious communities, so these  funds are also allotted to traditional non-Roman Catholic  confessions, taking into account their approximate number of  adherents and the requests of the heads of the religious  communities. A resolution was approved at the meeting, on the  basis of which the Supreme Orthodox Council of Lithuania, the  Protestant Lutheran Consistory, the College of Reformed  Protestants, the Greek Rite Catholic Community, the Karaite  Religious Community, the Orthodox Eparchy of Vilnius, the  Vilnius Sunni Muslim Community, and the Vilnius Jewish Religious  Community will also receive some of this money.</p>

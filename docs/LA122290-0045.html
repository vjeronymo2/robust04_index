			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> PLANNERS REBUFF BUILDER'S PARK OFFER  </P> <P> Ojai planners rebuffed the offer of a city park from a developer Wednesday  despite threats that his 31-acre meadow might be fenced to keep out  schoolchildren, equestrians and bird-watchers.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners spoke 5 to 1 against developer Howard M. Palmer's offer  to donate 11 acres of his meadow for a public park near Nordhoff High School.  </P> <P> Palmer said the park's benefits could offset environmental impacts of his  proposed 26-lot subdivision on the remaining 20 acres.  </P> <P> "A project of this size just doesn't fly in Ojai anymore," Commission Chairman  Lynn McConnell said.  </P> <P> Palmer paid a $50 hearing fee to test the commission's views before submitting  the plan. He asked the City Council for a similar review on Jan. 22.  </P> <P> About 30 residents attended the hearing to oppose the subdivision. Several  urged Palmer to donate the entire parcel to a nature conservancy.  </P> <P> Mark Finlinson of Salt Lake City, Palmer's loan consultant with the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corp., said he was puzzled by the opposition.  </P> <P> "Everyone is forgetting that somebody is making mortgage payments on that  land," he said. Palmer said he has been stalling foreclosure on the land for  two years.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized the assets of Palmer's lender,  Mountain West Savings and Loan, two years ago.  </P> <P> If the subdivision is not approved, Finlinson said the government will call in  Palmer's loan, put up a big, chain-link fence and no-trespassing signs and sell  the land to another developer.

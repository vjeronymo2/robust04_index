			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chen Huanyou, provincial party committee </F> secretary and governor of Jiangsu, recorded and sorted by  special correspondent Chou Yeh 0719 6851]; place and date not  given; first three paragraphs are CHUNG KUO SHIH PAO  introduction]    [Text] Today we publish a special issue on Jiangsu, the  eighth stop on our mainland reporting tour. Our ad hoc  reporting team, wishing to give an in-depth report on Jiangsu's  present situation, went across the entire province and carried  out a month-long investigation and news gathering, contributing  to the making of this special issue. This special issue is  divided into six main sections, giving reports on such special  topics as Taiwan-Jiangsu relations, local economies across  Jiangsu, village and town enterprises, society and culture, as  well as tourism and consumption.    In addition, Shen Ta-jen [Shen Daren] and Chen Huan-yu [Chen  Huanyou], respectively former and incumbent secretary of the  Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, gave separate exclusive  interviews to our editor-in-chief Huang Chao-sung [7806 5128  2646] and reporters Yu Yu-lin [0205 7183 7207], Pai Te-hua [4101  1795 5478], and Chou Yeh. During the interviews, both Shen  Ta-jen and Chen Huan-yu answered in detail questions raised by  our reporting team.    During his exclusive interview with our reporting team,  Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Secretary Chen Huan-yu  pointed out: Although we do not have too many exchanges with  Taiwan, Jiangsu will take a positive attitude toward exchanges  across the Taiwan Strait and will try its best to help realize  any plans favorable to cross-strait exchanges. Furthermore,  Jiangsu will start a tuition class for the Taiwan Joint College  Entrance Examination and pre-university courses for Taiwan  students. The contents of Chen Huan-yu's interview with CHUNG  KUO SHIH PAO [CKSP] are as follows:    [CKSP] Last year Jiangsu Province put up an economic  performance that was outstanding among various provinces on the  mainland. Mr. Secretary, would you please tell us the main  reasons behind the Jiangsu economy's relatively outstanding  performance?    [Chen] Outside people's affirmation of the noticeable  results in Jiangsu's economic development last year is an  encouragement for us. Encouragement from Taiwan in particular  gave us a deep impression. On behalf of compatriots in the  province, I express gratitude for this. We were able to score  such results last year because of good opportunities, favorable  geographical position, and, still more, the positive effect of  human factors.    We may call 1993 a year in which our provincial economy  enjoyed sustained development. While the total annual output of  goods and services for the province topped 255 billion renminbi  yuan, up 18.5 percent over the previous year and topping up the  second doubling in its value seven years ahead of schedule; the  per capita gross national product for the province rose to 3,675  yuan, or 1,000 yuan more than the national average.    [CKSP] You assumed the position of secretary at the end of  last September while holding the governorship at the same time.  As the new secretary, would you please tell us about your  latest overall vision of the direction for Jiangsu's economic  development and where the principal focuses of development lie?  <H5>  Implementation of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control is </H5> Favorable to Economic Transformation    [Chen] We have determined two main objectives of struggle  for Jiangsu's economic development: First, the objective of  reform is to establish in about five years a basic framework for  the socialist market economic system. Second, the objective of  development is to double the province's total annual output of  goods and services for the third time by the end of the century  following the realization of the second "doubling" ahead of time  in 1993, so as to lift the economy's overall quality and  composite strength to a new level and bring about a relatively  comfortable life for the people ahead of schedule.    As to the question of where the principal focuses of future  development lie, I would condense my answer into four phrases:  seize the opportunity, deepen the reform, open up wider to the  outside world, and accelerate development. So these will be our  focus of development.    As the state has introduced a few more major reform  measures this year, our present task is to properly conduct  propaganda, give explanations, and carry out organization,  coordination, dovetailing, and implementation of measures. We  should manage to carry out thorough preparation and meticulous  organization to ensure success. It is necessary to advance  opening up to the outside world at an even higher level to  vigorously develop an open economy. We will make full use of  the international market and foreign capital, technology, and  resources; expand import and export trading, attract foreign  capital from a high starting point and on a large scale,  converge and merge with the international economy in an even  faster and better way, and accelerate the process of building a  new system of socialist market economy. In addition, we will  strive for speed as far as possible based on the viewpoint that  "development is the last word." So long as we have quality,  good sales, efficiency, and basically satisfactory supplies of  essential production factors, we will embark on as many projects  as possible. Our general policy is: "The fast are not to be  halted by force and the slow are not to be rushed by force  either."    [CKSP] As you are the first person in Jiangsu to hold dual  positions [provincial party secretary and governor], we would  like to know whether you have trouble trying to cope with the  workload of managing both party and government affairs?    [Chen] I am now concurrently holding two positions on a  temporary basis under special circumstances, and this will not  last long. I have two ways to suit myself to the dual  positions: one is to rely on collectives -- our leading  collectives; the other is to rely on the masses. An individual  has very little strength and is unable to get things done all by  himself. I rely on the collectives. I give the ideas, they  carry them out, and the masses implement them. So things are  easily accomplished in this way.    [CKSP] I am sorry to chip in. You said you are holding dual  positions on a temporary basis, but Hainan's Juan Chung-wu [Ruan  Chongwu] has held dual positions for a long time while several  other provinces, such as Fujian, followed suit recently. Can  all these be viewed as temporary?    [Chen] I am not too sure about explanations given by other  provinces, but as far as I know, that was meant to be a  temporary measure in Fujian also. As for us, it really is a  temporary measure. Juan Chung-wu's holding dual positions is a  procedural matter, on which the central authorities have taken a  clear stand. Being a small province with a population of only a  few million and with economic development at the initial stage,  Hainan is suitable for a little experimentation. As we,  Jiangsu, are a big province with a population of 70 million and  economic development ranking among the top in the country, I  would be able to cope with the heavy workload alone only  temporarily but not in the long run. The central authorities  have also made this clear.    While some people say it is easier to get things done with  concentrated authority, this has to be viewed in two respects:  advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is swift handling of  matters, while the disadvantage is a lack of restriction which  raises the possibility of making mistakes. Things will go wrong  in the long run when a person has to make policy decisions as  well as carry them out all by himself; this just does not work.  Therefore, my holding dual positions at the moment is only a  temporary measure and not a matter of regular practice. From  the standpoint of regular practice, it is better to separate the  two positions. We had all the while separated party and  government affairs, with major strategies being decided by the  party committee and daily work and specific matters organized  and implemented by the government. Outside people misread it as  our current move toward combining party and government affairs;  this is a misunderstanding.    [CKSP] We all know the Central Committee of the Chinese  Communists are now implementing measures for macroeconomic  regulation and control and tightening finances. Is Jiangsu  fully prepared for this policy and have you taken any  corresponding measures such as reducing the scale of investment  and tightening credits? Furthermore, what impact does this  policy have on the economic development strategies formulated by  Jiangsu?    [Chen] The CPC Central Committee's measures drawn up last  year to strengthen and improve microeconomic regulation and  control played a very important role in overall economic  development and social stability. However, we have to admit  that these measures somewhat affected the pace of Jiangsu's  economic development in the short run. Nevertheless, there are  pros and cons to everything. With a smaller budget, we made  careful plans, concentrated funds, and spent money on more  important projects such as the renovation of the Nanjing Airport  and the Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway. Those small-sized  infrastructure projects had to be suspended temporarily. If we  took a passive attitude toward microeconomic regulation and  control, we would have only noticed problems like the tight  money supply, fund shortages, and a strained microeconomic  environment. But in the long run, microeconomic regulation and  control is helpful for quickening economic development and  carrying out our economic development strategy.    For example, village and town enterprises developed very  fast  in the past few years. The pace of development among them was  uneven. Some of them wanted to continue expanding their scale of  production without taking their poor quality of development into  consideration. Now they have slowed down somewhat and found out  about their mistakes. This enabled some small-sized plants to  merge into large- sized factories. With more funds, these  factories are, instead of manufacturing poor-quality products,  producing high-quality products that generate greater economic  efficiency. This might not be a bad thing. That is why I  stressed that we have to understand microeconomic regulation and  control with a positive approach.    When the CPC Central Committee just began to carry out  microeconomic regulation and control measures last year, we  encountered the problem of fund shortages. The provincial party  committee urged the entire province to economize as much as  possible to save money not allocated for normal expenditures.  The goal was to save 10 billion yuan by year's end. In only  two months, we accomplished our mission of saving 10 billion  yuan and resolved the fund shortage problem. We can see from  this example that as long as the people support us, we will  easily get things done.  <H5>  Village and Town Enterprises in South Jiangsu Are Required </H5> To Improve Their Quality    [CKSP] Village and town enterprises in Jiangsu developed  vigorously in recent years. Nevertheless, there are limits to  the development of village and town enterprises, most of which  are small- and medium-sized. Will Jiangsu consider expanding  village and town enterprises in terms of their sizes? Moreover,  does Jiangsu have a new development strategy for current and  future village and town enterprises?    [Chen] The flourishing of village and town enterprises is a  special feature in Jiangsu's economic development, and such  enterprises are the pillars of Jiangsu's economy. Especially  since the 1980's, village and town enterprises in south Jiangsu  have entered a new stage of development. We can sum up the  following special features shared by the village and town  enterprises in south Jiangsu: Enterprises' scales of operation  became larger, domestically-made equipment was replaced by  foreign-made supplies, product quality was improved, more  investment channels were opened, more markets for products were  found, and a better investment environment was created. These  features indicated the development of village and town  enterprises in south Jiangsu has entered the stage of quality  improvement. Those traditional enterprises began to change  themselves into modern industrial enterprises.    At present, Jiangsu's village and town enterprises are  indeed  faced with such problems as fund shortages, insufficient  markets, widening disparities between different regions, poor  economic efficiency, and lack of specially-trained personnel.  These problems are actually problems emerging naturally in the  development of village and town enterprises. With clear goals,  correct guidance, and solid work, we believe we will help  village and town enterprises seize opportunities, overcome  difficulties, and develop in a healthy manner.  <H5>  Jiangsu Strives To Shorten Disparity Between the South and </H5> the North    [CKSP] As the provincial economies developed in the  mainland, many provinces saw uneven development among various  regions. Jiangsu seemed to have the same sort of problem -- the  uneven development between the south and the north. Would you  please tell us if you have any measures to shorten the disparity  between the two regions?    [Chen] The problem of uneven economic development between  south and north Jiangsu does exist. Being restricted by certain  conditions, economic development in south Jiangsu is faster than  that of the north. We always attach importance to this problem.  We hold that the disparity was hard to avoid. However, we  cannot afford a great disparity in peoples' living standards.  Things will eventually go wrong if the disparity among peoples'  living standards becomes wider and wider. The second session of  the eighth provincial people's congress which recently ended put  forward the important task of bringing various regions' strong  points into full play to promote the economic development of the  entire province. To resolve the problem, the provincial  government drew up the following four [figure as published]  measures:    1. We are making efforts to assist northern Jiangsu in the  construction of infrastructure projects, such as installing  telephones and building electric power plants and roads. We  first borrowed $170,000 [figure as published] from Sweden to  solve the problem of inadequate telephone service in northern  Jiangsu. Now the problem of telephone service at the county  level and above in northern Jiangsu has been totally solved.  Then we helped northern Jiangsu build electric power plants.  Xuzhou had power plants with a total capacity of more than 1  million kw, and now we have built plants with an additional  capacity of several hundred thousand kw. We also built electric  power plants in Huaiyin, Yancheng, and Lianyungang. Although  there are still some locales which have not solved the problem  of electricity, we are determined to solve the problem within  three years. The next is road construction. Now we are  building highways between Nanjing and Lianyungang, between  Nanjing and Nantong, between Nantong and Yancheng, and between  Nantong and Lianyungang. Besides, we are also building some  railways.    2. We are speeding up the structural adjustment of  agriculture, making efforts to stabilize the production of grain  and cotton, and vigorously developing diversified farming  operations in order to improve the rural economy. Although  Jiangsu has made quite rapid progress in industrial development,  we have not overlooked agriculture. The total grain output of  this province is still between 62 to 66 billion jin per annum.  Jiangsu is different from Guangdong and Fujian. The latter  provinces plant less grain and attach importance to growing  bananas, chestnuts, and other cash crops. We cannot do the same  thing because we have so many people and we must have enough  rice.    3. We have made efforts to establish links between northern  and southern Jiangsu. We have dispatched cadres from southern  Jiangsu to work as deputy mayors or deputy county heads in  northern Jiangsu and let them bring the concepts and experiences  of southern Jiangsu to northern Jiangsu. Meanwhile, we have  also transferred some cadres from northern Jiangsu to southern  Jiangsu to let them learn the motive force of southern Jiangsu.  In addition, we have encouraged enterprises, sci-tech research  units, and individuals to visit and exchange experiences in  various fields with units and people at various levels in  northern Jiangsu. This is the exchange of personnel. We have  also promoted the establishment of links between units in  northern and southern Jiangsu. For example, textile mills in  southern Jiangsu have established direct links with  cotton-producing areas in northern Jiangsu to eliminate  intermediary agencies and increase the income of the rural areas.    [CKSP] Businessmen from Taiwan have made many investments in  Jiangsu. What are the main areas in which they invest?  Roughly speaking, what is the total amount of their  investments? What will be the most desirable areas of  investment by Taiwanese businessmen in the future? What  preferential treatments do you have?    [Chen] In recent years, economic and trade contacts between  Jiangsu and Taiwan have developed very fast. Taiwanese  businessmen have made many kinds of investments in this  province, including light industry, chemicals, textiles,  electronics, building materials, food products, agriculture, and  tertiary industries. Judging from the figures of growth of  Taiwanese businessmen's investments on the mainland, Jiangsu  ranks first among all provinces. We have a favorable  geographical position, a relatively good industrial foundation,  and a favorable investment environment. Besides, the educational  level in this province is also quite high. Therefore, we hope  more financial groups and major corporations in Taiwan will make  investments and set up plants in Jiangsu, and we hope they will  bring in more new and high technologies, items of greater  scientific and technological value, and more world renowned  brands.    Moreover, we highly welcome Taiwanese businessmen to make  investments in transportation, energy sources, communications,  and the production of raw materials. We are not afraid of  letting Taiwanese businessmen occupy a larger share of those  projects. On the contrary, we welcome Taiwanese businessmen to  increase their proportion of investments. In this connection,  we have formulated a series of policies to encourage investments  by businessmen from Taiwan and foreign countries. On a mutually  beneficial basis, we will protect the lawful rights of investors.    Welcome Investments by Taiwanese Businessmen, Expect  Exchanges With Taiwan    [CKSP] There are many people in Taiwan whose native region  is Jiangsu. What is the general situation regarding their  relatives in Jiangsu? As far as we know, exchanges of various  types between Jiangsu and Taiwan are not very frequent. I would  like to ask: do you have any plan for strengthening exchanges  between Jiangsu and Taiwan, and if so, how are you going to do  this?    [Chen] Exchange activities between Jiangsu and Taiwan are  indeed not very frequent. However, generally speaking, some  progress has been made in developing exchanges between the two  areas. In 1993, Jiangsu and Taiwan conducted 70 exchange  activities, involving 657 people. Of these, Taiwan organized 41  delegations to visit Jiangsu, involving a total of 606 people,  while this province organized 29 visits involving a total of 51  people. Jiangsu held exhibitions and demonstrations of Yixing's  pottery and Suzhou's embroidery in Taiwan. In the future, we  will continue to maintain a positive attitude toward promoting  exchanges between the two sides of the Strait. We will do our  best to promote all beneficial exchanges between the two sides.    This year we will hold a continuation class for students  from  Taiwan to take part in the joint college entrance examination  and a preparatory class for regular courses. The Nanjing  Teachers' University will also accept students from Taiwan  beginning the next semester.    At the invitation of the Kaohsiung Antiques Research  Society,  four experts of the Nanjing Museum will visit Taiwan. The  Yangzhou Puppet Troupe, the Xuzhou Liuqin Theatrical Troupe, and  the Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Troupe will all visit Taiwan at an  appropriate time.    As for the relatives of Taiwan compatriots in this province,  there are more than 520,000 people, according to a statistical  report. They are working at various posts.    [CKSP] Finally, I would like to ask the secretary this  question. Since relations between Jiangsu and Taiwan have  become increasingly close in recent years, we wonder about your  understanding of Taiwan. Through what channels do you know  about the situation in Taiwan?    [Chen] In recent years, in the wake of increasing contacts  of people between the two sides of the Strait, a large number of  Taiwan compatriots have come to Jiangsu to visit their  relatives, to engage in sight-seeing, to conduct investigations  and make investments, and to carry out other activities.  Therefore, we have paid good attention to the situation in  Taiwan. I have met with many Taiwan compatriots who came to  Jiangsu to conduct investigations and make investments or to  carry our other activities, including your colleagues in  journalist circles. They have given me much information about  the situation in Taiwan. Nowadays, the mass media have  developed rapidly and there are frequent reports on Taiwan. It  should not be difficult to understand the situation in Taiwan.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Employment - faulty predictions and outdated welfare system (1) Sir, The decline in male employment since 1970 has been nothing like as great as portrayed by your editorial, 'The wages of inequality' (July 5), which used data on employees only - thereby ignoring the rapid growth in self-employment as well as in those on training schemes. Comparing 1970 and March 1994, the male workforce in employment declined from 15.9m to 13.7m, while for women there was an increase from 8.8m to 11.6m. Comparing 1970 with 1990 - years more similar in relation to the business cycle - the decline in male employment from 15.9m to 15.2m was quite slight. The prediction by Patricia Hewitt, of the Institute of Public Policy Research, that 'by the end of this year women will already be half the British workforce' is clearly faulty - and is likely to remain so unless women completely forswear childcare in the home and men withdraw from economic activity. Even less persuasive is her advocacy of work-sharing as a solution to unemployment - rather than putting the unemployed to work to satisfy unmet needs for goods and services. Thus, the faster is productivity growth, the greater is the scope for meeting unmet needs through utilising the UK labour force more fully. Work-sharing, except on a voluntary basis, is a counsel of despair and not a politically attractive policy option.

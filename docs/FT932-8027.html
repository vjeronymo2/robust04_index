			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Woolworths aims for ADollars 2.45bn WOOLWORTHS, the Austra-lian retailing group, will go public next month in the country's biggest corporate flotation, seeking up to ADollars 2.45bn (USDollars 1.69bn)without an underwriter. The chairman of Woolworths, Mr Paul Simons, launched the long-awaited flotation yesterday, with forecasts of continued strong earnings and sales growth, against the national retailing trend. Mr Simons ended months of speculation, revealing that the flotation would offer 1bn shares at a price between ADollars 2.15 and ADollars 2.45, to be determined by an institutional tendering process. The flotation will be in four parts, with the biggest proportion of nearly 49 per cent offered on a non-renounceable basis to shareholders in Woolworths' parent companies, Adelaide Steamship, David Jones, and Tooth and Co. These companies were all formerly part of the corporate empire run by Mr John Spalvins. A further 30 per cent of the shares will be offered to institutional investors, 1 per cent will be reserved for staff, and the rest will go to individuals. Shares not taken up in either the entitlement or employee offers will be available to institutions or the public. Mr Simons said the public offer would begin on June 9 and remain open for one month. Trading in Woolworths shares is expected to begin on July 12 on a deferred delivery basis, representing the first time the Australian Stock Exchange has allowed trading to begin before scrip delivery. Despite strong publicity surrounding the flotation, some observers were surprised at the lack of both an underwriter and rights trading, especially as the vendors were forced to delay the flotation in 1992 after share markets weakened. The prospectus states that if applications, bids and indications of interest are not received for all of the shares offered, 'the vendor has resolved that the sale of shares will not proceed'. Mr Simons said yesterday that the board predicted a 14 per cent advance in Woolworths' earnings before interest and tax to ADollars 278.9m for the current year and a further 11 per cent rise to ADollars 310.2m for next year. After-tax earnings were forecast at ADollars 166.3m in the current year, rising to ADollars 188.5m next year, representing a prospective price-earnings multiple of just over 13 at the highest possible flotation price of ADollars 2.45 a share. The prospectus forecasts a final dividend of 6 cents a share this year and an annual dividend of 12 cents a share next year, representing a yield of just under 5 per cent at the maximum flotation price. A forecast pro-forma balance sheet estimates core debt of the floated entity at ADollars 258m, rising to ADollars 333m by mid-1994. Bank credit facilities totalling ADollars 420m have been arranged.</p>

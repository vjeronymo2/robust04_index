			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES U.S. ENVOY CAN TESTIFY  </P> <P> A federal judge ruled Monday that the U. S. ambassador to Mexico may testify as  a witness in a complex drug case, and defense attorneys said they plan to call  him to the stand Thursday.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge William B. Enright, who last month quashed a subpoena for  the appearance of Ambassador Charles J. Pilliod, reversed his ruling Monday  after reviewing State Department documents submitted by the defense.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys have asserted that Pilliod will cast doubt on prosecution  claims that three of the seven men on trial were high-ranking Mexican  government or military officials when they were arrested in an undercover sting  operation last year.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors have fought to keep Pilliod off the witness stand, arguing  that he has no first-hand knowledge of the investigation and little to offer as  evidence.  </P> <P> However, Cynthia G. Aaron, an attorney for Jorge Carranza, who prosecutors say  is a retired Mexican army colonel, argued Monday that a two-page Teletype  message sent by Pilliod in January, 1988, to then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III  indicates that all three Mexicans were less important than federal prosecutors  claim. The message details Pilliod's discussions with Mexican government  officials about the backgrounds of the defendants.  </P> <P> The Teletype informed State Department officials that Carranza was discharged  from the Mexican army as a major, not a colonel; that another defendant, Pablo  Giron Ortiz, was not a high-ranking member of the Mexican Federal Judicial  Police; and that a third defendant, Hector Manual Brumel Alvarez, had not  served as a Mexican government official with ties to the country's ruling  Institutional Revolutionary Party.  </P> <P> Stephen Nelson, the assistant U. S. attorney prosecuting the case, said Monday  that Pilliod's statements last year were made shortly after the arrests and  that his information was "third-hand" at best. "Before he's even briefed on the  case he makes these gratuitous comments," Nelson said. "It was pretty rank  hearsay. He would not have been informed or briefed on it. . . . He was kept  out of the loop."  </P> <P> Four Bolivian citizens also are charged in the case, which resulted from an  undercover investigation by U. S. agents attempting to expose corruption among  top Mexican officials. The investigation ended a year ago in the parking lot of  a La Jolla supermarket, where Carranza was arrested while wearing the uniform  of a Mexican army colonel.  </P> <P> Aaron said Monday that it is her understanding that Pilliod "voluntarily" did a  background check on the Mexicans by contacting Mexican authorities after  reading press accounts that Carranza had been arrested wearing a Mexican  military uniform.  </P> <P> "He did this checking on his own because he became suspicious that Carranza was  in uniform," she said. "That seemed bizarre to him. So he called and learned  that Carranza was not on the military list."  </P> <P> Aaron said she intends to question Pilliod "about his relationships with  various branches of the Mexican government . . . and how he first learned about  the indictment in this case."  </P> <P> Pilliod's testimony also should demonstrate how easy it would have been for U.  S. agents to determine that the defendants were not the powerful Mexican  officials the agents had hoped to bring down, she said.  </P> <P> "It shows the shoddiness of their investigation," she said. "The agents wanted  to believe it so bad they weren't willing to verify anything. And they still  want to believe it."  </P> <P> Nelson on Monday denied that the investigation was shoddy and said that, if  Pilliod testifies, the prosecution will be forced to present rebuttal witnesses  who will show the "absolute stonewalling of the Mexican government" on the  case. "To this day, we have not received one bit of official information from  the Mexican government," Nelson said.  </P> <P> Aaron said she at first hoped to have Pilliod, who is in Mexico City, in the  courtroom today, but, after discussing the situation with State Department  officials, she now hopes to have Pilliod on the witness stand on Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Years of Destruction"] </F>   [Text] The Communist Party of the Russian Federation  Central Committee Presidium and the Communist faction in the  State Duma has issued a statement on the policy of the  destruction of the foundations of Russia's economic life which  has been pursued over the past three years. The statement says,  among other things:    For the past three years the greatest tragedy has been  unfolding before the eyes of millions of people in our country.  With the adoption of the Declaration on the Sovereignty of  Russia and the election of B. Yeltsin as president, a disastrous  course of so-called "reforms" designed to take society back to a  wild and barbaric capitalism has been inflicted on the peoples  of a great country.    While promising to extricate Russia rapidly from the  economic  crisis, the president and his government have plunged it into an  even deeper, all-embracing crisis. The decline in production in  the country has passed the 50-percent mark and its most  important sectors are on the verge of self-destruction. The  retooling of enterprises has virtually come to a standstill.  Agriculture, precision machine building, and the textile and  light industries are near to total collapse. Basic science and  other forms of scientific research are being wound down. The  president's attempts to create by his edicts the semblance of a  campaign against the economy's rapid collapse are merely  aggravating it. In the past three years there has been a sharp  stratification of society and the guarantees of citizens' rights  to work, free education and medical help, security in old age,  and a youth full of confidence in the future have been destroyed.    Inflation and the uncontrolled rise in prices, unemployment  and intellectual bankruptcy, and bloody interethnic conflicts  and crime exceeding all bounds have become the daily  accompaniments to millions of people's lives. The process of  the nation's degeneration has begun.    In these conditions, the statement goes on to say, any state  leader with even a modicum of self-respect would be obliged to  quit the political stage and recognize the failure of his course  and the unprofessionalism and erroneousness of his decisions.  However, we do not see even the slightest desire to change a  course which has brought grief and suffering to many millions of  people.    Bearing this is mind, the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation and its faction in the State Duma urge all  truly patriotic and democratic forces to unite in the legitimate  struggle for a radical change of Russian state policy, the  departure of the ruling regime from the political arena, the  abolition of the institution of the presidency, and the creation  of a government that enjoys the people's trust.    Moscow, 10 June 1994.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Observer: Sweetness and light Some sweet news for Paddy Ashdown, the UK's Liberal Democrat party leader. Sugar producer Tate &amp; Lyle, a consistent financial supporter of the Tory party, has decided this year it will give a donation to Ashdown's lot, as well as spooning out its usual Pounds 25,000 to the Tories. The company is not commenting on the move but it is thought to be the idea of Neil Shaw, Tate &amp; Lyle's iconoclastic chairman, in recent months a less than vigorous advocate of Prime Minister John Major's leadership qualities. It is particularly unusual for Ashdown's party to get cash from companies outside a general election year. Not that the Lib Dems will be able to go on a spree; Tate &amp; Lyle is donating less than Pounds 5,000. Enough to sugar a few pills, nonetheless.</p>

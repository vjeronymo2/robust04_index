			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CERRITOS;  </P> <P> CHURCH HOPES TO COMBINE 2 LOTS AND EXPAND BUILDING  </P> <P> A decision is expected tonight from the City Council on whether the Sa-Rang  Korean Church of Norwalk will be allowed to build a new facility on Pioneer  Boulevard between South and 195th streets.  </P> <P> The church wants to combine two adjacent parcels of land into one parcel that  would be 1.75 acres. Both parcels have buildings on them, but one would be torn  down to make way for a parking lot. The other building would be made into a  church with offices, a children's nursery and a recreation room.  </P> <P> The parcels are zoned for industrial or commercial uses but the Planning  Commission is recommending that the church be allowed to locate there.  </P></p>

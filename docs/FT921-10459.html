			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: Eurotunnel affirms view of its finance needs Sir, May I adjust three impressions conveyed by Lex in its item headlined, 'The Eurotunnel paperchase' (February 5). First, Eurotunnel did not confirm that there is a plan to issue shares to the TML contractors. Eurotunnel issued a press release on Tuesday afternoon, saying: 'The stories in the press are purely speculative.' Second, Lex says it is 'most unlikely' that Eurotunnel's financial resources will be adequate to bring the Channel tunnel to opening next year. In fact, Eurotunnel's directors have informed shareholders that, provided project progress continues to be acceptable to our bankers, the Pounds 8.9bn available to us will be substantially more than project costs and interest payable by opening. Third, Lex asks if our contractors will 'surrender their right' to money settlement of their claims. Eurotunnel has a contract with TML: only claims justified under that contract have the right to be paid. TML has not justified anywhere near the level of claims put about in the press. Alastair Morton, chief executive, Eurotunnel, 111 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 0ST</p>

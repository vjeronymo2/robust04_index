			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Administrators abandon plan to float PPI Del Monte in US THE ADMINISTRATORS of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics group which collapsed in October 1990, confirmed yesterday that they have given up plans to float PPI Del Monte on the US stock exchange. Instead the fresh fruit operation, purchased by Polly Peck in September 1989 for Dollars 875m (Pounds 557m), will be sold Several fruit distribution companies confirmed yesterday that they may bid. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank is advising the Polly Peck administrators on the sale. The decision to sell PPI Del Monte ends almost two years of plans to float the company on the US stock exchange and represents a serious blow to hopes that Polly Peck creditors will be offered even the 20 per cent of their money back which was being discussed a year ago. PPI Del Monte was considered the only asset of the group capable of raising a substantial amount of money. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte which handles the corporate finance side of the administration yesterday said that the decision to go for a private sale rather than a float reflected disappointing conditions in the international banana market early this year. Del Monte Foods International, which is itself preparing for a flotation, is not connected with PPI Del Monte.</p>

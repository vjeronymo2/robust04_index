			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Finsbury Trust assets decline Net asset value per share of the Finsbury Trust slipped from 119p to 101.55p over the 12 months to September 30. After-tax revenue for the six months to end-September improved to Pounds 485,000 (Pounds 430,000), equal to earnings of 1.99p (1.76p) per share. The interim dividend is held at 1.2p. The trust said, however, that should earnings remain strong in the coming months it would 'have the opportunity at year-end to declare an improved final' - 1.8p was paid previously.</p>

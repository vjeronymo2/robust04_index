			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts: Good knight rides in for ENO - The opening of Don Quichotte After a year or two with its fortunes down in the dumps, English National Opera has found a new champion to send into battle. He is grey-haired and grizzled, a doddery old dreamer, but from the reception he received on the opening night he is on his way to leading the company back into profit. By the time he wrote Don Quichotte in 1910, Massenet was the grand old man of French opera. He knew every trick in the theatrical handbook and was well aware that chapter one begins, 'Pick a good story'. The tale of Don Quixote, known to Parisian audiences at the time through plays based on Cervantes, could hardly have been a happier choice for the ageing composer, himself a pensionable knight of the theatre dreaming of his past successes. The operas that Massenet wrote towards the end of his life are not bursting with invention, like those of Verdi or Janacek. Pick up a score of Don Quichotte and you might wonder where the music has gone. There are only a few ideas left in the drawer but, master craftsman that he was, Massenet knew exactly where to place them and how. The opera is a delicate balance of humour and sentiment, which asks little from a producer to win fairly certain success. From the minute Don Quixote and Sancho Panza come on, it is clear that ENO's production will be good entertainment. They enter riding wobbly old tricycles, which double as warrior horses. Don Quixote's has the head of a once noble nag, now emaciated and ready for the knacker's yard, like its owner; Sancho Panza's is a donkey with expressive, wagging ears and a friendly grin. They were greeted with a roar of applause. The production team - Ian Judge (producer), John Gunter (designer) and Deidre Clancy (costumes, brilliant and stylish, by the dozen) - have upturned expectations. After previous encounters with Don Quichotte in the theatre and on record, I have come away with a mental picture of the opera in pastel colours, the silver grey of ageing hair or the distant blue of unfulfilled dreams. Here it is the opposite, ablaze with Spanish sun-baked yellow and flame red. Instead of an arthritic, old man's drama, we get dancing at every opportunity, fandangos a-plenty. Alongside seniority, the production helpfully finds a place too for youth. When the 80-year-old Verdi wrote Falstaff and Janacek his late operas, like The Cunning Little Vixen, they wanted to celebrate the renewal of life, as a new generation takes over from the old. Massenet clearly did not view the advancing years like that and Don Quichotte sentimentally reflects on everything that old age has lost. As the knight of the doleful countenance, Richard Van Allan captures movingly the nobility of heart which beats on, while limbs and joints are creaking towards their end. He looks perfect as Don Quixote (full marks to the make-up department), though his voice these days is starting to get as rusty as his armour. The role was written for Chaliapin, who would have made far more of a star turn out of his dying solo, where Massenet miraculously conjures a vision of the Island of Dreams out of almost no music at all. A couple of the best solos go to Sancho Panza and were delivered with a trusty, down-to-earth honesty by Alan Opie, words sharp and clear. His homely buffo figure makes him an ideal choice as Sancho Panza. (The casting department certainly had an eye for the right singers.) Louise Winter makes Dulcinee a dry run for Carmen, tapping a burnished chest register and singing with fiery charisma. Her suitors, literally so in trendy silk suits, were a bright-voiced quartet. Emmanuel Joel conducted with plenty of vigour, though some of the wind tuning makes the teeth grate. Altogether, this Don Quichotte is an evening of fun - the scene where Don Quixote charges at the windmill, gets his spear caught in the sail and flies off out of sight is quite a coup de theatre - and touching enlightenment, for like his weary hero, Massenet had his wisdom, too. For ENO, it comes not a moment too soon. This is the new regime's first popular hit. Performances until November 9.</p>

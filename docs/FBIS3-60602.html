			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukraine Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who is  taking part in the work of the CSCE session in Rome, held a news  conference today.    He noted that unfounded accusations have been heard on the  part of certain participants at the lofty forum to the effect  that Ukraine has supposedly declared itself a nuclear state.  However, the minister of foreign affairs emphasized, Ukraine  does not want and has never desired to acquire operational  control over nuclear weapons. The nuclear button is located in  Moscow, and one should not forget this. For Ukraine nuclear  weapons are material wealth, in which the labor of the Ukrainian  people has been invested. There is, therefore, every ground for  demanding just compensation, Anatoliy Zlenko stated.    The minister explained Ukraine's stance regarding the  nuclear  weapons located on its territory. The decision of the Supreme  Council on ratification of the START I Treaty, he said, opens  the way to gradual elimination of nuclear arsenals. The world  should realize this, understand it, and take a step to meeting  Ukraine halfway.    The head of the foreign policy department stressed that  giving Ukraine appropriate guarantees of security and economic  assistance on the part of the world community would remove all  obstacles from Ukraine's path to acceding to the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty.    Touching on the issue of giving Russia a mandate for  peace-making operations on the territory of the former USSR, the  minister of foreign affairs emphasized that a reliable mechanism  to control such operations needs to be created, which should  only involve multinational forces. The television and radio  agency Novyny reported this at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  of Ukraine.</p>

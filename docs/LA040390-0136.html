			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES' SURVEY HAS MOST ANGRY;  </P> <P> ABORTION: THE PRO-LIFE POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE SENT A QUESTIONNAIRE TO ALL  COUNTY GOVERNMENT CANDIDATES SEEKING THEIR POSITIONS ON THE ISSUE. MOST SAY  THEY WON'T ANSWER IT.  </P> <P> County political candidates on both sides of the abortion issue expressed  outrage Monday at a questionnaire sent to them by a local anti-abortion group  demanding formal statements of their positions.  </P> <P> The Pro-Life Political Action Committee of Orange County sent the short  questionnaire to every county government candidate, including those who are  unopposed, a spokesperson for the group said. Included are those seeking posts  such as district attorney, county supervisor and county recorder, the official  responsible for filing birth and death certificates.  </P> <P> The survey asks candidates' positions on a constitutional amendment banning  abortion and on banning use of public funds for abortion-related services. The  survey warns that those who do not return the questionnaire by April 10 will be  listed as "refused to respond" in results that will be circulated to "thousands  of constituents" in the county.  </P> <P> Most of the candidates contacted by The Times on Monday said they do not plan  to fill out the questionnaire.  </P> <P> "You are placing candidates who do not influence the abortion issue at a  distinct disadvantage -- regardless of their position," county recorder  candidate Stanley L. Roach wrote to the group. Roach is refusing to reveal his  views. "I hope your constituents have the intelligence not to be influenced by  such a ridiculous survey. . . . If you list me in your publication as a  'refused to respond' candidate, you will be lying. I will be hurt. You will be  sued."  </P> <P> County Recorder Lee A. Branch said he will not answer the abortion questions  but that he was not offended by the questionnaire.  </P> <P> "I'm telling them I appreciate their interest (but) that that's a personal  issue -- that each person has to have an opinion outside this office."  </P> <P> Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Enright, one of four candidates hoping to succeed  the recently retired Cecil Hicks, said it is inappropriate for a prosecutor to  respond to such a survey.  </P> <P> "A district attorney has to respond to the laws that are on the books. . . . I  don't know what the other candidates did, but I discarded it," Enright said of  the questionnaire. "It's sort of like a veiled threat -- 'You better fill it  out or we're going to view you as a negative.' "  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi also said he did not answer the survey. Deputy Dist.  Atty. Tom Avdeef said he had not yet received the survey but that he probably  would not respond to it. Assistant Dist. Atty. Ed Freeman could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> County Clerk Gary Granville, who is running unopposed, said he intends to  respond with an indication that he favors abortion rights.  </P> <P> Granville said he thinks members of the anti-abortion group "have the right to  ask that question, and as a public official it's my duty to respond."  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who is seeking a fifth term and whom abortion  opponents consider an ally, said he is leaning against answering the  questionnaire. Riley also expressed frustration with being asked to take a  position on issues he cannot vote on as a supervisor.  </P> <P> "There's the airport -- there's a lot of other things going on in my life that  are a hell of a lot more important to me right now," Riley said.  </P> <P> Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Don R. Roth, who are also seeking reelection  in June, could not be reached for comment. Christian L. Basquette, who is  challenging Roth, said he would not answer the survey.  </P> <P> Marie A. Antos, who is challenging Wieder, said she returned the questionnaire  with the response that she would not support a ban on abortion or a prohibition  against tax money for abortion. Antos said, however, that she resented the  warning about failing to respond. Antos said she wrote on the bottom of her  questionnaire: "I have the constitutional right to speak or not to speak as I  see fit."  </P> <P> The questionnaire comes at a time of heightened public debate over the abortion  issue. It has dominated elections at the state and federal levels since last  summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling giving states more leeway in  restricting abortions made legal in the landmark '70s Roe vs. Wade decision.  </P> <P> The survey sponsors defended their seeking positions of candidates running for  offices that in no way influence the issue, saying that those people may  eventually seek other offices.  </P></p>

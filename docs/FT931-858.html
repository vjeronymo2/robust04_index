			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finmeccanica at L186bn despite defence downturn FINMECCANICA, the group controlling the bulk of engineering and high technology interests of IRI, Italy's state holding company, recorded net profits of L186.4bn (Dollars 117m) in 1992. Comparisons with the previous year have been distorted by the need in the 1991 accounts to write in L615bn plus interest repaid to IRI. This followed a ruling by the EC Commission that Finmeccanica had received illegal subsidies for its car divisions prior to the sale of Alfa Romeo to Fiat in 1986. As a result Finmeccanica posted a group loss of L525bn, but with this payment excluded the 1992 profits rose 11 per cent. The board is proposing a dividend of L140 for ordinary shares and L180 for savings shares, with L51bn going to reserves. The share of the results net of third party interests due to Finmeccanica is L126.3bn against L182.9bn in 1991. (Alenia, Ansaldo and Elsag-Bailey were incorporated after the close of the 1992 accounts). During the year turnover rose L112bn to L11,078bn, of which 40 per cent was accounted for by exports. This 1 per cent rise against inflation of 5 per cent reflected the downturn in a number of sectors, most notably defence. New orders topped L12,000bn compared to L10,318bn in 1991, and totalled L22,300bn. Financial liabilities rose 9 per cent to L5,310bn, equivalent to 47 per cent of turnover. Increased indebtedness was attributed to the difficulties of the civil aerospace business and the defence sector, plus the cost of group restructuring. Employment declined from 56,000 to 51,500.</p>

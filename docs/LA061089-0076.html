			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT LOSES COURT BID TO BLOCK TIME-WARNER DEAL  </P> <P> A Delaware judge Friday rejected Paramount Communications' request to  temporarily block an anti-takeover clause of the merger agreement between Time  Inc. and Warner Communications that Paramount feared could upset its rival  $10.7-billion bid for Time.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as the battle of the communication giants ended its third day, Time  directors were believed to have set a meeting for Sunday, and there were signs  of frantic lobbying by both sides in Washington.  </P> <P> On Wall Street, the stocks of the three giant media and entertainment companies  were among the five most active in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Time  rose $2.25 to close at $170.25, with 2.36 million shares changing hands. Warner  closed at $56.125, down 37.5 cents. Paramount rose to a 52-week high of  $59.125, up 75 cents.  </P> <P> In Delaware, the legal skirmishing attracted so many bystanders that Chancellor  William T. Allen had to borrow a federal courtroom in Wilmington to accommodate  the overflow crowd at the 85-minute proceeding.  </P> <P> Late in the afternoon, Allen ruled that he found no reason to temporarily block  a clause of the merger agreement that enables Time and Warner to swap huge  blocks of newly issued shares.  </P> <P> The Paramount offer has triggered the parties' rights under the exchange  agreement, which if exercised would leave Time with 8.7% of Warner's stock and  Warner with 11.1% of Time's shares. Paramount has contended that the exchange  could add $1.2 billion to the cost of acquiring Time at its current offer of  $175 a share.  </P> <P> Paramount challenged the clause as an illegal "lock-up" that would have kept  outsiders from making higher takeover bids that could have benefited Time  shareholders. But Allen said a temporary restraining order on the swap was  unnecessary, since a swap could be nullified if the court finds during the  trial that the swap is improper.  </P> <P> The restraining order thus "would not appear legally critical," he said.  </P> <P> In separate statements, Time and Warner declared themselves "pleased" with the  outcome.  </P> <P> Paramount said it considered the decision "an extremely satisfactory one,"  contending that the court had "protected our position by assuring the status  quo." The court denied the motion "solely because it has the power after a full  hearing to undo any Time-Warner stock swap," a Paramount statement said.  </P> <P> This claim of victory prompted an angry rejoinder from Warner spokesman  Geoffrey W. Holmes, who called it "clearly a public relations effort to cover  the fact that the court had turned down their request."  </P> <P> In his ruling, the Delaware chancellor also refused Paramount's request to  force Time or Warner to give Paramount five days' notice if either Time or  Warner decides to trigger the stock-swap agreement. Under that agreement, Time  and Warner have an obligation to give each other five days' notice, but the  court's ruling means "Warner and Time could agree to amend the agreement to  exchange the shares immediately," said Charles F. Richards Jr., a Wilmington  attorney who represented Warner in the hearing.  </P> <P> "The court indicated that Paramount can't possibly close its tender offer for a  number of months. I think that is of some significance to the (stock) market,"  Richards said. "I think it has significance for the course of this case,  because it indicates that the court feels that he has several months to hear  the issues."  </P> <P> In his eight-page ruling, the chancellor alluded to the central issue of the  case, which is whether Time and Warner properly forged their stock swap merger  deal they announced in March. Paramount has contended the deal did not do  enough to see if other, higher bids were available; Time and Warner have argued  that in a "merger of equals" the corporate partners do not have to start an  auction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Swarming All Over'  </P> <P> Chancellor Allen wrote that the legal issues raised by the case "are ones that  have not yet been addressed in Delaware or elsewhere."  </P> <P> As they have struggled in court, the companies also mounted intensive efforts  to get across their point of view on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> "They're swarming all over down there," said a member of the Paramount team in  New York.  </P> <P> Lobbyists for the Time and Warner side have emphasized how much debt the  Paramount deal would load onto Time's valuable package of entertainment and  media assets; Paramount's representatives have stressed how much better their  $175-a-share offer would be for stockholders, say Capitol Hill sources.  </P> <P> Lobbyists on the Time and Warner side have gone further, several said, to urge  legislators to contact Paramount and express their displeasure at the hostile  takeover attempt, said one legislative source.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Media Ownership a Concern  </P> <P> "I would say this is very aggressive stuff," the source said.  </P> <P> Paramount's team includes Washington attorney Joseph A. Califano.  </P> <P> Among the targets have been members of telecommunications and finance  subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and members of the  communications subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee.  </P> <P> The Senate panel, chaired by Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), begins hearings  Wednesday on the possible dangers of concentration of ownership in the media  business.  </P> <P> Paramount, for its part, announced that it has entered into a voting trust  agreement with Donald Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense and White House  Chief of Staff under President Ford, which -- if approved by the Federal  Communications Commission -- would enable Paramount to actually acquire the  Time shares pending transfer of numerous licenses.  </P> <P> Paramount also announced that it has retained lawyers all over the country to  handle the requests to transfer licenses to cable television franchises now  held by Time and its subsidiaries.  </P> <P> Paul Richter reported from New York and Kathryn Harris from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

The paper's culture, though intellectually sparky, tends to be hostile to would-be editors from outside. But one possible outside candidate has insider qualifications. Sarah Hogg, head of the Number 10 policy unit, is a former economics editor of The Economist. She also proposed Pennant-Rea for his new post at a late stage in the Whitehall job search.

Now there's a Machiavellian thought.</p>

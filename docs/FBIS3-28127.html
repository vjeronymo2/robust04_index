			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] The large-scale H-2 rocket, developed solely with  Japanese technology, was schedued to be launched at 0700 [2200  GMT] this morning [3 February] at the Tanegashima Space Center  in Kagoshima Prefecture. But because it was found during  all-night inspection work that an airduct attached to the rocket  had developed trouble, the launch was again postponed until 0700  tomorrow morning.    The Tanegashima Space Center, from where the H-2 rocket is  to  be launched, had carried on all-night work since yesterday for  the launch of the rocket at 0700 this morning. However, when  the doors of the launch pad, where the rocket was installed,  were opened a little after 2200 [1300 GMT] last night, it was  found that the airduct attached on the top of the rocket was  diconnected. Because it takes a long time to reattach the  airduct to the rocket, the National Space Development Agency  [NASDA] of Japan decided to postpone the launch until 0700  tomorrow morning. According to NASDA, the airduct became  disconnected because of a gust of wind. Because it is expected  that a soft wind will blow tomorrow, NASDA plans to resume  preparation work this evening.    The launch of the H-2 was initially scheduled for 1  February,  but because of bad weather the launch had been postponed until  today.</p>

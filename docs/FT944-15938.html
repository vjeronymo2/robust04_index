			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Turn loss into benefit - How to maximise tax breaks when a company folds Investors who backed such fallen UK tycoons as Robert Maxwell or Asil Nadir will, no doubt, prefer not to reflect on it. But all those with shares in busted companies should now be thinking how to derive maximum tax benefits from their ill-fated speculations. Time is running out. As soon as it becomes clear that the shareholders of a collapsed company have no chance of salvaging anything, the Inland Revenue announces that the shares are of 'negligible value'. This enables investors to claim a loss for capital gains tax purposes without actually having to sell the shares. Strictly speaking, the loss does not arise until the taxpayer makes the claim. But because it can take some time for a taxpayer to become aware of a 'negligible value' declaration, the Revenue allow claims to be made retrospectively. You can back-date to any tax year that ends not more than two years before the date of claim - on condition that the shares actually are worthless both when the claim is made and on the earlier date selected by the taxpayer. This concession was helpful and straightforward. But it has become a victim of the controversial decision by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in the last Budget to stop the CGT indexation allowance from being used to turn a capital gain into a loss or to increase the amount of a loss, as opposed to just reducing a gain. This restriction applies to disposals made on or after November 30 1993. Negligible-value assets were a prime target of the chancellor's loophole-closing zeal. By definition, indexing the value of a worthless share will always increase a loss. But continuing to allow retrospective claims would have enabled shareholders to circumvent the new legislation for a couple more years by back-dating their claims to before November 30 1993. The Revenue has blocked this by decreeing that a retrospective claim is now governed by the law in force at the actual claim date. Had that been the end of the story, our unlucky investors would have been deprived at a stroke of all indexation on their dud shares. But, in response to vigorous protests, Clarke granted a measure of transitional relief. Each individual can now use indexed losses totalling up to Pounds 10,000 arising on disposals made between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995. So, someone holding valueless shares must lodge his claim by the end of the present tax year to have any chance of saving his indexation. If he does that, he will still qualify for transitional relief, even if he back-dates his claim to before November 30 1993. It is not enough, however, merely for the relief to be claimed by April 5 1995 - it must also be utilised by then. So, the order in which the various types of loss are set against capital gains is crucial. The first step is to deduct actual - as opposed to indexed - losses for the year in question. If that leaves a gain of more than the CGT annual exemption of Pounds 5,800, the gain can then be reduced by indexed losses for that year. To the extent that those losses are not utilised fully, they can be carried forward - though not beyond the present tax year. Say Adam has the misfortune to hold shares in Polly Peck for which he paid Pounds 3,000. He makes his negligible-value claim in October 1994 and back-dates to the 1993/94 tax year, which gives him an indexed loss of Pounds 1,000. In that year, his gains exceed his losses by Pounds 7,000. Offsetting his actual Polly Peck loss will bring down his net gain to Pounds 4,000. Since this is below Pounds 5,800, the indexed loss is carried forward. So, the present year gives Adam a final chance to exploit his loss before it disappears over the Turkish Cypriot horizon. In the remaining five months of the year, Adam - and all like him - must aim to make capital gains for 1994/1995 which, after deducting any present-year losses and the Pounds 5,800 exemption, will still leave enough taxable gains to absorb his indexed loss. If likely to fall short, he should consider topping up his gains by bed-and-breakfasting shares with an in-built profit.

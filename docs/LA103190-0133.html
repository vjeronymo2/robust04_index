			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL EXTENDED  </P> <P> At the urging of more than 100 mobile home owners in attendance, the County  Board of Supervisors voted to extend a rent-control ordinance Tuesday.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which limits rent increases for spaces to 5% a year, was due to  expire Dec. 15.  </P> <P> Mobile home residents, most of them elderly, feared that they would lose rent  control if the ordinance expired. The revised ordinance has no expiration date.  </P> <P> Mural Torrance, representing the Mobile Home Owners Alliance, submitted a  petition with 747 names urging the supervisors to keep the rent-control  ordinance on the books.  </P> <P> However, he also complained about a provision that the supervisors inserted in  the ordinance last December that benefits mobile home park owners.  </P> <P> The provision, which stemmed from a federal court decision, allows park owners  to raise the rent on spaces to any level they wish when a mobile home is sold.  </P> <P> Torrance said the provision, called vacancy decontrol, has had a chilling  effect on mobile home sales. He said that in one park, rent for a space went  from $311 to $528 a month after the home was sold.  </P> <P> "They lose interest rapidly," he said.  </P> <P> David Evans, representing the Western Mobile Home Assn., said his group of park  owners opposed any move by the supervisors to eliminate the vacancy decontrol  provision.  </P> <P> But the supervisors said they would reconsider the provision after January when  two new people take their seats on the board. They said they may remove it or  put a cap on rent increases that park owners can charge after a home is sold.  </P> <P> The rent-control ordinance was adopted in 1981.  </P> <P> It applies to 1,555 spaces in 24 parks in the unincorporated area of the  county.

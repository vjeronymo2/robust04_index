			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  New Hamburg Party's Sluggish Growth </H8>   The success of the Statt [Instead] Party in the Hamburg  election in September 1993 "stunned the established parties made  insecure by voter disaffection with politics," but has not  carried through in recent party efforts to broaden its  geographic base, according to an article in the 10 May  HANDELSBLATT. While local organizations have been established  in six laender, the party's national board refused to recognize  Brandenburg and Saarland groups, and establishment of a Berlin  organization was deferred. The HANDELSBLATT article noted that  the party's constituent congress in North Rhine-Westphalia made  an "awkward impression." During the session, party founder  Markus Wegner and national chairman Bernd Schuenemann attacked  one another on the stage. In the heated debate, Schuenemann, a  professor of criminal law and the philosophy of law in Munich  who was elected in March, called Wegner a member of a "cadre  party." In the ensuing raucous scene, they even came to blows.  The 19 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE reported that six members of  the national board relieved Schuenemann of his office on 17 May,  citing the serious damage he had done the party, his intentional  violation of party regulations, and his failure to observe  conventions of democracy. The article speculated that a similar  party fate awaits the Thuringian party chairman, von Bogendorff,  and that the Bavarian party organization finances are to be  examined for irregularities.    The rancor of the rivals seems exacerbated by the party's  seeming lack of a platform, though in 1993 it did present a  statement of principles, which was cited in the HANDELSBLATT  article: "The demands were above all: not to spend more than was  collected, to meet costs through higher efficiency, to examine  government operations with an eye to privatization consistent  with social policy, to postpone and extend payment schedules for  planned investments." The article further noted the party's  economic policy of promoting small- and medium-sized businesses  and of technology to create and preserve jobs and to offset the  risky economic status of Hamburg's port. These views, peculiar  to the party's caucus in the Hamburg senate, are less clear  among more recently formed party groups such as those in  Schleswig-Holstein, Hesse, and Baden-Wuerttemberg, which do not  hold legislative office. The article asserted: "The newcomers'  program is vague, if existent at all: liberal, conservative, and  `grass-roots democratic' positions alternate; market economy  tendencies on the one hand and ecologically oriented demands on  the other only rarely seem attuned to one another."    The next nationwide meeting of the Statt Party organization  is scheduled for 4 June in Hamburg. It will tackle the question  of how many legitimate local party organizations there are, how  many authorized board members there may be, how much the party  may have been strengthened by a shrinking core membership, "and  perhaps, how many genuine Statt parties really exist." A 9 May  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE article questioned whether so late a  meeting can restore the party's potential for conducting an  effective campaign for the European Parliament election on 12  June, or whether that possibility was shattered by the debacle  in North Rhine-Westphalia.  <H5>  Opposition to Maastricht Shakey </H5>   Another recently founded party, the Union of Free Citizens  [BFB], is also among the 23 parties authorized to post  candidates for the European Parliament election. Barely five  months old, the party is also drawing up a platform for the  federal elections in October, with special emphasis on economic  and financial policy. In contrast to the Statt Party, however,  as noted in the 13-14 May HANDELSBLATT, "the membership rolls in  the laender organizations usually carry only a few names..." and  the BFB's geographic distribution makes it "a predominantly  southern German phenomenon," whereas the Statt Party membership  is primarily in the north. The BFB, however, numbers only about  420 members, according to an article in the 20 May FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE, and according to public opinion polling institutes,  support for the "liberal-conservative reform party" is currently  so slight that it cannot be measured. Personal clashes within  the BFB are impeding its expansion, as with the Statt Party, and  some founding members take exception to recent political  maneuvers by the party chairman, Manfred Brunner. Brunner has  developed contacts with the Bavarian Christian Social Union  [CSU], a party rather to the right of the liberal founders of  the BFB, and has associated with Joerg Haider, the chairman of  Austria's Liberal Party [FP0e], who is generally conceded to be  on the extreme right of the political spectrum.    According to the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, the BFB's  "Guidelines for European Policy" seem less pro-German than  anti-European Union [EU]: the party is in favor of preserving  the German mark as currency, rather than falling victim to the  "Esperanto money," as the Munich CSU chairman, Peter Gauweiler  called the ECU. The party "also intends to guard against `the  regulatory mania' of the EU; the joint agricultural policy ought  to yield to simultaneous supports dictated by operations, and in  questions of environmental protection, the EU ought to confine  itself to what is absolutely essential." Whether the party  properly describes itself as the "champion of German interests,"  by virtue of its concept of a European policy at odds with the  Maastricht Treaty, or whether it is viewed as a nationalist  group moving ever further to the right, even the chairman's old  friends and supporters are leaving the party and questioning his  judgment.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Air France to shed more than 2,000 jobs Air France, the state-owned national carrier which was forced to abandon a restructuring plan in October in the face of a crippling strike, is seeking to cut 2,100 jobs next year through voluntary measures, the company said yesterday. The job cuts, which will comprise early retirements and increased part-time work, are part of new plan aimed at stemming losses forecast to reach FFr7bn (Dollars 1.2bn) this year. The plan is expected to be announced next week, a spokesman for the company said. The airline's operations have returned to normal following the October strike, which lasted for more than a week and forced the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, the group's chairman. Mr Attali was seeking to reduce the company's 63,000 staff by 4,000, again through voluntary measures, and to cut overtime pay and bonuses. Mr Christian Blanc, who succeed Mr Attali at the head of the airline, has presented his proposals for the 2,100 job cuts to the company's unions. He is expected to present further recovery measures at the beginning of next week. Unions at the airline have said they will continue to oppose cost-cutting measures which involve involuntary redundancies and which impose an unfair burden on employees. One of their principal complaints against Mr Attali's restructuring plan was that they felt it discriminated against ground staff. The French government was forced to retreat in the strike at Air France, its first serious industrial dispute since taking office in March. Faced with an unemployment rate of 12.2 per cent it has ordered public sector companies to avoid involuntary redundancies.</p>

Despite the government ban on such links, many marine  companies sail direct to the mainland coast. The Ministry of  Economic Affairs will use the BOFT report in deciding whether to  recommend that the ban on marine links be lifted.    BOFT Director-General Huang Yen-chao said that ships sailing  to mainland ports are flying foreign flags which makes them  difficult to police. He said direct marine links should be  considered as long as they don't involve mutual recognition  problems.</p>

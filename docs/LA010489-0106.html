			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON RUNS AFOUL IN DEFEAT  </P> <P> When Cal State Fullerton's Mark Hill hit a 3-point shot that cut New Mexico  State's lead to 4 points with 1 minute 46 seconds remaining Tuesday, the  situation looked good for Fullerton.  </P> <P> But there was a problem. The Titans, who had come from 13 points behind, had  committed only 4 team fouls.  </P> <P> Before Fullerton sent New Mexico State to the free-throw line, 53 seconds  passed. The Aggies then made 6 of 6 shots from the line in the final minute,  taking a 65-60 victory in front of 1,603 in Titan Gym in the the Big West  Conference opener for both teams.  </P> <P> The foul situation presented a dilemma for Fullerton.  </P> <P> The Titans could try for a steal, all the while letting time run off the clock.  </P> <P> Or they could foul quickly, putting New Mexico State closer to the bonus. But  with the fifth and sixth foul, the Aggies got a new 45 seconds on the shot  clock.  </P> <P> "We got caught in a Catch-22," Coach John Sneed said.  </P> <P> In the end, Fullerton rode the fence, trying for a steal for the first few  passes and then fouling.  </P> <P> The Titans had no luck either way. The Aggies protected the ball and hit their  free throws, including 4 consecutive by Jimmy Taylor.  </P> <P> The loss overshadowed a career-high 26-point performance by Hill, who tied a  school record by making 6 3-pointers.  </P> <P> Kerry Boagni made 6 3-pointers against New Mexico State in 1986.  </P> <P> Hill made 6 of 9 from 3-point range, and 2 of 3 from closer. He added 4 free  throws in 6 attempts as he led the Titans in scoring for the second game in a  row.  </P> <P> He also played tough defense on Jeff McCool, who had been leading the Aggies  with a 14-point average, and was averaging 12 points a game from 3-point range.  </P> <P> Against Fullerton, he scored only 6 points, making 1 of 2 from 3-point range.  </P> <P> "Mark played McCool well," Sneed said. "McCool knows where that 3-point line  is, but Mark kept him away."  </P> <P> Fullerton has lost 4 in a row after a 5-1 start during which the Titans showed  remarkable composure.  </P> <P> But in recent games, the team has been in a state of flux.  </P> <P>  -- Cedric Ceballos, who averaged 25 points in his first 7 games, finished with  12. Two games ago, he scored only 2 points in a double-overtime loss to New  Orleans in a performance he called his worst since he was in grade school. He  came back with 16 in a loss to St. Mary's Friday. Against New Mexico State, he  made 4 of 16 shots from the field.  </P> <P>  -- John Sykes, returning after a 1-game suspension for unspecified reasons,  scored 14 points off the bench, making all 6 shots.  </P> <P>  -- Derek Jones, who had been the second-leading scorer in the early part of  the season, struggled with foul trouble, picking up his third in the first half  and finishing with a season-low 4 points.  </P> <P>  -- And Wayne Williams, the freshman point guard who played a crucial part in  two of Fullerton's early road victories, went scoreless for the second game in  a row, missing all 5 shots, 4 from 3-point range.  </P> <P> Fullerton will end its 6-game home stand with a game against Cal State Long  Beach in Titan Gym Thursday.  </P> <P> "We had lost 3 and they still came back to play tough tonight," Sneed said.  "That's a good sign. It was a home game, the conference opener and a TV game,  so that was motivation. We'll have motivation Thursday, because we don't want  to go on the road without a win."  </P> <P> The victory was the third in a row for New Mexico State (8-3).  </P> <P> Willie Joseph led the Aggies with 20 points, and Johnny Roberson added 15.  </P> <P> Fullerton rallied after falling behind by 13 less than 3 minutes into the  second half after a 3-pointer by Taylor and a short jumper by Joseph at the  start of the half gave New Mexico State its biggest lead, 39-26.  </P> <P> New Mexico State had used a 13-0 run to take a 17-7 lead over the Titans during  a first-half in which Fullerton made just 8 of 30 shots (27%).  </P> <P> The Aggies made 16 of 28 (57%) in the half, and led, 34-26, at halftime.  </P></p>

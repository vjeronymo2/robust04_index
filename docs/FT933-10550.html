			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Flour mill to be built in Sumatra A Dollars 100M FLOUR MILL is to be built at Belawan in North Sumatra, taking advantage of the Indonesian government's decision last June partly to deregulate the flour sector. Indonesia is one of the world's largest importers of wheat, having bought more than 2m tonnes last year. The country is also home to what is reputed to the world's largest wheat-miller, Bogasari Flour Mills, a subsidiary of Salim Group, which has a monopoly in the country's flour sector. The group is a major consumer of flour, with its subsidiary Indofood Group enjoying a 90 per cent share of Indonesia's instant noodle market. The new mill, with capacity of 1,000 tonnes a day, will be a joint venture of Bogasari, the Rodamas Group and ABC Group, both of Indonesia, and Gold Coin of Malaysia. With plants at Ujungpandang on Sulawesi, and in Jakarta and Surubaya on Java, Bogasari has a capacity of about 11,000 tonnes a day. In June, the government opened the sector to foreign investment but requires that all new ventures, domestic or foreign, export at least 65 per cent of production. Indonesia, however, produces no wheat and the export requirement effectively closes most avenues for new investment. Industry officials say the participation of Bogasari in the new plant's consortium reflects the limitations of the deregulation package and the continuing stranglehold of Salim Group over the sector. The consortium is likely to argue that the plant be considered an expansion of the existing Bogasari operations and thus escape the export requirement.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Germany and US agree on new bilateral aviation deal GERMANY and the US yesterday agreed a new bilateral aviation accord clearing the way for a far-reaching collaboration deal between Lufthansa, the German airline, and United Airlines, one of the three biggest US carriers. The four-year agreement, which will come into force on November 1, allows Lufthansa to enter a code-sharing partnership with a US carrier, giving the German airline gradual access to any destination in the US. Code-sharing allows two airlines to book their passengers on each other routes. Lufthansa yesterday said that it was still negotiating with two potential US partners, but negotations with United Airlines are urderstood to be in their final stages. A deal would also place Lufthansa in a stronger competitive footing against other European airlines which have already forged alliances with US carriers. Mr Jurgen Weber, the Lufthansa chairman, said that he was pleased with the accord and that it would lead to fair competition on North Atlantic routes to and from Germany. The agreement also puts a two-year capacity freeze on US carriers flying into Germany and back. A gradual increase on the number of North Atlantic flights is foreseen for the following two years. In return, the US will be allowed to have a second national carrier enter a code-sharing agreement with an airline from the European Community. Northwest, the US airline, already has such a partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and has been seeking to prolong its transatlantic flights to Amsterdam into the German market. The air traffic agreement follows lengthy and difficult negotiations in which Germany has sought to pry open the US market for its national carriers. Germany claimed that the current post-war air traffic agreement gave undue advantage to US carriers flying into Germany and had threatened to abrogate it unless it was changed. Under the new agreement, Lufthansa will be able to fly directly to 25 destinations in the US. It will be able to operate, via its code-sharing agreement, up to 500 North Atlantic round-trip flights per week to anywhere in the US by the year 1997. The German carrier at the moment operates 112 round-trip flights over the ocean per week. US carriers will be limited to the existing number of North Atlantic flights between the two countries for two years. The capacity freeze also applies to US flights out of Germany to third destinations. In the third and fourth year of the agreement, US airlines will be able to increase North Atlantic round-trip flights to 14 per week and round-trip flights to third destinations from Germany to seven a week. At the moment, US carriers operate an average of 253 flights a week between the two countries in the winter and 262 in the summer. The US will be allowed in return to have 140 one-way flights a week operated between the US and Germany through a code-sharing agreement with another airline from the EC. 'This a win-win agreement which amounts to three-quarters of an open sky treaty,' a German government official said.</p>

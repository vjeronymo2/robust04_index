			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Domnick Hunter advances to Pounds 2.6m Domnick Hunter group, the filtration and gas separation company floated in March, increased pre-tax profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 2.6m in the six months to June 30. The results, coupled with an upbeat trading statement, bolstered the Tyneside-based group's status as one of the most attractive of recent flotations. The shares, launched at 200p, yesterday closed 10p higher at 260p. Sales rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 17.7m. The pre-tax figure was flattered by reduced interest charges after flotation; the underlying performance showed in operating profits, ahead 21 per cent at Pounds 2.72m. Mr Brian Thompson, executive chairman, said: 'A strong level of orders and sales continues into the second half and there is every indication that this situation should prevail for the remainder of the year.' The industrial division, which makes dryers and filters for compressed air and gases, benefited from an uplift in market confidence. In particular, sales of compressed air dryers were strong. Operating profit rose 27 per cent to Pounds 2.67m, on sales of Pounds 13.5m, up 18 per cent. Mr Thompson said the group's new nitrogen generators were attracting 'tremendous' interest. Sales increased by 50 per cent to Pounds 660,000 and there was 'huge' scope for the generators, which produce nitrogen gas from compressed air at a fraction of the cost of cylinder supplies. A Pounds 2.5m extension to the industrial division's Birtley plant will increase space by 50 per cent. He said the process division - which filters pharmaceuticals and liquids using sophisticated membranes - was still in the evolutionary phase of its development. Sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 4.2m, but investment in an overseas sales network was behind a fall in operating profits from Pounds 151,000 to Pounds 51,000. Fully-diluted earnings per share improved to 3.8p (3.02p). A special interim dividend of 1p is declared for the three-month period since listing. COMMENT Analysts love this company, which attracts plaudits such as 'a little gem' and 'one of the best small companies I have ever seen'. Its products are market leaders and more than 60 per cent of sales are exported to more than 40 countries. The dryer business is going well, and the new nitrogen generators have tremendous potential. The process division is also seen as a sound investment, in spite of its present modest profits. Alas, all this quality comes at a price, and forecast full-year profits of Pounds 5.6m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 23 - a 45 per cent premium to the market. The shares are tightly held, but those who are lucky enough to have got on board still have no reason to sell.</p>

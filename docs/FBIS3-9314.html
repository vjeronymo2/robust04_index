The Serbs had taken away l3 of 30 artillery pieces,  leaving the remainder under the supervision of Canadian UNPROFOR  units who came across the cache last Sunday, Major Macdowall  said. The weapons left behind included l0 large calibre mortars,  four howitzers, two T-55 tanks and an anti-aircraft gun. The  cache was found in Cifluk village north-west of Sarajevo. The  Serbs said it was just outside the exclusion zone, basing their  calculations on Sarajevo's traditional centrepoint the  cathedral. But UNPROFOR's map used a reference point one  kilometre (slightly more than half a mile) to the west, putting  Cifluk within the exclusion zone, Macdowall noted.    The matter was sorted out late on Monday at Pale, stronghold  of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, in talks between  Bosnian Serb chief Radovan Karadzic and UNPROFOR's Dutch chief  of staff General Adrian van Baal. The exclusion zone came into  effect on February 20.</p>

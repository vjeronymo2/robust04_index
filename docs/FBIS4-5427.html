			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that the Cambodian  foreign minister's accusation that Thailand supports the Khmer  Rouge affects Thailand's image. The prime minister made these  remarks when talking to reporters in Nong Khai Province. He  said that he had instructed the Thai ambassador to Phnom Penh to  seek facts and evidence in this regard.    Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said he  regretted that the Cambodian leader made such an accusation  because the two sides had agreed not to publicly speak out  against each other. The two sides agreed to solve problems  through dialogue. He said that he would meet the Cambodian  foreign minister soon to discuss this question.    Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said  Thailand has upheld humanitarian principles in assisting  Cambodian displaced persons. He said that as the accusation has  an impact on the country's reputation, Thailand will have to  explain to the international community Thailand's policy of  noninterference in Cambodia's internal affairs.</p>

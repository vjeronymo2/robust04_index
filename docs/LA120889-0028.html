			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Washington Director Resigns: Jock Reynolds, director of the Washington Project  for the Arts for the last six years and a key player in the summer censorship  controversy that gripped the National Endowment for the Arts, resigned Thursday  to become director of the Addison Gallery of American Art on the campus of  Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. Officials said Reynolds, who had been at the  Addison Gallery on sabbatical since September, had quit to explore new  challenges at Phillips Academy, of which he is a graduate. Earlier this year,  Reynolds and WPA accepted a show of work by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe  after Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled it in an ill-fated attempt  at political appeasement of conservatives in Congress.

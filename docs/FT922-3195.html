			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures retreated on the back of the overnight falls on Wall street, though turnover was greatly improved on recent levels, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE started the session at around the 2,640 level and immediately saw selling activity which sent it falling to 2,623 by 10am, and helped send the underlying cash market lower. The poor distributive sales survey from the CBI only served to increased the downward pressure on June, but nerves steadied mid session and a bout of sideways trading followed thereafter. However the poor opening on Wall Street once again led dealers to sell the contract, though a feeling that earlier falls had been overdone helped June recover towards the close of the market. June closed at 2,629, down 20 on the previous session but around 10 points above its estimated fair value premium of about 6. Notably, the contract spent much of the session at a premium to fair value. Turnover was a healthy 10,025 contracts. The turnover in the traded options also saw a big improvement on recent levels. A total of 37,662 contracts had changed hands by the close. The FT-SE option traded 19,715 lots. Glaxo was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 1,838.</p>

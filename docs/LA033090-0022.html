			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU GRADUATES TO HEAR HUMANITIES FUND'S CHIEF  </P> <P> Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, will  address the nearly 7,000 graduates at San Diego State University in May.  </P> <P> SDSU President Thomas B. Day said Cheney was invited to speak to the 91st  graduating class because of her "contributions to journalism, literature and  the humanities."  </P> <P> Under Cheney's leadership the NEH/Reader's Digest Teacher-Scholar program was  established in 1989. The program gives elementary and secondary school teachers  who qualify $27,500 to study humanities for a year. Reader's Digest provides  one-third of the funding.  </P> <P> Cheney also oversaw the establishment of a $1.5-million research center at UCLA  to study the way history is taught in the country. It will make recommendations  for improving teaching methods.  </P> <P> NEH is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1965. It provides  grants to scholars, colleges, museums, libraries and other cultural  institutions to support research, education and public programs in the  humanities. Cheney was appointed to NEH in 1986 and was recently reappointed by  President George Bush. Her husband is Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.  </P> <P> "I hope everyone will have an appreciation for what she has to say," said Rick  Moore, an SDSU spokesman.  </P> <P> "We don't just train people to go into marketing or to become scientists and  engineers. They all take courses in the humanities, and, we hope, they learn  how to appreciate the significance of what they are doing and how it fits in  with the rest of society. That's what the humanities are all about."  </P></p>

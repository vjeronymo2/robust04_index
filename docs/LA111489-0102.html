			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROAD SHOW OFFERS LOUD LOOK INTO A DESIGNER'S VISION  </P> <P> Heralded by caravans of Space Age vehicles and accompanied by an entourage of  eager young assistants sporting T-shirts blazoned with his signature, Signor  Luigi Colani led "Automorrow 89," his famous international design circus, into  town last week.  </P> <P> A fast-talking midway barker sporting a luxuriant handlebar mustache and a  colorful striped blazer, Ringmaster Colani strode among the vividly colored  avant-garde cars scattered over the green lawns of Pasadena's Art Center  College of Design. Followed by a flock of adoring students, Colani ran through  a polished patter that laid out the principles of his philosophy of  "bio-design."  </P> <P> "Except for crystalline structures, nature has no straight lines," Colani  declared, "Every natural form, from the shape of a shark's body to the  trajectory of an asteroid, follows a curvilinear pattern."  </P> <P> Curves are everywhere in bio-design. Colani's bullet train's nose is shaped  like a giant tip of a guided missile. A large scale model of a supersonic  airliner resembles a female form in flight. Many of Colani's cars resemble eggs  that enclose their occupants like recumbent embryos waiting to be hatched.  </P> <P> Variously described by European and American design publications as a  "visionary sculptor/engineer," "the architect of the automobile," and "the  Leonardo Da Vinci of the 20th Century," Colani has created challenging and  extraordinary styles for everything from male toiletries -- including bars of  scented soap bearing his effigy -- to high-tech racing yachts. Among his best  known designs are those for Sony stereo headphones and Canon's easy-grip T-90  camera.  </P> <P> But the big act in Colani's "Automorrow 89," and the reason for the designer's  current international tour through the United States, Europe, Japan and the  Soviet Union, is a radical collection of experimental cars.  </P> <P> "Automorrow 89" began its worldwide odyssey last month on Utah's Bonneville  Salt Flats, the world's leading auto test grounds. There Colani subjected his  slow human-powered mini-cars and his fast engine-powered racers to exhaustive  speed and endurance tests. The vehicles, which are all designed with a concern  for fuel economy and ecological sensitivity, are designated as "Utah" models in  honor of the legendary flats.  </P> <P> Utah 2, intended as a prototype for short distance urban transportation, is a  two-seater, three-wheeled, human-powered fiberglass egg less than three feet  high weighing a mere 116 pounds. Its two pedaling drivers lie cushioned and  supine, watching watch the road through pounding knees. When the legs tire, an  auxiliary 30cc moped engine helps keep the fiberglass egg rolling.  </P> <P> Utah 3, a one-person version of the above, weighs 35 pounds. Its composite  alloy, bobbin-shaped shell fits its lone driver like a second skin. Both Utah 2  and Utah 3 are light enough to be lifted and carried by their riders.  </P> <P> "Tomorrow's vehicles have to be lean and mean," Colani said. "They must  generate maximum use within a minimum size. There is no future for the  overweight, overpowered monsters now being churned out by the world's auto  industry. We are running out of room in our cities and out of breathable air.  We are losing touch with natural rhythms."  </P> <P> Consequently, Colani's views of current auto design are caustic. "Most car  styling is pure design prostitution," he said. "It is made to please a legion  of publicists who have conned a gullible public into lusting after false  smiles. We cannot continue for long in this massive obscenity that is  destroying our cities and our souls.  </P> <P> "If people yearn for the va-va-vroom of overpowered engines, let them slip a  noisy race car audio tape in the decks of their human-powered autos. They can  set their blood on fire without burning up the world."  </P> <P> Colani's version of a vroom vehicle is his Utah 8, a low-riding two-seater  powered by a 1,000cc turbocharged BMW power-plant capable of reaching 150  m.p.h. Utah 8's curvaceous white plastic body fits tight to a carbon-fiber  chassis with a weight of only 1,300 pounds. The car's fuel economy of 35 miles  to the gallon is extraordinary for a high-performance racer.  </P> <P> In response to concerns about the safety of people riding at high speed in such  flimsy containers, he shrugged: "I favor a low-speed, lightweight  transportation strategy. High speeds are for long-distance travel by train and  plane, not for cities. Even with overpowered cars, high speeds are seldom  possible in the universal urban congestion we have created in the past 20  years."  </P> <P> If his cars aren't meant to travel fast, why are they so radically aerodynamic  in shape? "People love the idea and the romance of speed," Colani said. "We  produce automobiles that look as if they're flying even while parked in the  driveway. It is the primal image of the jet fighter, that hawk of the sky, that  haunts our dreams."  </P> <P> Colani, 61, learned to dream creatively as the son of an Italian businessman  living in Berlin. The four Colani children were never given toys; instead their  parents urged them to create their own from wooden blocks, paper, cardboard and  colored crayons. After a course in painting at Berlin's Academy of Art, Colani  studied aerodynamics and racing car design at the University of Paris.  </P> <P> Now based in Berne, Switzerland, Colani travels the world, stirring up  corporations and organizations as conservative as Japan's Mitsubishi and  Detroit's American Iron and Steel Institute with his provocative yet artful  showmanship. A spokesman for the AISI explained why they are one of the  sponsors of his current global tour: "With the industrial use of steel in  steady decline, we are very much in need of innovative concepts such as those  offered by Signor Colani."  </P> <P> "I love steel," Colani confirmed. "For me fiberglass and plastics are just a  temporary substitute for the new generation of lightweight metal alloys the  industry is beginning to develop."  </P> <P> Carving expressive curves in the air, Colani exclaimed: "Steel is the sexiest  of all man-made materials; its potential shapes are sensuous beyond imagining.  I embrace steel's future like a lover, and together we will produce a host of  beautiful and sensible children."  </P></p>

All work now underway is due to be  completed by the June 30 deadline.    The Tsing Ma bridge, topped out on Monday, is slightly ahead  of programme and well on course to be completed before June  1997. The airport site reclamation work is also ahead of  schedule, while construction of other key core projects,  including the West Kowloon reclamation and the North Lantau  expressway, is well advanced.    Trafalgar House, one of the companies in the Anglo-Japanese  construction consortium building the Tsing Ma bridge, confirmed  this. "As far as we are concerned, China's comments do not  affect us, because the bridge will be handed over to the Hong  Kong Government prior to June 1997," said Anthony Hasluck, a  Trafalgar House spokesman in London. He said design and  building firms working on the airport core projects were being  paid by the Government as work progressed.    What China's comments may do is to deter companies from  bidding for work which overlaps the handover. This almost  certainly includes the airport railway, which has been delayed  by more than a year. It could also affect the airport terminal,  although the Provisional Airport Authority has appointed several  companies to advise on how construction can be speeded up. But  firms will want to see proof that China is serious about  canceling contracts before they take action. Many are aware  that this is the second time the Chinese authorities have  threatened to cancel orders which straddle the 1997 handover.    China's statement also places a fresh question mark over the  future of Container Terminal Nine. The Port Development Board  has been waiting more than a year for the go-ahead from China to  award the concession. Any further delay will place even more  pressure on the existing facilities.    Interest in several of Hong Kong's other major  infrastructure  projects could also be torpedoed. Among these are the Country  Park section of the Route 3 highway to China which has just gone  out to tender; the strategic sewage disposal strategy and plans  by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation to extend its heavy  rail network.    But to what extent this happens depends on how companies  interpret China's declaration, which said that only projects  which had not been approved by the Chinese side would be  revoked. So while the Central reclamation and Western Harbour  Crossing are apparently unaffected by the Chinese threat, the  position is less clear about Route 3 and the sewage disposal  project, even though the Chinese authorities have given their  tacit approval to both.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Guenter Bannas: "The Federation Does Not Want To </F> Become a Bone Gnawed Clean--Federalists and Supporters of a  Centralized State Argue About Future Legislative Competence"]    [Text] Edmund Stoiber formulates his criticism of the  Federal Government in a manner that is full of sarcasm. He says  he was "somewhat astonished" that it questioned decisions about  projected changes to the Basic Law that were reached a year ago  with a large consensus. In this way, the Bavarian  minister-president, in an interview with this newspaper, entered  a plea on behalf of strengthening federalism. In the difficult  web between federal and land politics, differences of opinion  have come to light in the coalition parties with regard to the  future distribution of legislative authority, particularly in  the Union [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union--CDU/CSU]. The disagreement is ongoing between the Federal  Government and the governments of the laender that are under  CDU/CSU leadership.    In the CDU/CSU Bundestag caucus, the impression  prevails that caucus chairman Schaeuble stands--cautiously--on  the side of the laender in this matter. On Tuesday [19 April] he  said that they had to be granted additional rights. He left the  question of their scope open. Last week, the leadership of the  Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union could  not reach any agreement. They agreed to a "strategy meeting" for  next Thursday to settle the discord--on what is hostile  territory for the federal politicians, in Bavaria's land  representation delegation in Bonn.  <H5>  A Strategy Meeting </H5>   Under the leadership of Chancellor's Office Minister Bohl,  at  that time, Schaeuble, Interior Minister Kanther, chairman of the  constitutional committee Scholz (CDU) will negotiate on behalf  of the CDU, the right-wing politician Jahn, and (for the  laender), the Thuringian Minister-President Vogel and the  minister of justice from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Schaeuble [as  published]. Stoiber is coming on behalf of the CSU, as is his  minister of the interior, Beckstein, his former secretary of  state Wilhelm and Bundestag deputies Geis and  Friedrich. On 17 May, the CDU/CSU caucus is supposed to deal  ultimately with amendments to the Basic Law.    The contested recompensation law, Schaeuble said this week  in  the caucus, was, by contrast, an easy undertaking. Schaeuble  still recalls the unification treaty between the Federal  Republic and the former German Democratic Republic; in that, the  demands of the laender for additional legislative authority were  mentioned as a guideline for constitutional amendments. Still,  the atmosphere between the federalists and the adherents of a  strong central government is charged with tension. The authority  of the Federal Government, Deputy Renate Hellwig was heard to  say recently, should not be permitted, in the tension that  exists between the European Union and the laendern, to become a  "gnawed bone." Opinions of this kind, which President von  Weizsaecker also voiced, Stoiber considers "superficial," that  is to say, wrong.    Since the recommendations of the constitutional committee  had  been presented not only by the caucuses of the  Bundestag, but also by the Bundesrat as  draft legislation, the Federal Government had the opportunity to  state its position. This position was most outspoken in its  opposition of the proposed amendment to "competing legislation"  (Article 72). In the decision of the Federal Cabinet, there is  talk having to do with "constitutional policy reservations and  reservations having to do with constitutional law." The  formulations of the constitutional committee were said to be "on  the whole unbalanced, leading in some instances, to considerable  legal uncertainties and practical difficulties." In the  constitutional committee, the representatives of the laender--in  a broad alliance with the members of the  Bundestag--prevailed in the passage of an amendment  that should expand the authority of the laender. For a long  time, there had been the complaint that the legislative  authority had, over the years, in a creeping process, been  concentrated in the Federal Government. At this time, the  laender wanted to take effective countermeasures.    The concept of competing legislation has thus far given the  laender legislative authority "as long as, and to the extent  that" the Federal Government does not take advantage of its  right to legislate. According to the current legal situation,  the Federal Government has the right to legislate to the extent  that there is a need for regulation on the level of federal law  because a matter cannot be effectively regulated by the laendern  or because the uniformity of living conditions in Germany is  jeopardized. The recommendation that was decided by the  constitutional committee imposes limits on this authority of the  Federal Government. "In this area, the Federal Government has  the right to legislate if, and to the extent that, the creation  of equal living conditions throughout the country, or the  preservation of legal uniformity in the common interest renders  a federal legal provision necessary," the proposal of the  constitutional committee says. For a long time, the Federal  Government was reserved with its protest--probably for tactical  reasons, among others. The constitutional amendment that is now  the center of the controversy had been formulated within the  constitutional committee as a wrestling match was going on  between federal and land politicians concerning the competence  of the Bundesrat (Article 23) insofar as European  policy was concerned. Burdening these negotiations with the  quarrel over legislative authority could have endangered the  ratification of the European Community agreement of Maastricht  in the Bundesrat. After the fact, therefore, within  the Federal Government, there is talk of a "double legislative  bundle" that the laender had made as a precondition for the  ratification of the Maastricht agreement.  <H5>  The Concerns of the Federal Government </H5>   Above all, the "common state interest" as a condition for  the  Federal Government's legislative authority encounters the  Federal Government's contradiction, the sharpness of which was  surprising, even for the [CDU/CSU] Union's members of  constitutional committee, who were long acquainted with the  Federal Government's concerns. The Federal Government saw  considerable hazards for the ability of the state to act as a  whole and for the economic competitiveness of the "economic  venue Germany," it says in the Federal Government's position  statement. It is said that the proposed article was "a formulaic  compromise" that rendered no reliable statements possible as to  whether, and to what extent, the Federal Government could  exercise its legislative powers. This would lead to  uncertainties in all "areas that required settlement between  competing legislation." The Federal Government considers these  to be the following areas: the civil code, the commercial code,  corporate law, the atomic law, emissions standards law, the  social code, the construction code, penal law, and criminal  trial law. A subsequent legal uncertainty is, in the view of the  Federal Government, especially harmful for the ability of the  German economy to compete, "since the economy must adhere to  clear, predictable underlying conditions." Accordingly, leading  economic associations and the trade unions have rejected the  recommendation that was proposed, and they have done so using  rhetoric that closely resembled that of the Federal Government.  As a possible compromise, some consideration is being given  within the Federal Government to eliminating the indication of  the interests of the common state as a limiting condition.    Stoiber contradicts, reluctantly. "I hope that the decisions  of the constitutional committee remain standing." From his  standpoint, what is at stake is a compromise; he says originally  the laender demanded more. In addition, Stoiber created a  connection with expansions of authority for the Federal  Government that were granted him in matters of national  responsibility, organ transplantation and artificial  insemination. The concerns "of some" groups, he says, were taken  over by the Federal Government "unawares." Stoiber characterizes  claims as false that according to the representations of the  constitutional committee, the occupational training system in  Germany could collapse.    The Federal Government also contradicted the vote of the  constitutional committee concerning legislative authority in the  area of universities. In article 75 of the Basic Law  (constitution), at the present time, the Federal Government is  granted authority over "the general principles of the tertiary  educational system." In the presentation of the constitutional  committee, this is limited to "admission to study, the courses  of study, the examinations, university degrees, scholarly and  artistic personnel." In the Federal Government's position  statement, it says that the Federal Government was losing  authority to govern the structure of tertiary education (in  universities, specialized tertiary institutes, art schools, and  others). That would lead to a "disintegrating development of the  German tertiary educational landscape" and could jeopardize  national recognition of performance in studies and on  examinations.    Of lesser importance is the posture of denial of the Federal  Government concerning recommendations of the constitutional  committee pertaining to the time limits for position statements  by the Federal Government relating to draft legislation by the  Bundesrat. The Bundesrat would like to shorten  them from three months to six weeks to speed up the processing  of Bundesrat initiatives in the Bundestag.  The Federal Government contradicted that; it said the three  month limit that has existed thus far was even now often enough  hard to adhere to.    Since time immemorial, the Bavarian minister-president has  considered the Free Democratic Party [FDP] to be a "centralistic  party." And yet, he also sees its sister party on the same path.  He sees the weakening of the CDU in the laendern as the cause of  this. But Stoiber would like to avoid the situation that the  minister-presidents of the Social Democratic Party [SPD]--whose  names and number he revels in naming--could present themselves  as "lords keeper of the seal" of federalism and "present" the  CDU.</p>

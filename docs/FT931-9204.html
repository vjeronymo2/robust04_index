			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Inquiry urges citizens' referendums: Proposals for constitutional reform in France unveiled THE FRENCH public should have the right to call for citizens' referendums in conjunction with members of parliament, according to an official inquiry into the constitution. The inquiry, which was initiated by President Francois Mitterrand last November and headed by Mr Georges Vendel, an eminent French jurist, revealed its proposals for constitutional reform yesterday evening to the president at the Elysee palace in Paris. The president plans to present its finding to French parliament within the next fortnight. The proposals include requiring each new French government to secure a vote of confidence from parliament and replacing the present system whereby the National Assembly sits for two sessions each year with one session lasting from October to June. The panel also proposes that, given the length of the new session, members of parliament should not be allowed also to occupy other public positions such as city mayors or presidents of regional councils. Such changes are intended to clarify and strengthen the role of the French parliament. In the past, the parliament's power has been inhibited by the fragmented nature of French party politics and by the influence of the president, who is responsible for specific areas of policy including foreign affairs. However, the inquiry opted to maintain the present system whereby the president is elected for seven years with the possibility of re-election. There had been speculation that it might try to reduce the president to the same five-year term as the parliament. The conservative opposition, on course for a landslide victory in next month's legislative elections and a second term of 'cohabitation' with the Socialist president, refused to take part in the inquiry, arguing it was an attempt by President Mitterrand to distract attention from France's political problems.</p>

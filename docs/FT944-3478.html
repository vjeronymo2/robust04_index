			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Observer: Productive Audio on at last at Granada Television. The Independent Television Commission will this Thursday decide what action to take over repeated violations of the rules on 'undue prominence' of products on the Granada programme This Morning. Just in time for the meeting, Granada has announced a vacancy for a Compliance Adviser - someone whose job it will be to ensure that Granada's programmes comply with ITC rules. The new adviser's job will cover everything from Coronation Street and Prime Suspect to Cracker, World in Action and This Morning. Particularly This Morning. All fine and dandy. But it may be too late; Sir George Russell, the ITC chairman, has warned he is considering 'statutory action' - which could include a different sort of fine amounting to up to 3 per cent of Granada's qualifying income of around Pounds 150m.</p>

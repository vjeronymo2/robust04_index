			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (2): Big banks reluctant to pick up the tab - An official commission of inquiry is due to report later this year on bank rescues The Danish commercial and savings banks have usually been able to absorb banks which have run into serious trouble without much fuss and without losses to depositors or other creditors but the process has gradually become more difficult. After a long recession and pressure on their own earnings, the big banks are now reluctant to take over banks which are heading for bankruptcy because of incompetent management. As Mr Poul J. Svanholm, chairman of Den Danske Bank's supervisory board (he is chief executive of the Carlsberg Brewery group as well) told Danske's annual general meeting of shareholders in March: 'It is unacceptable for our shareholders if we have to pick up the tab for losses incurred by incompetent managements at other banks.' Danske is strong enough to pick other banks off the floor, but it already has a one third share of the domestic market. Apart from the question of losses to its shareholders, it does not feel that it should grow larger by acquisitions, said Mr Knud Sorensen, its chief executive. Unidanmark, is no more anxious to take over ailing banks than Danske, says Mr Thorleif Krarup, chief general manager. Since 1984, according to Mr Eigil Molgaard, director general of the state's finance industry supervisory authority, a total of 51 banks has ceased to exist. Most have been absorbed by other banks. Only four have gone bankrupt. In no case did depositors lose their money, but in the cases when banks went bankrupt, stock and bondholders did. There were two notable bank closures in 1993, and the events which led to the closures did nothing to improve the prestige of the banking world with the general public. The two banks were Himmerlandsbanken and Varde Bank. At Himmerlandsbanken, serving the north Jutland town of Hobro, most of the assets were taken over by Spar Nord, the north Jutland savings bank, while the rest of the bank went bankrupt. Varde Bank, based in the west Jutland port of Esbjerg, was the country's 10th ranking bank with assets of about DKr12bn. It is being wound up after most of its assets were taken over by Sydbank, the south Jutland savings bank. Both banks tried to strengthen their capital adequacy ratios by selling bonds to their local customers, many of whom did not realise that a bank bond carries a degree of risk which is not associated with mortgage or treasury bonds. The bondholders have lost their investments (so have the shareholders). The government reacted by ruling that in future banks may not lend money to their customers to buy bonds in the customer's own bank. As Sydbank took over more liabilities than assets from Varde Bank, Varde Bank had to pay Sydbank for the acquisitions. This required loans to Varde Bank by the Central Bank. The Central Bank loans to Varde Bank-in-liquidation total DKr4bn. In return for the Folketing's (Parliament's) approval of the rescue plan for Varde Bank, the government agreed to set up an official commission with a directive calling on it to set out models by which in future the banking sector itself will finance the liquidation of troubled banks. The commission is not expected to report until later this year. In the meantime, an important change has been made in the rules governing the banks' and savings banks' Depositor Guarantee Fund, which may help to smooth the way for bank liquidations. The fund, which is financed by the banks themselves. guarantees that no one with net deposits in a bank of under DKr250,000 will lose money if a bank goes bust. Hitherto, the fund has only been able to guarantee depositors against loss. The change in the fund's rules now enable the fund to issue guarantees or funds to provide for the ordered winding up of a bank, if this would be cheaper for the fund than having to meet claims from depositors after a bankruptcy. The banks feel strongly, as Mr Knud Sorensen, chairman of the Banker's Association, says, that whatever conclusion the official commission into bank rescue methods arrives at, it must avoid setting up a system with a built-in safety net. 'A bank must be able to go bankrupt. The risk must exist, and it must be clear to managements and supervisory boards, and they must be prepared to take the necessary steps to prevent their bank from collapsing. If the risk is removed, we shall see banks doing some stupid things, to the detriment of the banking sector as a whole and in the last resort to the detriment of the state budget,' he said. He would support a strengthening of the powers of the Supervisory Agency. He thinks, for example, that it may be necessary to give the supervisors powers to dismiss the management and supervisory board of a bank which is heading for bankruptcy and where the management is not doing enough to stop the rot. The debacle at Himmerlandsbanken had other consequences as well. Spar Nord was convinced (and so was the public when Spar Nord published a telefax which it received from the government) that it was promised a DKr173m tax-write off for taking over most of Himmerland's assets. When the terms of the deal slipped out, accountants pointed out that while a tax write-off is legal and correct when one company takes over another company in its entirety, a write-off, such as the one Spar Nord is claiming, is not legal when only part of the assets of a company are being acquired. The possibility that the government had committed a breach of the law of the land prompted a right-wing populist politician, Mrs Kirsten Jacobsen, of the Proess Party, to start a hue and cry against the tax minister, Mr Ole Stavad, a Social Democrat, who approved write-off. Mr Stavad's political life is still in the balance, but the government was able to postpone a show-down with the opposition. It set up a commission of inquiry into who said and knew what during the weekend in August when Spar Nord extracted the write-off from a government desperate to avoid a bankruptcy and all the complications for local business which this would have caused.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DANISH BANKS AND SAVINGS BANKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of banks            214     205     195     192     177     177 Branches of foreign banks    6       6       6       5       6   )                                                                  2,343 Branches                 3,159   3,059   2.884   2.570   2.461   ) Employment (full time   equivalents)          50,793  50,010  49,466  50,778  49,584  45,465  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT statistics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (8): Plans to 'wrap' it up - The chemicals industry must apply self-interest Few industrial sectors have an environmental image as appalling as that of the chemicals industry. In the UK, public approval for the chemicals sector has declined from more than 50 per cent at the start of the 1980s to less than 20 per cent last year. The declining popularity of its chemical companies has been mirrored by that of its counterparts around the globe. 'The chemical sector is rightfully cast among the problem industries,' concedes Mr Nicholas Reding, vice-chairman of Monsanto, the US chemicals company. The dangers of not improving the performance and image of the industry are serious. 'If the industry fails to clean up its act, it runs the risk of being legislated out of existence, argues Mr David Buzzelli, director responsible for the environment at Dow Chemical, the US group. 'Failure to improve both performance and image will be very expensive. Planning approvals for investment will be refused, making sites uneconomic. Plants will be driven further from employees and markets, further adding to costs. The chemicals industry could be legislated to the point of economic non-viability,' he says. Mr Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals manager for health, safety and the environment, agrees: 'The industry must improve its environmental performance not because it is being altruistic - although as corporate citizens we do care. It must improve out of self-interest.' The industry is being asked to spend ever-increasing amounts to meet environmentally-related legislation at a time when chemicals groups can least afford them. Many chemicals segments are struggling with over-capacity, poor demand growth, dire operating rates, declining margins and tumbling profits. Some sectors, such as the European petrochemicals industry, are bleeding red ink and require restructuring. Nevertheless, the chemicals industry has spent billions of dollars trying to clean up its act. Around the globe, the sector is trying polish its tarnished image and regain public trust through its programme of Responsible Care. This involves measuring emissions in a credible way, improving environmental performance and then communicating that performance, warts and all, to the public. The programme was initially created by the Canadian chemicals industry, was adopted by the US, migrated over the Atlantic to Europe, and has now proliferated worldwide. Convincing all companies of the value of Responsible Care has not been easy. But most now accept the need for the programme. The key to the process is measuring and then improving environmental performance. 'We don't want to put out propaganda. There is no point communicating, if you don't have anything of substance to communicate,' warns Mr Kasper Eigenmann, head of corporate unit safety and environment at Ciba, the Swiss group. Over the past decade, most companies have invested heavily in end of pipe solutions - treating waste after it has been created. Now they are turning their attention to waste minimisation. Some groups have adopted the concept as their mantra. Dow, for example, has a programme called Wrap - waste reduction always pays. The rhetoric behind Responsible Care is laudable, but implementing the programme is far from easy. It involves far more than just investing in technology and plant. Rather, it requires a change in an organisation's very culture. 'Responsible Care is not just a question of following a set of rules. It's like driving a car. There are a lot of regulations about how to drive, but we still have bad drivers. In the same way you can have companies that comply with regulations, but are not environmentally sound. An integral part of Responsible Care is a change in culture within the organisation,' says Mr Jacques Puechal, president of Cefic, the European Council of the Chemical Industry, and chief executive of Elf-Atochem. The impact of environmental measures can be dramatic. Take Leverkusen, the main manufacturing location for Bayer, the leading German industrial group. The giant chimneys stacked along the Rhine no longer spew smoke and are home to hawks and other bird-life. The Rhine is sufficiently full of fish to support a population of storks nearby during the summer. But to repair its damaged reputation, the chemicals industry must not only improve its environmental performance; it must also communicate that improvement in a credible manner. Much of this historically secretive industry is now trying to become more open in its communications with local communities and the public. The issue of credibility is the key. It depends foremost on the quality of environmental reporting. However, the sector is still divided on the issue. While some groups, such as BP Chemicals, have taken to publishing all their emissions, others, such as Ciba and Rhone-Poulenc of France, prefer to publish indices. Solvay of Belgium published its first set of figures this month. Others still refuse to publish group figures. At Monsanto, Mr Reding admits he had worries when the company started publishing its entire emission figures because they might provide ammunition for environmental groups. 'In fact, the external reaction has generally been pretty good, even if we have a long way to go to reduce our emissions,' he says. The chemicals industry has made enormous strides in its environmental performance and reporting. But it must make greater efforts in its communications if it is to change public attitudes to the sector. Britain's chemicals industry spent more than Pounds 1bn on the environment last year, according to figures released by the industry's trade body. That represents about 3 per cent of the industry's Pounds 29.9bn turnover. The Chemical Industries Association said the UK chemicals sector was the first British sector to publish its spending and environmental emissions figures. It was also the first national chemicals industry to publish such statistics, the association said. The association reported that between 1990 and 1992, environmental spending increased from Pounds 830m to Pounds 1.032bn.</p>

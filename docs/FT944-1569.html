			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: Swiss industrial output falls Swiss industrial production was 6 per cent ahead in the third quarter and new orders were 12 per cent higher than in the third quarter of 1993, according to the Federal Statistics Office. Industrial production, however, slipped 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from the second quarter. Export orders were 13 per cent higher year-on-year and 3.6 per cent ahead of the second quarter rate. A machinery industry spokesman said demand was strengthening, but export orders were being taken on very thin margins because of the strength of the Swiss franc. The improvement also reflected unavoidable restocking following the long recession, especially in the metal-working and watchmaking sectors. Domestic orders jumped as the January 1 implementation of a value added tax approached. Its effect will be to reduce the cost of capital goods. Domestic orders were up 10 per cent year-on-year, 1.8 per cent higher than in the second quarter. Sweden's State Audit Office revised downwards its estimate for the budget deficit and government borrowing requirement in the current budget year. The audit office said tax increases and spending cuts announced in November would help lower the budget deficit in the 1994-95, July-June fiscal year to SKr189bn (Pounds 16bn) from the SKr201bn it estimated in October. The borrowing requirement was now expected to total SKr227bn, compared with the previous estimate of SKr242bn. However, the new figures still show a budget deficit equivalent to more than 12 per cent of gross national product and are unlikely to ease the pressure on Mr Goran Persson, the finance minister, to produce a further round of deep spending cuts in his 1995-96 budget proposals due next month.</p>

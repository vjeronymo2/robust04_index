			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BUSINESS FLIERS SHUNNING EASTERN  </P> <P> Strikebound Eastern Airlines is having a tough time attracting business fliers,  although passenger levels on some routes are good, including those linking  Miami, the Caribbean and Latin America, a spokesman said today.  </P> <P> "In some of our markets, our loads are really quite good. Out of San Juan  (Puerto Rico) yesterday, our load factors were over 60%," said Eastern  spokesman Jim Ashlock.  </P> <P> Ashlock said traffic is also strong on flights linking Miami with 12 South  American cities, although he could offer no statistics.  </P> <P> "Where it is tough is in your business markets," he said. Those markets include  Eastern's Northeast shuttle, linking New York, Boston and Washington. The Wall  Street Journal reported today that some shuttle flights are carrying just 15  passengers since a bargain $12 fare was dropped.  </P></p>

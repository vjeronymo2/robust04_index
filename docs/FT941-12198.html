			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Campaign over bids for quangos Management consultants, merchant banks and service companies were last night urged by ministers to aid plans for privatising government agencies and quangos. Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, told business executives at a private seminar organised by the Cabinet Office that the government was keen to receive bids to buy agencies and quangos, or for running them under contract. The seminar was also attended by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury minister. Mr Waldegrave told the seminar the government would in future invite the private sector to participate in discussions over the setting up of agencies. The same would apply to reviews of the 92 agencies, which normally take place every three years. In both cases, the government must examine alternatives to agency status. The alternatives are abolition, privatisation, putting the agency under private management or contracting-out its work to the private sector. Similar arrangements will apply to almost 1,400 non-departmental public bodies, the quangos that deliver services on behalf of government. The computer operations of Itsa, the Department of Social Security's information technology agency, are to be offered to the private sector, the government said yesterday. Some 2,000 staff, mostly based in the north-west and north-east, will be affected. The successful contractor will win business worth some Pounds 100m a year.</p>

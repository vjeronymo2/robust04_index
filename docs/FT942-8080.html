			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Obituary: Goria, Italy's youngest prime minister, dies at 50 Mr Giovanni Goria, 50, who served briefly as post-war Italy's youngest prime minister and was the first major politician to stand trial in the country's massive corruption scandal, died at the weekend. Mr Goria, whose coalition governed from July 1987 to March 1988, died at his home in Asti in north-eastern Italy from a lung tumour which had deteriorated in the past month. The Christian Democratic party he joined in 1960 changed its name to the Popular Party earlier this year before the March elections in which they were punished for the corruption scandal which also touched Mr Goria. He studied economics, entered parliament in 1976 and often described himself as 'an accountant turned politician'. He became one of the youngest Christian Democrats to told key posts, serving as treasury minister in several coalitions. In a message to Mr Goria's widow, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi praised his 'generous, passionate and long political commitment'. Last February Mr Goria became the first major politician to stand trial on charges resulting from Italy's seemingly endless corruption investigations. He denied accusations that he agreed to a cut of a L7bn (Pounds 2.92m) bribe to be paid by companies given a contract to build a hospital in his home town. Work on the L230bn hospital was stopped by the scandal and the alleged kickback was never handed over to Mr Goria or his 10 co-defendants. The trial, which embittered Mr Goria as his health failed, is still in progress. Mr Goria was the surprise choice to form the country's 47th government since the second world war after the collapse of a coalition headed by Mr Bettino Craxi in 1987.</p>

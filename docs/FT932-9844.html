			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to seek Belize statement LABOUR is to demand a statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, about reports that Britain is poised to withdraw the garrison of up to 2,000 troops in Belize to help provide peace-keeping troops in the former Yugoslavia. Shadow defence minister Mr George Foulkes said such a move would be 'an outrageous thing to do in this volatile part of the world'. He said it could have been avoided 'if the government had taken our advice to suspend all the Army cuts that had been announced'.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: Options for encouraging lower payouts Sir, Barry Riley ('The long view', February 27/28) is of course correct when he points out that British companies pay out too much dividend and retain insufficient funds for reinvestment. The chancellor can mitigate this situation at no cost to the Treasury by increasing taxes on distributed profits and/or reducing taxes on profits retained for reinvestment.

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Exxon slowly recovers from shrinking pains / A look at the world's largest oil group as it emerges from restructuring Exxon prefers to do things without much fuss. So when Mr Lee Raymond took over from Mr Lawrence Rawl as chairman of the world's largest oil company in April the message was very much: business as usual. Mr Raymond, the company pointed out, had worked for six years as Mr Rawl's president, and the last thing he was going to do was shake Exxon up. It would be surprising if Mr Raymond did institute big changes since Exxon is emerging from a substantial restructuring caused by the squeeze in oil. What it wants is a period of calm to rediscover its roots. Under Mr Rawl, Exxon abandoned its skyscraper headquarters in Manhattan's Rockefeller Centre for a faceless office overlooking one of the many freeways leading out of Dallas in Texas, the home of US oil. It pulled out of the bold diversification ventures that were fashionable in the early 1980s. It even retreated from Los Angeles, the city of the car, because it could not make enough money there. The restructuring has been a painful process, not helped by the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster and the ensuing multi-billion dollar clean-up. Much of it was implemented by Mr Raymond, who was seen in some quarters of the US oil industry as Mr Rawl's hatchet man. Exxon's shrinking pains were brought on by the collapse of the oil price in the late 1980s. In common with all the leading US oil companies, Exxon had become bloated in a market where growth provided the escape route out of difficulty. This time, Exxon was forced to cut costs, and find ways of doing more with less. Over the past four years, it has got rid of refineries in Europe and North America, shut down over 4,000 service stations around the world, and cut its workforce from a 1989 peak of 104,000 people to 95,000. All told, Exxon's cutbacks have reduced costs by nearly Dollars 1bn a year and resulted in sell-offs of a similar order. The restructuring ate deep into profits last year, when net income fell 15 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. But this figure conceals a strong final quarter which analysts say shows that the strategy is beginning to work. In the first quarter of this year, earnings were flat. When Mr Raymond took over as chairman, he told shareholders: 'There are great risks associated with our industry. But the corollary is that there are also many rewards and opportunities for companies which are able to adapt to change.' The most obvious result of the restructuring is that Exxon is a smaller company. This year Exxon expects to produce 1.7m barrels of oil a day, refine 3.6m and sell 4.8m. Twenty years ago, Exxon was a 6m b/d company all the way through. But Exxon expects to make more money the new way, and it intends to keep up its annual investment programme of nearly Dollars 1bn a year, though the growth prospects are abroad rather than on its doorstep. The new Exxon will not try to compete across the breadth of the US market, but only where it is strong and can operate with low costs. Apart from Los Angeles, it has retreated from South Florida, and it plans to cover the whole of the US with just three large refineries and one small one. Its US exploration effort has been curtailed to three main areas, all offshore: Alaska, California and Mobile Bay. Exxon is still keen on the North Sea, particularly the Norwegian sector where it is the largest non-Norwegian acreage holder. It is especially interested in gas, believing that continental markets will develop stronger needs. The most exciting prospects, Exxon believes, lie in the Asia Pacific region where it is making the heaviest investments. The company is expanding its refinery in Thailand, participating in a large power generation project in Hong Kong, and is developing oil and gas prospects off Malaysia. There is a possibility to explore for oil onshore in China. One thing Exxon has turned its back on is diversification out of its traditional lines of business. This is partly because of costly lessons learnt from its forays into minerals and energy during the last decade, partly because it sees little change in the world's energy picture, with oil, gas and coal dominating. The biggest change between now and 2010, it believes, will be driven by rising electricity demand in the Third World. This means that natural gas will gain in importance as more gas-fired power stations are built. But it also means that coal will be able to hold its 25 per cent share of energy consumption over that period. The loser will be oil because of sluggish growth among its biggest consumers in the industrialised countries.</p>

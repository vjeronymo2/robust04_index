			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Germany steps up pressure over Eurofighter project GERMANY has stepped up its confrontation with Britain over the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft by threatening to withdraw from development work as early as next February. By serving formal notice, Bonn is increasing pressure on Britain, Italy and Spain to agree to abandoning the current aircraft and designing a lighter one instead. In June, the German government announced it would not take part in production of the current design EFA, but said it would continue with the development phase. About Pounds 3bn of the Pounds 8bn earmarked for development has still to be spent. Notification of the German move came in a letter from Gen Jorg Schonbohm, state secretary responsible for armaments, to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the British defence procurement minister. The letter formally initiates a dispute process foreseen under the 1988 memorandum of understanding covering EFA development. This process entails an initial three-month consultation period, after which a partner must give a further three months' notice if it wants to withdraw. Although the letter is dated September 16, Germany is backdating the start of this process to August 4, when the four defence ministers last met in Madrid. This was described as unacceptable by British officials, who yesterday confirmed receipt of the letter. The British officials said that if Germany abandoned the development programme - due to last until 1999 - it would be contractually obliged either to continue paying its share of expenditure or to carry the cost of transferring work to the other partners. The threat of withdrawal undermines British hopes of going ahead jointly with an aircraft substantially the same as the partners have been working on up to now. British Aerospace, which this week announced a first-half loss of Pounds 129m, is heavily dependent on obtaining EFA production work from 1996. It is estimated that programme would involve up to 40,000 British jobs. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has already put pressure on his Italian and Spanish counterparts to support a halt in development, with remaining funds being switched to a new project.

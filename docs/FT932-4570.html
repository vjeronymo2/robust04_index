			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heron banks reiterate stance BANKERS involved in the restructuring of Heron, the property and trading group, yesterday reiterated their view that the proposals offered creditors significantly more than they would achieve if the group was put into receivership. UBS, advisers to Heron, pointed to the report from Price Waterhouse, the accountants, which said 'the restructuring is significantly better than bankruptcy'. They were responding to a document circulated by Mr Gary Klesch, a bond dealer who claimed to represent 10 per cent of Heron's bondholders and said his firm owns Ecu1m of bonds. Mr Klesch urged holders to vote against the restructuring which is being presented to creditors at a series of meetings beginning on June 28. If the proposals are turned down Heron has said it would go into receivership. The complex nature of the group, which includes some 300 companies and has debts of Pounds 1.7bn, would make insolvency proceedings lengthy and costly. Bondholders are creditors of the parent company which owns only 5 per cent of the group's assets. They are relying on proceeds from asset sales by subsidiaries being passed up to the head office company. However, each of the companies in the group could have a different receiver or administrator. Some investors bought bonds when the were trading at about 25-28 per cent of face value, and have seen them fall to 15 per cent currently. It is thought that these investors are disgruntled and are threatening to vote against the restructuring in the hopes that Heron will improve terms to bondholders. However, another banker involved in the deal said 'there is an absolutely zero likelihood that they will improve the terms'.</p>

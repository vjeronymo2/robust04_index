			<p>SUMMARY                                  Elements within the Japanese Government appear to be engaged in a  search for a way to defuse trade tensions with the United States  by finding a qualified definition of trade performance targets  that is acceptable to both Tokyo and Washington.  Speedy  consensus on this issue is not likely, however, as recent  comments in favor of qualified targets by a powerful political  leader and a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) bureaucrat  involved in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations immediately met  with resistance from within the ruling coalition and the  bureaucracy, suggesting that Tokyo remains divided on the issue.                              END SUMMARY     Ichiro Ozawa, Secretary General of the Shinseito, one of the key  political parties in the ruling Japanese coalition government,  and Koichiro Matsuura, Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic  Affairs, recently floated what appeared to be trial balloons  suggesting the Japan should set some sort of voluntary, non-  binding targets to reduce its trade surplus and improve its  import performance.   According to the 23 February Mainichi  Shimbun and a 23 February Kyodo report, Ozawa, one of the most  influential politicians in Japan, told foreign correspondents on  22 February that Japan should set "endeavor targets for Japan's  effort to promote market opening" provided that the United States  agreed not to impose sanctions if Tokyo failed to meet the  targets.  The Japanese press reports have so far not provided  further details about the exact nature of the targets Ozawa has  in mind.     Matsuura, one of the key figures in the U.S.-Japan framework  negotiations, floated a proposal that may differ somewhat in  concept from Ozawa's, focusing on macroeconomic targets rather  than on criteria for measuring market opening in specific  sectors.  According to a 21 February Kyodo report, Matsuura  suggested in a 21 February speech that Tokyo should set a  voluntary target to cut the ratio of its global current account  surplus in fiscal 1994.  He reportedly stated that the surplus be  cut from the current 3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)  to 2.8 percent of gross domestic target--a figure he said would  help reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States.  However, according to Kyodo, Matsuura also said that Japan and  the United States were unlikely to reach an agreement on the  definition of "objective criteria" to measure foreign access to  Japanese markets, as stipulated in the July, 1993 agreement  establishing the framework talks.     Ozawa's and Matsuura's comments immediately provoked statements  of support and opposition from within both the ruling coalition  and the bureaucracy, suggesting there is as yet no consensus on  even a compromise position on the issue of targets within the  Japanese government.  According to a 23 February Kyodo report, an  unidentified "government source" indicated that there was some  support within Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government for  Ozawa's proposal, stating that it was "one idea" being floated to  defuse trade tensions with the United States.  The source  reportedly added that it was important that the targets be  "nonbinding."  Another unidentified source told the 22 February  Nihon Keizai Shimbun that there was some support within the  government for Matsuura's idea of setting a target for the  reduction of Japan's current account surplus, and that Japanese  delegates "may make a statement to that effect" at the conference  of G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors on 26  February "if asked."  Like Ozawa, the source also stressed that  this target must not be considered binding.  He stated that Tokyo  "cannot take full responsibility for failure to achieve the  goal," whose success, he argued, would be affected not only by  Tokyo's efforts but by U.S. and European economic policies.     While not commenting directly on Ozawa's or Matsuura's proposals,  other senior government leaders have suggested that they might  support strong measures to defuse tensions with the United  States.  Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi  Kumagai, a close associate of Ozawa, reportedly told a news  conference on 22 February that the impasse in the framework  negotiations "requires a political decision" and "cannot be left  to bureaucrats."  According to a 22 February Kyodo report, he  urged the government to take both microeconomic and macroeconomic  measures to resolve the bilateral trade dispute.  Tokyo may also  be hearing from Japanese diplomats in the United States that  Prime Minister Hosokawa's plan to draw up various measures to  relax regulations governing imports and to open Japanese markets  may not be acceptable to Washington.  A 22 February Kyodo report  quoted an unnamed Japanese diplomat in Washington stating that he  did not think the plan would be "sufficient."     Government Opposition     There also appears to remain considerable opposition to the  concept of setting any sort of targets, particularly within in  powerful Ministry of Finance (MOF), which has proven to have  considerable leverage with the coalition government in the past  on such issues as tax reform.  The 22 February Nihon Keizai  Shimbun quoted an unidentified government source as stating that  MOF is against Matsuura's idea of making a "public commitment" to  reduce Japan's current account surplus, arguing that Japan's  ability to follow through on such a commitment would be affected  by circumstances beyond its control, such as policies and  developments in other countries.  In addition, Manae Kubota,  director general of the Economic Planning Agency and a member of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan, the largest party in the  ruling coalition, has spoken out against Matsuura's proposal,  citing arguments similar to those made by MOF.  On 22 February,  she reportedly told a press conference that Japan could not  commit itself to reducing its current account surplus to a  certain percentage of GDP because the current account surplus was  affected by such factors as fluctuations in exchange rates and  developments in other countries.  According to a 22 February  Kyodo report, she stated that the Japanese Government would do  better to focus its efforts on its current plans to examine  specific measures it can take to further open its markets, such  as deregulation, trade and investment promotion, stricter  antitrust enforcement, and clearer procedures for government  procurement.     Initial press reporting on Ozawa's comments suggests that they,  too, have generated some opposition.  According to the 23  February Mainichi Shimbun, officials involved in the framework  negotiations--presumably senior bureaucrats--are opposed to  Ozawa's suggestion that nonbinding targets be set, arguing that  any targets will inevitably be viewed as a formal commitment.     Business Community Divisions     Like the government, the Japanese business community appears to  be divided over the issue of setting targets.  There appears to  be some support within the business community for Matsuura's idea  of setting macroeconomic targets, but less for setting targets  for imports by specific trade sectors.  On 21 February, Masaru  Hayami, chairman of one of Japan's leading business  organizations, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives  (Keizai Doyukai), reportedly stated that Japan should set a  target to reduce the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to  its GDP (Kyodo, 21 February).  Hayami has spoken out in favor of  such macroeconomic targets in the past.  In an article in the 17  October 1993 Mainichi Shimbun, he wrote that Japan should set a  "flexible goal" to reduce its current account surplus to around 2  percent of GDP in order to prevent Japan's economic relations  with the United States and other countries from deteriorating and  to keep the yen from appreciating further--a development that  would hurt Japan's export-oriented industries.  He added,  however, that he was "absolutely opposed" to setting targets for  specific sectors, describing this as "managed trade."     Other major business leaders also remain opposed to setting  targets for specific sectors.  On 23 February, Yutaka Kume,  chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturer's Association and  chairman of Nissan Motor Corporation reportedly stated that the  automobile industry was opposed to setting objective criteria to  measure the openness of Japanese markets.  According to a 23  February Kyodo report, Kume told a press conference that "some"  Japanese automobile companies would be willing to provide figures  for the amount of automobile parts they purchase each year, but  that they would not project how much they would buy in the  future, because such projections would be regarded by the United  States as a commitment.     Outlook     While Ozawa's and Matsuura's comments indicate that there is high  level support in Japan for finding a solution to the dispute with  the United States over objective criteria, the continued  opposition to the setting of targets in such influential sections  of the government as the Ministry of Finance suggests that it may  be some time before the Japanese Government reaches a consensus  on the issue.  Although Ozawa has been instrumental in resolving  some trade disputes with the United States in the past, his  support or the support of other influential political figures for  one side of particularly contentious issues has not necessarily  always translated into immediate action.  For example, Ozawa,  former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and former vice president  of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party Shin Kanemaru all came out  in favor of the opening of Japan's rice market in November 1991.  Even though Takeshita and Kanemaru were the most influential  figures in the ruling party at the time, it took two more years  for Japan to make a decision on opening its rice market.  Pressure for a resolution of tensions with the United States will  most likely force a more rapid decision on the target issue.  However, in the near term, Japan will probably attempt to defuse  tensions with an approach which is less controversial  domestically and easier to control, by focusing on Prime Minister  Hosokawa's current plans to draw up measures to relax regulations  affecting imports, clarify government procurement procedures, and  strengthen the enforcement of antitrust legislation.

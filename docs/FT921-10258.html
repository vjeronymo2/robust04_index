			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: Don Giovanni - Covent Garden A stark, ever-changing skyscape dominates this Stygian-black Seville. The inhabitants seem dwarfed and penned by the severity of the town enclosures; but one man walks free of all confining late-18th-century rigidities and proprieties. Greying at the temples, snake-like in sinuous control of movement, eyes flashing atop immaculate white ruff and black doublet, he stalks the streets with relaxed purpose when not poised motionless in corners, watching his victims (actual and potential) with insouciant gaze. He has a troop of heavies out of Goya at his command, money to burn, and a Sade-like determination to explore the farthest extremes of sensual pleasure: 'La liberta' for him means, among other things, freedom to imprison Zerlina for a bout of bondage sex (from which she is rescued only just in time) and eat dinner off a naked woman's body. When he dies, the sky glows blood-red - and then the town relaxes back into bourgeois security: the final homily is smugly offered over a cup of coffee. This, crudely summarised, is the dramatic rationale of the new Royal Opera Don Giovanni (sponsored by the Fondation Elf and the Jean Sainsbury Royal Opera House Fund). It is conducted by Bernard Haitink and produced by Johannes Schaaf in the effective and practical designs of Peter Pabst; and as one might reasonably guess after Schaaf's previous Mozart stagings in the house, it is contentious, at times fussily over-detailed - this producer has a mania for decking soliloquies with extraneous activity - and open to general reproach in its need to find plausible formulas in which to 'fix' a mighty and untameable masterpiece. But this time, it seems to me, the plusses definitely outweigh the minuses: the unfolding is swift and free of hitches, a notable Mozart cast and conductor have been engaged to vitalise its premisses into music-drama, and the title role is taken with thrilling magnetism. If this Don Giovanni grips the attention in spite of every objection against it, that is above all because of the tremendously powerful focal point at its centre. Thomas Allen, already a nonpareil Don Giovanni at Glyndebourne ten years ago (when Carol Vaness was also his Anna and Haitink his conductor), has waited a long time for a London production in which he might freely concentrate all his Mozartian gifts. The previous Covent Garden show (in which he twice appeared, in 1984 and 1988) was a poor vehicle; this new one marks his 20th anniversary on this stage, and does so fittingly and well, since it unfolds at least a cogent line of thought for this most remarkable of modern singer-actors to follow through. The pleasures of the performance start with the fact that Mr Allen, after a recent patch of unevenness, has rediscovered his best vocal form; the ability to make words and tone-colour part of a single dramatic impetus can again exert its mastery unimpeded. He is always wonderful to watch (and, as Schaaf introduces him as a prying eye on scenes from which Da Ponte intended him removed, this gift is a special blessing); he is witty, agile in his responses, unfailingly elegant in bearing, unfazed by passing crisis, and utterly repellent. No other Giovanni of my experience exposes the cruelty, violence and egotism at the character's core with such freedom and economy of means. At Glyndebourne Mr Allen formed part of Peter Hall's much more finely controlled production; here, his achievement in the role stands out the more strikingly. Of the cast only young Bryn Terfel, making a brilliant house debut as a lovably chunky, tough-tender Masetto, comes near to matching him in completeness of vocal and dramatic command; elsewhere, the hampering effect of production details has yet to be fully counteracted. But the quality of singing is extremely high; the performance can boast a feeling of voices carefully matched, that gives it a distinct patina, particularly in ensembles. The three sopranos all share a vibrancy of delivery, a sultry warmth of vocal texture: Miss Vaness's Anna magnificently majestic in full sail; the delightful Puerto-Rican soprano Marta Marquez (Zerlina) as full of zestful, sensual colour as a latter-day Conchita Supervia; and an unusually touching, distinctively passionate Elvira from Patricia Schumann. (Miss Schumann's vocal suitability is a stroke of fortune rather than of planning; she comes as a late replacement for the indisposed Karita Mattila.) Hans Peter Blochwitz's Ottavio, blander in timbre, is expertly delivered; a lovely 'Dalla sua pace' competes for our attention with a band of furniture-ing as the Commendatore. Only Leporello disappoints: for all Claudio Desderi's Italianate verbal relish and comic keenness, the voice simply fails to carry sufficient weight at Covent Garden. At Glyndebourne, Haitink proved himself a Don Giovanni conductor of shattering intensity and muscular force. On Wednesday's evidence the re-thinking process for the larger house is still a little way from completion. His tight (but never suffocating) grasp on Act 1 loosened after the interval; Act 2 felt like a succession of beautifully shaped discrete parts rather than a continuously flowing whole. In sum, then, this is neither a 'classic' account of the opera, nor an unarguably convincing re-thinking: but, with Mr Allen at its apex, it is full of interest and excitement all the same.</p>

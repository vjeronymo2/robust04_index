			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: NFC sees 1993 as year of growth NFC, the transport and logistics group, yesterday forecast growth in profits and earnings of between 6 per cent and 10 per cent this year, thanks to acquisitions and an expected upturn in the US. Mr Jack Mather, chief executive, said the company's 'best view' forecasts were for profits before tax of between Pounds 95m and Pounds 100m in the year to end-September, compared with an adjusted Pounds 89.9m last time. Mr Mather told several thousand NFC shareholders, gathered in Nottingham for the company's annual meeting, that first quarter profits before tax increased 10.2 per cent to Pounds 19.5m. The logistics division increased operating profits 48 per cent to Pounds 17.5m, helped by US growth, favourable exchange rates and lower restructuring costs. Neither the first quarter figures nor the profits forecast take into account NFC's sale of its waste management subsidiary in January. The company was sold for Pounds 113m to Wessex Waste Management, the joint venture between Waste Management International of the US and Wessex Water. First quarter turnover increased 12 per cent on continuing operations, while turnover including acquisitions and disposals increased 11 per cent to Pounds 557.4m. Interest costs increased sharply to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 2.3m), reflecting higher borrowings to finance acquisitions. Last year gearing increased from 29 per cent to 55 per cent. Earnings increased 8 per cent to 2.7p. A first interim dividend of 1.35p is being paid, a 3.8 per cent increase. Full year earnings are set to increase from 11.7p to between 13p and 13.7p, the company said. Mr Mather retires today and is replaced by Mr Peter Sherlock, who resigned from Bass last year.</p>

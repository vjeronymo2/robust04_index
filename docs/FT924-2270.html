			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / US backing for female condom FEMIDOM, the female condom invented in Britain, has been recommended for swift approval by an advisory committee of the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA obstetrics and gynaecology devices committee said the condom, known in the US as Reality, should prove significant in slowing the spread of the HIV virus that causes Aids. The committee had been concerned about the device's effectiveness but new evidence showed the HIV virus was unable to permeate the condom's sheath. The product is to be marketed in North America and Mexico by the US group Wisconsin Pharmacal.</p>

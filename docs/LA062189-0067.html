			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> UNESCO's governing body agreed on a compromise proposal allowing the general  membership to decide later this year whether to allow the Palestine Liberation  Organization to participate. The decision was made in Paris by the Executive  Committee of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The  proposal was watered down last week after representatives of seven Arab and  nonaligned nations agreed to dilute their demand for admitting Palestine to  UNESCO "as a member state." The final proposal makes no reference to Palestine  as a state. Instead it recommends that members "make Palestine participate as  closely as possible in the activities of UNESCO."  </P></p>

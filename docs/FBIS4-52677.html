			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- A Chinese minister in  Seoul said Wednesday that Beijing opposes possession of nuclear  weapons by both South and North Korea.    Minister Jie Qihua said in a speech to Buddhists here that  China supports solution of the North Korean nuclear problem  through inter-Korean dialogue and through talks between  Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    "China supports South and North Korea and North Korea and  the  IAEA solving the nuclear problem patiently within the framework  of bilateral dialogue," he said at a ceremony marking the second  anniversary of the inauguration of the Buddhist Council for  Peaceful Unification.    "China will fulfill its constructive role for peaceful  settlement of the nuclear problem," he said.    However, he declined to comment on those North Koreans who  have recently escaped from Siberian logging camps.    "It is difficult for me to comment on the issue because it  is  related to the difficult situation of the North Korean  authorities."    Meanwhile, he emphasized that South Korea and China should  further strengthen bilateral relations as partners in the  Asia-Pacific era in the 21st century.    "The two nations have rapidly developed their bilateral  relations since they formed diplomatic ties on Aug. 24, 1992.  But they still have to strengthen bilateral cooperation in many  fields, including the economy," he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Karapetyan report: "Vladimir Shumeyko Advocated </F> Increased Spending on Army. Conference with Leaders of Organs  of Representative Power of Components of Russian Federation Held  in Federation Council"]    [Text] The main areas of cooperation between the upper  chamber of the Federal Assembly and the components of the  Russian Federation in such areas as economic reform, the  strengthening of federalism, and the elaboration of  nationalities policy and a new regional strategy were discussed  at the conference.    Participating in the conference were Vladimir Shumeyko, Ivan  Rybkin, leaders of committees and commissions of the Federation  Council and the State Duma, vice premiers of the government,  ministers, representatives of the president's staff and the  Central Electoral Commission, leaders of all-Russian and  interregional unions and associations, and scientists.  Following the discussion and the adoption of the final  document, the Coordinating Council for Cooperation Between the  Chambers of the Federal Assembly and Organs of Representative  Power of the Components of the Russian Federation was elected.    Vladimir Shumeyko pointed out at the conference that the  process of political stabilization is growing in Russia and is  based on the Constitution, the strengthening of the organs of  representative power, and the Treaty on Civil Peace and Accord  signed by the country's main political forces. At the same  time, Shumeyko emphasized, two extremes can be ruinous to  Russia: Both overestimation of the significance of the regions'  autonomy and underestimation of the role of the center. "The  actual political decision that can be made today," the chairman  of the Federation Council emphasized, "is the adoption of the  budget." It is his firm conviction that the budget must  determine policy in the state. Vladimir Shumeyko once again  advocated increasing expenditure on the Army and the  military-industrial complex.</p>

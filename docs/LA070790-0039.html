			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHINING DODGERS NOT WINNING OVER FANS  </P> <P> Let's be honest. Fernando's no-hitter notwithstanding, the Dodgers are a bore.  </P> <P> There's more enthusiasm on Death Row than there is on the Dodger bench. They  can't hit, field or run, but they lead the league in yawns. Fred Claire has put  together a collection of strangers, and Tom Lasorda is too busy selling things  on TV to notice. Peter O'Malley had better do something pretty soon, or Chavez  Ravine will be returned to the goats.  </P> <P> EDWARD J. MONTAGNE  </P> <P> Agoura Hills  </P></p>

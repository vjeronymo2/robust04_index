			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. CANCELS 1990 AIR SHOW AT BROWN FIELD AFTER AUDIT  </P> <P> The City Council has canceled the 1990 Air/Space America show at Brown Field,  citing an auditor's prediction that its organizers would owe creditors nearly  $5 million even if they staged a successful show next year, city officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Councilman Bruce Henderson announced the unanimous decision, reached in closed  session Tuesday, during a Wednesday meeting of the council's Public Facilities  and Recreation Committee.  </P> <P> Besides revoking Air/Space America's permit to use any city-owned airstrip, the  council voted to withdraw the $300,000 in hotel tax funds that it was prepared  to spend on the show, Henderson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Cities Considered  </P> <P> Bill Walsh, president of Air/Space America, expressed disappointment at the  decision but predicted he will reach agreement within 45 days to stage the show  in Palmdale, Calif., or Ft. Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed and somewhat shocked by the manner and time in which it  occurred," Walsh said. "We've been working with the city . . . trying to please  them and make them happy, because it would obviously be easier to put that '90  show on in San Diego."  </P> <P> But Henderson made it clear that the council has lost confidence in Air/Space  America's ability to operate a successful show in 1990. According to two  separate audits, organizers of the aerial extravaganza and trade show now owe  creditors more than $4 million. They have yet to pay for an estimated $100,000  in damage to Brown Field from the May, 1988, show or hand over a $100,000 rent  payment owed the city.  </P> <P> Organized by former San Diego Congressman Bob Wilson and by Walsh, a retired  rear admiral, Air/Space America was envisioned as a biennial event designed to  be America's answer to the Paris air show. The idea attracted support from  well-known figures such as Sen. Barry Goldwater and former astronaut Wally  Schirra.  </P> <P> About 200,000 people attended the first Air/Space America show, in 1988, which  included trade booths, paratroop jumps, aerial acrobatics, $985 rides on the  supersonic jet Concorde and tours of the Soviet Union's AH-124 transport, the  world's biggest aircraft. The attendance was about half what Walsh had  predicted.  </P> <P> "It was just a situation where we didn't have confidence in their business  management, that we would be throwing good money after bad," said Councilman  Bob Filner, whose district includes Brown Field.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concern About Other Shows  </P> <P> Henderson said the council also became concerned that Air/Space America might  stage subsequent shows in other cities, causing the council to wonder whether  its investment would pay off.  </P> <P> Frank Panarisi, director of consulting services for the auditing firm Deloitte,  Haskins &amp; Sells, which was hired by the city, projected that the 1990 air  show would lose about $600,000, a figure that would be added to Air/Space  America's current $4.2-million debt.  </P> <P> "Our projections show that they would not quite break even for the 1990 show,  and they would not even be able to pay for the debt" from the 1988 show,  Panarisi said.  </P> <P> Walsh disputed both the calculation of the current debt and the predictions for  1990, saying his organization owes about $2.9 million to more than 2 dozen  creditors but would pay that off and end the 1990 show about $400,000 in the  black.  </P> <P> A city audit of Air/Space America's finances as of Sept. 30 shows that the  group is $4.45 million in debt, which includes more than $1 million owed to  Evergreen Chemical Products for applying a polymer to Brown Field soil that was  designed to take the place of more expensive asphalt. Walsh and city officials  claim the polymer was a complete failure, and Walsh is refusing to pay the  company.  </P> <P> At least eight firms have sued Air/Space America in an attempt to recoup  payments, and nine have asked the city to pay them a total of $1.4 million in  debts.  </P> <P> A major part of the financial snafu stems from a 1987 City Council decision to  waive a requirement that Air/Space America obtain a construction bond that  normally would be used to pay off creditors in the event of financial problems.  According to Filner, who was not on the council at the time, city staff members  warned the council about the possibility of financial problems in several  reports before the decision.  </P> <P> Several of the contractors attended Wednesday's council committee meeting and  huddled privately with city lawyers afterward in the hope of determining their  chances of recouping some money.  </P> <P> "We feel that Air/Space America, the city and the contractors are all partners  in this thing, whether we want to be or not," said Bob Spellman, managing  partner of Rock Paving and Grading, which claims it is owed more than $49,000.  </P> <P> "They've gotten some debts. The only way those debts can be paid is if they  have another show, so far as I know," Spellman said.  </P> <P> Nearly nine months after the May air show, Brown Field operators are still  repairing damage caused by the event, which Mike Tussey, airport operation  manager, estimated will total $100,000.  </P> <P> More than $8,000 was spent to repair a hole in the main runway that was created  when the giant Soviet transport made a quick turn and came to a halt, Tussey  said. Replacing the main road to the control tower, necessitated by the failure  of the polymer substance to harden into a usable surface, cost nearly $15,000.  </P> <P> Repairing a similar problem involving 41,000 square feet of space leased by the  Experimental Aircraft Assn. will cost $18,000. And repairs to 70 lights torn  off one of the taxiways will cost $6,000, Tussey said.  </P> <P> Although Walsh said that Air/Space America hoped to receive a rent credit for  installing a $550,000 underground drainage system, Filner claimed that the  system actually increases the chances of flooding.  </P> <P> "Everything they did, in fact, screwed up things more," he said.  </P> <P> Besides its financial and permit woes, Air/Space America now faces possible  competition from a Canadian group that hopes to stage an international air show  near Vancouver in May.  </P> <P> The show, which has secured more than $3 million from the Canadian and British  Columbian governments, is billed as "North America's Premier Aerospace Trade  Show and Symposium."  </P> <P> "Airshow Canada is funded by the government to pay for things like promotion  and marketing," according to show spokesman Mark Pond. "That's the key  difference between us and San Diego.  </P> <P> "Funds exist for this show, and there won't be checks bounced. I heard very  uncomplimentary things about the San Diego Air Show."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Greg Johnson contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> AZUSA PACIFIC GRIDDERS AIM AT AN OFFICIAL FOUR WINS IN A ROW  </P> <P> The Azusa Pacific University football team, which has won three games in a row,  will try to continue its winning ways when it visits Menlo for a nonconference  game at 1:30 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Azusa finishes the season with three road games, including Menlo. The Cougars  play Cal Lutheran and UC Santa Barbara in the following two games.  </P> <P> The Cougars will face a Menlo squad that has a 2-4 record. The Oaks have lost  four games in a row, including a 35-0 setback to St. Mary's last week.  </P> <P> Azusa, 3-2, has actually won five games in a row although only three count as  official wins by the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics. The Cougars  had to forfeit a game against Occidental because of an ineligible player. Azusa  also defeated the Cal Poly Pomona club team, although victories over club teams  are not recognized by the NAIA.  </P> <P> Still, the Cougars have appeared strong in wins over Redlands, La Verne and  Whittier. The team defeated Whittier, 31-6, last week behind a strong  second-half passing effort from quarterback Brian Hunt. He completed eight of  14 passes for 176 yards and two touchdowns, both to wide receiver Keven  Griffin.  </P> <P> Azusa Pacific has been led on defense by a strong linebacker corps that  includes Jeff Gustin and Phil Heppner, the team's leading tacklers.  </P> <P> In other games matching four-year colleges Saturday, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps  plays host to Redlands and La Verne visits Pomona-Pitzer in 1:30 p.m. games and  Occidental visits Whittier at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The Azusa Pacific men's basketball team has accepted an invitation to represent  the United States in the annual Cup of the Americas tournament on Nov. 6-11 in  Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> The Cougars, a member of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics, will  be joined by five teams from Puerto Rico and squads from Brazil and Belgium.  </P> <P> "We think this is a tremendous opportunity to represent the NAIA and our  nation," Azusa Pacific Coach Terry Layton said. "It's a rare opportunity for  our kids."  </P> <P> Elon of North Carolina, another NAIA team, won the tournament last year.  </P> <P> Layton said the Cougars were selected because of his experience as an  international coach, including a season in the Puerto Rican professional  league, and because most NAIA teams in the East start their season early,  making the tournament difficult to attend.  </P> <P> The Cal Poly Pomona women's soccer team will have a pair of difficult  assignments when it faces Cal State Dominguez Hills and UC Irvine today and  Saturday.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who have struggled to a 5-9-2 record as an NCAA Division II  independent, will play host to Dominguez Hills at 7 tonight and visit Irvine at  noon Saturday.  </P> <P> Pomona will face a Dominguez Hills squad that entered the week with a 15-2  record and is ranked No. 2 in Division II. The Toros have an explosive offense  led by senior forward Kristi White.  </P> <P> Irvine has also struggled with a 5-9-3 record but the Anteaters are a Division  I team and have played a difficult schedule.  </P> <P> Pomona has been led offensively by midfielder Melissa Rogers and forward Amy  Johnson.  </P></p>

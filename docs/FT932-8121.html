			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: The Makropoulos Case - Opera David Pountney's staging of The Makropoulos Case seems to have been in the repertory of one or other of the British companies ever since it was first seen in Glasgow 12 years ago. It has come back to Scottish Opera now to end the company's season. Sally May has directed the revival, John Mauceri conducts his last show as music director. A production that was for so long dominated by Josephine Barstow's Emilia Marty now has Kathryn Harries in the central role, and it is she who finally makes the evening a truly memorable one. Certainly the early indications were not auspicious. There is something rather tired-looking now about Maria Bjornson's designs, which conceptually seem already to have been consigned to a departed age of opera production, though whether that feeling is fuelled by nostalgia or hard-headed realism is difficult to determine. In the opening scenes too the show itself seemed rather over extended, as if this were one revival too far; it took a while for the direction to establish itself, for the playing to cohere and for what turned out eventually to be some very well observed characterisations to make themselves felt. Most surprising was Mauceri's lack of assertiveness in the first act. The orchestral playing sounded tentative, only hanging on to Janacek's exposed lines by the skin of their teeth. It was not until the conductor began to relish the tendrils of Straussian lyricism which buoy up the confrontation between Emilia and Prus at the climax of the second act that his part in the performance began to matter; from there to the end of the opera he provided a surging, vivid orchestral canvas. Ms Harries too only gradually took charge. She certainly needed to pace herself for the challenge of the last act, but nevertheless seemed rather reticent through much of the first, often masked by the orchestra (which, a sign of insecurity perhaps, was consistently too loud) and swallowing her words. Thereafter she was transformed, wonderfully vivid in the sharpfire exchanges of the second, mingling flashes of fierce temper with glimmers of the vulnerability that would make the final scene deeply affecting. Instead of the Barstow hauteur, Harries offers a feckless disregard and an absolute lack of moral centre. That is tempered by a sweetly turned sense of comedy - wonderful drunk acting] - which seems a new element in her stage persona. All the while the vocal lines gradually gain steadily in power and authority, the tone colour deliciously varied, and the cruel extremes of the last act were all handsomely negotiated. The gallery assembled around this fascinating portrayal had their own individual strengths. Nigel Robson's bumbling Gregor suffered most from the over strenuous orchestral playing early on but gradually established the character in rich detail, Donald Maxwell's Prus was authoritatively grasping and manipulative from the start, with exemplary diction. Nigel Douglas contributed a typical Hauk-Sendorf, Stephen Bennett a convincingly uptight Kolenaty; there was a nicely turned Dresser from Margaret Izatt, a usefully gormless Janek from Iain Paton. Any Makropoulos production, though, finally stands or falls by the strength of its Emilia Marty, and in this case there is no doubt of its success. Theatre Royal, Glasgow; further performances May 22, 25, 27; then on tour to Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Newcastle</p>

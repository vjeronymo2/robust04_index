Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that secret  contacts  have been made at the highest level between Tunisia and Algeria  to guarantee President Kafi's security and stability after the  end of the Higher State Council's term.    The president's wife had gone to Switzerland to look for a  place for them to live in, but the president prefers to live in  an Arab country.    A source close to the National Dialogue Commission told  AL-HAYAH that the commission yesterday proposed to President  Kafi to issue an amnesty for the "Salvation Front leaders" to  enable to them to participate in the "National Seminar"  scheduled for 25 and 26 January. It is not ruled out that the  president may issue an amnesty including Abassi Madani, leader  of the Islamic Salvation Front. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INSTALLATION GALLERY, SPONSOR OF ARTWALK, SUSPENDS SHOWINGS  </P> <P> Faced with mounting debts, a downtown alternative gallery for the avant-garde  has laid off its two-member staff, accepted its director's resignation and  suspended its exhibition schedule.  </P> <P> Saying that the nonprofit Installation Gallery at 930 E Street is at a "crucial  juncture" and may be hindered by "my sometimes outspoken personality," former  director Dan Wasil tendered his resignation about 10 days ago, he said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I laid off the staff on May 1," Wasil said. "I let it be known during Artwalk  (April 22-23) that, unless we found ways of coming up with the money, there was  no way I could continue."  </P> <P> Wasil also canceled a May-June group exhibit of artists from San Diego and Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> The gallery is $12,000 in debt, said Beverly Schroeder, a member of  Installation's board of directors. Most of the debt is unpaid rent and staff  salaries, she said.  </P> <P> "We are not throwing in the towel," Schroeder said. "It just got to the point  where he (Wasil) couldn't keep working without getting paid. The board is  meeting, like, three times a week. We have a group on the board that is  functioning as an operating entity." The group is looking at several  fund-raising possibilities, she said.  </P> <P> Founded nine years ago by artist Gary Ghirardi and his wife, Carol Roskos,  Installation has served as a forum for artists "to do some new thinking,"  Schroeder said. In recent years the gallery has expanded from three-dimensional  room installations of artworks to include original videos and performances.  </P> <P> Installation is best known as the sponsor of the annual downtown Artwalk each  spring, in which the public is invited to visit artists' studios and galleries.  This year's Artwalk drew 35,000 people, according to police estimates. However,  the event wound up costing Installation $3,500.  </P> <P> Schroeder denied recent allegations made by several artists that Installation  had used a grant from the city earmarked for Artwalk for its ongoing operations  and to pay its debts.  </P> <P> "No," Schroeder said. "We have a separate bank account. Everything is separate  for Artwalk."  </P> <P> Although Artwalk is a popular event, some Installation events, such as two  recent exhibits critical of Father Junipero Serra and of businesses, have  generated controversy.  </P> <P> "It's hard to get corporate funding when you're showing things like that,"  Schroeder said. "But I think that these kinds of shows need to be shown.  Usually there is some truth in them.  </P> <P> "We showcase experimental kinds of works. They're not commercial kinds of  works. It gives young artists a chance to show experimental things."  </P> <P> Schroeder said Installation's board of directors is still planning to  co-sponsor a local exhibit of the "Rosenberg Era Art Project," possibly in the  fall, with the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art.  </P> <P> "That's a real strong show that needs to come to San Diego and needs to be  seen," Schroeder said.  </P></p>

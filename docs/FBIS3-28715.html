			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop the Serbs -- now"] </F>   [Text] The time for action on Bosnia was when the problem  erupted, two years ago. Nothing was done, for reasons ranging  from desire to keep out of others' wars, to the fear of losing  them, to disagreement between the members of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO). When the Serbs of rump Yugoslavia  and the Croats began carrying out ethnic cleansing and genocide  with impunity, the United Nations decided that it would  intervene to keep the peace. That word was a misnomer, for  there was no peace to keep. Paralysed by an arms embargo that  removed their ability to defend themselves, the Bosnian Muslims  became prey to the barbarities of the Bosnian Serbs. These  Serbs were abetted by their brothers in Belgrade who, the same  embargo notwithstanding, enjoyed vast superiority in arms  because the hardware of the erstwhile Yugoslav military had come  to their possession. The massacre of Bosnians continued,  whether through outright shelling or the more insidious sniper  fire and a siege that kept humanitarian supplies from reaching  starving and wounded populations. In the meanwhile, out-of-work  European politicians became famous by flying in and out of  Sarajevo and Belgrade, trying to achieve a settlement which  they, more than anyone else, knew existed only in the  imagination. The reason: the Serbs knew that they did not have  to make peace, for they were simply doing fine in an unequal  war. As the world agonised and political leaders looked the  other way, Bosnians died slowly and painfully.    Then, last weekend, the shocking death of 68 people in a  mortar attack in Sarajevo reminded NATO that it has some  responsibility for ensuring that the Balkans do not slip  irreversibly out of the civilised world. Foreign Ministers of  the European Union (EU) met in Brussels on Monday to issue the  toughest warning heard in recent months to those strangling  Sarajevo. After the usual disagreements among themselevs, they  asked that NATO meet to see how besieged Sarajevo could be  relieved using all necessary means, including air strikes. But  even now it is not certain that those necessary means will be  used.    True, air power is not an end in itself. Not only will its  use endanger the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, will air  strikes not supported by ground action lead to a Serb  withdrawal? Who will provide the ground troops? Are NATO  governments ready to face the political cost of sustaining  casualties in what may turn out to be a protracted war? In  terms of realpolitik, is it worth all the effort as long as the  Bosnian massacre does not grow in a larger European problem?  That apart, what is the point of undertaking military  intervention in the absence of a larger, sustainable peace plan  whose enforcement must be the objective of the military action?  Is there such a peace plan?    These are legitimate questions, but they can also become  dishonest excuses for doing nothing -- which is exactly how they  look today. The Serbs need to be punished for what they are  doing, and prevented from doing what they will do if they are  not stopped. The demilitarisation of Sarajevo enforced through  limited air strikes, will remind them that they can be losers in  an equal war. Strategicaly, the strikes will hold the situation  while increased diplomatic pressure is brought to bear on the  Serbs for a political solution. Concurrently, a lifting of the  arms embargo on Bosnia will enable it to balance the military  scales for the same purpose: to make the Serbs realise that they  have to talk real peace. To date, the U.S. has shown more than  any other NATO member that the plight of the Bosnians means  anything to the conscience of the civilised world. In the name  of that civilisation, in the name of the right of a people to  resist genocide, in the name of innocent Bosnians who are still  alive, it is the U.S. which needs to lead the way to what needs  to be done at once: Stop the Serbs.</p>

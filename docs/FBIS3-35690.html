			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview with a RIA correspondent, Konstantin  Borovoy, co-chairman of the Economic Freedom Party, has  expressed concern over Russia's possible deviation from the  reform course.    In his opinion, some time in the near future opponents to  the  market in the government will start introducing all possible  restrictions in the economy. Therefore, according to Borovoy,  empty shelves, lines, and distribution coupons might very soon  appear.    Also, he does not rule out that a rigid dollar exchange rate  might be introduced. According to Borovoy, this will happen  when the dollar rate exceeds 2,500 rubles.    Such economic decisions might be followed by anti-democratic  moves.</p>

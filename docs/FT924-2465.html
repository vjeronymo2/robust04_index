			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Boeing works on new engine mounts for 737 BOEING is working on an improved design for the engine mounts of its older 737 twin-engine airliners, after a Delta Air Lines 737 lost an engine after take-off at Dallas-Fort Worth earlier this year. The US manufacturer yesterday confirmed it was preparing a service bulletin to airline customers on a newly designed engine aft-mount secondary support system for its 737-200 and 737-100 airliners. Boeing has been working in close consultation with Delta, the US National Transportation Safety Board and the US Federal Aviation Administration on the new design for the engine mounts on the 1,040 Boeing 737-200s and 27 Boeing 737-100s still in service. British Airways is a large Boeing 737-200 operator, with 43 aircraft in its fleet, the UK carrier said yesterday. Although the engine mountings are different on the Boeing 737, these parts have also been identified by investigators as the probable cause of the crash of an El Al Boeing 747 cargo jumbo jet last October in Amsterdam and a similar incident involving a Boeing 747 cargo jet in Taiwan a year ago. Boeing is now redesigning for the second time the fuse pins used in Boeing 747 mounts and recently completed a programme to improve engine mountings on the Boeing 757 twin-engine airliner. The US manufacturer said yesterday it was not yet in a position to discuss any eventual retrofit of 737 engine mounts, their schedule and cost. Boeing said there had only been three occasions, including the Delta incident this year, of when an engine separated from a 737 in flight, in over 50m flight hours in 25 years of service.</p>

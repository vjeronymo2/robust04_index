			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Right that aspirations of Russia not endorsed Sir, The position you have taken with regard to Russia's self-proclaimed role as 'peace-keeper' within the republics of the former Soviet Union in your editorial, 'Russia and its neighbours' (November 22), is commendable to we who live directly within Russia's sphere of influence. While there is little question that Ukraine and Russia are culturally, linguistically and economically interrelated and that continuing such ties will be beneficial to both nations, it is also crucial that the international community recognises the existence of Russian proclivities to undermine stability in the region. These proclivities are the result of Russia's attempt to regain its former superpower status and are evidenced by many of its recent policy statements, including that which your editorial examines. It is comforting to know that some of Russia's actions which attempt to shroud its inclination to dominate the affairs of sovereign nations are recognised as such by the international community and are appropriately not endorsed.

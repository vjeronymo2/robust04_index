			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad by Ahmad </F> 'Abd-al-Majid in Baghdad; date not given]    [Text] ['Abd-al-Majid] What is your assessment of the OPEC  Geneva conference?    [Jawad] At a meeting convened in Geneva last month, the  price-monitoring ministerial committee of OPEC decided to  maintain the existing production ceiling of 24.52 million  barrels per day [BPD] until the end of the year. The agreement,  which Iraq did not sign, led to a deterioration in oil prices on  world markets, given that the ceiling far outstrips demand for  OPEC oil. That applies particularly to the second quarter of  this year, when demand is expected to fall behind the ceiling by  1 to 2 million BPD.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Why did Saudi Arabia balk at cutting its  output quota?    [Jawad] Saudi Arabia has benefited the most from the cuttoff  of Iraqi oil from world markets. In the wake of the sanctions,  Saudi Arabia's production jumped from 5.38 million PBD -- the  share set for it by the July, 1990 agreement -- to over 8  million BPD early this year. Although this substantial increase  in Saudi Arabia's output was accompanied by a real drop in  prices, notably in late 1993 and early 1994, the Saudis pressed  ahead with these high production levels, without reference to  the interests of other OPEC members.    The argument advanced by Saudi Arabia was that in the event  OPEC cut production to boost prices, non-OPEC producers would  increase theirs and thus neutralize the intended effect of the  OPEC action. Incidentally, Iraq has called on all producers,  both within and outside of OPEC, to pursue production policies  that should raise their income by balancing output and prices in  the international market. Many producers from outside OPEC have  shown a willingness to cooperate in restoring balance to the  market. However, for this to happen such major producers like  Saudi Arabia must act responsibly.    ['Abd-al-Majid] With the current downtrend in oil prices on  the world market, how will Iraq act if the oil embargo is lifted?    [Jawad] The downward trend in oil prices is projected to  persist for the next five months, when they will rally again.    We think that lifting the oil embargo on Iraq will  contribute  to a boost in prices, since then OPEC will call an extraordinary  session and adjust its overall production. Iraq's return to the  oil market will remove a negative factor that has been having an  impact on the oil prices. Iraq will also play an influential  and responsible role in formulating OPEC's production policies  so as to advance the interests of all interested parties and  stabilize prices.    ['Abd-al-Majid] When will the Iraqi contract with the  French companies become effective?    [Jawad] Iraq seeks to expand and diversify its relations  with  many foreign companies, including French companies. The latest  talks with the French side and their results are aimed at having  good relations with oil companies based on the exchange of  interests between all parties. As for relations with the French  companies, Iraq hopes that these companies will take the  necessary steps and prepare for the lifting of the oil embargo  as soon as possible.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Will Jordan's share of crude oil be  increased, or will it continue at the same rates?    [Jawad] As you know, Iraq has warm fraternal relations with  Jordan. The present rates of oil supplies to Jordan depend on  the quantities required by Jordan and allowed by the United  Nations. The question of maintaining or increasing the present  rates depends on coordination between the two sides and the  relevant UN resolutions.    ['Abd-al-Majid] How true is the report about constructing an  Iraqi oil pipeline to the Port of al-'Aqabah?    [Jawad] Iraq seeks to increase and diversify its oil  exporting terminals. The idea of an Iraqi oil pipeline to  al-'Aqabah is aimed at increasing the flexibility of Iraqi oil  exportation. Several feasibility studies should first be made,  taking into consideration political developments and the  required guarantees for the flow of Iraqi oil from the Port of  al-'Aqabah.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Which are the U.S. companies that negotiated  with Iraq on investing new oil fields?    [Jawad] Several U.S. companies negotiated with Iraq on  investing new oil fields, as did companies from other countries.  These negotiations aim to realize the joint interests of all  parties, also they are in their initial stages, so we cannot  predict their outcome.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Twenty-two Congress members asked the U.S.  President to send equipment to extract oil from the northern  region of Iraq. What is your comment?    [Jawad] The attempts to divide Iraq's unity are pitiful and  are destined to failure. What some agent quarters and Zionism  are trying to do is to split the national unity. These attempts  do not aim to realize the interests of the Iraqi people in the  northern region. Iraq does not need assistance from suspicious  quarters under the pretext of assisting its sons. Iraq is rich  with oil, and can provide all its areas with their oil needs.    ['Abd-al-Majid] What was the most prominent achievement in  the oil sector despite the circumstances of siege and oil  embargo?    [Jawad] There have been several achievements in the area of  oil during the siege, but reconstructing the oil sector after  the wholesale destruction it suffered was the most prominent  achievement. In order to know the importance of this  achievement, we recall that the oil sector suffered brutal  attacks against all its facilities, and that 180 main sites were  attacked by missiles and air raids. Two thousand five hundred  air raids were launched against these sites, and 150,000 bombs  were fired at them. This reduced the refining capacity to only  3 percent, and the total costs of damage reached $6 billion,  according to UN estimates.    Since the first day of the cease-fire, the people in the  oil sector exerted exceptional efforts and used innovative means  to rebuild the destroyed facilities, thus the refineries once  again became operational. As for the field of oil extraction,  the oil facilities were badly damaged and nonoperational.  During the rebuilding stage, oil experts managed to rebuild  these facilities and restored them to a better status than prior  to the aggression. Moreover, the pumping stations, pipelines,  and oil tanks were rebuilt.    Many big and important accomplishments could be added to the  marvelous rebuilding work. These accomplishments were realized  through personal efforts--accomplishments that had in the past  been confined to Western expertise. New potentials were added  in the oil refining sector with a dependence on potentials and  expertise that in the past were not sufficiently invested. The  productive efficiency of our oil facilities is now better than  it was before the aggression. Cadres were introduced to other  fields of work other than the oil sector, including the  industrial and agricultural sectors as well as the sugar plant,  al-Najaf tire factory, and other industrial plants. We also  actively participated in completing the leader's river, al-'Izz  River, Taj al-Ma'arik [Crown of Battles] River, and Umm  al-Ma'arik [Mother of Battles] River. Work is continuing on a  project to irrigate al-Jazirah, and the sanitation projects in  al-Ramadi and al-Fallujah. We also made contributions to  rebuilding bridges such as al-Qurnah tubular bridge, the bridge  at al-Majidiyah, the suspension bridge, and leader Saddam's  double-deck bridge. Moreover, our cadres were able to find many  alternatives to industrial parts that used to be imported from  outside.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Is there any inclination to export gas to  Arab countries, including Jordan, in particular, after the  discovery of gas reserves in the Western desert?    [Jawad] Iraq sought to develop all its hydrocarbon  resources.  Some time ago, Iraq adopted a policy to stop wasting gas. The  gas projects in the North and South clearly show Iraq's concern  about the amounts of gas produced. Of course, plans to utilize  gas does not only mean using it locally, but also to export it  to other nearby or faraway countries. Priority will go to  nearby countries, especially Arab countries, which will receive  special attention in terms of exporting gas to them. Foremost  of these countries is Jordan, which will receive its share of  exported gas as soon as gas projects are completed and once  outlets and means to export it outside are available. The  unfair embargo on Iraq is currently a big obstacle to Iraq in  terms of developing its gas resources and allowing it to export  its surplus to nearby countries, including Jordan. Of course,  the fact that there are new gas reserves in the Western desert  will contribute to Iraq's ability to export to a nearby country  like Jordan.    ['Abd-al-Majid] A Turkish official who recently visited  Baghdad expects Iraq to start exporting oil this year. What do  you say about that?    [Jawad] We are ready to export oil at any time.    ['Abd-al-Majid] When to be exact?    [Jawad] We expect this to take place in 1994. Oil will be  pumped through the Turkish pipeline next month. Cleaning work  on this pipeline is currently underway and will require pumping  a certain amount of oil. This, in practice, means that we will  resume the export of oil. This issue is of great importance to  the Turkish side. The halt in exporting Iraqi oil has caused  unemployment and security problems. The Turks are the ones who  insist that we quickly finalize this issue.    ['Abd-al-Majid] Have you thought of special security  measures  to protect the aforementioned pipeline from acts of sabotage in  areas controlled by the Kurds?    [Jawad] Protection is available and the Turks are capable of  securing that. It is illogical that they would take a step like  this without coordinating their stands with the Kurds.</p>

"The linkage was first proposed by Australia as part of its  effort to promote trade cooperation among members of the Asia-  Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum," said DGC Deputy  Director-General Hou Teh-chi.    If the Taiwan-Singapore linkage succeeds, Hou said, other  APEC member states will follow suit.    Among the 17 APEC members, only the United States,  Australia,  New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have established  automatic customs clearance systems. As the Japanese system  does not meet the United Nations standards, Australia suggested  earlier this year that Taiwan and Singapore link their systems  first on a trial basis.    Hou said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to  provide funds needed for the computer uplink.    After the project is completed, Hou said, Taiwan and  Singapore will be able to call up each other's export/import  product lists and other related information on their own  computer screens.    Hou said APEC members will also establish computerized trade  databanks to boost multinational economic cooperation.    Apec groups the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New  Zealand, Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines,  Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, South Korea,  Mexico and Papua New Guinea.</p>

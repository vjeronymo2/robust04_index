			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar by </F> Vladimir Kuzmishchev; place and date not given: "Yegor Gaydar:  All Sober-Minded People Must Unite in the Face of Danger"]    [Text] [Kuzmishchev] Yegor Timurovich, information in the  mass media on your party building is rather contradictory. I  understand, for example, that you have not found a common  language with the leaders of "Democratic Russia...."    [Gaydar] Of course, it is a complex process to find a common  language among democrats, who do constitute, let us say, a  specific milieu; but the organizational mechanism which we have  proposed has, on the whole, been supported and will be realized.  The "Russia's Choice" faction has come up with an appeal on the  need to create a political party which will be able to become  the democratic movement's reliable mainstay in the complex  political clashes which await us over the next two years and on  which a way out of the present indeterminate, intermediate  situation will depend. There are two of them -- either  restoration, or the continuation of the reforms.    This appeal was discussed at two major forums held Saturday  in the council of the "Russia's Choice" movement and in the  council of "Democratic Russia." The "Russia's Choice" Council  supported the faction's initiative and proposed that its  regional organizations assist in creating the party.  "Democratic Russia" discussed our proposal in detail, and  various viewpoints were expressed, but in the end they  nonetheless agreed to give "Democratic Russia's" regional  organizations the opportunity to decide on the spot, proceeding  from their own conditions. This accords with our programs and  principles, since in creating the new party we will not rely on  the bases of existing structures but will build the party on the  basis of people's individual choice.    [Kuzmishchev] In other words, will those political figures  who have become familiar and even odious and who, nevertheless,  automatically end up seated at the presidium table in democratic  meetings not necessarily occupy leading places in this party?    [Gaydar] Quite right. You can always gather together 10 or  100 chance people who would go and vote for you today and  convince them that you are a great democratic figure, even if  you do not have an ounce of authority left. If you have created  an understandable and structured organization with a fixed  membership, then that organization already has the opportunity  to decide for itself what leaders it needs.    [Kuzmishchev] At the word "party" people recall "democratic  centralism," above all. Moreover, historians know that  dictatorship came into being not in 1918 but in 1903, when the  Leninist principle of party building was adopted. Will you have  anything like that?    [Gaydar] We are, of course, trying to build a party not of a  totalitarian but a parliamentary type, i.e. a party geared not  to full and comprehensive control of society but to efficient  political campaigning and measures, striving to implement a  policy which we consider feasible within the framework of the  Constitution and existing legislation.    [Kuzmishchev] How, then, will the party differ from  "Russia's Choice"? Even now the faction votes uniformly.    [Gaydar] We propose quite clear and definite discipline in  implementing jointly adopted decisions. As in Western  parliamentary parties. It is possible to debate endlessly and  champion your own viewpoint and yet implement jointly adopted  decisions in practical work. This is not some amorphous  formation like what exists now, when the position can change any  day depending on who has made himself today's leader. It is a  broad association of people who share common views and fears,  who work together, and who shape and implement decisions  together. There has never been anything like this in the  democratic movement.    [Kuzmishchev] How will your organizational principle  differ from, let us say, that of Travkin's party?    [Gaydar] In principle not at all. Any party is a mechanism  for realizing political power. Precisely because we are  countering today not only Travkin's party but the perfectly  capable and regrown Communist Party with its strong structure in  the provinces, with a large aktiv and with established  traditions of party work and propaganda and our national  socialists' quite rigid organization which, although still weak,  is rapidly taking shape, we must counter them not with a friable  and uncoordinated association of democrats but with a quite  efficient organization. It is like a rifle, you know: It is  identically made, but shoots at different targets.    [Kuzmishchev] An argument is taking place in the Democratic  Party, as in the past between Martov and Lenin: Must a party  member work within an organization, or is it sufficient to share  ideas?    [Gaydar] This question will ultimately be decided by the  party's constituent congress. But we believe, nonetheless, that  we are building a party of the parliamentary type, and so such  rigid demands are hardly applicable.    [Kuzmishchev] Why do people call you the presidential party?  You know, this does not always produce political capital.    [Gaydar] It is a case of inaccurate interpretation. Very  many people hastened to imagine a party of chiefs headed by the  president. As far as I understand it, the president simply has  no intention of creating such a party. It was a question of  creating capable, organized structures which can implement a  policy of reforms.    [Kuzmishchev] What if the party achieves success and becomes  the ruling party?    [Gaydar] It will not supplant the state.    In the traditional Soviet society it was a question not just  of the election-winning Communist Party's placing its own  representatives in various posts, as is done in any normal  democratic state, but of the party's essentially turning the  state into a scarecrow, into some ritual mechanism existing in  order to implement the decisions adopted by the party. The  party not only appointed the minister but also decided who must  be his deputy, head of department, etc. This was a party of the  totalitarian type. We, of course, have no need of such a party.    [Kuzmishchev] A party means a structure, money, and  ideology. In my view, things are difficult for you with the  latter. You say: We will create an economy which, in the final  analysis, will itself resolve all problems. People remember  that they were once promised: Communism will be achieved, and  then everything will be good....    [Gaydar] In actual fact, the essence of what we propose  consists in limiting the state burden and the burden of  officialdom in every possible way for society. Our opponents  say: If there is a problem, the state must solve it. This  means in practice that they will put 1,000 more officials in  place and give them the opportunity to share several trillion  rubles. You will pay taxes, and the officials will extort them  and decide to whom to give money and to whom not to give it.  This is what our opponents propose. Our position is the direct  opposite. We do not promise manna from heaven; we promise  something else -- a society in which the official will not have  the right to decide which enterprise will prosper and which will  not, depending on who has given him a bribe; a society in which  the official will merely keep an eye on compliance with the laws.    [Kuzmishchev] But more specific proposals are also needed.  In my view, unless you elaborate program decisions on the  protection of the Russian population in the neighboring  countries, you will find it hard to compete with Zhirinovskiy,  let us say, who has made the national question his trump card.    [Gaydar] In 1992, when we did not in actual fact have our  own monetary unit and there was no separation of our economic  area, everybody despised us. Why should I supply anything to  Russia, why should I seek entry to the Russian market if I can  print money? We were forced to run and plead: Please send meat  to us in Moscow. Ukraine said: Why should we feed you? That  was what happened, and that is what we are being pushed toward  today.    In 1991 Crimea together with all of Ukraine had voted to  pull  out precisely because there was chaos in Russia, precisely  because we were not separated by anything and had no tool of  influence. Crimea votes differently today precisely because we  have been separated. Either we have an efficient Russian  economy with its own money, when people reckon with us and stand  in line wishing to cooperate with us, and then we have the  opportunity to uphold the rights of Russians in the neighboring  countries by economic methods; or we mess up this whole  business, and then we ask in bewilderment why Russians are being  offended.    [Kuzmishchev] What did those Russians who graduated from  Saratov Polytechnical Institute and were sent to Dnepropetrovsk  or Karaganda do wrong? Why has big politics turned them into  second-class people? How can Russia help them?    [Gaydar] Of course they did nothing wrong. The question is:  What is to be done? The most important thing that we can do is  to have a competent Russian economy, because then we will be  able to secure dual citizenship for them, we can welcome them  home, if that is what they want, and we can hold talks and  conclude an agreement on a common economic zone and create a  customs union and, in time, a currency union. We can make  Russia the center of the common economic area which is being  formed.    [Kuzmishchev] Your opponents also favor a single emission  center....    [Gaydar] Well, that is not a bad political move on their  part: to appropriate the idea for which they criticized us, for  which we struggled, and which we implemented....    [Kuzmishchev] Yegor Timurovich, what would you say to people  far removed from politics if, as they say in advertising, you  had 30 seconds?    [Gaydar] Today we must be conscious of the rigid need to  unite all sober-minded people precisely because a sense of a  real historical danger has come about once again. All people  feel and understand this. They also see the gleam in the eyes  of the Communists, who have forgotten nothing and renounced  nothing. They also see the triumphal self-confidence of the  national socialists. In general this is dreadful for normal  people, who simply think about themselves and their children.  There are two reactions here: either panic or, nonetheless, a  courageous decision to counter this real and very serious threat.    We are struggling for our country's future. We do not want  to see it a totalitarian state with camps, with no signs of  human freedom, with lines, with shortages, with humiliations  before chiefs. In fact we see our country free, with everyone  having the right to his own opinion, to choose, to vote, and to  decide the country's future and the opportunity to work and earn.</p>

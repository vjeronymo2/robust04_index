			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday morning [30 March], a ceremony for  provincial leaders to devote warmth and make donations to the  masses in Mashan and Yaoshan was held in the former office  building of the provincial government. Provincial party,  government, and military leaders attended the ceremony,  including Liu Fangren, Chen Shineng, Wang Chaowen, Long Zhiyi,  Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Hu Kehui, and others. They took lead  in donating more than 10,000 items of clothing, more than 200  books, and 1,500 yuan in cash to the masses in Mashan and  Yaoshan.    At the ceremony, provincial party committee Deputy Secretary  Wang Siqi said: I hope that party and government departments in  various localities will strengthen organization and leadership,  and that -- taking these donations as a starting point -- they  will carry out education throughout the province on struggling  hard, and practicing thrift, patriotism and collectivism. He  also pointed out: At present, there are quite a lot of  impoverished people in our province. Governments in all  localities must fully realize the difficulties, importance, and  complexity of work to support the impoverished. We must arouse  our emotions, take real action, and use our heads to increase  the weight of the work to support the impoverished. Only thus  can we change the situation in the impoverished areas.    Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren and  Governor  Chen Shineng were interviewed by reporters. They said: On the  one hand, the present activities to devote warmth to the masses  in Mashan and Yaoshan have shown that our province is  implementing conscientiously the policy of the CPC Central  Committee. On the other hand, such activities are the common  desire of the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the  province. They have strongly promoted the work to support the  impoverished throughout the province. There are 10 million  people in our province who need support. In Mashan and Yaoshan,  there are 300,000 poor people. If the work to support the  impoverished in these two areas is carried out well, it can play  the role of grasping the key point to promote the work as a  whole. I believe that the broad masses of party members and  cadres will participate actively in such activities to support  the impoverished and aid households in need.    While answering reporters' questions, they stressed: In  carrying out such activities, we need a good plan. However,  what is more important is that we need to work in a  down-to-earth manner. The present donations are only part of  the project to support the impoverished. We must help them  develop and improve the quality of production and education,  with the emphasis on development. It is necessary to solve the  problem of impoverishment once and for all, and to help these  impoverished areas develop their self-supporting capabilities  and to survive.    They emphasized: The activities of devoting affection are  merely a good start in supporting the impoverished. There is  much work to be done. The provincial party committee and  government have the confidence and determination to carry out  well the work to support the impoverished.    After the ceremony, provincial party committee Secretary Liu  Fangren and Governor Chen Shineng talked with responsible  comrades of the office in charge of the activities, and asked  them to contact one child in Maoshan and one in Yaoshan who were  deprived of education, promising to subsidize them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kampala, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Four Ugandans facing charges  of involvement in smuggling arms to war-torn Yugoslavia in a  Ugandan Airlines plane in August 1991 have been acquitted and  discharged, court officials said here Tuesday [2 February].    They said that those acquitted on Monday by Kampala's chief  magistrate Yorokamu Bamwine included Uganda's former prime  minister Abraham Waliggo, who then headed the state-owned  Ugandan Airlines Corporation (UAC), two pilots Stephen Makyeri  and Rogatiano Mugisha, and loadmaster David Nsubuga. But a  fifth accused, Captain Jack Calnan, would continue standing  trial for abuse of office.    At the time of the incident, UAC officials denied that the  plane, which had been leased from Aviation Leasing Groups (ALG)  of Kansas City in the United States, "was on Ugandan Airlines  business when it was caught smuggling arms to Yugoslavia and  impounded by the Yugoslav authorities".    The officials maintained that the ALG and UAC had agreed to  temporarily suspend the lease between August 15 and October 15  because the Uganda flag carrier did not need the plane during  that period.    Under the agreement the Ugandan pilot Stephen Makyeri and  his  five compatriot crew members were to be retained by ALG during  the period the lease was in suspension, the officials said.    Consequently, the plane left Uganda on August 29, 1991 for  Gaborone in Botswana, but was diverted to the  nominally-independent South African homeland of Bophuthatswana,  where a Canadian citizen of Yugoslav origin, Anton Ikac, who had  a Ugandan Airlines ticket, apparently boarded the plane and arms  were loaded, the officials recounted.    It returned to Uganda's Entebbe international airport two  days later carrying what was described as "technical cargo",  taking off from Entebbe on the next day, but was forced to land  at Zagreb in Yugoslavia, where it was found to be carrying 19  tonnes of arms and ammunition.    According to the officials, money for refuelling the plane  at  Entebbe airport appeared to have been remitted to the Uganda  branch of the British multi-national oil company, Shell-BP, from  abroad, heightening suspicions here that senior officials of  Uganda airlines were in on the deal.    A South African arms maker denied having supplied arms to  separatists in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia as had then been  claimed in a report in the London weekly SUNDAY TIMES.</p>

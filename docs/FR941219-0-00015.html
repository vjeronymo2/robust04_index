This amendment is prompted by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective February 17, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 17, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Service Manager, Spey engines, Rolls-Royce, plc, East Kilbride, Glasgow G74 4PY, Scotland. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  John Fisher, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7149, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R-R) Spey series turbofan engines was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed at least 40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These disks must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit where either the HPT or LPT disks are removed after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will allow stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with R-R Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1044, dated September 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the one comment received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter concurs with the AD as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the definition of shop visit has been clarified to eliminate the reference to next scheduled disk inspection and include next disk removal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it will take no additional work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during regular turbine overhauls. Approximately 80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $189,750.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

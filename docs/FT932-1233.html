			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: 12% fall to Pounds 13m for Hogg Robinson HOGG ROBINSON, the travel, transport and financial services group, saw profits fall 12.2 per cent to Pounds 13.3m in the year to March 31, under the pressure of cutbacks in consumer spending and heavy discounting in the travel sector. Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the recently-announced Pounds 25m sale of the group's leisure travel business to Airtours would ease the volatility of Hogg's profit performance. Turnover rose 12 per cent to Pounds 172.7m. Operating profit in business travel fell to Pounds 2m from Pounds 3.3m in 1991-92. In the discontinued leisure travel arm, profits were down to Pounds 47,000 (Pounds 1.1m). The fall in the leisure travel business came despite an increase in turnover to Pounds 30.4m from Pounds 28.8m the year before. Business travel turnover was slightly down to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 31.4m). Mr Perry said: 'Market structures are such that there was little prospect of making acceptable profits from our leisure travel business. The transport division saw operating profits rise to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.7m). Mr Perry said transport was continuing to gain ground in Europe despite the effects of recession in Germany. Financial services' operating profits increased to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.7m). Earnings per share were 14p (14.01p). The final dividend is 4p (3.8p), making 6.6p (6.3p).</p>

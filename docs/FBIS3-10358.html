			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- On 1 March the government issued  Provisional Measure No. 438, establishing restrictions on  foreign capital to be invested in stock exchanges. The new  decree provides for the levying of the Financial Operations Tax  (IOF) on exchange operations, which will have to pay as high as  25 percent in IOF. A total of $12 billion were invested in the  stock exchange last year.    Gustavo Franco, international area director at the Central  Bank [BC], yesterday asserted, however, that the government will  not restrict the entrance of foreign capital into the country.  He explained that the government is not interested in imposing  more restrictions on the inflow of foreign capital, at least  until the new currency, the real, is instituted.    He stressed: It would be a contradiction to impose  restrictions before the real becomes effective, as we are then  going to need reserves. He also acknowledged that the  unification of foreign exchange markets may be effected on the  same day the real is instituted as the currency.    According to Franco, the provisional measure only seeks to  consolidate the legislation on the IOF and to put an end to  lawsuits as far as exchange operations are concerned. He  nonetheless conceded that the financial market was in turmoil  after the news of the provisional measure was learned. Franco  said that yesterday the BC had been deluged with requests for  authorization to issue bonds abroad.    He stated: People rushed to request authorizations so as to  avoid paying the 25 percent tax.    Franco explained that the rate of 25 percent had been  established since 1980, and that the implementation of the 3 and  5 percent rates -- levied on incoming capital for fixed earnings  operations and issuance of bonds abroad, which came into force  last year -- gave rise to legal problems. He could not,  however, explain the three-month delay in the filing of legal  proceedings once the new rates were instituted in November 1993.    On 2 March the BC suspended the five-day deadline for the  automatic approval of authorization requests in case it is  unable to meet the said deadline during in the coming days.  According to Franco, it will be impossible for the BC to  analyze all the requests that were submitted yesterday to the BC  within five days.    A source close to the BC guaranteed that the intention of  the  economic team is also to control the black market dollar, as it  has now become the favorite target for irregular transactions  because of its lagging behind the commercial rate -- or in other  words, the black market dollar rate of exchange is lower than  that of the commercial dollar. In order to check these  irregular transactions, the BC determined on 2 March that all  real cruzeiro remittances for the payment of debts abroad be  made following the submission of the necessary documentation.    This CB measure will be instrumental in thwarting a  transaction often made by importers, which consisted of paying  for their imports in real cruzeiros, i.e., by just remitting  money, which enabled them to keep the bill of lading for their  imports. The transaction was thus cheaper. As Franco  explained, the idea behind this was to get returns when the  black market dollar exchange rate becomes once again higher than  that of the commercial dollar. In that case, the importer would  have resort to the bill of lading to bring dollars from abroad  at the commercial rate of exchange, just to subsequently sell  them on the black market. In a move that sought to push the  black market dollar up, the BC also decided yesterday that any  dollar amount exceeding the limit allowed for banks may be  deposited at the BC. Banks are thus expected to be more willing  to receive dollar notes.</p>

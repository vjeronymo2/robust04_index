			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Managers' salaries outstrip inflation BASIC PAY for managers continues to outstrip inflation comfortably and has risen by 5.6 per cent over the past 12 months, compared with 8.9 per cent a year ago, according to the latest survey by the Reward Group, the employment consultancy. In the three months to August, the average settlement for managers fell to 4.2 per cent, but the survey participants do not predict a further fall, and the annual settlement level for this time next year is expected to be 4.8 per cent. The latest report from Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, predicts that next year: 'Low inflation plus stagnation will produce low pay settlements, roughly in the 3 to 5 per cent range.' The report notes: 'It is true that pay settlement levels have more than halved since the beginning of 1991, but this has been the consequence of recessionary forces and the decline in the inflation rate, rather than a fundamental change in bargaining behaviour.'

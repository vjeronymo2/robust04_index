			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Scheme to cut cost of administration - In a Nutshell Small businesses fed up with the time and money spent on administration may be interested in an initiative launched yesterday by the British Chambers of Commerce. The BCC Invoice Clearing House scheme requires companies to compile a list of suppliers, with the amounts to pay each one, and send a single cheque covering the full amount; the scheme then makes payments to all the individual suppliers. Two dates per month can be chosen for the payment of regular bills, including electricity, rates bills and personal credit card accounts. The BCC claims its scheme will lower bank charges as well as saving time and other administration costs. Further information on 071-222-1555.</p>

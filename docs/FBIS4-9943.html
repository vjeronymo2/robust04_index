			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japanese Mitsubishi Company's presence in Cuba  has been confirmed by the presentation and display of its  automobile products. The Mitsubishi Company has been announced  as the first Japanese company to establish a long-range business  deal in Cuba. Also present in that investment is the Sumitomo  Trading Corporation [name given in English], one of the largest  automobile companies in Japan.    Mitsubishi declared the Panamanian company, International  Engines, its representative in Cuba. This company has been  operating in the Cuban automobile market for more than 10 years.    This is seen as a short-term investment with an immediate  impact on the Cuban tourism sector, although the Japanese  managers have expressed interest in extending their investments  into other economic areas, and have confirmed their confidence  in Cuban economic growth. The Cuban party said this investment  implies the first economic rapprochement between Japan and Cuba.</p>

It was established that the  frequency of occurrence of congenital developmental defects in  children was elevated in these regions.    Four bibliographic reference, two tables.    Key Words: congenital developmental defects, chromosome  aberration, nuclear radiation.    The mutagenic effects of ionizing radiation have been  illuminated rather extensively in the literature [2,4,6,8].  Their registration is one of the approaches to biological  dosimetry [3,5,9,10]. At the same time the structure and  occurrence of genetic pathology in the population of a region  within which nuclear explosions were actually carried out over  the course of four decades have not been addressed by  researchers. Nor has there been any research on the frequency of  detection of different types of chromosome aberrations in  lymphocytes of the blood of persons living in direct proximity  to a test range. The purpose of this paper is to fill in this  blank. The need for it was brought about by the absence of  dependable information on the dose loads experienced by people  who suffered from nuclear weapon tests. These dose loads may be  estimated indirectly using the results of research on the  frequency of detection of chromosome aberrations in different  age groups.  <H5>  Materials and Methods </H5>   We analyzed statistical reporting materials of public health  agencies, the birth and developmental histories of newborn  infants, and records of autopsies of children who died at an age  of up to 1 year in Semipalatinsk. We took account of cases of  congenital developmental defects and diagnosis of hereditary  diseases. We studied the frequency of detection of congenital  developmental defects and monogenic genetically caused diseases  in Beskaragayskiy, Zhanasemeyskiy and Abayskiy rayons, which  suffered the most from the effects of ionizing radiation, and  Kokpektinskiy Rayon as a control. Cytogenetic research was  conducted on material from 31 clinically healthy students of the  Semipalatinsk Medical Institute, 11 of whom (21.4 years old on  the average) lived outside the northeastern region of Kazakhstan  prior to entering the VUZ and who had resided for not more than  2 years in Semipalatinsk before the time of their examination.  They made up the first group of subjects. The second included 11  students (20.8 years old on the average) who were indigenous  inhabitants of Semipalatinsk. A third group was made up of nine  students in their first and second years, who lived in Mayskiy  Rayon, Pavlodar Oblast, which is directly adjacent to the test  area, prior to entering the institute.    The frequency of chromosome aberrations was determined by  cytological analysis of preparations of metaphasic chromosomes  obtained by culturing lymphocytes from peripheral blood by the  micromethod [7]. One hundred metaphase plates, selected  according to criteria recommended in [1], were analyzed for each  individual. A total of 3,100 metaphase plates were studied.  <H5>  Research Results and Discussion </H5>   Data on the occurrence and structure of genetic pathology in  the child population of different rayons adjacent to the test  range are presented in Table 1.

As we can see, the frequency of detection of congenital  developmental defects was highest in Beskaragayskiy Rayon--1.5  +/-0.004 percent--that is 10.47 per 1,000 population. This  indicator was 3.3 times higher than that for children residing  in Kokpektinskiy Rayon (control), it was 1.6 times higher than  that found in Zhanasemeyskiy, and 2.6 times higher than the  indicator in Abayskiy Rayon. These differences were  statistically highly significant (P[.sub]1[/]&lt;0.001,  P[.sub]2[/]&lt;0.001, P[.sub]3[/]&lt;0.001).    One of the most important causes of the appearance of  congenital developmental defects in children is chromosome  abnormalities, the frequency of which typically rises in  response to ionizing radiation [4,5,6]. The results of research  on the frequency of different types of aberrations in  chromosomes in the lymphocytes of the blood of persons residing  in the region adjacent to the test range are shown in Table 2.       Table 2.

As we can see, the frequency of detection of aberrant cells  was 1.9 +/- 0.3 percent for students from outside the city prior  to entering the medical institute (first group), it was 3.2 +/-  1.2 percent for students who were indigenous inhabitants of  Semipalatinsk (second group), which was 1.5 times higher than  for the first group, although this difference was not  statistically significant (P&gt; 0.1). This indicator was 3.7 +/-  0.3 percent for students who had resided in Mayskiy Rayon,  Pavlodar Oblast prior to entering the VUZ (third group), which  was 1.95 times higher than for subjects of the first group. This  difference was statistically highly significant (P&lt;0.001). A  tendency for the frequency of detection of aberrant cells in  students of the third group to rise in comparison with the  second was also detected, although this difference was not  statistically significant (P&gt; 0.1).    The total number of chromosome aberrations in students of  the  first group was 2.0 +/- 0.24 per 100 cells--that is 1.6 times  lower than in the second group (3.2 +/- 1.2 per 100 cells). This  difference was not statistically significant (P&gt; 0.1). However,  the number of chromosome aberrations in students of the second  group was found to be 1.9 times higher than for students of the  first, with the statistical significance of the indicated  differences being high (P&lt;0.001).    When we studied the types of aberrations we found that the  chromosome type was encountered significantly more often in  persons of the third group than in persons of the first  (P&lt;0.05). Chromatid aberrations were encountered significantly  more often in persons of the third group than in the second  (P&lt;0.5) and first (P&lt;0.05) groups.    We know that the frequency of spontaneous aberrations of  chromosomes in lymphocytes in human peripheral blood, determined  in special research using large samples, is sufficiently low,  varying on the average from 1.0 to 1.2 percent [1]. In this case  it does not depend on the sex of the subjects, but it increases  with age, attaining 5-6 percent in persons over 60 years old. In  this connection we selected groups that were homogeneous with  respect to age for our research.    Thus our research established that the frequency of  chromosome aberrations in students who were inhabitants of  Mayskiy Rayon, which is directly adjacent to the Semipalatinsk  nuclear test range, was the highest. Moreover we also discovered  a tendency for the frequency of detection of chromosome  aberrations in students who were indigenous inhabitants of  Semipalatinsk to increase in comparison with students who lived  outside the northeastern region of Kazakhstan prior to entering  the medical institute.    It is evident from Table 1 that the frequency of detection  of  monogenic genetically caused diseases was highest in  Beskaragayskiy Rayon (0.31 +/- 0.007 percent), while in  Zhanasemeyskiy Rayon it was 3.5 times lower that the indicator  for Kokpektinskiy Rayon, the population of which suffered to a  relatively lesser degree from ionizing radiation as a result of  the test range's operation. This can apparently be explained by  the fact that point mutations play the dominant role in the  advent of monogenic diseases, and according to some data [6,8]  their frequency changes insignificantly in response to small  doses of ionizing radiation.    Thus our research established a rise in frequency of  occurrence of congenital developmental defects in the child  population residing in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear  test range. This pattern is explained by the higher frequency of  chromosome aberrations detected in persons residing permanently  in the region; a tendency for this frequency to rise with  decreasing distance from the test range was also observed. The  influence of its factors on the frequency of occurrence of  monogenic genetically caused diseases could not be established  dependably in this research; this question does need additional  study.

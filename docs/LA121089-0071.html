			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS: SEEKING PRIVACY IN HAWAII PARADISE  </P> <P> A brochure titled "Privacy in Paradise" is available from Creative Leisure  International. Features 52 apartments/resorts on Maui, Molokai, Kauai, Oahu and  the Big Island. Everything from beach-front condos to three-bedroom homes. A  seven-night package figures out to $494 per person, based on two vacationers  traveling together. Includes the round-trip flight from LAX, taxes, a lei  greeting, limousine service from the airport and return. Creative Leisure  offers a money-back service warranty. (On request the company will prepare  customized vacation plans for travelers.)  </P> <P> "Privacy in Paradise" is a 50-page listing of accommodations and rates, with  descriptions of amenities available at each property.

Telephone  (707) 778-1800.  </P> <P> Skier Hot Line: A new hot line for skiers is providing reports on more than 150  resorts across the nation. Information on weather/road conditions, day/night  skiing, snow depths. Callers learn whether trams and gondolas are operating.  (The weather report is updated hourly.)  </P> <P> Here's how it works: Press 1-900-WEATHER plus the area code for the city  nearest the resort you intend to visit. Skiers calling Denver, for example,  would be given ski conditions for Arapaho Basin, Breckenridge, Keystone, Winter  Park, Loveland, Eldora Mountain, SilverCreek, Steamboat. The service is  operated by American Express. Callers pay 75 cents per minute.  </P> <P> Christmas in Arizona: America's most unusual Christmas tree is a blinking  attraction in Chandler, Ariz. Composed of a thousand tumbleweeds, the unusual  "tree" is the state's answer to an old-fashioned fir. The citizens of Chandler  sprayed the tumbleweeds with 25 gallons of paint, showered the pile with 50  pounds of silver glitter and strung together 1,500 lights. Of an evening, it  flashes like a beacon in the clear Arizona atmosphere.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Sheraton San Marcos Resort has put together a Tumbleweed Holiday  that's pegged at $79 a night (single or double occupancy), including film with  which to photograph the tree. For reservations, dial (602) 963-6655.  </P> <P> Currency Guide: The big money changer, Ruesch International, has published a  new currency guide for Europe, Australia/New Zealand.

Rises  behind the ski lift. Proprietor Gary Eschman writes: "Our guests have  threatened not to tell anyone about us as they want to keep our place for  themselves.

Several readers insist the more accurate description  would be "seedy." This wasn't the case several years ago when we surveyed  London's little hotels for our readers. Mike Manfro of Banning wasn't  disappointed. He describes guest rooms as "small but comfortable" and adds that  the baths have only recently been refurbished. Still, because our readers have  been mostly negative, we are striking The Fielding from our list of recommended  hotels. Here's what LeAnne E. Maillian of Beverly Hills said of the Fielding:  "It's not a hotel, it's an embarrassment." And Jack Toomey of Granada Hills  complained that "although there were no blatant inaccuracies in your  description of the Fielding . . . the scene was grim."  </P> <P> Bye-bye Fielding.  </P> <P> Reader Recommendations  </P> <P> Hawaii -- Mary Lee Gaylor, Culver City: "Recently stayed at Lampy's Bed &amp;  Breakfast, 6078 Kolopua St., Kapaa, Kauai, Hawaii 96746. As a former resident  of Hawaii, to me this is what Hawaii is all about. Nestled behind Sleeping  Giant Mountain, with fresh fruit right off the trees. You can prepare your  meals in a fully equipped kitchen. Cost is $55 nightly for one or two persons.  As an experienced traveler who has been all over the world, I highly recommend  Lampy's."  </P> <P> The Netherlands -- Donald Selten, Los Angeles: "The most remarkable restaurant  I have encountered in many years of travel to Europe, and I feel fairly  qualified as I have been in the restaurant and food business for well over 35  years. It's De Wenteltraf, Vijzelstraat 43-45, Amsterdam. A set menu for less  than $10 U.S."  </P> <P> England -- Ruth Shayne, Los Angeles: Praises Knightsbridge Service Flats, 45  Ennismore Gardens, Knightsbridge, London SW7 1AQ, England. A block of 12 studio  flats within walking distance of Knightsbridge and Harrods, and two minutes  from Hyde Park. Rates between 320 and 340 per week.  </P> <P> We regret that only a select few recommendations can be used. They must be  brief (typewritten or printed). Only one recommendation per reader, please.  Note: Recommendations will not be used unless prices and addresses are  included.  </P></p>

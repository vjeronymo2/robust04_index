			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Costa Rica 'dry canal' may rival Panama - Plans are under way for a port-rail link across central America PRIVATE financial groups have been courting the Costa Rican government with offers to build a trading thoroughfare across central America to rival the Panama Canal. If one is accepted, construction could begin early next year on two ports and a railway linking the country's Caribbean and Pacific coasts. At a meeting on July 10 in the Casa Presidencial, Mr Rolando Lacle, minister of the presidency, laid down the ground rules for what would be the largest private sector investment in central America. Three foreign groups and one from Costa Rica headed by a former president, Mr Mario Echandi, have so far made proposals for a trans-isthmian link, said Mr Lacle. The government would ask for tenders once the legislative assembly had passed a law allowing the executive to grant concessions to private companies for infrastructural projects, he added. The bill is expected to pass next month. The construction and operation of the ports and railway would be regulated by a law on free zones, which would grant companies 10 years' grace on income tax and tax-free imports of capital and intermediate goods. A detailed environmental impact study would also be required. Although it is insisted that the route would complement rather than compete with the Panama canal, the Panamanian authorities have already expressed concern that the canal would lose traffic. Recently several international shipping companies protested against a proposed 9.9 per cent rise in toll charges. A short land bridge would be an increasingly attractive alternative. The most talked-about offer is a Dollars 1.2bn proposal by a US consortium, the Costa Rica Trans Development Corporation, which would lay a 315km railway along flat, sparsely populated, mostly agricultural land close to Costa Rica's northern border with Nicaragua. The proposal is to dredge a deep-water port on the northern Caribbean coast at Parismina which would be linked by a two-track electric railway to a port and natural harbour at Cuajiniquil on the Pacific. 'See it as one port linked by a railway,' said Mr Juan Manuel Rodriguez vice-president of the consortium. The dry canal would take at least two and a half years to complete, and a further two years before investors began to get a return, according to Mr Rodriguez. 'This is not a restaurant we are opening. This is business for people with patience and money,' he said. The new route would be aimed at some of the container cargo shifted by rail across the US or through the Panama Canal. Four years from now, there could be a railway moving 750 double-stacked 40-feet containers a day in little over three hours, according to Mr Rodriguez. He said the group had the backing of leading shipping and construction companies. The Boston-based Roy Group which specialises in shipping and investment was putting together a Dollars 450m long-term equity package with shipping companies from the Far East, the US and Europe. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the latter a big lender in Costa Rica, have also provided advice to the group but their assistance would not subordinate the role of private capital, Mr Rodriguez added. 'Theirs will be a symbolic presence but we welcome it.' Financing of Dollars 152m for the first year of the plan, to cover an environmental impact study and initial construction costs, had 'already been secured'. The proposed route skirts the Santa Rosa National Park which contains some of central America's rarest flora and fauna. But according to the natural resources minister, Mr Hernan Bravo, whose ministry must approve the route, substantial environmental damage can be avoided. 'The route will be defined in keeping with environmental parameters,' he said. The idea of a trans-isthmian link has been well received by the ailing state-run railway company Incofer which stands to be rejuvenated by the deal. Incofer subsists on 800m colons (Dollars 60m) from the central government. The Trans Development Corporation has suggested the Costa Rican government and Incofer be granted a share in the consortium.</p>

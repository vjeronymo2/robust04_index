			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Soldiers bring security to the Somalia aid effort: Relief agencies have fewer doubts about US-led intervention WESTERN aid agencies who have fought a battle to deliver food and medicine to Somalia's starving millions have greeted the US-led military intervention with relief and optimism. In Mogadishu gunmen and their battle wagons have virtually disappeared from the streets and the relief gateways of the port and airport are secure and operating at full capacity for the first time in two years. Even the most sceptical aid agencies, such as Britain's Save the Children Fund which opposed the US operation at the beginning, have cautiously welcomed the multinational force building up in Mogadishu with a United Nations mandate to protect the delivery of relief supplies. Concern is growing about the slow movement of the military into the starvation-ridden interior, and reservations about the long-term commitment of the US-led task force remain among many experienced aid officials. But in the six days since US Marines first landed in Mogadishu, aid workers have begun to feel that they can now do their job without fearing for their lives or being held hostage to extortion, intimidation and the threat of looting. Fears among some agencies that expatriate aid workers would be made targets by resentful Somalis suddenly put out of a lucrative protection racket have so far proved unfounded. 'We have seen some security benefits,' said Mr Don Redding, Save the Children spokesman. 'But we are not yet satisfied there's sufficient thinking about long-term development and the involvement of Somalis in reconstruction.' Others such as the international relief and development agency CARE and the UN World Food Programme, which were strong although belated advocates of military intervention, are more optimistic. 'We have always had the capacity and food pipeline to feed Somalia within weeks,' said Mr Paul Mitchell of WFP. 'Now the security situation is ten times better already and we are getting the operation moving swiftly. Food is already moving through the port and city with the help of the marines.' Turmoil, violence and looting had overtaken Somalia by early last year. Many Somalis feared that each food shipment would be the last and in the scramble for scarce resources armed robbery, diversion of food convoys and shoot-outs over food became the norm. Merchants and warlords cashed in on the relief business, hiring out bandits turned guards and armoured battle wagons to agencies desperate for protection and then paying gunmen to loot relief supplies they were paid to protect. The airport was repeatedly closed and re-opened as the clan-faction which nominally controlled it massively increased its fees and occasionally fought gun-battles with rival clans. At the port relief ships were looted in the harbour. Port security guards, supplied by one warlord, had to be paid off with large amounts of food and in money to get relief trucks moving out of the port. Once the trucks left the port gates, as much as 80 per cent were 'diverted' - a Somali euphemism for stolen. Movement of food into the interior, outside a handful of towns, was impossible and at least 300,000 people have starved to death this year. Lengthy negotiations with the warlords, first by humanitarian relief organisations and then by UN representatives, got bogged down in the greed of opposing groups determined to benefit more than their rivals. It took four months for the UN to get 500 poorly armed Pakistanis into Somalia and deployed into the airport. Patience finally broke after two incidents. First Bardera, a town north-west of Mogadishu, after a tussle between Somalia's two main battling warlords was retaken by Gen Mohammed Hersi Morgan from Gen Mohammed Farrar Aideed. Aid workers were evacuated. The death rate rocketed from under 100 a day to 307 a day at its highest. Bardera proved that relief efforts were futile without vastly improved and long-term security. Weeks later, on November 24, a WFP-chartered ship with 10,000 tonnes of wheat was shelled as it tried to dock in the port ,and turned back. 'These incidents finally demonstrated what we had been arguing for since November of last year,' said Dr Willy Huber of SOS Kinderdorf, which drew up a plan for military intervention at that time and tried unsuccessfully to seek other agency support for the scheme. 'Since 1991 all efforts to distribute food were a waste of time, energy and resources without security backed by massive force.' The US-led force in Somalia are still trying to find their feet and learn how to deal with an armed population who have lost respect for authority and their starving fellow people. Concern is growing among aid workers about US statements that Washington wants to withdraw its forces by late January and hand over to the UN, which is thoroughly discredited in Somalia. 'I am not in favour of military intervention but it had to happen,' said Dr Dominique Martin of Medecins Sans Frontieres. 'But it is the transition from the US to the UN which really worries me and how they will handle to gunmen and the clans which are losing out. It could still fall apart if they don't handle it right and then we will be back to square one.'</p>

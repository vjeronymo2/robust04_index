			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> New York artist David Humphrey's surrealist paintings seem to come from a  besieged public official's dream time. The images are strange yet make a weird  kind of sense, as if the floating gaseous bladders, winged bells and formal  gardens were all just unconscious symbols of an individual trying to deal with  a too-complex civic responsibility. The style is a strangely serene mix of  Magritte fantasy joined to a smooth, body-oriented, organic abstraction. The  result is an unreal, highly symbolic world of distended viscera and odd bits of  recognizable reality.  </P> <P> The paintings are powerful, both in the way they are painted and in the  symbolism that stays just outside of comprehension. Humphrey adds to the fray  by spelling out the titles in disjointed lettering right on the canvases. This  technique, suggesting the additive nature of collage, also mirrors his own  slightly out of kilter means of communication that obscures as much as it  reveals. Ultimately, however, it is the nagging sense that something vital is  being addressed that makes deciphering the images seem important.  (Krygier/Landau Contemporary Art, 2114 Broadway, to June 30.)

The facility's total floor space is about 1,400  square meters (sqm), and it has four floors above ground. So  far, 4,500 people have received training at this facility, and  it has played a role in raising the capability of nuclear power  plant operators.    New equipment was added to the facility for maintenance  training and to provide comprehensive education and training in  nuclear technology. Construction began in April 1992, and was  completed in September 1993.    The facility has a simulated steam generator water chamber,  a  steam generator heat transfer pipe inspection device,  tank-pump-valves-pipes system training equipment, and electric  motor equipment. The facility's total floor space is 3,000 sqm,  and it has three floors above ground and one below ground level.  The building area is about 800 sqm.

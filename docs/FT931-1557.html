			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Watchdog warns MoD on sale of surplus arms THE Ministry of Defence is preparing for a 'dramatic' sell-off of military equipment without an adequate grasp of sales and pricing techniques, the National Audit Office warns today. Items on offer over the next two years may include obsolete Phantom and Buccaneer aircraft, Leander frigates and Oberon submarines. The audit office, the government spending watchdog, says sales will be 'on a scale unprecedented since the period following the second world war'. It says smaller disposals over the past five years have raised almost Pounds 200m, but that more could have been realised. The value of some ships, for example, was reduced unnecessarily by the premature stripping out of equipment. The office adds that the Ministry of Defence needs to tighten safeguards against fraud and theft in the light of 'a major investigation' by police at its disposal depots. The second-hand market is competitive because of defence cuts in many countries, the audit office says. But the ministry has failed to assess the identities, strategies and strengths of its competitors. There has been progress in improving the efficiency of equipment sales, the office says, and the ministry has created a directorate to centralise sales of surplus equipment. It has been involved in the sale of 35 ships to south America and south-east Asia, as well as tank spares to Kuwait and ammunition to New Zealand, Chile and Sri Lanka. The number of aircraft sold more than trebled to 102 in 1991-92 compared with a year before, and the ministry disposed successfully of several hundred tonnes of time-expired ration-pack biscuits to zoos and manufacturers of pet food. Yet the directorate still relies largely on a manual database because its computers have failed to work, says the audit office which blames 'funding limitations and a lack of appreciation of the directorate's requirements'. A shortage of management information means that 'the directorate has insufficient information on prices achieved and costs incurred to know whether they are covering their costs'. The handling of auctions is also criticised by the audit office. It says most buyers at the ministry's auctions are late in their payments, and urges that professional houses should be consulted about producing a list of possible changes to the ministry's auction procedures with the aim of increasing the prices obtained. The ministry said it was studying the report and hoped to make a response within weeks. Disposal by Sale of Defence Surplus Equipment and Stores. House of Commons Paper 557. HMSO. Pounds 7.40.</p>

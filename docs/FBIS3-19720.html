			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Bjorn Mansson: "Red-Green Majority"] </F>   [Text] A red-green majority in the next parliamentary  election right now appears probable, asserts Bjorn Mansson, who  in the latest poll on party support does not discern any  clear-cut effects from the presidential election.    The Social Democratic Party [SDP] is continuing its  triumphal  procession in the polls. According to the most recent one, which  was conducted by Taloustutkimous for the Center Party press  organ SUOMENMAA, the SDP is up to a new record 33 percent -- or  one-third -- of the electorate.    This is all of 11 points -- or, stated another way, no less  than 50 percent! -- over the 22-percent result in the 1991  parliamentary election. The rise has been accelerating ever  since the 27 percent posted in the municipal elections of 1992.    Since the Left Alliance has risen to more than 10 percent  over the Greens despite an overall declining trend, in just over  seven weeks [since the first round of the presidential  elections], a red-green majority in next year's parliamentary  election right now seems probable.    In the nonsocialist camp the situation is most bleak for the  Center Party: a drop from almost 25 percent in 1991 to a bare 19  percent in the municipal elections, to 18 now, which is almost  as dramatic as the SDP's advance.    It appears significantly better for the Conservative Party,  whose voter support of just over 19 percent in both 1991 and  1992 dropped only to 18.5 percent now. The same can be said of  the Swedish People's Party, whose 4.7 percent is nearly the  "normal."    It is interesting that the Rural Party's risk of dropping  below the threshold for parliamentary representation is now  confirmed.    A main reason for the poll trend is obvious: Governing  responsibility in times of economic crisis has impacted the  largest governing party, while the SDP has benefited from its  role as leading opposition party. What is interesting regarding  this, however, is that the Conservative Party and Swedish  People's Party coalition partners have not been hit as hard as  the prime minister's party.    It is starting to become really urgent for the Center Party  to convince voters, with the aid of an economic upturn, that its  policies have been the right ones.    On the other hand, it seems the presidential election has  not  left any clear-cut influences on the parties' poll figures.    It is possible that the SDP's advance could be explained as  an "Ahtisaari effect," if it were not that the advance turned  upward during the survey period, i.e., after Ahtisaari's  election win.    [Conservative Party presidential candidate] Ilaskivi's  fiasco  has not affected his party -- not to speak of Andersson's [Left  Alliance]!    In the same way, Vayrynen's result has not impacted the  Center Party; he did better than his party, despite Korhonen and  Kuuskoski. The Swedish People's Party will have to gaze at the  moon to find some "Rehn effect."    Even the Green's decline can hardly be explained by the  absence of their own candidate.    In the future the EU [European Union] issue will decide  much.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chime confirms Chartwell deal Chime Communications, Sir Tim Bell's private PR business, confirmed plans yesterday to come to market through a reverse takeover of Chartwell Group, the USM-quoted toilet cubicle and carpet tile manufacturer. The proposed deal provides a partial 34p a share cash offer for Chartwell's existing shareholders. Shares in Chartwell, which yesterday reported a substantially higher pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 445,000) in the year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 6.26m (Pounds 5.62m), were suspended last week at 48p pending an announcement. The Gravesend-based group will pay a total of Pounds 14.3m to acquire Chime, which was set up by Sir Tim in 1989 following a management buy-out from Lowe Howard Spink, the advertising company. The acquisition will be partly funded through the placing by Panmure Gordon of 11.9m new shares at 34p each with institutional shareholders to raise Pounds 4.05m. The remaining Pounds 10.2m will be satisfied through the issue of a further 30.1m shares to the vendors. A further 7.35m shares will be placed to raise Pounds 2.5m which will be used to reduce the debt incurred by Chime at the time of buy-out. The enlarged group, which will be renamed Chime Communications, has applied for a London listing. It plans to dispose of the current Chartwell businesses 'in due course'. Chime made 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 918,000) on turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 11.9m). Because of 'the fundamental change' in the nature of Chartwell's business, Chartwell's existing shareholders are being offered 34p a share cash for up to 3m shares, representing 45 per cent of its fully diluted equity.</p>

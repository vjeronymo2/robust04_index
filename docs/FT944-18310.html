			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record third-term sales for AMD Advanced Micro Devices yesterday reported record third-quarter sales, lifted by strong demand for microprocessor chips which are used in personal computers. The Silicon Valley chip maker also announced a contract to provide microprocessors to Digital Equipment, one of the fastest growing PC manufacturers. The Digital deal represents a breakthrough for AMD, which is battling with Intel, the market leader, for a bigger share of PC microprocessor sales. Intel had been Digital's sole supplier of PC microprocessors, and manufactures a large proportion of Digital's PC products. Strong sales of microprocessors helped boost AMD's third-quarter revenues to Dollars 543m, up 30 per cent from Dollars 418m in the same period last year. Net income for the quarter ending September 25 was Dollars 86.7m before the payment of preferred stock dividends. After the dividends, quarterly net income was 86 cents a share, at the low end of Wall Street projections. Net income for the comparable period last year was Dollars 61.3m before the preferred stock dividend, or 61 cents a share after the payment. 'Microprocessor sales re-mained at record levels with Am486 microprocessor sales up 7 per cent over the immediate prior quarter,' said Mr WJ Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive. Higher than expected yields from AMD's California sub-micron production facility boosted production volumes, Mr Sanders added. AMD also announced new 'flash memory' products for notebook computers, personal communicators and other applications. During the third quarter the group began production of 16-megabit flash memory chips at its new Japanese production facility, a joint venture with Fujitsu. 'We expect revenue from the Fujitsu-AMD facility in the first quarter of 1995,' Mr Sanders said. With production capacity increasing in both internal facilities and external foundries, 'we have prospects for continued overall revenue growth in our fourth quarter, if present market conditions continue', Mr Sanders added. For the first nine months of 1994, AMD reported total revenues of Dollars 1.59bn, up 29 per cent from Dollars 1.23bn. Net income was Dollars 264.5m before preferred stock dividends and Dollars 2.64 a share after dividends. In the same period last year net income was Dollars 187.1m, and per share income after dividends was Dollars 1.89.</p>

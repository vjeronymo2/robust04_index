			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Bonds to coax the cautious - Regular incomes, third of a series by Debbie Harrison s week, we look at two types of bond for the cautious investor who is seeking to guarantee income and preserve his capital. Gilts, certain corporate bonds and sterling foreign government bonds held to maturity effectively represent an IOU - you lend the money and, in return, the borrower promises to repay the loan in full at a fixed date in the future. With conventional gilts and bonds, the borrower pays interest, known as the coupon, twice a year at a fixed rate. As a general rule, the longer the term, the higher the income - but also the greater the drop in the real value of your capital. Gilts pay interest gross if you buy through the National Savings Stock Register (NSSR). This is particularly convenient for non-taxpayers and also the cheapest way to purchase. But NSSR applications are made by post, so you will not know in advance what the buying price will be. Both gilts and qualifying bonds (not including convertible and preference shares) are free of capital gains tax on any profits. Bond income is unfranked because it is classed as interest and not as dividends. This means it is paid net of 25 per cent tax, all of which can be reclaimed by non-taxpayers. With shares, only 20 per cent can be reclaimed. When assessing the income from gilts (and bonds), you need to look at three figures. The nominal value represents the original purchase price (not necessarily the one at which you buy) and is the amount you receive at redemption. The coupon tells you the interest rate that applies to the nominal value throughout the term. The market price is the present value if you buy or sell. Thus, the coupon and nominal amount determine the level of interest but the actual return or yield will depend on the buying price. The important difference between gilts and other bonds is the nature of the guarantee. Michael Dyson, director of BZW Capital Markets, says: 'Gilts are guaranteed by the government and this is the best credit you can have. Other bonds might be guaranteed by banks, companies and foreign governments, so there is an element of credit risk which is compensated for by a higher yield - usually about 0.3 per cent above gilt yields.' One other point on security: in the event of the borrower becoming insolvent, bonds rank before shares in the creditors' pecking order. Gilts and bonds are traded during the loan period, and there are no guarantees on the return of capital if you sell before the redemption date. Prices tend to reflect the market's view on future interest rates. Over an exceptional six-month period earlier this year, gilts fell by as much as 15 to 20 per cent. Interest is paid in advance, so the price will also take into account whether a recent interest payment has been made to the holder - in which case, the price is 'ex-dividend'. If the interest is still to be paid, the price is 'cum-dividend'. The price quoted in the FT is the mid-point between buying and selling prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FACTFILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gilts (held to maturity) Recent net income or yield: Non-taxpayers:     7.8%-8.9% 25% taxpayers:     5.85%-6.68% 40% taxpayers:     4.68%-5.38% Suitable for: Non-taxpayers, taxpayers seeking fixed income.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Features: Generally held for five to 10 years.

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Gorbachev to order crackdown on labour force: Stringent work decree rounds off week of political success for Soviet leader PRESIDENT Gorbachev ended a week of considerable political success with a promise to the Supreme Soviet that he would soon sign a decree for a 'special, stringent regime of work and control' in the basic industries. Appearing more relaxed and humorous than he has for months, the Soviet president praised the patriotism of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and the eight other republican leaders who signed a statement this week expressing support for the anti-crisis plan, for a return of order and for the conclusion of a union agreement. Mr Yeltsin said he would today unveil a proposal which would allow the thousands of strikers around the country to return to work 'in an elegant manner'. Mr Yevgenny Arapov, deputy chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions, said Mr Yeltsin had discussed the joint statement with the federation's leaders. A one-hour strike called by the Federation and by the Democratic Russia movement took place in parts of Russia - though not Moscow - yesterday. However, the strike committee in Minsk, the Belorussian capital, suspended action until May 21, when the republic's supreme Soviet reconvenes; and the miners in Vorkuta called off the strikes in their area. It now appears that Mr Gorbachev, and his prime minister, Mr Valentin Pavlov, have managed to shore up the anti-crisis plan with a sufficiently strong political base for an attempt to be made to implement it - though the effect of a tough, sacrificial strategy on a people already enduring steep price rises is incalculable. In his speech to the Central Committee Plenum Mr Pavlov said the 10 per cent drop in production and the Rs34bn budget shortfall in the first quarter of the year had to be staunched by immediate, harsh measures. Republics would be ordered to pay their budget contributions, special (undefined) regimes would be instituted in basic industries, transport and banks, and strikes would be banned. At the same time, Mr Pavlov held out the prospect of a coalition government (again undefined), and promised instant privatisation of small businesses and 'destatisation' of medium and large enterprises by transforming them into joint stock companies. He appears to be winning grudging support from opponents and from western observers. Mr Nikolai Petrakov, the former economic adviser to the president who resigned when Mr Gorbachev refused to back a radical pro-market strategy, wrote yesterday in Komsomolskaya Pravda that while the plan was vague and probably inflationary,the agreement between the republican presidents showed a possible consensus that 'the realistic way is to form a new union from the republics that favour it and want to join it.' A western diplomat said yesterday that the agreement showed that Mr Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin were responding to a public mood which called for practical results. He said he was 'not sanguine' that the anti-crisis plan would work.</p>

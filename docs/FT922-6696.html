			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: State works help big Japanese builders THE volatility of Japan's property market slowed orders for most contractors in the fiscal year just ended, though a steady flow of public works business bolstered revenue for the industry's larger companies. The striking contrast between the larger contractors with a broad business base and the smaller concentrated on housing and resort development was highlighted by the vastly different earnings statements released yesterday by Kajima, a general contractor, and Nichimo, an apartment builder. Kajima reported a 14.7 per cent increase in sales, to Y1,951bn (Dollars 14.67bn) and a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profit, to Y123.9bn. Nichimo Corporation, meanwhile, suffered a pre-tax loss in its first half to the end of March of Y4.9bn, compared with a profit of Y3.5bn in the same period last year. It also revealed a 59.5 per cent fall in sales, to Y17.5bn, and a 10 times increase in inventory to 2,300 apartments. Although housing starts in Japan last year fell from 1.7m to 1.37m, even the reduced production was still too much for a market damaged by a spate of speculative building in the late 1980s. Meanwhile, civil engineering contracts rose by 6.9 per cent last year, and public construction works were 18.5 per cent higher. Contractors are hoping to benefit from the Japanese government's plan to stimulate the economy by increasing budget outlays in the first half of the year, and its promise to expand investment in infrastructure. A construction industry leader, Obayashi, was bruised in spite of the cushion provided by public works spending. It reported a 12.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y52.8bn, on a 13.3 per cent increase in sales to Y1,509bn. Obayashi blamed the fall on an increase in interest payments on loans taken to cover bills unpaid by the company's customers, and by appraisal losses of Y5.6bn on securities holdings. For the current year, it is expecting a slight increase in profit to Y55bn on sales of Y1,610bn. And the current period will not be as buoyant for Kajima, which is forecasting that pre-tax profits will fall by almost 20 per cent to Y103bn on marginally higher sales of Y2,000bn. It reported that short-term holdings of land expanded from Y196bn to Y229.9bn, apparently as a result of the difficulty in offloading new properties, while its unrealised gains on short-term stocks fell from Y186.6bn to Y116.8bn last year. Two other leading contractors, Shimizu and Taisei, announced profit increases. However, they also expect the current year to be more difficult. Shimizu reported a 7.5 per cent lift in pre-tax profit to Y124.5bn, on a 13.1 per cent increase in sales to Y2,130bn, though orders received rose by only 2 per cent during the year. For the current year, Shimizu's sales are expected to grow by about 3 per cent to Y2,200bn, while pre-tax profit will remain at around Y125bn. Taisei reported an 18.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profit, to Y96.4bn, and is expecting a 6.8 per cent rise this year. Sales were 10.9 per cent higher at Y1,717bn, though revenue from housing construction fell 6.2 per cent and the company reported Y9.3bn in appraisal losses on securities holdings.</p>

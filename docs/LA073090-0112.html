			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COOK SURVIVES 14 DAYS IN QUAKE RUBBLE;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: HE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BEFORE HIS RESCUERS FOUND HIM IN THE  SHATTERED HOTEL.  </P> <P> A cook entombed for 14 days with corpses in the rubble of an  earthquake-shattered hotel said he tried to kill himself before he was pulled  from the rubble today.  </P> <P> "I thought I would not make it. I don't think I could have lasted one more  day," said Pedrito Dy, 27, who survived two weeks without food by drinking his  own urine and drips of rainwater.  </P> <P> "I tried to commit suicide several times by banging my head against the  concrete beams because I could not take it any more," he told reporters before  being flown to a hospital in Manila.  </P> <P> Dy was the third survivor found in the last four days under the rubble of the  Hyatt Terraces Hotel in Baguio, 120 miles north of Manila. A man and a woman  entombed for 11 days in an elevator shaft of the hotel were rescued Friday.  </P> <P> The hotel was among dozens of buildings toppled by a strong earthquake that hit  the northern Philippines on July 16, killing at least 1,650 people in Baguio  and nearby provinces.  </P> <P> "My pillows were the broken arms and the corpses of my dead companions,"  doctors at a Baguio hospital quoted Dy as saying after his rescue.  </P> <P> "You could say this is a miracle because he had no food for two weeks and yet  survived," said Rogelio Bay-an, a doctor at the Baguio General Hospital where  Dy was being treated.  </P> <P> Dy, who was suffering from dehydration and bruises, said he did not think any  of the 60 or so people whom hotel officials believe are trapped in the ruins  could be alive.  </P> <P> "I think I'm the last person they would get alive from the hotel," Dy said.  </P> <P> Dy, a cook who doubled as a body-building instructor at the hotel, said he was  working out in a gym with 11 people in the hotel basement when the earthquake  struck.  </P> <P> Nine of his companions were killed immediately, and the two others died of  injuries over the weekend just before rescue came.  </P> <P> "Suddenly they (the two) stopped talking. It was then that I knew they were  dead," Dy said.  </P> <P> Foreign rescue experts left Baguio a week ago saying there was no chance of  finding anyone trapped in the ruins alive.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Today the Sejm rejected the presidential  constitutional proposals. The president's press spokesman,  Andrzej Drzycimski, acknowledged this to be a conflict between  the party-dominated parliament and the president, who wanted to  make it possible for all political forces and citizens to have a  real role in the discussion on the Constitution. Sejm Speaker  Jozef Oleksy addressed the statement by Andrzej Drzycimski  during a news conference:    [Begin Oleksy recording] I do not think Poland needs any new  conflict at the top, and Poles expect good cooperation from all  of the highest bodies in authority in the state, a good mutual  understanding of the matters that are most important for Poland,  and not conflicts, collisions, rancor, and resentment. I wish  to express a deep conviction that this sort of judgement  expressed in the name of the president is an emotional judgement  in association with the decision of parliament, and that it will  not cast a shadow on the hitherto good cooperation between the  president and the Sejm.

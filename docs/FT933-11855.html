			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gt Portland rights After so many of the recent rights issues from the property sector had achieved take-up percentages in the high 90s, Great Portland Estate's announcement of a 91.1 per cent acceptance level at first appeared slightly disappointing. But sector analysts rated the issue a success against what one specialist described as a highly competitive background. Great Portland lost 4 to 191p in a turnover of 1.1m. The placement of nearly 10m shares by Cazenove could have had a slight knock-back effect, although the shares, which comprised the 4.8m rump of the issue and 5m from existing holders, were spread evenly through the market, said the analyst. The placing of the shares at 189p was thought reasonable. Elsewhere in the property sector, trading was subdued. MEPC made positive ground, rising 6 to 460p. Brixton Estates firmed 3 to 220p. International trading group BAT Industries moved against the market trend as dealers continued to focus on last week's news that price cuts from a US competitor were to be confirmed. Changes in regulation in the insurance sector were also said to have dampened enthusiasm. The shares eased 2 to 447p in trade of 2.8m. A feeling that the recent run on food manufacturing shares in general and those with strong brands in particular was overdone led to a strong showing in the sector. Cadbury-Schweppes gained 10 at 452p, Northern Foods 5 at 260p, Tate &amp; Lyle 7 at 391p, United Biscuits 7 1/2 at 366p and Unilever 7 at 960p. There was also a bounce for the much-maligned food retailers. The spate of recent downgradings - analysts are worried about overcapacity and poor margins - has led a number in the market to suggest some value might now be showing in selected stocks. Asda improved 2 3/4 to 64p, Argyll Group 5 to 296p, J. Sainsbury 9 to 467p and Tesco 2 1/2 to 205p. A squeeze in Burton helped the shares firm 3 1/2 to 74 1/2 p. Components group GKN was knocked by a double downgrading of profits expectations. The shares shed 8 to 465p after Hoare Govett weighed in with a sharp cut in its profits estimates. The securities house reduced the current year's figure by Pounds 23m to Pounds 112m and the following year's forecast by the same figure to Pounds 130m, citing continued weakness in the European automotive market. Nomura added its weight to the negative sentiment. Hopes of strong sales in the month of August helped motor dealer T. Cowie move up 6 to 237p. Hoare Govett was said to be negative on BBA, which dipped 1 1/2 to 162 1/2 p. British Aerospace put on 5 at 409p on further hopes of a favourable outcome to its negotiations for its regional jets joint venture with Taiwan. Talk of a big and lucrative order for Airbus aircraft also boosted sentiment in BAe, which builds the wings for the aircraft and also holds a 20 per cent stake in Airbus. Union Discount appreciated 7 to 158p after reporting a recovery in profits. The discount house said the continued economic upturn would enable it to reassess the prospect of resuming dividend payments. Interim profits came in at Pounds 11.3m, against a loss of Pounds 14.8m a year earlier. Lloyds Bank shares were wanted ahead of figures due on Friday, advancing 9 to 567p. Among oil issues, Shell Transport finished 5 ahead at 620p after Strauss turnbull reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. The broker believes the company will benefit from group rationalisation currently taking place. Speculation about a management shake-up at Scottish TV hung over the shares, which weakened 7 to 509p. Shares in the life insurance sector remained depressed, following last week's order from the UK Treasury for new rules requiring companies to disclose more about their products. Legal &amp; General ended 6 lower at 464p and Lloyds Abbey Life 3 cheaper at 409p. Strong interest in a bond issue by Anglian Water led lead manager Schroder to lift the size from Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m. The money is to be partly used to refinance the Pounds 36m Nordic Water acquisition. Anglian's shares slipped 2 to 471p. The positive sentiment surrounding Hartstone's recent standstill agreement with its bankers continued to buoy the share price. It rose 4 to 60p. A fall in profits knocked Merrydown and the shares dropped 16 to 268p. A bright start for a new Centre Parc site saw Scottish &amp; Newcastle firm 2 1/2 to 432p. Positive press comment on Greenalls was said to have helped the shares, which ended 5 higher at 356p. Guinness retreated after LVMH, the French luxury goods group which has a 24.6 per cent cross-holding in the brewer, forecast that its first-half 1993 earnings would drop by a quarter. LVMH said the fall was due to a downturn in the champagne business. Guinness shares partially rallied later to close 3 down at 444p. The move by Coats Viyella to issue Pounds 70m of senior convertible bonds knocked 3 off the shares, which closed at 230p. The company said the issue would be used to reduce short-term borrowing. Caution over Emap's remarks last week about the cost of new magazine launches continued to gnaw at the share price, which fell 9 to 323p.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Government wins justice bill vote The government secured a majority of 26 in the Commons last night to overturn the first of a series of amendments made by the House of Lords to the controversial criminal justice and public order bill. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, warned that changes made by the Lords would undermine the secure training centres planned for persistent juvenile offenders. But he failed to convince Mr Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP for Eltham, who joined with opposition MPs in voting against the government. Their bid to retain a Lords amendment which would have permitted the courts to choose between sending persistent juvenile offenders to the proposed secure training centres and secure accommodation controlled by local authorities was defeated by 298 votes to 272.</p>

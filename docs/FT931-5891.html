			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Westinghouse to face trial in US PHILIPPINE negotiations with Westinghouse Electric of the US for an out-of-court settlement on a bribery charge in the construction of a nuclear power plant have collapsed, paving the way for a trial at a US court. Philippine negotiators yesterday said they 'did not believe' that the latest Westinghouse proposal for a settlement 'would provide substantial benefit to the country'. They declined to divulge details. The trial is set to start on March 15 at the New Jersey federal court and could take about two months. The case was filed in December 1988 by the Philippine government and the state-run National Power Corporation (Napocor), owner of the nuclear plant, which alleged that Westinghouse and Burns and Roe, a US consultant to Westinghouse, had in 1973 bribed the late President Ferdinand Marcos, to win the contract. The 620MW plant was constructed on the Bataan Peninsula, 60km north-west of Manila, at a cost of Dollars 2.1bn. Mr Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising in 1986 and the government of Mrs Corazon Aquino mothballed the plant and initiated the court suit. The Philippine government alleged that Westinghouse and Burns and Roe illegally obtained their contracts by bribing Mr Marcos through Mr Herminio Disini, a Marcos relative. The government had also claimed that the plant was unsafe and inoperable because of allegedly defective design, construction and testing. It is seeking Dollars 26.5m (Pounds 18m) in actual damages and an unspecified amount for punitive damages. On the eve of the original trial in March 1992, the two sides came up with a provisional out-of-court settlement that involved Westinghouse payments to the Philippines of Dollars 100m in cash and cash equivalent to repair and upgrade the plant to current safety standards. In return, Westinghouse was supposed to be granted a licence to operate the plant for 30 years, selling electricity to Napocor at a pre-set price. Subsequent negotiations, however, failed to resolve the price at which the output from the Bataan plant will be purchased by Napocor, according to Manila officials. The freeze on the nuclear plant had left the Philippines with a severe shortage of electric-power generating capacity.</p>

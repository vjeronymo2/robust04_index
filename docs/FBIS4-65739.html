			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Manuel Estape report: "Camdessus Does Not Believe That </F> Atmosphere of Corruption Will Affect Economic Recovery in Spain"]    [Text] Madrid -- IMF Director General Michel Camdessus  believes that the atmosphere of corruption experienced in Spain  will not affect economic recovery and acknowledges that the  institution he heads was overly pessimistic in forecasting a  1-percent growth rate for the Spanish economy this year. "Growth  could be a little higher," he stated at a news conference with  which he yesterday concluded a two-day visit to Spain, during  which he met with the king, the prime minister, the economy  minister, and representatives of the financial and academic  communities.    Camdessus believes that the phenomena and the turmoil  created  by the atmosphere of corruption "cannot delay investment  decisions amply justified by the macroeconomic prospects and the  growth potential" of the Spanish economy. The IMF chief  concludes from the contacts held over the past two days that  "there are already some initial figures that clearly point to an  economic recovery, such as the value-added tax revenue and the  performance of the balance of trade and the housing market." In  addition, at his meetings with Spanish bankers, he was informed  of the existence of "signs" of a revival of investment, which  would thus become "the second driving force of growth, giving  way later," he added, "to a recovery in domestic consumption,"  the variable that has fallen furthest during the recession,  owing to the "2-percent" increase in the family savings rate  because of the fear of unemployment.    The IMF director general yesterday sought to make quite  clear  his support for the government's economic policy, a policy that  should extend and accelerate the structural reforms. "It is  very satisfactory that, despite the recession, the Spanish  Government has undertaken a crucial dual initiative to restore  sustained and job-creating growth -- the reduction of the public  deficit and the far-reaching measures to make the labor market  more flexible." Michel Camdessus emphasized that the "budget  deficit in the first quarter was well below" that of a year ago.    In his opinion, "the government has decided to do many  important things; it must now implement them, and quickly," and  so he expressed his "joy" at the "good prospects" of the reform  of the labor market being approved in the Cortes. The IMF, he  pointed out, "supports what the government is trying to do" with  the labor reform, and "there are already promising results  concerning the introduction of some measures," he said,  referring to the apprenticeship contract, stressing that "this  is the direction that must be taken if people want this country  to reduce its high unemployment rate through growth and labor  flexibility."    He warned, however, that further steps should be taken in  order to ensure that "the small and medium-sized enterprises are  not afraid to recruit." It will be necessary "to continue to  reduce the obstacles to finalizing labor contracts, continue to  cut labor costs, improve vocational training, and increase the  quality of the job supply, because this country must create  skilled jobs and can do so, although it will take time."  Camdessus regretted not "having been able to reach agreement  with the trade unions" in the course of his "brief" visit, and  expressed his intention to meet with them "before the October  meeting in Madrid."    The most critical assessment that Camdessus made concerning  the Spanish economy's performance was in taking the view that  keeping inflation between 4 and 5 percent -- a level that is  "certainly too high" -- will force the Bank of Spain to cut  interest rates cautiously. Control over inflation and the  public deficit will make it possible in the long term to ensure  sustained growth with lower interest rates.    Michel Camdessus would not answer in specific terms a  question on whether the conduct of the former Bank of Spain  governor and the former Civil Guard director general invalidates  one of his "prescriptions" against corruption -- improving  officials' training and pay. "I will not talk about specific  cases until justice has been done, because the presumption of  innocence applies to everybody." The IMF official emphasized  that "corruption is a universal scourge," and pointed out that  "where it is not known, it is hidden under some form of  totalitarianism." The important thing "in Spain, on the other  side of the Pyrenees, and in any developed country" is that  corruption be prosecuted, that there be strong and democratic  institutions, and that "some trees" be prevented "from hiding  the quality and the high sense of public service existing in the  Spanish administration."</p>

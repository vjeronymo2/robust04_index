			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Mexico to privatise air and sea ports MEXICO IS to sell concessions to manage the country's airports and sea ports, deepening its commitment to privatise much of basic national infrastructure, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The Airports and Auxiliary Services said the first airports to be sold are likely be those at the Caribbean resort of Cancun and at Tijuana on the US border. Both require new terminals. Mr Carlos Cardenas, head of the national chamber of construction, told El Economista newspaper that airport concessions for up to 20-30 years are likely to be sold. Foreign investors will almost certainly be welcome.</p>

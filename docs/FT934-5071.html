			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Charities left unimpressed - VAT compensation THE MEASURE A compensation package for low-income households following the extension of VAT on domestic fuel and power from 8 per cent from April 1994, to 17.5 per cent in 1995. IN DETAIL Income-related benefits will rise by 3.9 per cent next April, which Mr Clarke said would be 'a lot more than many people in work will get next year'. Furthermore, Mr Clarke promised an extra Pounds 1.25bn a year in benefits for 15m people from April 1994. It will be apportioned in this way: Single pensioners will receive a 50p a week increase in the rate and pensioner couples 70p a week from April 1994 in addition to the regular uprating of benefits. It is also intended to award the same weekly cash increases in April 1995, taking extra overall help to Pounds 1 for single pensioners and Pounds 1.40 for couples, weekly, amounting to total extra help of Pounds 1.30 for singles and Pounds 1.85 for couples by April 1996. The same benefit increases will be made for those on widow and invalidity pensions, and those disabled people on income support. Mr Clarke said: 'By April 1996 benefits will be Pounds 1.40 a week higher for single poorer pensioners and Pounds 2 a week higher for couples than they would otherwise have been.' He also announced an increase in cold weather payments - the extra benefit payable following seven successive days of zero temperatures - from Pounds 6 a week currently to Pounds 7 a week next winter, with a further 50p the following winter. Mr Clarke announced that funds for the home energy efficiency scheme, which provides grants for home insulation, will be almost doubled, to Pounds 35m a year for the next three years, and pensioners and all dis-abled people will in future be eligible for the scheme. The measure should mean an extra 200,000 pensioner households are eligible to receive grants; more than 500,000 such grants have been made since the scheme started in 1991. THE BACKGROUND Mr Clarke said that the compensation package 'will ensure that the introduction of VAT does not put the cost of fuel beyond the reach of the poorest in our society.' He said the immediate impact of the new measures will mean that, for instance, a pensioner couple on income support will have a total benefit increase of Pounds 4 a week. Mr Peter Jenkins, VAT specialist at Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday that 'while the extra payment takes the sting out of the tail of extending VAT to fuel bills by helping the most disadvantaged, there is a sizeable number of low wage-earners who will be hit very hard when the VAT jumps to 17.5 per cent in 1995. I think there is still a lot of political flak to come on this issue.' For Lady Sally Greengross, director of the charity Age Concern England, the compensation package 'is not enough. Fifty pence for a single person is only between half and two-thirds of the amount needed to fully compensate for VAT on fuel, and 70p for a couple is only about two-thirds of the amount needed, and these are average figures.' That view was echoed yesterday by the sister charity Age Concern Scotland, whose director Maureen O'Neill said: 'This doesn't go anywhere near enough . . . charities and retirement homes are statutorily required to keep temperatures at a certain level; this package does nothing to help them.'</p>

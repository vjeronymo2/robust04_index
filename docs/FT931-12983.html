			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / PSA privatisation reaches the final stage THE government yesterday launched the final stage of the privatisation of the Property Services Agency. It announced the sale of PSA's five building management businesses, which conduct most of the maintenance and upkeep of government buildings. The five businesses, based in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and London, employ 9,000 people and should have a combined fee income of Pounds 311m in this financial year. The announcement comes two months after the controversial sale of the agency's projects division to Tarmac, which will cost the government up to Pounds 90m to cover liabilities and redundancy costs. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm advising the government, said the management businesses were considerably healthier than the project division. Mr Andrew Jordan, a partner, said he believed that the prices commanded by the businesses would more than offset the redundancy costs the government had agreed to pay. The businesses are all in profit. For the past 15 months they have been under the temporary management of Bovis which aimed to improve their efficiency, systems and customer relations. Mr Jordan said: 'They are remarkably good given they are government departments. They are surprisingly commercial.' The businesses have lost contracts over the past few years following the decision to allow the private sector to compete for government business. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the companies expected to make up for the lost business over the next five years by competing actively for new work. The sale, to be conducted by competitive tender, will be advertised throughout the European Community. Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said he would prefer to sell each of the five businesses to a different buyer, although bids for more than one business would be allowed. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said it had received interest from more than 70 businesses, including contractors, consultants, utilities and building management companies. Preliminary bids will be submitted by March 9, after which final offers will be invited from shortlisted bidders. The guidelines for the sale provide that the deal should look after the interests of clients, taxpayers and staff. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said it would try to sell to a buyer able to provide the maximum number of jobs and one with sufficient financial strength to honour redundancy obligations. The government will guarantee redundancy payments in the event of the buyer going bankrupt in the next five years. After the sale of the building management businesses, the sole remaining part of the PSA in the Department of the Environment will be Property Holdings.</p>

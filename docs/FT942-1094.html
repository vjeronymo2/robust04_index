			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / How to spend it: Outdoor accessories at the forefront of fashion WOODEN FURNITURE Simple but finely-made oak garden furniture is offered by Gaze Burvill, a small company. Every piece is designed to be in tune with the more muted, subtle approach that seems to suit the English garden. Only English oak, one of Britian's most durable woods, is used, with the timber coming from carefully managed estates. Though some tools and machinery are, of course, used (in particular for steam-bending the wood which gives the comfortable, curving corners) each piece is essentially made and finished by hand. Photographed above is the Court Seat - elegant, under-stated and durable - with comfortable curves, angles and wide seat slats. It comes in two, three or four-seat versions and price ranges from Pounds 885 to Pounds 1,075. Gaze Burvill will be showing its products at the Hampton Court Palace Garden exhibition, which runs from July 6-10. The workshop at Plain Farm Old Dairy, East Tisted, Hampshire, GU34 3RT, can also be visited by appointment (tel: 0420-587467) and a selection of colour photographs and a price list for all pieces is available from the address above. OLD ACCESSORIESus, when he disposed of a lifetime's collectables, that it was quite amazing what people would pay for a couple of battered flower-pots or some rusty spades if you could call them 'old' or 'antique'. And in some cases, the epithets can actually stand for better quality as well. Take spades. Those who know about such things tell me confidently that good-quality Victorian or Edwardian spades are far sturdier and more handsome than any of their modern equivalents. The Chelsea Gardener of 125 Sydney Street, London SW3 has given over a corner of the building to Marmaduke, a concession which supplies a constantly changing selection of old implements. Handsome, sturdy spades and hoes range between Pounds 34.95 and Pounds 50, trowels start at Pounds 11.95, watering-cans at Pounds 34.95, a reel and line for marking out straight lines when planting seeds is Pounds 34.95. The best brand-names to look out for, the ones with the longest tradition, are - Brades, Skelton, Griffin Brand, Spear and Jackson 'Neverbend', and Elwell. A few old garden accessories, such as wheelbarrows, have been purloined by the interior decorating and design set and their prices have risen accordingly. At Marmaduke it is hard to find one at much less than Pounds 300. METAL FURNITUREFor those who like to leave their garden furniture outside all year round, Boundary Metal makes the furniture that meets the brief. It is rustproof and heavy enough to be difficult to steal (a very important point this: in our part of London there seem to be gangs of thieves who specialise in garden accoutrements). In the standard range there are several benches, chairs (such as the one photographed here, Pounds 171) and tables, but the company is small and friendly enough to enjoy handling special orders. Recently they have created a series of pagodas (such as the one photographed here - prices start at Pounds 700), as well as decorative structures encircling trees. All the furniture is sold from its Newbury offices (Boundary Metal, Boundary Road, Newbury, Berkshire RG14 5RT) and there is a small to selection to view there. Otherwise there is a leaflet available (tel: 0635-42255) and furniture will be dispatched by carrier. RATTAN FURNITUREStrictly speaking, Rattan is not the ideal material for garden furniture as it is neither weatherproof nor easy to move around. But it looks more romantic and is more comfortable (when propped with cushions) than metal or wood. The Pier has one of the biggest selections around. Alison Richards, The Pier's founder and managing director, believes that the market for rattan is expanding, with many people using it not just for the conservatory but for country cottage living rooms, bedrooms and dining rooms. For the eco-conscious it is worth knowing that rattan is, (so The Pier's excellent information sheet on rattan tells me) a renewable plant which can be collected and used without destroying either the vine or the trees themselves. Most rattan furniture comes from the areas where it grows most freely - Southern China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and The Philippines. Photographed here are a sofa (Pounds 149), chair (Pounds 75) and coffee table (Pounds 65). For those who prefer their rattan to look rather more decorative there is the curvier (and more expensive) Raffles Collection and the yet more decorative Savannah. The Pier has 10 shops around the UK but none further north than Birmingham, so it offers delivery by post. (Tel: 0235-821088 for details and brochure.) Global Village sells a particularly refined and decorative collection of rattan, much of it with an antiqued finish. In particular there is a wonderful colonial high-back chair which two years ago it was selling at Pounds 250 a time and today it is offering at Pounds 195 (either in forest green or biscuity antiqued finish). Global Village has six shops in all. Tel: 0935-823390 for details and brochure. PEBBLESIf you have more a pocket handkerchief than an estate, design matters more than ever - and in particular, the relationship between paving stones and grass and plants. Blot Kerr-Wilson has started applying her decorative skills to gardens. In collaboration with an artist, Tim Coppard, she uses small pebbles to create patterned surfaces on the ground. Each job is different and is done to commission, so prices vary enormously. In addition, materials used can vary from the white marble and beach pebbles used in this commission (pictured), to glass, stone, brick, slate or other materials. Contact Blot Kerr-Wilson, 49 Northfield House, Peckham Park Road, London SE15 6TL. Tel: 071-639 2277.</p>

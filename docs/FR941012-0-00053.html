OSHA Fatality/Catastrophe Investigations Report (FCI). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OSHA regulations require that all workplace fatalities be reported to the nearest OSHA Area Office. Employers are required to complete a Fatality/Catastrophe Event Report Form (OSHA 36), which is reviewed by the OSHA Area Director to determine whether an investigation of the fatality is warranted. In 1989, OSHA published a study of 141 logging fatalities that occurred during the period of 1978&hyph;84 (Ex. 4&hyph;61). These fatalities do not represent all logging industry fatalities during that time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the study, 71 percent of those logging employees killed were out in the cutting area. Only one percent each were killed on skid trails or at landings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The study also indicated that 43 percent of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> killed were felling trees at the time. Employees performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yarding and bucking and limbing operations each accounted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for 13 percent of the fatalities. The overwhelming majority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of employees (72%) were killed when they were struck or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crushed by a tree, log or limb, while 17 percent were killed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in machine accidents. One percent were killed in chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unsafe work practices, misjudgments and lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training or supervision accounted for 42 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatalities while less than one percent were due to equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6. Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The State of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine Bureau of Labor Statistics (Maine BLS) has compiled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various statistics on injuries and fatalities in the logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry (Ex. 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;175, 4&hyph;176).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine BLS conducted a detailed survey of 189 logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee injuries that occurred between May and July of 1982  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 4&hyph;175). This number does not represent all logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees who were injured during that period. According to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this survey, 35 percent of employees reporting injuries were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> struck by trees, logs or limbs. Chain-saw accidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounted for 26 percent of the reported injuries while 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the logging employees were injured in slips or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Maine BLS, the category that showed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly higher than average percentage of disabling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries was chain-saw accidents. Over one-half of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain-saw accidents involved kickback. In over 70 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the kickback accidents, the chain saws were equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain brakes. Maine BLS said that chain brakes had played a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant role in lessening the effects of the injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Less than 13 percent of chain-saw accidents where chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brakes were present resulted in hospitalization, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearly 50 percent of the accidents involving other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain saws resulted in hospitalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This survey also indicates that two-thirds of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging accidents resulted in lost workdays and 13 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all injuries required at least one overnight in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital. The average hospitalization was for five days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine BLS has also compiled statistics from 1980&hyph;87 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain-saw injuries that resulted in a first report of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious injury (Ex. 4&hyph;176). According to this report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average chain-saw injuries for each year was 362. Of those,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an average of 237 (65%) were disabling injuries, that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries which result in lost workdays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maine BLS has also examined disabling logging injuries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported from 1985&hyph;87 that had resulted in lacerations (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4&hyph;174). During those three years, there were an average of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 183 disabling lacerations each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 7. Washington State Logging Fatalities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study has been compiled on logging fatalities in the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Washington from 1977&hyph;83 (Ex. 4&hyph;129). Of the 135  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatalities that occurred during those years, the study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed 92 percent of them. Death certificates and reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of investigations by Washington OSHA were used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to this study, the overall annual fatality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for logging during this period was approximately 2 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,000 full-time employees. Those employees who were killed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had a mean length of experience in the logging industry of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.6 years. Less than 10 percent had less than one year's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More than 40 percent of all loggers killed were engaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in felling activities, while 23 percent were killed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing yarding operations. Almost 20 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loggers were operating logging machines at the time of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident. Table 20 shows the jobs employees were performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time of their accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

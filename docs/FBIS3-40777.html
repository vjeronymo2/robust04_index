			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thirunavukkarasu, M.G.R.-ADMK (Anna Dravida </F> Munnetra Kazhagam) General Secretary: "Election-Epilogue: Empty  Rhetoric That Won't Fill the Stomach"]    [Text] The results of the state assembly elections held in  Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan,  Delhi and Mizoram have given a shock as well as good lessons to  many political parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] which  was in power in four of the six states, was able to form a  ministry only in Rajasthan and that too, with the help of a few  independents and faced defeat in the other three states. Delhi  is the new one where BJP formed the ministry. The crushing  defeat of the BJP in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar  Pradesh will prove to be a good turning point in the future of  Indian politics.    In Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav-Kansi Ram coalition was  successful. The voters did not care in casting their vote  whether it was for a national party or a local party. All that  they were concerned with was whetheror not the party could  provide them with a better life. This has been amply  demonstrated by the results. It is a wonder in the Indian  political scene that the state that has been traditionally  giving Prime Ministers to the nation elected regional parties.  The results also indicate that the prefix, 'national' alone  cannot bring about good results. P.V. Narasimha Rao is the first  person from Southern India to hold the position of the Prime  Minister and his position has now been well strengthened by  these "mini-general elections." Now he can deal with his rivals  in his party effectively and bring about control and discipline  in the party. His stature now not only scares his own party men  but also opposition parties. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister  Jayalalitha's recent visit to Delhi is an interesting example.  During her last visit to the capital, she stayed with Advani and  met with Rao's rivals--Arjun Singh and Sharat Pawar, much to the  annoyance of Rao and came back without seeing the Prime  Minister. This time, she sought time to see him in advance, met  him, gave him a flower bouquet and a golden shawl, and also had  pictures taken She forgot the 'generation gap', for publicity in  the news media. She had to do this due to her fear. When fear  creeps in, a person will do anything.    Due to the breakdown of discipline, infighting and group  politics, the Congress Party was pulled down to its present  miserable plight. The Congress was taught a lesson for its dual  stand in the case of Babri Mosque and Ram Janma Bhoomi issues.  Neither Hindus nor Muslims accept the Congress Party's stand.  The demolition of the mosque has brought down the prestige of  India in the international arena. India's secularism and unity  also suffered a severe blow. Though all this was due to the BJP,  the Congress had to pay the price. In the future, the Congress  Party has to be firm in protecting and enforcing secularism and  also be very vigilant and nip in the bud any divisive movements  and religious fanatics' activities with firmness and sincerity.  This is the message that both Hindus and Muslims have jointly  delivered to the Congress Party. This itself is a victory for  secularism.    The Janata Dal, which had grown to be a national alternative  to the Congress in the northern states was rejected by the  people. This is not a good sign for India's political health.  Even for a lamp of gold to keep its flame steady and effective a  device is necessary. Ruling parties should have effective  opposition parties. The weakening of these parties is not a good  sign. The people do not trust in the opportunistic alliance led  by V.P. Singh Chandra Shekhar and Ajit Singh. It is better that  those leaders who sincerely oppose the religious fanatics,  should quit these groups and join the Congress. It will be good  for them as well as the Congress Party. This may result in  adding to the formation of another group within the Congress  Party.    Anybody could come into power and that too, with a big  majority. During their regime, if the legitimate needs of the  people are not provided for, the voters may throw out the rulers  whom they installed in power. This has been proved just now.  Attractive slogans may be sweet and pleasing to the ears of the  people, but can not fill their stomachs. If there is a clash  between ears and stomachs, undoubtedly the victory is always for  the stomach. The many slogans and disguises of the BJP caused  great disappointment to the people.    Even the worst rulers, while in power, may appear to  everybody that they are at the top of their popularity. But when  the frustrated people wake up, they will give their rulers a  crushing defeat, without any hope of their coming up again. This  is the lesson from Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to the  rulers, past and present.    Our people are not fully literate, but they are endowed with  a robust common sense. Attractive slogans, pomp and pageantry  and agitations alone cannot deceive everybody all the time. This  is the message, a lesson delivered by the voters of northern  India to all the political parties. Greetings to the voters!</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku 17 May TASS -- "The position of Azerbaijan  remains unchanged. It stands for the settlement of the Karabakh  problem in the CSCE framework", Vafa Gulidze, the republican  state adviser on foreign policy, told TASS on Tuesday after  Azerbaijan refused to sign a ceasefire protocol brokered by  Moscow between the warring sides.    He rejected mass media reports that Azerbaijan had accepted  only the Russian plan according to which Russian peace-keepers  are to be deployed in the zone of conflict. "These allegations  are absolutely groundless and can be assesseed as pressure on  the republic", Gulidze said.    "We are not against cooperation with Russia, however the  Armenian-Azeri conflict has acquired an international character  and can be resolved only in the framework of the CSCE of which  Russia is a member", he stressed.    According to Gulidze, neither the president, nor the foreign  minister, nor he himself have seen the document discussed in  Moscow.    At the same time he recalled that Azerbaijan had agreed on  Monday with the document proposed by the chairman of the CSCE  Minsk Group for Karabakh which envisages a ceasefire,  disengagement of troops and a simultaneous withdrawal of  Armenian forces from occupied Azeri territories.    Armenians have in words agreed with the proposal too, but  did  not sign it explaining that they are unaware of the results of  the Moscow meeting of defence ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia,  and Russia, according to Gulidze.</p>

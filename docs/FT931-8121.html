			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / The Long View: Gilts buck the odds NOT A lot of people know this because, unlike new stock market highs, it does not make headlines - but the yield on long-dated British government securities dropped this week to near 8 1/2 per cent, the lowest level for 21 years. Far from being demoralised by the prospect of massive government funding at the rate of Pounds 1bn a week over the next year, the gilt-edged market is hitting back. It would be nice to think that the reason was the rising credibility of the British government's economic strategy, but a glance at the rest of the major bond markets around the world reveals a general trend. The US long treasury bond yield, for instance, has declined from 7.5 to 7.0 per cent since early December, and only junk bond markets such as that of Italy - where 10-year government bonds yield over 13 per cent - have really stood out. It would seem, therefore, that falling bond yields are primarily the consequence of the global recession. There is a check on this in the UK gilt-edged market, in the gap between the nominal yield on fixed coupon issues and the real yield on the index-linkers. This gap, which is a rough-and-ready measure of long run inflation expectations, has stayed steady at around 5 per cent so far. It is the real yield that has fallen. Now, there are no absolutely simple explanations for global trends and something more has to be said about the US, where there appears to be an economic recovery under way. President Clinton's tax threats this week, and his promises of a 40 per cent cut in the US budget deficit to just over Dollars 200bn by 1997, have had something to do with the bond market's cheeriness. At the same time, the US stock market, which has existed for many months on hope and hype, was jolted by the implied constraint on economic growth. It is unusual for the bond market and the equity market to move in different directions. In the classic stock market cycle, bond prices rise first but stock prices soon follow - albeit with a time lag of around six to 12 months. Market strategists monitor closely the ratios between fixed interest and equity yields, and they do not expect the relationship to change very much over time. But we are not dealing with a normal business cycle. This week's bumper batch of British economic statistics included confirmation of the third successive annual fall in manufacturing output, the first time this has been seen since the beginning of the 1930s. What is happening is something outside the experience of post-war economic fluctuations, but fits in with notions of a long-term Kondratieff cycle. Normally, a rising bond market would be expected to carry the stock market along with it. But the yield ratio has now dipped below 2, a figure which it has exceeded consistently - averaging perhaps 2.3 - during the past 20 years while sterling has been floating (although it also fell below 2 while the UK was in the European exchange rate mechanism). Such a fall in the ratio says something about pessimism over dividend growth, and also something about optimism over low inflation. On Tuesday, the Bank of England published its fascinating first quarterly Inflation Report, in which it warned that the government could have difficulty in holding underlying inflation below 4 per cent over the next two years. My own feeling is that there is a necessity for a certain amount of inflation in the sterling prices of traded goods so that British manufacturing industry will gain the incentive to reverse the disturbing trend in the balance of payments. But how can this imported inflation be prevented from triggering pay rises? Real incomes of those in work have continued to rise steadily during the recession, as a red line on a Bank of England chart displays neatly. But unemployment has passed 3m and, even on the official definition, it will soon also be at levels not seen since the 1930s. Will employees at last grit their teeth and submit to a cut in real pay? In the 1930s, the inflation rate rose by around 6 percentage points after the pound was devalued in 1931, but retail prices still increased by only about 2 per cent a year because they had actually been falling by 4 per cent annually from the late 1920s. Cheap money, cheap labour, cheap property and gently rising prices permitted reasonably vigorous economic growth. Gilt-edged yields subsided from 4.5 per cent in 1931 to about 3 per cent by 1936, and equity dividend yields fluctuated between about 5 and 3.5 per cent; shares, being riskier, had to yield more than government bonds. Such bond yields seem unbelievable to us today, but remember that they are already reappearing in Japan where 10-year bonds return about 4.1 per cent. In the UK, the most recent period of really low inflation was a six-year spell between 1958 and 1963 when it averaged 1.9 per cent a year (including nil in 1959). In those conditions, gilt-edged yields held at 5 to 6 per cent and the yield ratio was little over 1; indeed, it was in the 1959 bull market that the phrase 'reverse yield gap' emerged. The reverse gap initially reflected rapid growth in the economy and, therefore, in dividends, but later mainly reflected inflation. This week, the stuffy bankers of the IMF told the British government to raise taxes and cut spending, the early 1930s' recipe. On the other hand, the government is perceived generally to have an incompatible duty to keep an overpaid and underproductive British work-force in jobs. For its part, the government is enthusing thoughtlessly over the surely dangerous combination of rising retail sales and stagnant industrial output. To believe in British government bonds yielding 8 1/2 per cent, you have to believe that the hidden hand of Kondratieff is imposing inevitable deflation. It is no longer looking such a silly idea.</p>

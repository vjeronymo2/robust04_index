			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Kyocera improves at operating level Buoyant demand for cellular telephones and electronic components supported an 8 per cent increase in consolidated sales at Kyocera, the world's largest maker of ceramic packages and electronic parts. Kyocera, whose broad product range also includes microprocessors, karaoke equipment and artificial bones, enjoyed a 27 per cent rise in operating profits in the first six months of the fiscal year, to Y26.8bn (Dollars 292.3m) from a previous Y21.1bn, on sales higher at Y228.9bn from Y211.2bn. However, recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - slid 24 per cent to Y33.1bn compared with Y43.5bn last year. The year-ago figures were boosted by gains from the listing of DDI, the telecommunications company in which Kyocera owns 22 per cent, and a share offering from two companies in which Kyocera is a leading shareholder. Net profits were also down by 19 per cent to Y18.6bn from Y23bn because of last year's gains. During the latest period, Kyocera benefited from the surge in world semiconductor markets, which supported rising demand for its components. As a result, sales in the fine ceramics division rose 12 per cent. Electronic components sales climbed 2 per cent on the back of strong sales to the PC and mobile telephone markets. Surging demand in the domestic cellular telephones market since liberalisation in April also boosted the company. In addition, the popularity of its karaoke equipment combined to lift sales in the electronics equipment division by 9 per cent. The company is forecasting a 14 per cent rise in parent sales to Y344bn in the full year; a 43 per cent increase in recurring profits to Y50bn; and a 21 per cent rise in net profits to Y26.8bn.</p>

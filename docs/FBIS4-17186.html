			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Semena: "Defense Ministers Attempt to </F> Divide Up Black Sea Fleet"]    [Text] Sevastopol -- A Russian-Ukrainian defense  ministers' meeting is taking place in Sevastopol. It will  devise a mechanism for dividing up the Black Sea Fleet in  accordance with the presidents' 16 April Moscow decision.    It was learned in Sevastopol that vice admiral V.  Bezkorovaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, was in Kiev on  the eve of the meeting to participate in the elaboration of the  preparatory documents. According to him, the fleet could be  divided up in two stages. At the first stage, it would be  decided who the fleet's personnel in service afloat belong to  and at the second stage it would be decided to whom the  infrastructure belongs. Ukraine, as has been said before,  intends to share the fleet's combat might, but not the pennants  on each auxiliary ship.    A fierce argument has been raging for some days now in  Sevastopol over the future basing of the Black Sea Fleet and  Ukrainian Navy, which could turn out to be the most difficult  question in the course of the meeting. The presidents, as in  known, decided that the fleets could not continue to stay in the  same city. But who would have to leave Sevastopol?    The question had been submitted to a city soviet session. On  the eve of the session Ukrainian Navy Commander in Chief V.  Bezkorovaynyy and the Ukrainian Navy Military Council sent a  letter to City Council Chairman V. Semenov questioning the  advisability of conducting a session with that agenda following  the presidents' decision. But an emergency session of the  Sevastopol City Council, discussing the matter on 19 April,  "deemed the presidents' decision valid" and "roundly condemned  the practice of confrontation between the two fleets due to the  vacillation and inconsistency of the top people in Ukraine and  Russia in tackling the problem of the Black Sea Fleet." The  deputies adopted a decision "suggesting to the leaders of  Ukraine that the headquarters and other facilities of the  Ukrainian Navy be moved from Sevastopol and stationed  elsewhere." Moreover, the session adopted a decision to conduct  an opinion poll in Sevastopol on the status of the city and  approved the poll form bearing the following text: "Are you in  favor of Sevastopol having the status of chief base of the  Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet in accordance with the  Ukrainian-Russian protocol of 3 September 1993? Yes or no." The  city soviet intends to conduct the poll on 26 June, presidential  election day in Ukraine.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Observer: Cover-up Fresh signs that the accountancy profession is beginning to buckle under the strain of too many members breaking too many regulations. Accountancy magazine, the official organ of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, has decided to stop publishing, for reasons of space, the names of those knuckle-rapped by its disciplinary committee. Unless readers object in large numbers, 'consent orders' for minor misdemeanours will no longer even be hidden in small print at the back of the magazine.</p>

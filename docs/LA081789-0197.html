			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINA'S DEFENSE CHIEF, SEVERAL OFFICERS HELD  </P> <P> Soldiers loyal to China's president detained the defense minister and several  commanders in a dispute over a top military post vacated by Zhao Ziyang, the  purged Communist Party boss, Chinese sources said today.  </P> <P> They said President Yang Shangkun, a central figure in the martial law  crackdown, apparently ordered the action to strengthen his control of the  Chinese military.  </P> <P> In the military power struggle, soldiers loyal to Yang went to the Beijing  residence of Defense Minister Qin Jiwei about 6:40 p.m. Wednesday and took him  and one of his armed guards away, the sources said.  </P> <P> Other troopers detained the heads of the Beijing, Guangzhou and Nanjing  military districts, who support Qin and who were in Beijing for an important  meeting, they said.  </P> <P> Control of the military is essential in high-level Chinese politics. Senior  leader Deng Xiaoping's only official post is chairman of the Central Military  Commission, China's top military body.  </P> <P> Qin and Yang have been competing to become first vice chairman of the  commission, left vacant by Zhao's dismissal June 24.  </P> <P> In Beijing, government spokesman Yuan Mu confirmed reports that student leader  Wang Dan had been arrested and said Zhao, who has not been seen in public since  May 18, is leading a "completely normal life."  </P> <P> A Shanghai newspaper said authorities have arrested or are investigating 99  people accused of involvement in illegal workers' groups that plotted to  establish a "people's party" and to kidnap officials. The Shanghai Liberation  Daily said the groups planned to overthrow the government.  </P> <P> Staff members of the Guangming Daily, the Communist Party's leading newspaper  for intellectuals, said senior editor Yao Xihua, 61, has been "asked to  retire."  </P></p>

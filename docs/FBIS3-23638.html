			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ukrainian Navy Press Center Senior Officer </F> Captain-Lieutenant Albiy Shydrya: "The Admiral Has Questions,  But the Sailors From Ukraine Can Only Remain Silent"]    [Text] Commander of the Black Sea Fleet [ChF] Eduard  Baltin, accompanying Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov during his  visit to Sevastopol, himself began asking the journalists  questions instead of giving answers. "Who drew the borders of  Ukraine?" asked the admiral. And immediately in the same spirit:  "Ukraine had five oblasts within the 1939 borders, and has 26  now. Who has been pursuing an imperial policy--Russia or  Ukraine?" (The admiral, by the way, made a "trifling"  arithmetical error here, for some reason counting Ukraine with  26 oblasts instead of the 24.)    Noting the embarrassment of the representatives of the mass  media, who had in no way expected such attacks directed at  Ukraine from the commander of the fleet of the two nations,  Admiral Eduard Baltin promised that "our people" would soon be  able to meet with him for a more detailed discussion on that  topic.    So now here is Admiral Baltin, who has gained a reputation  as  a cautious commander, not concealing his antipathy toward  Ukraine and starting to talk the language of the odious Russian  leaders. This visibly reflects the situation in the ChF, whose  commander fulfills only orders from the Russian Navy. The  uniform of the armed forces of Russia with the corresponding  insignia has been introduced in the fleet, in violation of the  Yalta agreements. Draftees from Ukraine, making up 50 percent of  the fleet, are being indoctrinated in the spirit of loyalty to  the Russian leadership... Need we be surprised that the  commander of the fleet is now proposing that we think where the  state border of Ukraine should really be, starting the division  into "ours" and "not ours"?    Just whose interests does the command of the Black Sea Fleet  intend to protect on the territory of Ukraine?</p>

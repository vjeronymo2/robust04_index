			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Birmingham plans rail station switch BIRMINGHAM'S main city-centre railway station will be replaced by a Pounds 50m out-of-town terminal under proposals put forward by British Rail and the city council yesterday. The new terminal would be built 1 1/2 miles north-east of Birmingham New Street station in the redevelopment area administered by the Heartlands Development Corporation. All InterCity trains and some suburban trains using New Street would switch to Heartlands, leaving New Street as a local station of half its present size. The Heartlands station, which would have road links with the nearby M6, would have parking for 4,000 cars. It would be connected to the city centre by local rail services and the planned Midland Metro light rapid-transit network. A substantial part of the cost of the project would be met by the redevelopment of the city- centre land released by the shrinkage of New Street station. New Street is handling more than 600 trains a day - twice the number it was designed for - and congestion is limiting plans for big increases in local rail services. Birmingham City Council said the project would not only produce a national 'gateway' station worthy of the city but provide for the next logical step in the development of the city centre. The proposed Heartlands terminal would be served mainly by existing tracks. British Rail believes the project could be completed by the end of the decade.</p>

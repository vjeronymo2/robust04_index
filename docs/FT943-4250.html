			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong margins rise helps Royal Doulton to Pounds 2.62m A strong improvement in manufacturing margins helped Royal Doulton, the china table ware group, report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.62m for the first half of 1994, against losses of Pounds 3.79m. Sales were 4.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 101m, against Pounds 96.7m. Excluding currency effects the advance was 5.3 per cent. Mr Stuart Lyons, chief executive, said the group had enjoyed a good start to the year in spite of difficulties in North America and Japan. Order books were running at their highest levels since 1989 and demand was estimated to be some 3 to 4 per cent ahead of last year. This had allowed the factories to return to five-day working compared with four-day last year, and helped to improve factory margins from 42 to 44 per cent. Profits were also enhanced by the absence of Pounds 3.1m in non-recurring items which arose as a result of the December demerger from Pearson, the media conglomerate which owns the Financial Times. The group's first half was marred by difficulties in the North American distribution businesses, which fell victim to aggressive price cutting from competitors. The group had been forced to introduce cuts of between 8 and 15 per cent. Mr Lyons said improved efficiency in the factories, higher output margins and rising sales allowed the group to cut prices there without any impact on profitability. Nevertheless, market share had fallen and North America now accounted for 30 per cent of overall sales, against 33 per cent last year. Japan, where Royal Doulton has a 50 per cent owned joint venture, remained very competitive, and gross margins fell. Losses attributable to Royal Doulton came to Pounds 300,000. The group was in the process of buying the outstanding 50 per cent for Pounds 5m. The dividend was set at 1.75p, an increase of 6 per cent on the notional dividend announced at the demerger. Earnings per share were 3.3p, against losses of 8.4p. The shares closed 3p up at 310p. This represents a 60 per cent gain in the nine months since the group was demerged at 193p.</p>

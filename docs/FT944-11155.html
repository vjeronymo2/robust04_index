			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Cubans swim home Three months ago, they braved the Straits of Florida on makeshift rafts in a bid to escape from Cuba to the US, reports George Graham in Washington. But in a striking reversal this weekend, dozens of Cuban refugees, broke down fences and leaped from a cliff into mine-strewn waters to swim back to Cuba from the US military base at Guantanamo Bay. Fed up after languishing in the camp since August, a group of 85 tried to flee, but only 39 made it to Cuba. The rest were caught by US troops and returned. In all, about 32,000 Cubans are interned at Guantanamo, which the US still leases from Cuba, and in Panama.</p>

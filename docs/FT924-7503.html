			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (5): Tide of history seems to be against Labor - Politics: Background to the forthcoming federal poll LIKE most elections in the television age, the impending federal poll in Australia is being described by politicians and commentators on all sides as the most important ever. Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, says voters are being presented with a clear choice between a pragmatic government and an ideologically-driven Thatcherite opposition. Mr John Hewson, leader of the Liberal-National Party conservative coalition, says the election presents a unique opportunity for voters to rein in corporatism and big government. Both men are exaggerating. Australia is already undergoing dramatic economic and social changes as a result of the generally liberal and deregulatory policies followed by Labor since its election in 1983. A conservative election victory would speed up the process of opening the economy to market forces, but that would largely represent a consolidation of liberal economic policies rather than a philosophical change of direction. Nevertheless, the antipathy between the two leaders exceeds normal political limits. Mr Keating, a master of the pithy phrase, has a variety of insulting labels for the conservative leader, all designed to present him as a heartless economic theorist, remote from the problems of ordinary people. He says Mr Hewson is 'Gordon Gekko,' the fictional banker whose creed was 'Greed is Good;' he is Dr Doom or The Professor, recalling his stint as an economics lecturer; he is the 'Feral (wild) Abacus', suggesting an out-of-control calculator. Mr Hewson uses less colourful language, but he takes little trouble, even in private, to disguise his distaste for the prime minister's spiteful rhetoric and street-fighting style. Mr Keating's attacks on the opposition are undoubtedly politically astute. Most opinion polls suggest that Mr Hewson's popularity has declined since the attacks began in earnest at the beginning of the year. The prime minister's relentless concentration on the character issue has also helped to divert attention from the government's own policy failures, notably Australia's 1990-91 recession and subsequent slow recovery. As a result, Mr Hewson has been forced to spend time trying to soften his personal image, instead of attacking the government's weak point - its failure to prevent unemployment passing the politically sensitive 10 per cent level. Mr Keating can claim credit for a remarkable revival in Labor morale since he replaced Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, in a bloody leadership coup in December. A year ago, government officials were resigned to losing the election, which must be held by June. Now, some think Labor might yet pull off a record fifth successive victory. However, there is a long way to go: Labor's popularity rating remains well behind the opposition - 12 percentage points in the latest opinion poll - and the coalition has no shortage of ammunition with which to embarrass the government. Election advertising, for example, is likely to exploit some of the prime minister's less well advised one-liners, such as his successive declarations that 'there will be no recession,' that 'this is the recession we had to have,' and that 'the recession is over long ago.' The federal government will also be weakened by the loss of state power in Tasmania and Victoria this year, and the likely fall of weak Labor governments in South Australia and Western Australia next year. Mr Keating is not yet ready for the Elysian fields. But increasingly, it looks as though the tide of history is moving against Labor. After dominating Australian politics for a decade, the party may now be heading for a period in the wilderness.</p>

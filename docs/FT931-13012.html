			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Canadians try to end dumping disputes CANADIAN steel producers want a bilateral trade agreement with the US aimed at promoting an integrated North American steel market in which both sides would place less emphasis on anti-dumping duties and other import curbs. The initiative has surfaced on the eve of a widely-awaited dumping ruling expected tonight from the US commerce department against imports of flat-rolled steel products from 21 countries, including Canada as well as Japan, South Korea and a number of European countries. Foreign producers deemed to be dumping will have to pay bonds ranging up to 25 per cent on all shipments while the extent of injury to the US industry is examined. The International Trade Commission will make its final injury determination by May 27. The Canadian proposal is based on an argument that the relationship between the US and Canadian steel industries is unique, both in the extent of cross-border trade and in the way the trade is conducted. As a first step, the Canadians suggest that both Ottawa and Washington should drop current anti-dumping investigations. According to a Canadian government document, 'these investigations make no commercial sense'. Later this week Revenue Canada will make preliminary determinations of dumping against imports of hot-rolled steel from six countries, including the US. The complaint affects about CDollars 200m (Pounds 102m) of US exports out of a total of CDollars 800m. The US industry's complaint against Canada affects about a quarter of annual exports to the US, totalling CDollars 1.5bn. The Canadian producers acknowledge that they are 'technically' guilty of dumping steel in the US, but they dispute some of the criteria used by Washington. The Canadian proposals include the appointment of a high-level panel of steel-industry executives. The panel would examine reforms in the trade laws of both countries to recognise the integration of the North American steel market.</p>

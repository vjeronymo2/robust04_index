			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand has lobbied the Cairns Group of farm  exporting nations to include fisheries products among farm items  subject to free trade at the upcoming meeting of the World Trade  Organization.    The action came after a recent meeting between the 14  economic ministers of the Cairns Group. Deputy Prime Minister  Suphachai Phanitchaphak was the leader of the Thai officials.    The Cairns Group now is working out what areas the group has  to include after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world  trade talks.    The Cairns Group was formed out of concern that the Gatt  members would not include a farm agreement at the latest round  of Gatt talks. But though the round has concluded with a  requirement for subsidy cuts on farm products, the Cairns Group  has decided not to abolish the grouping but continue to work as  a supervisory body to push for free farm trade in the  post-Uruguay Round environment.    Thailand was assigned to conduct a feasibility study of fish  and fisheries products, said Kanitson Nawanukhro, deputy  director-general of the Business Economics Department. He said  at a press conference after the Cairns meeting that Thailand  would like to add fish and fisheries products to the farm  products category.    "If Thailand's effort is successful, it means that Thailand  will have more access to the fisheries products market," he said.    Fish resources are the main interest of Thailand and many  countries in the group. But the recent Gatt agreement does not  force its members to liberalize the fisheries trade, leaving an  opportunity for some countries to unfairly restrict fishery  imports.    Thailand also will work with New Zealand in working out a  framework proposal to prevent the export of subsidized goods and  food aid that distort international trade.    On other countries:    Argentina: responsible for conducting a primary study on  market dumping and export subsidies not stated in Article 9 and  their impact to be used as a guideline under the World Trade  Organization.    Canada: seeking a mechanism to review and monitor the  agriculture policy under the agriculture committee.    Brazil and Colombia: considering the impact of the Green Box  Policies peace clauses and the condition to use the protection  measure for farm products, and evaluating the new dispute  settlement mechanism of the Cairns Group.    Brazil and Chile: studying how to promote goods, including  processed food products and fruit, which will benefit the group.</p>

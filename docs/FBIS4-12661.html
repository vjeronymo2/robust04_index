			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Official spokesman's statement dated 11-4-94"] </F>   [Text] H.E. [His Excellency] Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah,  minister for foreign affairs of the Republic of Yemen, visited  [as received] India (April 10-13, 1994) at the invitation of  Shri Dinesh Singh, minister for external affairs. This was the  first ever visit by a cabinet minister to India from unified  Yemen.    At their meeting today, the two ministers recalled age-old,  friendly relations between Yemen and India and expressed their  keen desire to further strengthen them in the coming years.  They exchanged views of regional and international issues.    The visiting minister expressed the desire of the Government  of Yemen for an intensive interaction in the economic area,  especially to increase trade and technical cooperation. During  the discussions it emerged that there is a great scope for  strengthening mutually beneficial relations in the field of  irrigation, telecommunications, health sector, agriculture,  trade, training of Yemeni students in professional institutions  in India in the areas of engineering, management, electronics  etc.    The Yemeni foreign minister invited investments from India  in  the development projects being carried out there. Our external  affairs minister welcomed the suggestion. It was agreed that  India and Yemen would jointly explore the possibilities of  establishing joint ventures in the field of oil exploration,  extraction, refining, distribution and marketing, development of  Aden free port, civil construction etc.    India extended its best wishes for the success of  multi-party  democracy introduced in April 1993 in the Republic of Yemen and  hoped that the long-felt, cherished dream of the Yemeni people  to see their unified country proceed further on the path to  peace and development, would be realised soon.    Yemen expressed its concern at the menace of growing  fundamentalism and terrorism in the world. Yemen supported  India's concern on cross-border terrorism and the rejection of  interference in the internal affairs of any country by external  forces. Yemen supports India's stand on Kashmir issue and hoped  that it would be resolved through dialogue between India and  Pakistan and not by resorting to polemics and violence.</p>

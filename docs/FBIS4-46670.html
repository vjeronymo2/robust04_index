			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valentin Khalin, Moscow-based reviewer for </F> DELOVOY MIR, under the rubric "Entrepreneurship": "A Commercial  Wheel for the Space Wagon"; first paragraph is source  introduction]    [Text] The Russian aerospace complex is ill. Total  financial dependence on state subsidies in the context of the  current budget deficit is cutting off the wings of new projects  before they even get off the ground. Meanwhile, unlike medicine  for the human body, the medicine for the industry's body has  long been found. It is commercialization of the aerospace  programs.  <H5>  How "They" Set Things Up </H5>   In the United States, for example, under conditions of  rather  strict secrecy, the job of developing the commercial sphere of  the space program was conferred on NASA from the very beginning.  As far as 10 years back, an entire Department of Commercial  Programs was set up for that. That department created the  Strategic Plan for the Commercialization of Space, which was  designed to cover 25 years. In that same year of 1984, the U.S.  Congress approved a law for the development of commercial  operations associated with the use of space transportation  systems. We note parenthetically that, in the previous decades,  the reliance was primarily on communications systems. Then came  a succession of commercial uses of launch vehicles.    In a word, without getting into detail, one can state that  the enlistment of commercial structures in the exploration of  near-Earth space was, from the beginning, "their" program goal.  With that, they killed two birds with one stone: "Deriving  economic benefit for all the people and raising the quality of  life on Earth," plus "encouraging investment in the space  program from the private sector." The quotation marks here house  the actual words from the 11 February 1988 directive of the U.S.  president on the commercial space initiative.    In the West, as we know, the return on space investment is  $3-15 for every dollar invested.  <H5>  Our Domestic Draft </H5>   The draft was drawn up as the State Space Program for the  Period Ending in the Year 2000 by the Russian Space Agency (RKA)  and the Russian Academy of Sciences, along with interested  ministries and departments. Everything, it seems, was provided  for in the draft. First, the basic principles were enunciated:  competitive development and independent advisory councils for  the projects; program-specific planning based on alternatives;  economically efficient combination of unique, uniform, standard  elements; compliance with legal regulations and improvement of  the regulatory system; and regular informing of the public of  the plans and results of space activity. Second, spheres of  application were enumerated -- from communications and  television broadcasting to systems for defense and the transfer  of scientific-technical and technological achievements to other  sectors of the economy. There was talk of the introduction of  those achievements to the world market.    And not just talk. Our aerospace complex is a dainty morsel  to foreign business circles. Under acute financial strain,  Russian enterprises were forced to sell unique know-how to  Western partners. NPO Energiya, for example, sold its spacecraft  rendezvous and docking system; the KB [design bureau] Salyut and  the Scientific Research Institute Khimmash sold the technology  for producing a cryogenic oxygen-hydrogen engine; and the Yuriy  Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center sold the system for screening,  training, and post-mission adaptation of cosmonauts.    The entry into the world market is basically a good thing.  But with the investment into our aerospace complex, things are  worse. Domestic private and joint-stock capital, because of its  rudimentary nature and weakness, is not rushing to open its  purse strings. And the West is in even less of a hurry. After  all, foreign partners are trying to sell their own products to  us. Aircraft of the well-known Sergey Ilyushin aircraft complex,  the Il-96M and the multipurpose Il-103, are being outfitted with  the motors of two American firms.    What to do? How can the entrepreneurs of Russia be enticed  to  participate in the commercialization of space? The draft of the  state program is quiet about that. Oh, these days, hopeful  assurances are being tossed about to the effect that Russia was,  is, and will be a great space power.    One of those assurances issued from the mouth of Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in his speech at a solemn  celebration of the Space Program Day. But let's not look at  words, let's look at realities. Not having yet passed the draft,  but only having approved it, the government has thereby agreed  to allocations of more than 16 trillion rubles [R] (at prices of  the first quarter of 1994) all the way to the year 2000. Some  R1.7 trillion is expected to be allocated as early as this year.  That's no small amount, but it's not exorbitant, either -- it's  0.23 percent of the budgetary outlays (in the United States, the  percentage is 0.97). The high-tech sector probably deserves the  better part of that. Especially since, as experience shows, the  actual monies for it will come in irregularly and in small  amounts. For example, although the decree specifies that at  least 30 percent of the monies allocated for the year be  appropriated every quarter, the RKA in three months has received  1.9 percent for deliveries of series-produced equipment and 2.9  percent for cosmodrome maintenance. With such drops in the  bucket instead of the promised injections, it's impossible to  guarantee prepayment of the many special orders, and specialists  feel that within two or three years, our space program will be  agonizing if...  <H5>  If Business people Are Not Brought In </H5>   It's naive, of course, to think that small- and medium-sized  enterprises are, by themselves, capable of competing with state  infusions into the space program. But what's to keep them from  following the West's example and creating funds of risk (or  venture) capital? That, in particular, was a topic at the Fifth  Scientific Workshop and Conference "Business People and the  Economic Development of Space," which took place recently at the  Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation. In  discussing the problems of the commercialization of space,  scientists and entrepreneurs reached the same conclusion.  Business people, commercial banks and insurance companies, and  representatives of regional authorities are fully capable of  coordinating efforts, creating venture funds, and becoming  involved in the financing of the commercial projects of the  space sector. Similar funds in the United States, for example,  are created as TOO [not further expanded]. For a specific period  (usually 7-10 years), the accumulate money from the most varied  of sources: individuals, industrial companies, retirement funds,  foreign investors, and so forth. Such a consolidation of sources  is capable of gathering a considerable amount of capital and  reducing the potential risk for each individual contributor. The  risk become even less with the cooperation of regional and other  venture funds (in the United States, they number upwards of 600)  and the creation of a team of professionals capable of investing  money in promising, prestigious space projects with a maximum of  return. Our newspaper has already named a number of them --  satellite communications, which is five to six times less  expensive than cable or radio communications, and space-based  prospecting of natural resources, which is capable of returning  R7 for every R1 spent (see DELOVOY MIR, 8 April 1994).    At the conference, representatives of the space department  told of dozens of similar projects. Just one of them involves  the Bankir system of NPO Sergey Lavochkin, which is capable of  replacing our extremely archaic, awkward banking transactions  with paperless technology. There are no such systems abroad yet.  Bankir will service more than 40,000 subscribers, and all  finance operations will be effected instantaneously, by ground  standards. The traffic handling capabilities of the system are  so great that, in the next three to five years, all Russian  banks will be able to keep only about 15 percent of it busy.  Unused channels you could, for sure, sell right and left.    God only knows, if I were a wealthy banker, I would break my  neck on one such project, if only to put together with my  colleagues a venture fund and use it, and then expand the system  so that it would envelop the entire globe: if would you be so  kind, gentlemen Western bankers, as to allow me to be of service  to you. Alas, at the conference, the voice of the business  people was timid and muffled.  <H5>  Where Are You, Entrepreneur-Enthusiasts? </H5>   Why are the business people being slow about this, why are  they being so cautious? The question of what is getting in their  way is not at all rhetorical. The obstacles are manifold. One of  the main obstacles is that there are no real levers of  interaction between state and commercial structures in the  development of space. No legal basis has been drawn up for such  interaction. There is not yet in Russia a market infrastructure  capable of flexibly and reliably distributing capital in  priority sectors and projects. And we've already mentioned above  of the weakness and lack of coordination of private owners and  entrepreneurs.    The list could go on and on. Everybody knows it well. It is  the misfortune of our Russian reality that the upper echelons of  power are deaf to the earthly needs of goods-producers and that  they don't give them a helping hand. And the entrepreneurs,  despairing in turn of ever reaching the higher offices with  their innovations and requests, are up to their ears in humdrum  concerns and can't see the forest for the trees.    Meanwhile, our space wagon can't pull away from the curb to  get onto the high road without a commercial wheel. And it's not  a fifth wheel -- it's one of the front wheels. And it needs to  be put on by the authorities -- who need to set up a clear-cut  program and a legal basis for the commercialization of space  research -- and by the business people -- who need to assemble  the capital and lobby the standard official circles. God  willing, one or the other will rouse us from our sleep. Anything  could happen -- even the newcomers could surge ahead of our  great space power.</p>

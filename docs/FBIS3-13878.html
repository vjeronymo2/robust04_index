In a departure statement, Sha'th said that at a time when  the  Hebron massacre brought to the fore the issue of settlements,  the United States and Israel raised the issue of Jerusalem.    Sha'th added: Jerusalem will remain the capital of Palestine  and its future independent state and a capital to all Muslim and  Christian people in the world. Israel's claims in this regard  are completely rejected. Jerusalem is an occupied city that is  subject to all the Geneva conventions and will remain so until  the occupation ends.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Brake Put on Fake Truck Scam"] </F>   [Text] Some 16,000 fake trucks are believed to be still on  the roads today, following the discovery of 4,000 such vehicles  recently in South China.    The discovery has prompted authorities to warn Chinese  consumers again to be on the lookout for fake and shoddy goods.    Fabricated motors, mechanical equipment and high-tech  products have joined the list of fake name brand liquors,  cigarettes, medicine, fertilizers and pesticides.    According to Li Chuanqing, newly appointed Director General  of the State Technology Supervision Administration (STSA), one  of the most serious new cases involves fake Dong Feng trucks.    According to Li, more than 4,000 such fake trucks have been  found on the roads. This has resulted in an estimated loss of  40 million yuan ($4.59 million) to the State and also to the  maker, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which is based in Hubei  Province.    Analysts believe some 16,000 more fake trucks are in  service,  he added.    Meanwhile, some enterprises in Zhejiang's Pingyang County  and  Fujian's Fuding County have sold assembled mechanical equipment  to landlocked regions at more than 60 million yuan ($6.89  million).    When the machine tools arrived in these 26 provinces and  municipalities under the name of "joint ventures," they failed  to operate and turned out to be waste parts.    The central government is now investigating these matters  and  is prepared to levy tougher penalties on producers.    Counterfeit products in the high tech sector include  computer  software, anti-virus disks and laser symbol detectors.    Li vowed to further carry on the drive against counterfeit  goods, which was started six years ago.    Last year, the country handled 91,017 cases involving fake  and shoddy goods, sentenced 470 people and executed four.    One of the latest cases reported by the Beijing-based  Worker's Daily [GONGREN RIBAO] said that a firm in Shenzhen was  ordered to pay a fine of 8.2 million yuan ($940,000) and had its  earnings of 2.8 million yuan ($320,000) confiscated for selling  counterfeit Maotai, a Chinese brand liquor.</p>

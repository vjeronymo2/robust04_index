			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnam was adjusting its foreign policy in order to  serve the country's top priorities to meet its economic  development. This was said by Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai in  an international investment seminar in Hanoi.    He said: Vietnam has no time for getting involve in  hostilities in neighboring Cambodia. On military aid to  Cambodia, Mr. Le Mai said: It was no longer Vietnam's duty to  do that. Vietnam did once and that was enough. Now it's turn  for other countries if they want to help the Cambodian  Government fight against the Khmer Rouge.    Mr. Le Mai also said the United States will soon open a  diplomatic mission in Vietnam and that the only remaining  obstacle was the difficulty in finding suitable accommodation in  Hanoi. He said economic development was a top priority for  Vietnam.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS: PERENNIAL POPPIES  </P> <P> Southern California gardeners, seeing gorgeous photographs in books, have been  trying to grow oriental poppies for years. These brightly colored,  huge-flowered poppies are perennials and are reasonably easy in cold climates,  but not so here. They will grow and they may even flower after a few years in  the ground, but the flowers are often on such short stems that they bloom  inside the foliage.  </P> <P> Last year, there was hope that a new kind of Oriental poppy might grow well in  Southern California, and this year we can report that there are indeed oriental  poppies we can grow -- a special strain developed right here in California.  This strain came from crosses between a California perennial poppy and an  Oriental, and it resulted in poppies called Minicaps.  </P> <P> They bloomed in my own garden most of last summer and are blooming again right  now, with flowers six to seven inches across. Do not expect a mass of flowers  at any one time but there are nearly always a few in flower. Individual flowers  only stay open two or three days, but they are quite a spectacle during that  short time. The fuzzy, slightly gray foliage makes a mound about two feet by  two feet and flowers are on stems about three to four feet tall.  </P> <P> Unlike some perennials, these should not be cut to the ground for winter, but  just left alone. You may dig the plants up and move them in winter as I did, so  they could be in a sunnier spot. They like lots of sun.  </P> <P> Minicaps will be available at the Huntington Botanic Garden Plant Sale on May  21. Tickets may be obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed legal envelope  to Huntington Plant Sale, 1151 Oxford St., San Marino, Calif. 91108. You can  also order them directly from the grower who offers a color catalogue for a  25-cent stamp. Write to Mohn's, P.O. Box 2301, Atascadero, Calif. 93423. ROBERT  SMAUS  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BUCKLEY IN PHILHARMONIC DEBUT  </P> <P> The day after the introduction of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's music  director-elect may not have been a good time to make a debut with the  orchestra. Not only was the occasion thoroughly upstaged, but the orchestra  gave Richard Buckley rather unsettled performances Tuesday evening at Hollywood  Bowl.  </P> <P> There was also a different soloist than originally scheduled. Leon Bates  replaced Ken Noda, who acquired "an indisposition" a week ago, in Beethoven's  Second Piano Concerto.  </P> <P> Given the exigencies of the Bowl rehearsal schedule, the substitution should  not have caused artistic problems, but Bates seemed to have quicker ideas about  the piece than Buckley. At some points, Bates' tempos seemed faster than he  could handle articulately. Otherwise, he spun out a bright, focused and often  sparkling account.  </P> <P> Buckley apparently wanted a more mellow, plumper sort of interpretation. He led  a down-sized orchestra in a genial, balanced accompaniment, responsive to  Bates' goading on the tempo issues.  </P> <P> In the opening, Mozart's Overture to "Don Giovanni," Buckley tried for  transparency and tension. He got a scrambled, scrappy reading, in which speed  and an almost frenzied sort of energy were the prime components.  </P> <P> After intermission, Buckley and the full orchestra turned to Mahler's First  Symphony. The conductor, who turns 36 on Sept. 1, accepted Mahler's judgment in  dispensing with the "Blumine" movement and offered a formally clear view of the  work.  </P> <P> As realized in sound, though, his approach proved superficial. The Philharmonic  played with greater cohesion than before, producing a measure of bucolic charm  in the second movement. But the fierce contrasts and struggles of the work were  so lightly tackled, that the various recapitulations on the road to triumph in  the finale sounded like pro forma redundancies.  </P> <P> Attendence: 10,469.

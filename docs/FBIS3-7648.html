Rep. Pak Chung-su, who led a South Korean delegation to the  91st International Parliamentary Union (IPU) meeting in Paris,  said Wednesday he noticed that all nine members of the North  Korean delegation had not sported the Kim Il-song badge.    In addition, all six North Korean representatives at another  Paris meeting of the United Nations Educational, Social and  Cultural Organization (UNESCO) did not wear the badge, according  to Pak.    The absence of the badge, the symbol of Kim Il-song's  "chuche" (self-reliance) ideology, is drawing unusual attention  because all North Korean officials had until recently worn it as  though it were a bodily appendage, Pak said.    "It is a big change, considering the rigidity and  inflexibility of the North Korean regime and society," Pak added.    Pak speculated that North Korea's leaders may be preparing  "a  grace period" during a transition of power from Kim Il-song to  his son and heir-apparent, Kim Chong-il.</p>

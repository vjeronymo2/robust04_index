			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Blueprint for EC reforms sought THE GOVERNMENT has set up a high-level committee to draw up a British blueprint for reforms to European Community institutions, aimed at consolidating and entrenching the powers and autonomy of member states. The committee, combining Foreign Office and Cabinet Office personnel, has been set up by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in anticipation of the 1996 inter-governmental conference on the EC's constitutional arrangements. It reflects Mr Hurd's growing conviction that the controversy over the Maastricht treaty is in part the consequence of reactive as opposed to 'active diplomacy'. Mr Hurd concluded that by promoting a British vision of 'a more flexible and decentralised Community', the Conservative party would be able to reunite after the internal strife provoked by the treaty. A senior official said yesterday there was widespread acknowledgement in government circles that Britain had failed to articulate its vision of the Community early enough in the policymaking process, fuelling the impression, he said, that 'we are constantly being shifted by foreigners'. He added: 'The last IGC was conducted on other people's terms. We want to be on the front foot from the outset.' The European Policy Group, a market-oriented, London-based think tank, is engaged in a similar initiative. It is acting as the secretariat to a group of economists and constitutional specialists drawn from right-wing and Christian Democrat opinion across Europe. Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Group, described its work as a 'fightback' by those who believed in positive engagement in EC affairs but opposed the 'centralising' tendencies of the European establishment. Among the ideas under consideration is a possible role for national politicians in a second chamber of the European parliament.</p>

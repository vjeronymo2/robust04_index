			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Optimism is clouded by jobs outlook: EC business survey BUSINESS confidence in the European Community has picked up as companies become more hopeful about an end to recession. But this has not improved the gloomy outlook for jobs, with nearly half of companies expecting to cut their labour forces during the next 12 months. These are the main conclusions of a survey, published today, of business opinion in the seven main EC countries. The survey - the UPS Business Monitor, conducted for the US-based United Parcel Service by Harris Research  -points to widespread disillusionment with the effects of the single market programme. However, there is relative confidence that plans to create a single currency will eventually produce results, despite the exchange rate mechanism upsets of the past two years. A total of 58 per cent of respondents believed at least three EC states would create a single currency by 1999, with a further 25 per cent expecting it to happen after that date. On economic prospects, 56 per cent of executives saw their companies' economic position improving over the next 12 months, up from 38 per cent when the survey was last carried out in autumn 1992. Only 7 per cent expected a worse position, against 19 per cent a year ago. The survey indicates that the short-term employment outlook is bleakest in Germany and the Netherlands. Across the seven countries, 43 per cent of companies forecast staff cuts during the next 12 months. The same percentage expected to keep numbers unchanged and only 12 per cent reckoned to take on extra labour. In Germany, 60 per cent of companies expected to reduce staff, a course of action planned by 57 per cent of Dutch companies, and 47 per cent of Belgian ones. In the UK, where the corporate outlook has shown the sharpest improvement compared with a year ago, 22 per cent expected an increase and 30 per cent a cut. Employers delivered a rigorous assessment of the effect of the EC's social chapter: 27 per cent thought it would reduce employment, and only 19 per cent thought it would create jobs. Pessimism was highest in the UK and Germany, with Italy and Spain relatively hopeful. Only 5 per cent of respondents blamed EC policies for the Community's economic problems over the past year. At the same time, underlining disappointment with EC single market policies, 87 per cent saw no noticeable benefits to their companies. Asked about improvements in the movements of goods following the ending of border controls, only 25 per cent of companies said they have lived up to expectations, compared with 67 per cent expecting improvement a year ago. A total of 65 per cent of companies pointed to high German interest rates as causing problems for the rest of Europe, although most conceded that the Bundesbank was correct to take action to keep down German inflation. Criticism of German monetary policy appeared greatest in Spain, Britain, France and Belgium. By contrast, 55 per cent of German respondents exonerated the Bundesbank from blame for Europe's difficulties. Perhaps surprisingly, 88 per cent of respondents thought German unification brought benefits to Europe, up from 76 per cent a year ago. The approval rating was higher in the Netherlands (99 per cent) than in Germany (98) and was lowest in Italy (77).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Europe's future: the view form the boardroom  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The third UPS survey is based on nearly 1,500 interviews carried out by Harris among EC business leaders between September 6 and October 8, 1993.

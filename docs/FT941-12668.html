			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices continue to fall in higher volume - Market Report Disappointing trading statements from the retail sector, together with further weakness in government bonds, undermined the UK stock market yesterday. Early firmness, which held until mid-afternoon, owed much to the futures-related demand, and once this was completed share prices renewed their downward drift. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 8.8 easier at 3,427.3, having rallied from the 3,425 area. Those market strategists who have been predicting a correction in the market believe that the Footsie could fall to around 3,400 without necessarily implying a significant change of direction. The setback was, as so often happens, triggered from the stock index futures sector, where the March Footsie contract closed near to parity with the cash index. But wider factors were at work, including reports that a noted US market specialist had turned bearish in futures and that some UK houses had tried to unload bonds left over from this Wednesday's auc-tion of Pounds 2.75bn of British government securities. Nervousness over bond markets in London and elsewhere counter-balanced suggestions in some quarters that yesterday's slightly discouraging reports from leading UK retailers would serve to strengthen the chances that base rates would be cut sooner than expected. Shares in Marks and Spencer, the monarch of Britain's high street retailers and one of the most widely held shares in the market, fell sharply after the market took a cautious view of the board's statement that Christmas sales had been in line with expectations. Investors also reacted badly to comments at the annual meeting of Burton, another leading clothing retailer. Much of the market's powerful advance in December and early January hinged on confidence that the Christmas retail trade would confirm the recovery in the domestic economy. Retail shares gave ground widely yesterday in significantly increased trading volume. Dealers commented that trading volume has increased as the market has given ground. Seaq volume of 972.6m shares yesterday saw non-Footsie business remain high at around 63 per cent of the total. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, supported initially by the aftermath of traded options expiries, slipped away later to close 3.3 down at 4,076.4. Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained strong, although below last week's totals. On Wednesday, retail business in UK equities was worth Pounds 1.86bn, suggesting that the institutions were again active in the market. London yesterday failed to follow the brighter tone of the other continental European stock markets. However, the rally in Hong Kong was reflected quickly in HSBC. In spite of the doubts over short-term prospects, UK equity strategists remained favourable towards the London market for the medium term. Smith New Court, the UK integrated securities house, sees London as offering 'considerable security' in global markets threatened by short term risks, with the strength of sterling perhaps prompting an interest rate cut that could prove unwarranted. Flemings Research believes the FT-SE 100 Index could reach 3,700 by April, with base rate hopes kept alive by 'well founded fears' that tax increases in the spring may prompt deceleration of econ-omic activity. However, it remains cautious on the outlook for UK consumers.</p>

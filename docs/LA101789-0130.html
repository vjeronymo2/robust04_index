			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> CHILDREN TO LEARN ABOUT INDIAN LIFE  </P> <P> Elementary school children will learn about American Indian music, housing,  food and clothing under a new, pilot program in the Capistrano Unified School  District.  </P> <P> In a survey of parents, district officials found that more than 1,000 children  enrolled in Capistrano schools have American Indian ancestry. That qualified  the district to receive a $104,000 federal grant for the program.  </P> <P> The money will allow the district to train teachers and pay for new materials,  said Bill Eller, an assistant superintendent. The program is intended to make  students more aware of their Indian heritage and to instill pride in their  cultural identity, he said.  </P> <P> The district previously had what Eller called a "road show," in which  artifacts, pottery, examples of weaving, weapons and clothes were packed in  boxes and moved from school to school. Classes at each school were allowed to  view the materials for a week or two.  </P> <P> Beginning this year, teachers in kindergarten through fifth grade will have  their own materials, Eller said.

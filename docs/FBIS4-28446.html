			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Eleven political figures  of foreign countries including the Politburo member of the C.C.  [Central Committee], the Communist Party of Argentina, Jorge  Alberto Craines, and the coordinator of the People's Party of  Costa Rica, Eduardo Mora Valverde, in a joint statement  published on May 22 held that for a durable peace and security  of the Korean peninsula the Korean Armistice Agreement should be  replaced by a peace agreement.    Recalling that the United States has broken down the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks and shipped various kinds of  sophisticated weapons including Patriot missiles into South  Korea recently, he joint statement said this shows that the  United States is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula  to the brink of war.    It expressed support for the Korean people's efforts to  solve  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way  through DPRK-U.S. talks, and strongly urged the United States  to get its forces out of South Korea.    It expressed the belief that the Korean people would surely  achieve national reunification in accordance with the three  principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great  national unity laid down by President Kim Il-song.</p>

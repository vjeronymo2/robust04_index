			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Akwa', spokesman for the north </F> Yemeni delegation visiting Cairo, by Shadiyah Riyad; date not  given; from "The Talking Newspaper" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Riyad] Mr. al-Akwa', Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of Dr.  Butrus-Ghali, has not succeeded in arranging a meeting between  the two [north and south Yemeni] sides. Nor has he succeeded in  attaining an agreement over a mechanism for observing a  cease-fire. Do you see this as a failure of Lakhdar Brahimi's  mission?    [Al-Akwa'] First of all, I thank you for this interview. In  the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. I wish to  comment on the description given to us as being the Sanaa  delegation. We did not come here in the capacity of a  delegation representing only Sanaa but as a delegation  representing the country's ruling three-party coalition, the  General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. We came to Cairo on this basis  and in order to meet with the representatives of the third  coalition partner, the YSP. When we arrived, however, we  discovered that they were insisting that they represented an  independent state. This is of course impractical and  unacceptable.    [Riyad] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj [foreign minister in south Yemen]  has declared that the coalition delegation, as you have  described it, has no authority to make decisions.    [Al-Akwa'] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj has no justification to say  such things. What is the authorization needed to make  decisions? When a certain party sends an envoy on a particular  mission, this means it gives him powers equal to his mission.    [Riyad] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj has remarked that Aden's  delegation has the power to make decisions pertaining to a  cease-fire.    [Al-Akwa'] I wish to say this: He represents a rebellious  party and can claim to have power. In actual fact, they always  avoid reaching a solution. Formerly when we and they held a  political dialogue, I was a member of the political dialogue  committee. Whenever we came close to a solution, they provoked  disputes and introduced new debates to lead us into an endless  maze that would prevent a solution.    [Riyad] Why does the fighting continue so fiercely despite  the two sides having accepted the idea of dialogue and the UN  Security Council resolution which provides for a cease-fire.  Sanaa bears the blame for continuing the war, or at least  everyone is saying that it is to blame.    [Al-'Akwa'] This is a very simple matter. A permanent  cease-fire aims to encourage the international community to  intervene and disengage the two warring sides. This is the  rebels' objective. From the beginning the rebels sought not to  solve the crisis or observe a cease-fire in a normal way. They  were afraid that if this happened, the citizens would think more  about the situation and distance themselves from the rebels'  goal, namely seceding by force. Their aim is to continue the  fighting and to provoke an international response. They went so  far as to attack civilian targets inside Aden in order to claim  that the legitimate forces had carried out those attacks. They  did this to justify intervention by international troops to  disengage the warring parties. They wanted to guarantee their  secession.    [Riyad] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that Egypt  stresses the need for observing an immediate cease-fire because  continuing the fighting would devour all chances of safeguarding  unity. Under the current circumstances, how do you view the  future of this unity?    [Al-Akwa'] Truly, all the Yemeni people support unity. When  we say they are rebels we do not say it just for the sake of  making accusations. They claim that they want to secede the  south. But they do not represent the south or the wishes of the  people of the south. They fail to understand the geographical  reality of the south. They are now deployed in extremely small  areas. Let's take for example the southern governorates. Lahij  is currently under the control of legitimacy; Abyan is also  under the control of legitimacy; parts of Shabwah, Aden, and  Hadhramaut are under the control of legitimacy. They are  deployed in a very small area. They have no popular support.  They rely on party forces. They rely on individuals who have  received party education. This is evident in the support that  the citizens in the southern and eastern governorates give to  the legitimate forces.    The rebels' forces have been expelled not only by the  legitimate army but also by the citizens in those areas, whether  in Abyan, Shabwah, Hadhramaut, or Lahij. The security and  administrative affairs in the areas that were regained by the  legitimate forces are being supervised by their sons and not by  the legitimate forces.    This is obvious and any person can verify this on the  ground.  We do not consider our brothers in Egypt as a foreign party.  We believe that we have common blood with our brothers in  Egypt. Yemeni and Egyptian blood was shed and it watered the  Yemeni land to achieve and establish the Yemeni revolution. The  revolution's principal objective was to achieve the Yemeni unity.    [Riyad] What is the next step now that UN Envoy Lakhdar  Brahimi has failed in his mission?    [Al-Akwa'] I do not believe that he has failed.    [Riyad] But he failed to bring the two sides together, or to  achieve a unified formula of a mechanism for halting the  fighting.    [Al-Akwa'] I am definite that Lakhdar Brahimi has not yet  announced that he has failed. It was the rebels'  representatives who said that Brahimi has failed. This is  because they had built their calculations on this basis -- that  Brahimi would fail in his mission. They made the announcement  before Brahimi said anything. Brahimi has not failed, but they  tried to place obstacles to undermine his mission by insisting  that they represent an independent state. If we were prepared  to accept them as an independent state, there would have never  been a problem or a war. But the problem cropped up when they  tried to impose secession and set up an independent state by  force. It was the responsibility of the government and the  legitimate forces to defend unity. They started to use force to  impose secession.    [Riyad] Does this mean that the dialogue will continue and  that there is hope that an agreement will be reached?    [Al-Akwa'] We are interested working out an actual mechanism  for a cease-fire. We believe that every day that passes means  more blood will be shed and more people will be killed. This  will only complicate the issue. Every day that passes means  more efforts will be needed to resolve the problem. Therefore,  we are very interested in working out a mechanism that could  achieve a cease-fire immediately.    [Riyad] Thank you.    [Al-Akwa'] You are welcome.</p>

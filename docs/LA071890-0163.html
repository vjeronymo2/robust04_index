			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: EDDIE MURPHY TRIES AGAIN TO BE STAND-UP GUY  </P> <P> CAN EDDIE Murphy be worried about the so-so box-office take on his last two  movies -- "Harlem Nights" and "Another 48 HRS."? Can this former stand-up  comic, who gained stardom on "Saturday Night Live" and was insulting women and  gays long before we ever heard of Andrew Dice Clay, be feeling just a bit  insecure about his status in Hollywood? Insiders say yes, maybe.  </P> <P> And they speculate that is why Eddie is working hard on new stand-up routines,  with an eye to regaining his original audience.  </P> <P> But Eddie's act, which he tried out recently at New York City's Comic Strip,  contains some slams at Sylvester Stallone that Eddie would probably say were  all in fun. Stallone might not think so.  </P> <P> At one point, Murphy talks about how Sly was jealous and suspicious that Eddie  may have romanced Sly's then-wife, Brigitte Nielsen, when the statuesque blonde  appeared with Eddie in "Beverly Hills Cop II": "Yeah, he thought I did. Now I  ask you, why would I want her -- she looks like a man!"  </P> <P> Eddie says he didn't bother getting into a physical hassle with Stallone  because "he's small -- he's just a itty-bitty little man. Now Arnold  Schwarzenegger, I'd stay out of his way. He's a BIG man."  </P> <P> Well, boys will be boys, but we have a feeling Sylvester, who is a much more  interesting, articulate and mature person than his screen image suggests, might  just laugh it off as sticks and stones and all that jazz.  </P> <P> SEAN PENN, the formerly pugnacious former husband of You Know Who, is preparing  to descend on Nebraska next month to direct "Indian Runner," a film he also  wrote. This is his debut as a director.  </P> <P> "Indian Runner," a contemporary story about the Midwest, also stars Valeria  Golino (she was Tom Cruise's fed-up girlfriend in "Rainman"), Sandy Dennis,  David Morse and Patricia Arquette.  </P> <P> Penn also has a new movie ready for release, "State of Grace," the story of the  Westies gang war in New York. Both Sean and co-star Gary Oldman are said to be  excellent, and the film powerful, but be forewarned: It is realistically and  graphically violent.  </P> <P> BON JOVI guitarist Richie Sambora is still hot and heavy with Cher, for whom  youth springs eternal. In fact, it is at Richie's house in New Jersey that Cher  has been resting her limbs during her East Coast concerts. And please discount  rumors that put the blame for what appears to be the breakup of the band on  Cher.  </P> <P> As one insider said: "All these people are too sophisticated, smart and  ambitious to let a personal relationship spoil a successful band. If Bon Jovi  does break up, it has nothing to do with Cher."  </P></p>

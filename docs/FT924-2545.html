			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading DISAPPOINTMENT that there would be no cut in UK or German interest rates led to heavy selling in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,761 and good buying, particularly from independent traders, saw the contract rise to 2,768 within the first hour of business. This proved to be the session's high, for a period of light profit-taking followed, sending December gently lower. The announcement of unchanged interest rates from the Bundesbank over the lunchtime period led to a heavy bout of selling, which saw the contract fall to 2,755, and pulled the cash market lower. The poor opening on Wall Street led to a further selling as did comments from the UK chancellor of the excheqeur that there would be no early cuts in interest rates. December closed at 2,730, down 33 on the previous session and just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 4. Turnover at 11,271 contracts was particularly heavy. Traders attributed the high volume to increased rolling of positions in to the March contract. It saw business of around 5,000 lots, up from 1,834 on Tuesday. The volume in traded options also saw an improvement on Tuesday's poor level. It reached 26,294 lots, with the the FT-SE 100 option trading 13,402 contracts.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Most tenders from councils won by their own workers LOCAL authorities' in-house labour forces have overwhelmingly held their own against the private sector under government compulsory competitive tendering, according to an advisory body survey. The survey shows that in-house workforces, known as direct-labour organisations, in England and Wales have won 69.7 per cent of 2,558 contracts in the first four rounds of compulsory tendering. Contracts won in-house represent 84.3 per cent of the total value of contracts on offer. Councils have been obliged by law since 1989 to put out to tender refuse collection, street and building cleaning, catering, vehicle maintenance and ground maintenance. Most contracts are for five years and councils are generally bound to accept the lowest tender. The survey was conducted by the Local Government Management Board, the national body which advises local authorities on training, pay and conditions, and management. It shows wide variations between different services. Refuse collection and ground maintenance face the greatest competition, with an average of 3.4 tenders per contract. Only 10 per cent of refuse-collection contracts were won without competition. Catering in schools and social service departments drew an average of only 1.2 tenders per contract, with 73 per cent of them won without competition. There are marked regional variations, which correspond closely to councils' political control. In-house labour has won all refuse-collection contracts in Labour-dominated Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside and has been very successful in the West Midlands. In London only 58 per cent of contracts have gone in-house, and fewer than two thirds have done so in the Tory-inclined south-east and East Anglia. Contracts lost by councils' direct labour forces have almost all gone to the private sector. There have been few management buy-outs.

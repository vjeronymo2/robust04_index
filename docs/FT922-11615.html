			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pension funds help Nikkei rise above 17,000 BUYING by pension funds and investment trusts combined with futures-linked activity to push the Nikkei average sharply higher yesterday, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The 225-share index surged 562.93, or 3.3 per cent, to 17,402.05 for its first close above 17,000 in three days. It reached a high for the day of 17,431.05 and a low of 16,832.50. Volume increased to 300m shares from 230m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 32.00, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,315.03 as advances led declines by 814 to 184, with 129 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 1.47 to 1,070.45. Mr Masumi Okuema of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International said the stock market's supply-demand balance is expected to improve towards the end of the month with the likely establishment of new funds allowing companies to support their own shares by pooling funds as a step towards legalising stock repurchases. He added, however, that the strength could prove largely psychological and the market still lacks the buying interest needed for a sustained recovery. A boost from domestic pension funds and investment trusts sparked a rally early in the day, while continued activity in index futures continued to dominate for most of the day, as it has in recent sessions. Large local brokerages were also seen strongly supporting speculative issues, a practice rare in recent months. The day's volume leaders were Teac, which forged ahead Y60 to Y1,090, and Morinaga Milk, up Y13 to Y764. Top securities firms also fared well, with Nomura advancing Y40 to Y1,310 and Nikko Y43 to Y635. However, Daiwa retreated Y6 to Y773 on foreign selling. Bank shares extended their rally, with Mitsubishi Bank rising Y150 to Y1,850 and Industrial Bank of Japan Y130 to Y1,880. Drug issues and leading electricals continued to rise, Daiichi Pharmaceutical adding Y50 at Y1,420 and Pioneer Electronic Y120 at Y3,880. In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 486.42 to 19,621.45 in volume of 18.8m shares. Roundup ANOTHER record high was achieved by Hong Kong, while the rest of the Pacific Rim remained mixed. In Bombay, brokers resumed their boycott in protest against a circular from the Securities and Exchange Board of India requiring brokers to obtain clearance from the board before they could re-register. HONG KONG rose further in strong volume. The Hang Seng index closed 98.75 higher at 5,287.78 in turnover of HKDollars 4.43bn, after HKDollars 2.85bn. The most active stocks were HSBC Holdings, up 50 cents to HKDollars 41.00, Cheung Kong, which gained 50 cents to HKDollars 22.00, and Hutchison Whampoa, 20 cents stronger at HKDollars 16.20. AUSTRALIA closed at a six- week high. The All Ordinaries index gained 9 to 1,608 in turnover of ADollars 247.5m. BHP climbed 16 cents to ADollars 13.88 in volume of 2.1m shares, while Brambles advanced 46 cents to ADollars 16.50 and Lend Lease rose 50 cents to ADollars 16.10. Among the declines was CRA, which lost 26 cents to ADollars 14.04 after reporting a fall in March iron ore production. SEOUL slipped in active trade. The composite index shed 1.35 to 582.87 in turnover of Won381.8bn. Buying centred on low-priced shares, while stocks of large manufacturers and financial groups were sold. TAIWAN fell further as a demonstration in Taipei calling for direct presidential elections depressed sentiment. The weighted index declined 34.76 to 4,470.31 in turnover of TDollars 12.7bn, against TDollars 14.3bn. MANILA gained ground in active trading. The composite index put on 13.91 to 1,178.30 in combined turnover of 552.6m pesos, after 218.2m pesos. There was foreign interest in Philippine National Bank, which released good first-quarter earnings. It rose 2.50 pesos to 275 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR advanced afresh, the composite index ending 8.95 stronger at 582.90 in MDollars 102m turnover (MDollars 69.2m). SINGAPORE was dull. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 0.83 to 1,402.27 while turnover rose to SDollars 195m, up from SDollars 50m. Singapore Airlines foreign shares receded 30 cents to SDollars 18.20. NEW ZEALAND was buoyed by a survey showing an increase in business confidence. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 23.09 to 1,451.40.</p>

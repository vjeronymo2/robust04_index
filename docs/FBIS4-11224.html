			<p>BFN     [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has promised to  eliminate visas for Chileans who want to visit Czechoslovakia.  The prime minister reported that Chile and the Czech Republic  have completed an agreement to eliminate entrance visas.    The Czech prime minister made this comment at the end of a  lecture he gave to international affairs experts at the Andres  Bello Diplomatic Institute in the Foreign Ministry building.    In his lecture the Czech prime minister said he is in Chile  because he believes that his nation must not restrict its ties  to European countries only.    Klaus expressed skepticism about the idea of a great  European  union, but he said he favors an integration process that admits  diversity. He also said that the Czech Government is interested  in safeguarding its own identity without, he said, dissolving in  coffee like a lump of sugar. In addition, he warned that the  Czech Republic does not intend to become a bridge between  eastern and western Europe.</p>

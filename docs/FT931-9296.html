			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Housing associations see threat to their future from government plans to make cuts in grant rates Sir, You wrongly assert that the status quo as regards funding of the social housing stock must remain. Currently, annual incremental demand for government-funded housing association properties far outweighs the buildings which record funding of Pounds 2bn a year can support at 72 per cent grant levels. This is in part a result of high unemployment in the pit of a recession. But it also reflects the young and mobile that are disinclined to buy homes in a falling market (although they can afford them) being forced into social housing because the private rental stock is inadequate. There can be nothing wrong in housing associations tapping this demand at higher rent levels than are the norm rather than setting rents for all properties at levels those least well off can afford. The housing associations can cross-subsidise the needy and when this fails housing benefit can tide tenants over what may be a temporary shortfall in income. It must be better to direct subsidy at those who need it now. Clearly targeting finite subsidy in the social housing sector does not alone constitute a housing policy. The challenge for government is to break free from a hotchpotch of past practice, some good, and some indefensible, to conduct a review of housing policy that is not restricted to the social sector but spans all forms of tenure. Such a radical review would explore how we can both promote job mobility and ensure affordable accommodation for all households. But it cannot start if existing subsidies are seen as immutable.

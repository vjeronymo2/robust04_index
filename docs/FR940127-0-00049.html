			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggests that section 6 of the NPRM be amended to add that the Administrator must approve within 15 days a change in repair station staff necessary to meet other requirements of the regulation or a change in procedures approved under a separate paragraph of the regulation. The FAA disagrees; often, more than 15 days is needed to conduct research necessary to verify a new staff member's background and ability or to evaluate procedures. The FAA can not grant approval to necessary staff personnel or procedures without thoroughly investigating all issues involved to ensure that the level of safety intended by the rule continues to be met. No time limit for FAA approval will be added to Section 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter states that the qualifications of the SFAR 36 staff engineering personnel should be consistent with qualifications assigned to Designated Engineering Representatives with regard to damage tolerance requirements. The FAA agrees; this issue is addressed in Section 5(a)(3), which identifies engineering personnel that can determine compliance with the applicable airworthiness requirements of the regulations. Therefore, no change is made to the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters propose that section 5 of the SFAR be amended to state that the applicant must have authority to repair products or articles to be eligible to apply for an SFAR 36 authorization. The FAA agrees that this is a helpful clarification; the final rule incorporates this change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter proposes that the words ``article'' and ``product'' should both appear wherever one is currently used to encompass all items intended. The FAA agrees in part, and has further determined that the final rule should reflect one term where one most clearly states the applicability of the corresponding provision. For example, FAR Section 121.379(b) states that a certificate holder may approve for return to service a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> product <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after maintenance, etc., performed under paragraph (a) of Section 121.379. FAR Section 145.51b states that a repair station certificate holder may approve for return to service any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> article <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for which it is rated. Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to use ``product'' when referring to repairs performed by air carrier and air taxi certificate holders, and to use ``article'' when referring to repairs performed by repair station certificate holders; the final rule uses both terms where it does not distinguish between the certificate holders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggests that clarification is needed as to whether a repair station may continue to utilize major repair data developed previously under its SFAR 36 authorization if that authorization ceases, terminates, or expires. The FAA agrees that a clarification is needed. A holder whose authorization has expired or has been terminated may not use data previously developed under its authorization to perform a major repair and return the product or article to service; the relevant provisions of FAR parts 121, 127, and 145 cited in Section 2 of the proposed and final rule prohibit that return to service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Section 7 of the final rule requires the holder to surrender its SFAR 36-developed data to the FAA. However, the FAA acknowledges that a holder whose authorization has expired or been terminated may have a legitimate future use for the data; e.g., the holder may apply to the FAA to have the data approved. Accordingly, to accommodate the FAA's continued airworthiness concerns and a holder's interest in data it has developed, Section 7 of the final rule has been revised to allow a former authorization holder to surrender its SFAR 36-developed data, or maintain its data indefinitely and make the data available to the FAA for inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information collection requirements in SFAR 36&hyph;6 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commission opens doors for E Europe THE EUROPEAN Commission has recovered its nerve. A new package of measures to accelerate the political and economic integration of six eastern European countries into the EC is bolder than expected, a rebuff to criticism of the Community's response to the collapse of communism. The proposals support improved, across-the-board market access for east European products; faster dismantling of EC tariffs; more Commission-led lending to finance infrastructure; and a commitment to eventual membership. None of these offers goes as far as the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Bulgarians, and Romanians would like, and they fall far short of the privileges of full membership. But the initial response is positive. A Polish official described the measures as 'ambitious', and argued that it was unrealistic to expect bigger moves by the EC. A Hungarian diplomat agreed: 'We have a very positive reaction. The acceptance of future membership as a shared objective is a very important political signal.' The Commission's proposals reflect a new alliance between Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Hans van den Broek, the EC commissioners responsible for external economic and political relations respectively. The two have apparently set aside earlier rivalry and championed the cause of freer trade. 'Improved market access is the most effective way of encouraging economic growth and the transition to market economies,' proclaims the document, which attacks the notion that increased imports from eastern Europe will cause lasting damage to EC members caught in recession. It points out that the EC moved from an Ecu1bn (Pounds 790m) trade deficit in 1991 to an Ecu1.7bn (Pounds 1.34bn) surplus in the first 11 months of 1992. Furthermore, eastern Europe accounted for just over 3 per cent of total EC imports (less than Norway), yet the EC accounted for more than half the total trade of eastern Europe. The chief trade liberalisation elements are: Lifting customs duties on industrial goods such as cars and chemicals by the end of 1994 - a two-year advance. Scrapping tariffs on 'sensitive' industrial goods at the end of the second year after the agreement comes into force. Moving from a quota-based system which sets rigid targets for imports into less restrictive ceilings. This means east Europeans will not automatically face higher tariffs if they breach import targets. Advancing by six months plans to reduce levies by 60 per cent on meat, dairy produce and vegetables from eastern Europe. Quotas are to be raised by 10 per cent, too. Scrapping duties on steel imports at the end of the fourth year - ahead of schedule but subject to new agreements with eastern Europe. Brussels officials predict a battle with member states over market access if the document is to win approval at next month's EC summit in Copenhagen. France, Spain and Portugal are all nervous about greater market access; Germany and Britain want a generous approach, if possible with more 'front-loading' so there is an immediate pay-off for east European exporters. The political proposals are also proving controversial. Mr van den Broek lost his fight to insert 1995 as the date for a review conference to assess the east European's progress toward EC membership. Another suggestion is to invite a committee of eminent personalities from western and eastern Europe to report to a future EC summit on how to foster closer ties.</p>

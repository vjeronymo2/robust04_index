			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`enn/now' report: "European Union Foresees No Law Suit </F> Regarding Eko-Aid"]    [Excerpt] Berlin/Brussels, 30 May -- The European Union  [EU] Commission has asked the German Government to explain the  failure to privatize the Eko-Stahl Steel Plant in  Eisenhuettenstadt, but does not intend to file any charges with  the European Court in Luxembourg on account of continued  financial aid. The EU Commission communicated this decision to  the Federal Economics Ministry today, thus canceling previous  rumors about a possible law suit for violating Article 95 of the  European Coal and Steel Communities Treaty.    On 18 May, the EU Commission had already informed the  Economics Ministry that financial aid from the Eko-Stahl  trustees would no longer be included in the restructuring  concept controlled by the Italian Riva concern, which the EU  Council of Ministers had approved last December. The Eko  trustees are currently paying the steel plant 120 million German  marks per month in order to preserve the plant's financial  capability and prevent the interruption of investment projects  hat have already started. At its 20 May meeting, the Eko-Stahl  trustees council had pledged to continue the aid until at least  20 May. [passage omitted]</p>

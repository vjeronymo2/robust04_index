However, the poll could go ahead without the Inkatha Freedom  Party, the Bophuthatswana Government, and the Afrikaner  Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] which includes the  Conservative Party. The three Freedom Alliance members failed  to register before last night's midnight deadline. But this  came as no surprise as they had stated earlier that they would  not be contesting the election despite a flurry of urgent  meetings with the government and the ANC [African National  Congress] in the pasts few weeks to try to accommodate their  minimum demands for participation. Both the government and the  ANC have expressed willingness to accept a possible extension of  the deadline.    The main parties that will be contesting the elections are  the ANC, the National Party, the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress],  and the Democratic Party. Others in the race are the African  Christian Democratic Party, Mr. Armichand Rajbansi's Minority  Front, and several parties with strong regional bases. Qwaqwa  based Dikwankwetla [The Strong], Gazankulu's Ximoko Progressive  Party, Lebowa's United People's Front, and the Ciskei-based  African Democratic Movement. The more conventional parties were  joined by several new comers with diverse election tickets.  These includes the Realists, the North-West Democratic, the  Merit Party, the Islamic, the Workers' International to rebuild  the fourth international South Africa, and the worker's list  parties. Three parties hope to bring women's interests to the  fore. They are the Women's Rights Peace Party, the South  African Women's Party, and a One Woman Party, the Keep It  Straight and Simple Party, or KISS, for short, whose main thrust  is the abolition of taxes.</p>

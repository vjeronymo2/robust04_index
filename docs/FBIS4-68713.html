			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Davydov: "Great Prospects for </F> British-Russian Cooperation"]    [Text] Trade volume between Russia and Great Britain  was $3.7 billion in 1993, remaining at roughly the same level as  in previous years. Products in the raw materials group continued  to predominate in Russian exports, including diamonds and  precious metals, oil and petroleum products, other metals and  wood products. Generally speaking, based on figures for January  1994 one may conclude that there has been an upturn in  Russian-British trade, as trade increased by a factor of two in  comparison to January 1993, with growth in both Russian and  British shipments. Russia and Great Britain are currently  negotiating on ways of dealing with the former USSR's  indebtedness based on the terms of the Club of Paris agreement.  This will help resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the  two countries' economic relations: the uninsured commercial  debts of organizations in the former USSR to British companies,  which total approximately $250 million.    * * *    A few days ago Oleg Davydov, Russia's minister of foreign  economic relations, paid an official visit to Great Britain.    He met with members of the Cabinet of Ministers, including  minister of trade Needham, minister of energy Eggar, and  minister of state Goodlad. Talks were held with heads of the GPT  Company regarding a plan to modernize Moscow's telephone  network, a plan referred to as Comstar. The Russian minister  visited the sorting rooms of the DeBeers Company, met with the  head of the British Bankers' Association, and participated in a  roundtable discussion with the Confederation of British Industry.    Before departing from London for Montreux (Switzerland) to  attend a conference on trading in energy sources, Oleg Davydov  shared his impressions of his visit with a DELOVOY MIR  correspondent and talked about the most pressing problems of a  foreign economic nature facing Russia.    * * *    [Davydov] The first thing I should note is that British  business people are better prepared to expand their cooperation  with Russia than are their colleagues in other countries. They  have a fairly large amount of experience working with our  organizations. However, as you are aware, opportunities are  determined by the level of participation in cooperation. You  know that we have had a period of recession here, with declining  output. Currently Great Britain is emerging from a period of  decline, and soon it will start expanding its industrial  production volume; the sales market which could stimulate  economic development right now is quite well defined. It is  Russia and, of course, China. It appears that these are going to  define economic development. Those markets' capacity is very  large. It is only natural that the West is showing increasing  interest in those countries, with a view toward starting up  operations in those markets, or at least "staking a claim" in  this new "Klondike." Therefore our talks and meetings in Great  Britain were very serious.    This concerns us greatly. And the second thing that is  causing us some worry is that foreign capital is primarily  involved in the energy sector. Everybody is interested in oil  and gas production or refining. Yet the largest market is in the  consumer sectors, i.e. food industry and light industry. Thus  far foreign investment in those businesses has been very slight.  That is why we are currently considering ways of making the  terms of foreign investment in that sector of the economy even  more favorable. Proposals in this regard are being prepared by  the government and will be submitted to the State Duma for  discussion.    Generally speaking, in regard to the reason why foreign  investors are still holding back one should note their  insufficient understanding of the nature of the economic reforms  being implemented in Russia. Naturally the influx of investment  is hampered by the high rate of inflation, the weak banking  system and insufficient tax breaks for investors during the  period of initial capital recoupment.    Direct investments by British partners have also been very  limited thus far. They mainly go into the energy sector, the  textile industry, communications and a few other areas. British  officials and businessmen have learned, "firsthand," so to  speak, that a presidential edict entitled "On Improvement of  Work With Foreign Investments" has been issued for the purpose  of improving the investment climate for foreign entrepreneurs.  They have expressed an interest in the fact that newly-created  normative acts will not apply for three years to enterprises  that exist at the time those acts are enacted, or to plans for  the development of security-based forms of attracting foreign  capital and the possibility of foreign investors' participation  in privatization of Russian enterprises. The English were keenly  interested in the news that the government is currently  considering a new program to bring foreign capital into the  process of defense plant conversion in Russia. The priority  sectors singled out in this regard are manufacturing of civil  aviation equipment, maritime and river transportation, equipment  for the fuels-and-energy complex, new communications technology  and equipment for agriculture and the food industry.    The amount of foreign investment in those areas could reach  $4 billion by 1995 and as much as $20 billion by 2000.    The West, including Great Britain, has shown great interest  in the terms of operation for foreign banks and the conducting  of financial operations in Russia. At this point our banks are  still very weak. During the transition period it will be  virtually impossible to ensure them the ability to compete  successfully at the international level. Therefore we have  offered 12 percent of the market to our partners and we feel  that as of the present time that is as far as Russia is prepared  to go. As reforms progress and banking structures grow stronger  we will expand foreign banks' access to the Russian market.    Beginning in the middle of this year a favorable climate  will  be created for foreign investors, including British ones, due to  a transition to the principle of selling shares in Russian  enterprises through stock exchanges. That means that Russia is  opening up to Western capital the stage of direct partnership in  restructuring of the Russian economy.</p>

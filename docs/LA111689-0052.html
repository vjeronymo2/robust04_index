			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> COLORADO ST. BRIDGE TO CLOSE  </P> <P> The city's landmark Colorado Street Bridge will be closed to traffic  immediately while the city undertakes a structural analysis of the bridge to  determine if it would be safe during an earthquake.  </P> <P> The closure was approved Tuesday by the Pasadena Board of Directors, who also  approved structural analysis for five other city-owned bridges.  </P> <P> In addition to the Colorado Street Bridge, the following bridges will be  checked: the San Rafael, the La Loma, the Holly Street and the Oak Grove Drive  bridges over the Arroyo Seco, and the Oak Grove Drive Bridge over Flint Canyon  Wash.  </P> <P> Three consulting firms will be paid $175,000 to determine how the structures  would fare in a major earthquake.  </P> <P> The city decided to check its bridges after engineers advised city officials  that the Colorado Street Bridge might collapse if Pasadena experienced an  earthquake of the same magnitude that struck Northern California on Oct. 17.  </P></p>

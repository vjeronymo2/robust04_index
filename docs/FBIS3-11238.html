			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) reported that  in the event there is no absolute winner in the 20 March  presidential elections, a second electoral round is scheduled  for 24 April. TSE President Dr. Arturo Zaldivar said the TSE has  everything ready for a second round.    Political party representatives who were asked, however,  listed the inconveniences a second round would cause. Therefore,  they have asked citizens to make every effort to vote on Sunday  to decide once and for all their future. A second round would  cause generalized uncertainty, directly affecting investments.  Likewise, new elections would freeze bureaucratic work. Just  organizing a second round would cost millions [currency not  specified]. The parties would have to spend money on new  propaganda. Citizens would be again exposed to partisan  propaganda. Voters would have to face further discomfort.    Zaldivar, on the other hand, rejected a possible FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] election challenge  in Chalatenango Department. The FMLN are dissatisfied about  concentrating four municipality voting sites in the department's  capital. Zaldivar said it is not true that the UN is pressuring  them to leave the polling stations in Arcatao, San Jose las  Flores, Nueva Trinidad, and San Isidro Labrador. "We do not  accept domestic or foreign pressures," the official stated.    He said the FMLN has no possibility of challenging the  elections there because the TSE is in compliance with the law.  On this Zaldivar said: "Challenges are made when the law is  disregarded. We are obeying the law." He added that the general  rule is that voting should occur in the municipalities but the  same law covers exceptions. It states that voting places may be  changed due to unforeseen circumstances or in rare cases. Other  voting places have also been changed, like San Francisco Gotera,  which was moved to Cara Sucia, and Colon, which will be moved to  Lourdes. "In these cases, nothing was said because there is  simply no political interest," Zaldivar said.</p>

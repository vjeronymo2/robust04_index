			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The race: Governor. Whose ads? Democratic candidates Dianne Feinstein and John  K. Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> Feinstein, the confident front-runner, is showing signs of looking beyond the  June 5 primary to the November general election with a new 30-second commercial  that emphasizes several elements of her record as mayor of San Francisco from  1978 to 1987. As is often the case in compressed television spots, the ad  raises several points that might be debatable. The commercial begins airing  immediately and will run statewide, the campaign said.  </P> <P>  Elements of the advertisement with an analysis by Times political writer John  Balzar:  </P> <P> Ad: "Oct. 17, 1989. World Series, Game 3. A day no Californian can forget. But  because of one woman's foresight and common sense, a reinforced Candlestick  Park protected thousands when the quake hit."  </P> <P> Analysis: There were many competing priorities in San Francisco at the time,  but earthquakes hold a special terror. So when the Department of Public Works  warned her of structural danger at the ballpark, she authorized a $150,000  temporary shoring up of the stadium's overhanging lip. Later, as part of a  $27-million rehabilitation, including the addition of luxury boxes and  additional seats, the stadium was permanently reinforced.  </P> <P> Ad: "Her innovative plan built and financed affordable housing. She started the  Youth Conservation Corps to train disadvantaged youth. (She saved) the cable  cars."  </P> <P> Analysis: Criticized for supporting the San Francisco high-rise boom,  Feinstein's housing program required developers to contribute to housing as a  condition for building. She claims that 5,000 units of housing have been built  or rehabilitated at a cost of $35 million since the program began in 1981.  Still, a 1989 report by the city found that only 5% of families could afford a  median-priced home in San Francisco. The youth corps was started in 1984, after  the establishment of a similar program by the state. Finally, with an energetic  fund-raising effort, Feinstein was a leader in helping renovate the city's  picturesque 109-year-old cable car system.  </P> <P> Ad: "And (she) signed the law making San Francisco the first major city to  divest from South Africa."  </P> <P> Analysis: This is the most controversial claim in the ad. Feinstein signed a  resolution calling for pension fund divestiture in 1985 and signed a stronger  city divestiture ordinance in February, 1986. Van de Kamp's campaign says the  advertising claim is distorted and overblown. She signed the ordinance, yes,  but opposed it every step of the way through the Board of Supervisors and acted  only under threat of a veto override and citizen initiative, the Van de Kamp  campaign says. Moreover, her opponent continued, Feinstein successfully lobbied  on behalf of the locally headquartered Bank of America for an exemption so the  bank could continue to conduct business in both South Africa and with the city  of San Francisco. Finally, 36 cities (including Los Angeles) and 11 states  passed divestment laws before San Francsico, according to news accounts at the  time.  </P> <P> Ad: At the end of the ad, Feinstein takes aim at Republican Pete Wilson. "She's  the only candidate for governor, Democrat or Republican, with a plan to manage  growth."  </P> <P> Analysis: Feinstein has proposed a new state commission to plan for population  growth. She says it would be modeled after the state Coastal Commission,  empowered to draw up regional growth plans and force adherence by cities and  counties. Feinstein says new growth can be accommodated by directing it to  those areas that want it. She mentions Chico as an example, although the  controlled-growth movement is well entrenched in Northern California.  </P> <P> Underdog Van de Kamp, unable to move ahead in the polls or recapture a sense of  momentum, seems to be looking ahead, as well -- perhaps to how he will be  remembered in the future. Rather than going on the attack as some had  predicted, Van de Kamp previewed for statewide airing a soft, inspirational  homily about his support for the environmentalist "Big Green" ballot initiative  that will face voters in November.  </P> <P>  The ad is narrated by Van de Kamp against a changing backdrop of forest, farm  and waterfalls, with him holding a child in his arms and speaking to  supporters:  </P> <P> Ad: "And the big Green initiative for which I am fighting will change the face  of California forever. To protect the coastline. . . . To reforest our land. .  . . To outlaw cancer-causing pesticides. . . . And to phase out products  threatening the ozone layer essential to life on Earth. . . . And someday, when  our peaceful war to save the world is finally won, let it be said the tide was  turned here, this year, in this special state, California."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] We now have Premier Carl Bildt with us on the  phone. What is your comment on the negotiations breakthrough in  Brussels?    [Bildt] The talks have been very tough but a few minutes ago  they were solved in that the European Union [EU] side announced  that they had accepted the final position taken by Sweden as a  result of the give and take which has been going on for quite  some time. This is, of course, of extraordinarily great  significance. This is the most important international agreement  Sweden has concluded this century. It opens the way for full  Swedish participation in European cooperation, widens the  political horizon, and provides new economic opportunities.  [passage omitted]    In matters of substance, it is a very satisfactory result.  It is my hope now we will also achieve an agreement between the  EU and the other countries, perhaps above all Finland and  Norway. I understand that as regards Finland, above all, it  seems to be very close now.    I also want to say that in my opinion there has been  extraordinarily skillful negotiation work by the Swedish  delegation led by Ulf Dinkelspiel in Brussels. There has also  been very close consultation with the Social Democrat  opposition. All this has contributed to success becoming  possible. [passage omitted]</p>

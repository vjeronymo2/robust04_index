			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Happiness is modest expectations - Keynote / Equity yields have been deceptive. Many companies are digging into their reserves to maintain dividends HISTORIANS WILL one day come up with searching analyses of Britain's economic problems during the past couple of years. For the moment, we only know that the perennial recovery hopes of the Treasury and most City of London economists have been repeatedly dashed. In spite of the Tories' election vicitory and some euphoria in the London stock market, the recession continues. A jittery market had managed to hold up really quite well until Budget Day on March 10. But when the then Chancellor Norman Lamont revealed the barrenness of the nation's cupboard, with a Pounds 28bn borrowing requirement, effectively dashing the over-stimulated hopes of significant tax giveaways, the financial markets began to crumple. But first the good part. January had been quite buoyant, as it usually is, and over the quarter as a whole the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index, the broadest measure of the UK equity market, only lost about 1 per cent. This was not as progressive as the performance of US stocks on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Average was still slowly advancing into new all-time high ground until the beginning of March. But it was a great deal better than what was going on in Tokyo, where the great 1980s share-price bubble was relentlessly being deflated - stocks fell about a sixth during the first three months. It has been a time for much theorising about recessions and recoveries. Official figures for the final quarter of 1991 confirmed that the British economy was still heading downhill, confounding all those official government forecasts of an imminent turn for the better. As further statistics on industrial production, unemployment and car sales emerged during the winter, it appeared likely that the economic contraction was continuing into its sixth successive quarter. Extraordinarily, however, the normal antidote to a recession - a fall in interest rates - again failed to materialise. Short-term interest rates in the UK stopped falling last September, and remained stuck at 10 1/2 per cent during the January-March period, although rates in the US and in Japan were slashed to under 5 per cent. The UK's monetary freedom has, of course, been circumscribed by the decision to join the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. Interest rates are now set largely to suit Germany, which still has an overheating problem. Britain has indeed bought exchange-rate stability and lower inflation, but at a price which is only now emerging. To an extent, the strains showed up in some terrible bank profit figures for 1991, when the bad-debt provisions of the Big Four high street clearing banks aggregated Pounds 5.6bn. That reflected the big corporate failures of 1991 and the myriad small business and personal loan problems that have built up during the recession. Recovery, it was hoped, was around the corner. But further problems have emerged, especially in the beleaguered property sector where major national and international developers such as Speyhawk, Heron and Olympia &amp; York confessed to financial problems in March. Against this unpromising background, the stock market seemed astonishingly ready to believe that the Conservatives could pull off a narrow victory in the general election. But although stock market sentiment can cause big temporary swings around the time of a general election, history shows that longer-run trends persist either side of the result. In this case, we have a stock market which hit an all-time high last September, more or less coinciding with the last fall in sterling short-term interest rates, but has been struggling to hold its ground since. The big question-mark now is over dividend growth, which has been the great engine of the UK equity market since profits growth petered out some two years ago. Many companies have been willing to dig into their reserves in order to keep paying out. In the first quarter, it was remarkable that there were so many big banks and insurance companies willing to maintain or even increase their dividends despite huge bad debts and underwriting losses. Industrial companies were wilting, however, and even some traditionally big payers, such as Lonrho, were forced to slash their dividends. An average yield of over 5 per cent during the quarter had given tremendous support to share prices in London. Historically, if you have bought the equity market at this yield, you have never been out of the money for very long. But then, we have not suffered such a prolonged recession - which at some stage we may have to start calling a depression - since the 1930s. So should we be wary of dividend growth prospects? The constituent companies of the All-Share Index raised their payments on a weighted average basis by just 4 per cent in the year to the end of March, and there was no growth at all in the January-March quarter. Some of the most buoyant dividends have come out of the newly privatised sectors - such as water, where dividend growth has been 13 per cent over the past year - and fortunately these utilities are now freed from political risks. Companies as a whole, however, may want to rethink their dividend strategies, because times are tough and dividend cover has been eroded. In a depression, it can be better to buy bonds, once stability is reached. But UK government bonds - gilt-edged - fared no better than equities during the first quarter, with prices slumping in March and losing all their earlier gains. Still, gilts too were boosted by the election result. In the current quarter, it will begin to become clearer at what kind of interest rate level the government will be able to sell the many billions of pounds of gilts needed to finance the yawning budget deficit. But this could be a troubled and erratic period for equities as well as government bonds. We also face continued uncertainty over sterling's position within the European Community's exchange rate. Can the Germans be persuaded to bring their interest rates down and reduce the pressure on other member states? Or might the UK be forced to find its own solution, possibly sharing a common interest with France? With the election out of the way, and the need for political unity within the parties reduced, there is likely to be a more noisy political debate on this subject - and the longer that interest rates stay high, the noisier it will be. A simple devaluation of sterling can now be ruled out, with the Conservatives back in power. Yet that only confirms the problem of the recession. In the next few months, the happiest investors will be those with modest expectations.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (15): A sea change for futures and options - Derivative Markets ONE OF the more interesting developments in recent years in pension fund investment has been the increasing use of the equity derivative markets. Until the late 1980s, futures and options were something that cautious pension fund trustees avoided. The possibility of having a substantial part of one's portfolio wiped out by what was viewed as extremely risky and speculative products meant that most pension funds gave derivatives a wide berth. The prospect of unlimited losses filled trustees with horror. The spectacular losses in some of the commodity futures traders confirmed their suspicions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe into the Chicago futures market also created worries among the larger institutions that they would be fleeced by unscrupulous floor traders. The expense of introducing new computer systems which track the performance of futures and options and the sheer technical difficulty of understanding some of the derivative markets - particularly options  - has been a deterrent. Finally, the inability of equity futures markets to operate smoothly during the stock market crash of 1987 led to a disillusionment among some fund managers, who were unable to use the markets to hedge against their holdings of shares. But there was one other important reason why pension funds avoided futures and options. Until last year, futures transactions - those made to hedge a portfolio - were liable for capital gains tax. Others - which were classed as trading - were liable for corporation tax. All that changed in the 1990 budget, when Mr John Major, then chancellor of the exchequer, bowed to years of lobbying and exempted pension funds and authorised unit trusts from tax on trading income from futures and options. The Finance Act of July 1990 cleared the way for traded options and futures to enjoy a more favourable tax treatment than that of their underlying securities. Now, gains from futures and options are treated as capital rather than income. These important regulatory change have been the catalyst for a major sea change in pension funds' use of futures and options. 'These changes had a big impact in making trustees feel more comfortable about the use of derivatives,' says Mr Andrew Maclaren of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management. 'Before it was a bit of a grey area and that was enough to deter some funds from those markets.' One clear reflection of the changes has been the increased turnover of FT-SE 100 index futures on the London International Financial Futures Exchange. It rose by more than 40 per cent in 1990. According to Mr Nick Weinreb, deputy market secretary at Liffe, the tax changes showed that the government believed futures and options were important. 'Now there is much more awareness from trustees who are giving approval to fund managers but also learning how they work.' Liffe has organised three workshops over the last six months for trustees on the use of futures. Mr Weinreb says the interest has been 'staggering.' Fifty to 60 people have attended each workshop and with a further one planned next month, over 200 trustees will have attended in total - which represents a significant slice of the trustee community. While it is true that trustees who attend Liffe's workshops must already have an interest in derivatives, the questions being asked give an interesting indication of the level of awareness among trustees - and the results are surprising. Rather than asking basic questions about how the markets work, trustees tended to be interested in administrative and logistical problems. How are futures and options accounted for and how are they valued, are the sorts of points raised, says Mr Weinreb. Understanding how to manage the additional paper flow; and the measurement of performance of futures are other common questions. Actuaries and fund managers agree that returns are enhanced only marginally by the use of futures. The real benefit comes when a fund is seeking to alter its exposure to different countries. As Mr Maclaren explains: 'The historical industry practice has been to change asset allocation by buying holdings in individual shares, whereas as now the trend is towards using futures as a direct means of asset allocation, which is quicker and more flexible. The futures positions can be unwound as attractive individual holdings are built up if desired.' The changes that have taken place are reflected in a recent survey by KPMG Management Consulting of leading pension funds. Seven out of the 10 it surveyed expected to increase their use of futures and options over the next year. Meanwhile, eight out of 10 use derivatives for asset allocation trades and only seven out of 10 use them for hedging purposes. However, while there has been an increased use of derivatives by pension funds the changes have been gradual. Practitioners say there has been no 'big bang'. So far only a minority of funds uses futures. While most of the larger funds are using derivatives, of these only a handful have a majority of their funds using derivatives. The hesitancy of trustees has still not been totally overcome. As one fund manager says: 'Derivatives still have something of a bad name and trustees are suspicious about getting something for nothing.' The hesitancy is not just on the part of the trustees. While some of the larger pension fund management groups have encouraged clients to make use derivative markets, if an individual fund manager has a long-standing relationship with a particular fund and does not want to use derivatives, such a change is unlikely to forced on him or her by the group. There are still difficulties in devising systems which can monitor the investments and also clear and settle trades. Several medium-sized fund managers still have considerable problems in this area. Finally, the changes so far have benefited futures. Options are still not widely used by funds. The difficulties in valuing a widely diversified options portfolio has discouraged some funds, while others lack the expertise to explain its uses to trustees.</p>

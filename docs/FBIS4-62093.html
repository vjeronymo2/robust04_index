			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Berger article: "When the Military Wants To Seize </F> the Treasury, It Needs Neither Tanks Nor Special-Purpose Troops.  One Mercedes Is Sufficient"]    [Text] It became known Tuesday evening that the Russian  president had agreed to the proposal by the State Duma Defense  Committee to increase defense spending this year to 55 trillion  rubles [R]. This committee's proposals, sent to the premier,  bear the endorsement of Boris Yeltsin: "I deem it expedient to  agree."    As is known, the figure of R37.1 trillion for defense  features in all the versions of the government draft, including  the one submitted once again to the Duma for discussion 11 May.  Back at the beginning of March, when the sum of the proposed  military spending became known, the military department together  with the military-industrial complex mounted an extensive  campaign for the radical revision of that figure. Upward,  naturally.    Until very recently, however, the military was losing this  war for money. Blackmail by military industrialists, who had  declared at the beginning of March that such a budget would lead  to the closure of 3,000 enterprises in the military-industrial  complex, failed to make the expected impression. Pavel  Grachev's March memorandum to Boris Yeltsin had no direct  consequences, although, according to the newspaper SEGODNYA, it  gained the president's endorsement: "I share the defense  minister's concern."    Two months later -- two months which the military lobby, to  all appearances, did not waste -- there came a series of  conferences of interested persons and departments in this  regard. They culminated in a discussion of the problem with  Yuriy Baturin, the president's assistant for national security.  Everyone there naturally claimed that national security demands  a sharp increase in defense spending.    Two months ago the military's appetite extended to R80  trillion. Given the total budget expenditure planned at the  time of R183 trillion, this meant that almost 44 percent of all  state spending would go on defense.    It should be pointed out that even high-ranking nonmilitary  experts in the government were speaking of the unrealistically  low level of defense spending planned for this year. Their  chief argument was that the sector of the economy associated  with defense cannot be cut back as fast as the whole of the rest  of the country's economy.    The maintenance of personnel (wages, clothing allowance,  etc.) accounts for the lion's share of the expenditure. This  part cannot be sharply reduced for the very reason that an  officer being transferred to the reserve must receive 20 times  his monthly salary and other benefits, which add up to a tidy  sum. In such a situation it is cheaper for the Ministry of  Defense to maintain the military than to reduce it.    There are grounds for believing that the chief internal  spring of the military's financial activeness is the fact that  it has ALREADY PLACED THE DEFENSE ORDER FOR 1994 IN THE SUM OF  R28.3 TRILLION, WHILE THE EXISTING BUDGET GIVES IT NO MORE THAN  R5.5 TRILLION FOR THIS    At the last conference with Baturin the chief opponent of  the  military lobby (ex officio, at least) -- Andrey Astakhov, deputy  minister of finance -- showed sympathy toward the sphere which  he supervises. He said that it is necessary to add to the  military's money, but within the limits of the overall figures  for state expenditure already defined.    There are no grounds for doubting that only the first part  of  the deputy minister's sentence will be taken on board.    True, the new figure for military spending remains just a  project at present. Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin's  telephone conversation with the premier on this subject, which  took place Wednesday morning, did not turn this proposal into  the government's position, but neither did it cancel it out.    If the military succeeds in seeing this operation to seize  the treasury through to its logical end, it will receive 28  percent of all the state expenditure in the present budget or  almost half of the budget's actually expected income. The  existing draft budget allocates 20 percent of expenditure to  defense.    Knowledgeable people in the government say that if  parliament  approves a 50-percent increase in military spending, it will be  practically impossible to avoid allocating this money,  regardless of actual income. It will be sufficient for  Grachev's Mercedes to drive peacefully into the Kremlin. A very  tough instruction to the Ministry of Finance follows after every  such drive: Allocate money! Money will be allocated even if  this takes half the treasury's money, even if Russia is left a  country with the largest number of servicemen per head of the  civilian population.</p>

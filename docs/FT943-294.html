			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Berlusconi decides to go for broke: After failing to placate the unions, Italy's prime minister has opted for a more austere budget. Business leaders can hardly believe it Confindustria, the Italian industrialists' confederation, held back for a day in judging the Berlusconi government's 1995 budget for fear of appearing over-enthusiastic. But yesterday all reserve was removed. 'I scarcely believe that this government has dared do what no one else has dared to do - structural cuts in the pensions and health systems,' commented Mr Stefano Micossi, head of research at Confindustria. In stark contrast the unions have called a general strike for October 14 to protest against the budget's 'unfair and unacceptable' attack on pensions and health benefits. Already localised stoppages have been staged in major cities. The difference between these two positions is not surprising. On Tuesday in the final stages of preparing the budget the right-wing coalition changed tactics. Sensing the unions could not be placated, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, accepted the tough line advocated by the treasury. As a result the austerity measures acquired more teeth and the structural adjustments affecting Italy's chronic budget deficits became more significant. The government is committed to finding L29,000bn (Pounds 11.8bn) through spending cuts and extra revenues, so reducing the budget deficit by almost 2 percentage points to 8 per cent of GDP. The increase in public spending is being held to the projected inflation rate of 2.5 per cent a year. The burden of these adjustments will not fall evenly, and future pensioners, especially in the public sector, will lose out. At the same time the core of the fiscal measures pander directly to Mr Berlusconi's electorate - rewarding those who have built property without proper planning permission and those with tax assessment disputes. Last week the government made the terms of the building amnesty even more attractive to encourage people to register their properties (and hence provide registration revenue). In the case of tax assessments, a backlog of over 1m disputed cases can now be eliminated with the payment of often less than 10 per cent of the amount in dispute. This is an effective tax amnesty. These two 'amnesties' are due to raise two thirds of extra fiscal receipts. Other revenues will come from reducing the tax privileges of co-operatives; tightening tax evasion and imposing a minimum tax on shelf companies. The government could not duck the generous pay-as-you-go state pensions system. If unchecked the treasury funding of the pensions deficit would have risen 11 per cent to L94,000bn in 1995. The measures in the budget will reduce the rise in pensions transfers to 3.5 per cent. This will be achieved by accelerating the pace at which the retirement age is raised from 56 to 60 for women and 61 to 65 for men; by harmonising the rate at which pensions accrue annually at 2 per cent next year and lowering this to 1.75 per cent thereafter; and by penalising early retirement. Also all pension requests will be blocked for four months and throughout 1995 indexation payments will be frozen. The bulk of the other cuts come from the health system with the closure or sale of small hospitals, further reductions in the availability of free prescriptions, and a hefty cut in procurement contracts. The budget encourages privatisation of healthcare as well as increased use of private pension funds. The government's axe will be felt in every ministry, not least defence where the L1,000bn pruning risks seriously impairing Italy's pretentions to upgrade its military hardware to play a more active international role. In the civil service new hiring has been frozen and productivity pay bonuses are being introduced. But it is not clear whether enough funds have been earmarked to satisfy pending wage claims from the 3.6m civil servants, who have called a strike on October 13. Taken together these various measures underline the government's desire to balance austerity with a business friendly budget that builds upon the strong economic recovery now in evidence. The financial markets have reacted positively largely because the budget is tougher than anticipated. But the markets are still cautious because the government has done little more than the minimum necessary to tackle the deficit. The 1996 budget will have to find similar sums to hold down spending needs and the deficit will still be far from complying with Maastricht criteria. The extra cost of debt service resulting from the half percentage rise in the discount rate in August is not included in the budget. Other doubts also exist: on the yield from the two tax amnesties which are measures that have a notoriously unreliable record; on the ability of an inefficient civil service, now threatened by reform, to carry out the necessary cuts; on the natural tendency of Italian governments to understate spending needs; on the optimistic 2.5 per cent inflation target for 1995. Such doubts mean the Bank of Italy will not be easily persuaded to lower interest rates which are four points higher than in Germany. Unfortunately, the bank's view is also likely to be coloured by the five-month stand-off with the government over appointing a new director-general to succeed Mr Lamberto Dini, who became treasury minister.

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN RIGHT-HANDER WATSON SIGNS WITH BLUE JAYS  </P> <P> Matt Watson, a junior pitcher from Cal State Fullerton, signed a minor-league  contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, he said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The 22-year-old right-hander, drafted in the 14th round, will report Sunday to  the Blue Jays' New York Penn League Class A team in St. Catharines, Canada.  </P> <P> Watson made four starts and 11 relief appearances for the Titans this year. He  had 28 strikeouts and 27 walks in 33 innings and was 1-5 with a 4.91 earned-run  average.  </P> <P> "College is so geared to winning," Watson said. "We have guys on our staff who  are more consistent than me. I'm more of a power pitcher but I'm inconsistent.  I should be able to develop more in the pros."  </P> <P> Other Cal State Fullerton players drafted included pitcher Huck Flener,  outfielder Domingo Mota and shortstop Kevin Farlow.  </P> <P> Flener, a junior left-hander with an 8-1 record, was taken in the ninth round  by Toronto. He is meeting with Blue Jay officials today and is expected to sign  as soon as Friday.  </P> <P> Mota was picked in the 29th round by the Dodgers; his father, Manny, has worked  for the Dodgers for the past 21 years. Domingo hit .266 and led the Titans with  19 stolen bases.  </P> <P> Farlow, who was taken in the 15th round by San Diego, hit .284 with six home  runs.  </P> <P> Joe Sewell of UC Irvine, a junior right-hander with a 3-3 record and three  saves, was taken by the New York Mets in the 30th round.  </P> <P> Fullerton College outfielder Tom Wilson, who hit .307 with 11 home runs and 36  RBIs, was taken in the 23rd round by the Yankees.  </P> <P> Golden West College outfielder Shelby Hart (.252) was taken by Baltimore in the  12th round and pitcher Jason Hutchins (6-3, 4.41 ERA), also of Golden West, was  picked in the 30th round by the Giants.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Mike DiGiovanna contributed to this story.  </P></p>

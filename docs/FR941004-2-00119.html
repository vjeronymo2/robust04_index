			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CITES Secretariat has been working to screen Appendix III proposals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consult with the submitting Party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 28. Guidelines for Evaluating Marine Turtle Ranching Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States participated in a working group at the ninth meeting of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animals Committee in Brussels in September, 1993 which developed draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines for recommendation to the Animals Committee on this issue. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ninth meeting of the Animals Committee adopted a requirement for ``regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management on the basis of genetically defined populations''. The United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States strongly supported that element, which may have been removed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent meeting of the Animals Committee. The United States remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supportive of regional cooperation in the management of such widely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migratory endangered species as marine turtles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 29. Proposals To Register the First Commercial Captive-breeding Operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an Appendix I Animal Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 30. Standard Nomenclature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Support adoption of the resolution submitted by the United States, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was submitted at the request of the Nomenclature Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This resolution was submitted at the request of the CITES Nomenclature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee, and deals with nomenclature and taxonomy of CITES species. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution submitted was discussed and agreed upon by the Nomenclature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee at its May, 1994 meeting in Beijing, China. The names of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> genera and species of several families are in need of standardization and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current lack of a standard reference with adequate information creates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an implementation problem for some species. The United States also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that the taxonomy used in the appendices to the Convention will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be most useful to the Parties if standardized and correlated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nomenclatorial references.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This resolution makes several recommendations dealing with the inclusion of subspecies in the Appendices, use of references in proposals, synonyms, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the role of the Scientific Authorities in nomenclature issues. The resolution also recommends several standard references for species listed in the CITES Appendices, for mammals, birds, amphibians, cacti, cycads, tree ferns, and other plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> XV. Consideration of Proposals for Amendment of Appendices I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice published on September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46023), which sets forth summaries of the proposed U.S. negotiating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions on the proposals for amendment to the CITES Appendices for COP9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and requests information and comments from the public on these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> XVI. Conclusion of the meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Determination of the Time and Venue of the Next Regular Meeting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Conference of the Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No documents have been received indicating requests from possible host  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments. Favor holding COP10 in a country where all Parties will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admitted without political difficulties. Support the holding of COPs on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biennial basis, or, as in the case of COP9, after an interval of two and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one half years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COP meetings energize governmental and nongovernmental organizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned with CITES issues to examine its implementation, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation of affected species. The United States recognizes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial burdens of hosting a Conference of the Parties may serve to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discourage developing countries from offering to serve as host, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovative ways can be found to provide them with financial assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Information and Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service invites information and comments on the proposed negotiating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions on COP9 agenda items, excluding item XV, ``Consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals for amendment of Appendices I and II,'' which is the subject of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. Information and comments on this present notice should be submitted to the Service no later than October 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

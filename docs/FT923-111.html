			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Cost reprieve for Eurotunnel EUROTUNNEL is today expected to make important progress in its dispute with the Transmanche-Link (TML) consortium of building contractors over the costs of building the Channel tunnel. Eurotunnel's 220 banks are expected to give the company an additional two months to continue its negotiations with TML over claims made by TML for additional payments. Separately, TML contractors were last night braced for bad news from arbitration proceedings on whether they should continue to receive Pounds 50m a month in extra progress payments from Eurotunnel to cover some of the cost-overrun. They were worried the arbitrator may rule that the Pounds 50m payments should be terminated. Judgment is due today. The monthly cash payments have been especially valuable to the UK contractors, which have been hurt by the building industry recession. Eurotunnel was furious when an independent disputes panel ruled in March that the payments should be made and it appealed against the decision. Since the disputes panel ruling, Eurotunnel has been forced by its banks to hold talks with TML to end the row over whether it or TML should bear the brunt of a sharp increase in the costs of building the tunnel. The banks had set a deadline of early September for settlement of the dispute over the contractors' claims for more than Pounds 1bn in extra payments at 1985 prices. Eurotunnel failed to meet the deadline, so its banks have had to vote on whether to allow Eurotunnel to continue drawing from its Pounds 6.8bn loan facility or whether to prompt a financial crisis, which could involve the banks taking control of the project. The banks are voting on whether to allow Eurotunnel sufficient funds to continue meeting its obligations for another two months, while negotiations with TML continue. By yesterday evening, 100 banks had voted. An overwhelming majority - as measured by the value of their loans to Eurotunnel - had voted in favour of allowing Eurotunnel to continue drawing on facilities. Eurotunnel needs a majority of only 65 per cent of votes cast. However, for the vote to be valid, 112 banks have to cast a vote. Bankers said yesterday they were confident the remaining 12 would vote by today's 5pm deadline.</p>

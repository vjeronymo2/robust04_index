			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: JSDA to admit banks as special members JAPAN Securities Dealers Association is to admit banks as special members following April's financial system reform allowing bank units into the securities business, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'It is not clear when authorities will actually give a go-ahead for the first securities subsidiaries of banks,' JSDA said. 'But the overall direction has been set.' Bank units' operations will be restricted to the primary market, and will need to ask ordinary brokerages to trade equity-linked bonds they lead manage, JSDA said. The bank units will ask one JSDA-member brokerage to make a market in such bonds, and JSDA will appoint another as a second market-maker.</p>

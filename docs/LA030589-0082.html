			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NOSTALGIC APPEAL' OF THE AK-47 DRAWS FIRE  </P> <P> So the AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle has "nostalgic appeal"? ("In Defense  of the AK-47" by Patrick Mott, Feb. 24). What about the nostalgic appeal to  their families of children killed by the AK-47 and similar weapons?  </P> <P> But then we should remember that "Guns don't kill people; people kill people."  Why, then, are we concerned to reduce nuclear arsenals? Nuclear missiles don't  kill people; people kill people. Why are we concerned to eliminate the weapons  of chemical and bacteriological warfare? Chemical and bacteriological weapons  don't kill people; people kill people. In short, no weapons kill people; only  people kill people. But people without weapons designed exclusively for killing  would find it more difficult to do so.  </P> <P> ROBERT E.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] These Algerian-IMF talks have entered a decisive  phase, which is aimed at signing an agreement on a three-year  stable economic program. Our colleague Rabah Hallis wrote an  analytical paper on the issue, which will be read by Mokhtar  Maher:    Mr. Mourad Benachenhou, the economy minister, affirmed that  Algeria's present problems center around continued inflation  pressures and the increase in the unemployment level, especially  among the youth, on the other.    Prevailing over these problems call for an agreement with  the  IMF, because the continuation of the situation as it is would  lead to the collapse of the whole of the production apparatus  and the dismemberment of the social body.    But the agreement with the IMF on a stable economic program  does not mean that all the problems would be solved in a  comprehensive manner, because the economic and social situation  in Algeria is very complicated. Any violation of either of the  social or economic balances could result in social and political  dangers.    The statements of the different officials confirm that  Algeria is attempting to sign a politically and socially  acceptable agreement. The main problem lies here. How could a  compromise solution, between Algeria's demands of a politically  and socially acceptable agreement, on the one hand, and the  contents of the programs proposed by the IMF, on the other, be  reached ?    The contents of the programs that the IMF is calling for  have  a very high social cost, because in essence they restrain social  demand and attempt to absorb the surplus, while Algeria knows a  big increase in demand that is not matched by a supply which  suffers from weaknesses in its structure. This means that the  real average of income will noticeably fall. Would it therefore  be possible to make this fall acceptable socially?    Mr. Benhamouda's recent statements reveal that the General  Union of Algerian Workers [UGTA] does not any more object to the  idea of devaluing the dinar if the aim was to control inflation.  This stance is considered new in the UGTA's thinking. Has  Benhamouda been finally convinced that the continuation of the  existing situation is more dangerous to the workers than signing  a stable economic agreement with the IMF the main aim of which  is to control the levels of unemployment and inflation?</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: In the mutual interest . . . WHEN Peter and Hilary Rost helped set up the Mutual Share Ownership Investment Club in 1962, they wanted to invest more in the stock market than their resources would allow, so pooling money with friends seemed the solution. Now, their club is probably the UK's oldest. Although Peter Rost was a stockbroker, Hilary stresses that it has always been an 'amateur club' with a cross-section of members, including farmers, plumbers and housewives. The club is unusually large with about 60 members. 'We elect a committee which makes the day-to-day decisions and we meet every three months,' said Hilary. 'We meet more frequently when there is new money to add stocks to the portfolio. About 15-20 people usually attend.' Meetings are held at the Rost's home in Berkhamsted, Berks. Hilary says it was important to have a lawyer draw up club constitution and rules. The club has used nominee accounts from inception. New members either make a lump sum downpayment or monthly contributions using a banker's form. The average monthly payment is Pounds 15 to Pounds 20. The portfolio is valued at the beginning of each month and the new unit price calculated. Hilary took over this task once the accountant's fees became 'ridiculous.' It only takes her only half an hour now that the books are kept on computer. The portfolio holds five or six stocks which include: Eurotunnel, BP, Lonrho, Fleming Chinese Investment Trust and Abtrust's recently launched Emerging Economies Investment Trust. Dividends and profits are reinvested. Hilary says the main early difficulty was lack of stock market understanding. 'Choosing shares was also difficult. We did not, for example, know what distinguished the shares of one food company from another. So we spent a lot of time reading and cutting out articles to discuss at the meetings.' She said: 'We outperformed the market until the recession and the portfolio is now worth Pounds 65,000 although it has been as much as Pounds 100,000. It is great fun - you can be the last of the big spenders and you feel you have a stake in the companies.'</p>

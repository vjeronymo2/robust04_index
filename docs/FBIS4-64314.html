			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Silvio Berlusconi has been entrusted with the  task of forming a new government in Italy. [passage omitted]  The French Government hopes that close cooperation will  continue with the Italian Government. Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe said that it will be necessary to judge on actual evidence:    [Begin Juppe recording] Since the birth of the EC, Italy has  been one of the most fervent players in the construction of the  Community. I hope it will still be the same. This government  has just been formed; we do not know its projects. We must  judge on actual evidence. What is said during an election  campaign does not always allow one to pass a precise judgement  on what a government will do after the elections. I think that  we should wait and see what will happen in the next few weeks  and months. I really hope that we shall continue to work  closely with Italy and that what is the very foundation of the  construction of Europe -- a community of values and the same  ideas about democracy and the rule of law -- will continue to  exist in Europe. This is the foundation of European identity  and of the construction of the European Union. [end recording]</p>

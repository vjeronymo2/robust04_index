			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Appleyard helped by exceptional APPLEYARD Group, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, reported pre-tax profits ahead 16 per cent in the six months to June 30. The outcome of Pounds 1.75m compared with Pounds 1.51m in the first half of last year and was only marginally short of the depressed Pounds 1.81m achieved in the whole of 1991. However, the latest figure was struck after an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.37m relating to the disposal of freehold property in Leeds, and interest charges reduced to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.65m). Turnover fell to Pounds 158.1m (Pounds 218.9m). Mr Mike Williamson, chairman, said the new car market during the period was 4 per cent below last year, but the group had improved overall margins. Contract hire and leasing lifted profits by 15 per cent and the commercial vehicle side performed 'extremely well' in a weaker market. Referring to sales in August, Mr Williamson said overall volumes were largely unchanged with the notable exception of Audi/VW where national volumes were down 23 per cent on August 1991. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.6p, uncovered by earnings of 2.2p (2.1p) per share.</p>

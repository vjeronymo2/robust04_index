			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Bolivia fails to meet IMF terms BOLIVIA has failed to meet some terms of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, government officials have confirmed. The development could delay a rescheduling of the country's debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations. The main sticking point is understood to be the country's public sector deficit. Mr Pablo Zegarra, minister of finance, said the IMF had been insisting on a public sector deficit figure of 3.2 per cent this year, which the government was unlikely to meet. The deficit reached 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1991 and has averaged 4 per cent over the four-year government of President Jaime Paz Zamora. The IMF had also envisaged a drop in Bolivia's inflation rate from around 15 per cent in 1991, to 7.5 per cent by the end of 1993. Mr Zegarra predicts inflation will reach 9 per cent by year end. In September the IMF extended for a fourth year an enhanced structural adjustment facility, a concessional lending facility. The main significance of the development is not the loss of IMF credit - only about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.2m) of the credit remains to be disbursed  -but the impact on a Paris Club debt deal. The current agreement runs out at the end of June. At end-1991, some Dollars 1.5bn of Bolivia's Dollars 4.1bn debt was owed to bilateral government creditors.</p>

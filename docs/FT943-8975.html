			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: Rude health blossoms on the Edinburgh Fringe Before the official festival starts with Mahler conducted by local son Donald Runnicles, the Edinburgh theatre fringe has blossomed into rude, sometimes very rude, health. The usual strong transatlantic influence is evinced at the Traverse, a venue so vital to Edinburgh in the festival and out of it that it seems anomalous to classify it as fringe. Besides the Canadian Brad Fraser's rather disappointing recycling of previous themes in Poor Super Man, reviewed last month, two plays by Americans have already made their mark. Killer Joe is part of what seems like this festival's trend towards the strong meat of brutal sex and violence. Tracy Letts' play is performed superbly by the Hired Gun Theater of Chicago. This is Sam Shepard territory, a trailer park in Texas. Ansel (Marc A Nelson, grossly beer-bellied over his Y-fronts) shares a mobile home with his second wife Sharla who is in the habit of answering the door naked from the waist down. The plot is less important than mood, but it centres on killing Ansel's ex-wife for her life insurance. Also in the scheme are the children of the first marriage, feckless Chris and the feyly virginal Dottie. The killer of the title is the hitman (Eric Winzenreid) who demands Dottie as part of his fee, to the semi-articulate unhappiness of Chris who obviously feels more than brotherly love for his sibling. Brilliant acting (notably from Michael Shannon and Shawna Franks as the Siegmund and Sieglinde of the caravan set) steers the characters clear of cliche and the play is often funny as well as disturbing. Wilson Milam's direction explodes into disconcertingly vivid violence which threatens to burst the bounds of a claustrophobic set (designer: Luke Grimm). Killer Joe is an engrossing work  -which incidentally depicts an act of sexual outrage on no-good Sharla (Holly Wantuch) that should leave Kentucky Fried Chicken uncertain whether to sue or use it as great publicity. Another American play, Liberty Oregon, is presented by an English-based group. The year-old Foothold Theatre Company has already given Steffen Silvis' haunting ode to the casualties of a forgotten corner of history at the Man in the Moon, Chelsea, but it deserves its festival showing. Sometimes falling into the trap of self-conscious Fine Writing, the piece nevertheless generates power in Natasha Carlish's confident production. Here the presiding deity is John Steinbeck, with a dash of genuine loathing for small-town redneck America that is all the author's own. We meet Nadia Novitski as a young girl collecting shells on the beach, and her father, a strike-leader at the local saw-mills. Nigel Hook's set drapes a tattered Old Glory above the suggestion of a worm-eaten, splintered world that harbours fundamentalist Christians beating the devil out of the rebellious girl, racist authorities that intern Japanese American citizens after Pearl Harbour, and inanely bright proprietors of burger chains, the new carpet-baggers snapping up the internees' property. We follow Nadia's quest to find out what happened to her father and the other mill-hands after they were transported on a freight train, roped and hooded, to oblivion, her father bearing a good-luck shell from the beach. Silvis has a savage eye for his own new world: the religiosity and racism, the corruption and inequity of the melting-pot that never melded, of new Americans - German or Irish or whatever - 'driven by second-hand dreams of how they once belonged somewhere else'; and the totemic nationalism of those 'ending up in some shotgun shack pledging allegiance to a rag'. The play ends uncomfortably with the disappearance of Nadia as she nears the revelation of what happened to her father. The radio news reports a woman being picked up in the middle of nowhere carrying human bones and a petrified shell. The item is dropped and then all traces of Nadia officially disappear. Uniformly well acted by an Anglo-American-Malay cast (David Gilliam's adept doubling - vicious sheriff, all menacing rage, and alcoholic derelict - is typical), the play is dominated by Sarah McVicar. She gives Nadia a toughness that never becomes bitter, a weary hopefulness that casts a radiance at the heart of the author's unforgiving vision. I felt pretty unforgiving after an hour of Bow to the Beast, where the audience is harangued by a bare-chested young man, apparently a serial killer though this assumption of these particular sins could merely be part of his messianic conviction that he is the 'psychopathic Christ' - no, sorry, we are the psychopathic Christ. Though 'devised' by the company (the usually accomplished Boilerhouse), the text is attributed to Barry Graham, an angry young Scottish writer, ex-boxer and Zen Buddhist. Descriptions of murder and necrophilia or choking a child to death on Smarties may pack a certain shocking punch, but the conclusions are both banal and illogical, the methods stale - TV interviews with Nazi camp officials and their families: 'He was a good man, a good father, doing his job'. The moment of truth comes fairly near the beginning when we are informed 'What I am going to have to show you you will never understand'. Jan Knightley performs with ferocious physical intensity. Off the Royal Mile, The Pleasance's complex of performance spaces is already humming with activity. A trifle tentatively in the case of Abducting Diana which I saw early in its run before the company, Moving Theatre, had ironed out technical problems. I would be more worried about injecting some thrust into Susan Penhaligon's sleek dumpling performance of what should be a cyanide souffle in the title-role. This British premiere of a 1986 Dario Fo comedy is not about you-know-who. The original Francesca was a banker kidnapped and held to ransom; in Jonathan Banatvala's production she is a media tycoon, one Diana Forte-McKaye. Typically for Fo, farce is piled on social comment, but the Italian fun fails to fizz in English. Everything is too exaggerated. There are national styles in injustice, and this does not quite gel, despite painstakingly interpolated British references to such natural targets as Stringfellow's, Hello] and The Independent. Some of the translation is doggedly facetious. Some is quite funny, but not enough to clarify the tangled threads of this plot of bluff, double-bluff, twist and turn. And writers of comedy should never tempt comparisons by mentioning other comics. 'This is isn't Ray Cooney,' says someone sharply. Alas no. Full marks to Clare Welch as Diana's mother for crisp comic style.</p>

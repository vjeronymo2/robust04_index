			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Lords' fears over forensic 'cowboys' THE growing private market in forensic science needs new regulations to prevent police or defence lawyers using 'cowboys', the Lords' science and technology committee recommended yesterday. Lord Dainton, chairman, said the committee was surprised to find the Pounds 40m a year public forensic services 'in much better shape' than it had expected. But the committee was concerned about the small but growing private sector. The committee recommended a system of individual registration for all of the 900 or so forensic scientists working in the UK, to help customers steer clear of bogus operators.</p>

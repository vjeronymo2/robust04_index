			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US fishermen to protest against French embargo A US-French row is simmering over US complaints that French health inspectors are deliberately holding up imports of fresh and frozen US fish. There have been reports this week that the French are close to at least partially lifting a virtual embargo against US fish. But the US administration, which filed an official protest last week, is expected to reject any compromise. US fishermen are expected to stage a protest today outside the French embassy in Washington if no solution has been found. Congressman Gerry Studds, chairman of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, says American fisherman, trying to sell fish 'under-utilised' in the US market - including dogfish, skate and mackerel - in France, last month suddenly found their products refused entry and left to rot in airport warehouses. According to Mr Studds, the French government has never made any claim that rejection of the fish was based on legitimate health concerns, but publicly admitted during the February 23 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade council meeting that the actions were a 'highly temporary' solution to address strikes and violent protests by French fisherman about cheap imports. 'It is clear that your government's actions are an attempt to placate your fishermen at the expense of American fishermen and exports,' he has told the French. He says the US is considering retaliation. The US annual exports about Dollars 200m worth of fish and fish products to France, while the French exports about Dollars 360m worth to the US. Congressman Studds says the French have 'flagrantly' refused to honour international agreements to conserve bluefin tuna. For this alone, their seafood imports into the US can be embargoed.</p>

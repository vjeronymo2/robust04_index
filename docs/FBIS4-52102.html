			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Communications  Minister Yun Tong-yun and his Japanese counterpart Hikasa  Katsuyuki agreed Friday to establish a policy coordination  committee to help construct an "Information Superhighway"  linking the two countries, the Communications Ministry said.    The two ministers also agreed to hold seminars on building  an  information superhighway and to exchange ministry officials to  boost bilateral cooperation on the project.    The agreements were reached during a meeting of the two  ministers, the first of its kind, which South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam and former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa had pledged to hold during a summit meeting last March.    In a joint statement after the meeting, the two ministers  stressed that the information and communications industry will  supply the core technology which will decide national  competitiveness in the 21st century and that building  information infrastructure through cooperation between Seoul and  Tokyo will contribute to the development of the world economy,  culture and living standards.    The ministers also said they had agreed to discuss further  the possibility of allowing businesses from one country to  participate in information infrastructure projects in the other,  the development of communications satellites and the use of  frequency resources.    According to officials of the Communications Ministry who  attended the meeting, the Korean side outlined Seoul's  information superhighway projects including organizing and  financing plans.    The Japanese also explained plans to organize and finance  such projects, the officials said. They introduced a model  project in which the information superhighway network will be  installed in the western Kansai region ahead of other regions.    During the meeting, the Japanese proposed the establishment  of the Asia Information Infrastructure (AII) to compete with the  Global Information Infrastructure (GII) planned by the United  States, the officials said. The Seoul side opposed the idea,  however, citing the need to move gradually because the GII  project remains in the planning stage and the AII project  requires cooperation from China and Southeast Asian countries.    The proposed policy coordination committee on the  information  superhighway consists of bureau-director-level officials from  the two ministries who will co-chair committee meetings,  officials from Korea Telecom, Korea Electronics and  Telecommunications Research Institute, Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone, several other communications technology institutes  and academics from both countries, according to the ministry  officials.    Katsuyuki, who arrived here Thursday at the invitation of  South Korean Communications Minister Yun, is scheduled to fly  back to Tokyo Saturday afternoon after winding up his three-day  visit, the officials said.</p>

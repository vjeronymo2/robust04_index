			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: TRW unveils Dollars 140m deficit TRW, the US automotive, space and information services group, yesterday unveiled a loss of Dollars 140m for 1991 after taking a final quarter restructuring charge of Dollars 256m, which the management had warned about in December. Excluding the charge, which was taken to help fund an overhaul of TRW's businesses - including a 10,000 workforce reduction, big cuts in capital spending, and up to Dollars 500m of asset sales - the group made a net profit of Dollars 25m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 116m in the year, both well down on earnings at the same stage of 1990. The picture throughout TRW's divisions was the same: sales were higher in the fourth quarter than a year ago, but full-year sales were flat or lower than in 1990. Overall, group sales were up 3 per cent in the quarter at Dollars 2.1bn, but down 3 per cent over the full year at Dollars 7.9bn. The figures were well received on Wall Street yesterday, with TRW shares rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 3/4 .</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Building review attacks abuses and lack of trust Guidelines aimed at reducing contract abuses and litigation in the Pounds 45bn-a-year construction industry will be published today as the first stage in a wide-ranging review of business practices in the sector. The review, jointly financed by construction employers and the Department of the Environment, is thought to be highly critical of adversarial attitudes between companies and clients which it says have soured commercial relationships and have damaged the industry's reputation. The interim report by Sir Michael Latham, the former Conservative MP and ex-director of the Housebuilders' Federation who led the review, is understood to refer to a climate of deep mistrust and a disturbing atmosphere which had led to considerable dissatisfaction in the industry. The guidelines are designed to improve ways in which property developers and other private-sector and public-sector customers award contracts and make payments to construction companies. A second, more detailed report due to published next summer will examine ways in which contractors and others working in the building industry can improve practices and reduce friction in commercial relationships. DoE officials believe the chances that the review's recommendations will be implemented are boosted by the broad support it has received. It has been supported by construction industry leaders as well as representatives of some of its most important customers including property companies, local authorities, banks and large industrial companies. Sir Michael's interim report is expected to recommend that customers seeking better value should consider reducing the size of tender lists. In one instance the review body was told that a local authority had sought bids from 28 companies for a heating and ventilation contract worth less than Pounds 250,000. This size of competition for small or medium-size contracts is wasteful when the customer must have known that many of those asked to bid had very little chance of success. Companies required to spend large sums pursuing unnecessary bids will try to recover this expenditure on jobs they do win, the report is understood to conclude. It is also expected to criticise customers who drive prices down to uneconomic levels in the belief that they are getting the best value. It warns that contractors faced with a loss may try to cut corners. Construction companies may also seek to recoup losses by overcharging clients for late design changes. The report is also understood to criticise customers who delay payments and thereby put contractors and sub-contractors at risk. A report by Construction Intelligence Data, an independent research and credit rating organisation, warned earlier this year that 60 per cent of all construction contracts were paid late.</p>

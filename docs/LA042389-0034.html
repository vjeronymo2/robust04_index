			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAFE AND SOUND NO MORE;  </P> <P> WHEN THE CHILD MOLESTER TURNS OUT TO BE A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY  </P> <P> DICTIONARY DEFINITIONS sometimes don't suffice. The word molest can mean to  annoy or harass. But when applied to a sexual attack, it doesn't begin to  describe the act.  </P> <P> I found out just how inadequate it is because, about a year ago, my children  were molested.  </P> <P> On those rare occasions when my wife or I discuss it with close friends, the  word hangs in the air, then draws looks of sorrow and expressions of concern.  But even if they want to know more, few dare ask for details. The talk soon  moves to other, more pleasant subjects. That's fine because nothing about  molestation is easy, least of all talking about it.  </P> <P> Frederick, the 13-year-old who molested my son and daughter, hasn't been in our  home for more than a year now. But like cockroaches, what he did infests our  lives to this day. Do anything -- open a book or a container of flour -- and  the memories slither out.  </P> <P> On Christmas, our daughter stopped emptying her stocking and said, "I bet Santa  only put coal in Frederick's stocking." The other day, she and my wife were  baking dinosaur-shaped muffins. If the fearsome allosaurus came to the door,  she would kick him in the knee and run away, she told her mother. She paused.  "But Mom, what would I do if (Frederick) came to the door?"  </P> <P> The image I had of molesters was that they were sickos in parks or people in  bizarre cults who use children for God-knows-what. Frederick didn't fit the  stereotype. He played Little League baseball, was active in a children's  theater troupe and had a terrific mother. On three weekends when she had to  leave town, we helped her out by having Frederick stay with us.  </P> <P> About two months after Frederick's last visit, my son, then 5 and in  kindergarten, began to describe what the teen-ager had done. He began with the  most minor violation, awaiting my reaction before relating more. I since have  learned that this is the classic pattern of behavior children follow when  broaching the subject of molestation.  </P> <P> "(He) showed me his privates," my son began.  </P> <P> "Oh, really," I replied, outwardly calm. I continued to wash the dishes,  petrified. Thoughts swirled. Frederick was just a kid. We had never left the  house when he was over. This was nothing more than a game of doctor, I hoped. I  assured my son that he had done nothing wrong, thanked him for telling me and  told him he was very brave. Emboldened, he gave us details long into the night.  </P> <P> Little kids look up to big kids. Push them on a swing, and you're a trusted  friend. Frederick slept in my son's room. While my wife and I were in our room,  Frederick manipulated my son into thinking that molestation was some sort of  game. First there was "showing." Then touching, "tasting" and probably sodomy.  There were at least three, and as many as five, opportunities. Remember,  Frederick told my son each time, don't tell anyone.  </P> <P> My wife and I hoped that Frederick had not done the same things to our  daughter, then 2. We were wrong. Like our son, she started by giving us the  least offensive information, then studied our faces. She saw pain. It's common  for very young victims to feel torn at this point. They want and need to tell,  but they don't want to hurt their parents. My daughter's solution was to send  up a different kind of trial balloon. Since the truth made us so sad, she gave  us metaphors. "Frederick tore up all my stuffed animals," she said.  </P> <P> It was her way of telling us that something bad had happened. But we didn't  understand her code. The statements relieved us, so her use of fantasy was  reinforced. For the next six months, she talked about Frederick incessantly.  There was always an element of fact, but she obscured it with enough fiction so  that we didn't get that look of hurt on our faces.  </P> <P> It took a therapist experienced in these matters to shake our denial. When our  daughter said something like "Frederick broke all my toys," we learned to ask  calmly, "Was there anything else?"  </P> <P> Now we know that she was raped, sodomized and forced to perform oral sex in  such fear that she didn't once cry out. Don't tell, he warned.  </P> <P> The only solace we could take was that our children trusted us enough to break  their vows of silence. At last, we began to understand why our outgoing  children had become sullen, why our son drew disturbing pictures of himself  caught in traps, why our daughter would not sleep in her room. We could start  dealing with it.  </P> <P> For six months now, our kids have spent Tuesday afternoons with a therapist. In  the sessions, my son doesn't talk much about Frederick. But the therapist said  he's angry and feels guilty. He thinks he should have protected his little  sister and shouldn't have let it happen to himself. He's mad at us, too,  because he doesn't understand why we let it happen. He said he has told only  his very best friend. "But," he added in a voice that sounded years beyond 6,  "he didn't really understand what molest is."  </P> <P> Neither did I. In my house of memories, there is no Frederick, no nightmares  that go on night after night for months, no therapy sessions. I have written  newspaper stories about disasters and personal tragedy. I have had deaths in my  family. But I have never felt more pain than when my 3-year-old daughter says  to me, as she often does, "Do you want to know what (Frederick) did?" I gently  tell her that I know; then I hold her.  </P> <P> I now know that we could have done more to prevent it. We were exceedingly  careful about choosing nursery schools, and we rehearsed instructions about  strangers. But we never thought to warn the kids about friends. It never  occurred to us that our children would be at risk in our own home, with my wife  and I present.  </P> <P> We still tell them that most people are good. But I am far less trusting. When  our friends come over, I find myself wondering whether they're molesters. We  make a point of getting to know the parents of our kids' playmates, and when  those children come over, we make sure the bedroom doors remain open.  </P> <P> After our son started to tell us about Frederick, we called his mother and gave  her a chance to confront him, on the chance that he had an innocent  explanation. He didn't. Because she was a friend, we waited a few days before  calling the police. Frederick was arrested. He pleaded guilty to the sex  offense and was sentenced to probation. Months later, when we learned what he  had done to our daughter, detectives rearrested him. After denying all along  that he had molested my daughter, he finally confessed. The judge was less  understanding the second time around and sentenced him to two weeks in juvenile  hall. Frederick must see a probation officer weekly, perform community service  and go to therapy. Our kids greeted the sentence with glee.  </P> <P> In my view, the judge issued a firm sentence. But because Frederick is a  juvenile, everything about the case is confidential. (Frederick isn't his real  name.) Unlike adult sex offenders, he is not required to register with the  police. And when he turns 18, he can request that his record be sealed.  </P> <P> Whether he will molest again is anyone's guess. In his favor, his mother takes  his problem very seriously. At his sentencing, she and I spoke for 45 minutes.  Both of us were in tears. She is deeply sorry. But he's his own man now. Like a  recovering alcoholic, perhaps he can control his behavior; but he must realize  he has a problem. I don't know that he does.  </P> <P> Much is unknown about molestation, including how often it occurs or how often  juveniles molest. Victims may not talk about it until years afterward, if at  all. But as with other sex crimes, society is learning more. Experts say that  most molesters were victims themselves. Authorities say there are more reports  of women and teen-age girls molesting. Both findings apply in Frederick's case.  As a child, he was molested by a teen-age girl, something that emerged only  during his therapy after his arrest.  </P> <P> To someone who doesn't know them as we do, our children would seem fine. Our  son is obsessed with Little League. He hasn't drawn a picture of himself  ensnared in a trap for some time now, although he still sleeps with his light  on. Our daughter happily will demonstrate the latest steps she's learned in  ballet for anyone who asks. But while scribbling at the kitchen table awhile  back, she drew what she called a picture of herself. As we sometimes do, we  asked her to tell us about it. "I'm sad," she said. Why? "Because someone hurt  me," she answered.  </P> <P> If anything, my wife and I are closer now. Problems common to any family seem  small. Things such as job advancement are less important than stability at home  and being there for our kids. The shock I felt at first is gone. But a feeling  of loss remains. Because of what happened to my children, we all have been  robbed of something very precious. They've lost some of their innocence.  They've lost the sense that they are safe in their own home and that their  parents always can protect them. They've lost the comforting childhood belief  that bad guys are easy to spot, that villains don't look like witches or  wolves. Sometimes they look like the kid next door.  </P></p>

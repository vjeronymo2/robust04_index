			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WARRIORS BLOW LEAD BUT NIP NO. 1 CERRITOS AT END, 82-80  </P> <P> El Camino struggled to pull out a 82-80 victory Saturday against top-ranked  Cerritos in probably the Warriors' most exciting game this season.  </P> <P> With 19 seconds left to play and the game tied, freshman Kelvin Harris hit a  turnaround jumper for the win.  </P> <P> "Cerritos is a great team," said El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin. "They have a  lot of desire to win, and they made our guys make lots of mistakes. They made  our guys get out of what they're supposed to do."  </P> <P> The No. 14 Warriors (18-5, 3-0) held the lead for most of the physical contest,  which included lots of shoving and elbowing under the bucket.  </P> <P> Cerritos (19-3, 0-2) had already been upset by Pasadena in its South Coast  Conference opener Wednesday but hoped to beat El Camino and keep its No. 1  ranking.  </P> <P> And since Cerritos had beaten El Camino in double overtime at the Fullerton  tournament early this season, it expected another victory Saturday.  </P> <P> The Warriors however, were determined to change the outcome this time despite  losing the 9-point lead they held with 1:17 remaining in the game.  </P> <P> "They almost blew it," McClurkin said of his players. "That's why they're not  in there jumping up and down and celebrating, because they know they almost  blew it."  </P> <P> Unlike their last two games, the Warriors played an exciting first half with a  fast-paced offense and an effective full-court trapping defense.  </P> <P> David Keeter hit a 3-pointer and Kevin Mixon sank two free throws to put the  Warriors up, 28-17, with 6:47 left in the half. But Cerritos came back, cutting  the lead at intermission to 34-31.  </P> <P> Mixon, a 6-foot-3 sophomore, led the Warriors with 23 points. Harris had 13,  and Zlatco Josic and Frank Beatty 10 each.  </P></p>

According to opinion polls, 31 percent of  respondents support him. Some 20 percent of Ukrainian citizens  are ready to support the current president, Leonid Kravchuk.    Here is another report indirectly connected with the  Ukrainian election. The "Person of the Week" program from the  Vid company under Ostankino TV, which was scheduled for tonight,  has been taken off the air. It was to have profiled Leonid  Kuchma.

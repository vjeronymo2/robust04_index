			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE ANATOMY OF RUSSIAN MELANCHOLY  </P> <P> On the Golden Porch by Tatyana Tolstaya, translated by Antonina W. Bouis  (Alfred A. Knopf: $17.95; 200 pages)  </P> <P> You could block out every allusion to monuments and landmarks, censor  references to the rigors of daily life, anglicize the names and "On the Golden  Porch" would still be immediately recognizable as Russian literature. Whether  they're young, old or members of the author's own postwar generation, Tatyana  Tolstaya's characters dream and yearn for elusive, lost or unattainable goals.  In the rare instances where they achieve their desires, the consummation turns  to dust, leaving the protagonist to bittersweet melancholy.  </P> <P> Tolstaya, the descendant of one illustrious Russian literary family, partakes  of her country's entire tradition. Though the 13 tales are contemporary and the  style is intensely personal, the collection echoes with Dostoevsky's passion  and Chekhov's wistfulness. Tolstaya writes with Andrei Bitov's satirical bite  but occasionally lapses into Yevtushenko's sentimentality.  </P> <P> Virtually a one-woman anthology of contradictory Russian attitudes, Tolstaya's  frustration is tempered by a powerful sense of national identity; her hard  feelings softened by a palpable love of the land. The frigid winters, the  clammy autumns, the amazing springs and the short sweet summers are as  important to her stories as the people, perhaps because you cannot create the  complex Russian character without the climate. Moscow freezes, Siberia looms,  Georgia basks in sunshine; Leningrad teases with glimpses of Scandinavian  comfort and vanished imperial glory. Surrounded by choice, her characters are  fixed in place by law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crucial Disappearances  </P> <P> Consider Rimma, in "Fire and Dust." She's still a relatively young woman when  the story begins, but she has already seen crucial disappearances -- "her  radiant youth, the childhood of her children, the freshness of her hopes, as  pale blue as the morning sky. . . . She had been promised every wreath, flower,  island and rainbow, and where are they now?" Years pass, and Rimma is still  living in a communal apartment, waiting for its last tenant to die, watching  her once ambitious husband dozing in front of the TV, listening to the wild  fantasies of her friend Svetlana, who has escaped into madness.  </P> <P> In the end, desperate for any break in the monotony, Rimma settles for a sleazy  blouse bought on the black market. Ahead of her is only "the whole viscous flow  of the future years -- as yet unlived, but already known. . . ." For all its  universality, Rimma's story has uniquely Russian aspects -- the old man, the  ugly blouse, the dead-end jobs, all symbols of gratification perpetually  deferred.  </P> <P> Every story has these small, poignant details; volumes of social and political  observation in a phrase. In "Sweet Shura," an old woman wears a marvelous hat  decorated with snowballs, flowers and berries; "The cherries dropped down and  clicked against one another." Where do you find such hats today, except in the  bottom of a trunk, hoarded for half a century? And the memories -- "Finland in  the spring. Crimes in the summer. White cakes, black coffee. Oysters -- very  expensive. Theater in the evening."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Terrible Passivity  </P> <P> The ancient woman tells the young narrator about the lover who begged her to  elope with him. The train ticket was bought and the valise packed, but a  terrible passivity kept her from leaving home. Listening, the writer imagines a  crack in the universe through which old Shura could re-enter her life and take  that train; a gap offering an alternative reality.  </P> <P> In "Okkervil River," an elderly bachelor collects the second-hand records of a  once famous soprano, fantasizing the life they might have had together. When he  discovers that she's still alive, he seeks her out and pays a call, only to  find a fat, coarse old woman who ignores him.  </P> <P> A lonely young boy in "Date With a Bird" is befriended by a neighbor who  enthralls him with adventure stories. Vibrant and fun-loving, a wonderful  contrast to his own staid family, she becomes the focus of his life until the  day he finds her in bed with the uncle he loathes.  </P> <P> Though many of the stories deal with disillusion and resignation, the tone of  the collection is vibrant; the plots inventive and the characters remarkably  vigorous despite their anguish. Some books are the next best thing to a trip to  their native ground, but "On the Golden Porch" is an exception; a distillation  of atmosphere and personality so concentrated that it actually seems more  intense than a first-hand experience; not just equal to being there but better.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hajnalka Cseke, Tamas Dobos, Anita Elo, Laszlo </F> Meszleny, Gabor Moricz, Gabriel Oszy-Toth, Lilla Rist, and Noemi  Sumegi: "What Results Are Expected at Next Year's Elections?"]    [Text] The big parties generally expect better results in  the spring of 1994 than they achieved at the last elections.  The small parties and the recently formed ones would be happy  to get into Parliament. They are all aware that their  self-confidence, and their assertion that a coalition capable of  governing cannot be formed without them, can bring extra votes  for them. Based on their surveys, the Gallup or the Szonda  Ipsos [public opinion poll companies] would probably contest  many forecasts. Although who knows.... Many things can change  in four or five months in politics, the popularity of certain  parties can either increase or decline. After Christmas and  before New Year when, leaving the daily political struggle  behind, the party leaders have more time to look into the  future, this is how they see their and our chances.  <H3>  Laszlo Kover, parliamentary group leader of the Federation  of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]: We Are Able To Defeat the  Socialists </H3>   "I would by no means like to express or predict the FIDESZ's  chances in percentages. One reason is that I would not like to  reduce our chances by talking about them, and the other is that  Hungarian domestic political life seems to be very pliable just  now. However, in my view, the contest will be between the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the FIDESZ. I hope that we  will come out from this as winners. As far as I can see, at the  moment, we are the only ones who will be able defeat the  socialists.    "It does not seem like a very daring prediction that none of  the political factors on the three poles, namely the MSZP on one  side, the three parties of the current government coalition on  the other, and the "group" of the FIDESZ and the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ] on the third, will on its own be able to  gain absolute majority. Therefore, two out of the three  tendencies will -- at least partially -- work together to form a  government majority.    "It does not seem likely that the forces outside Parliament  will gain much strength and that any of them will turn into a  significant political factor as a result of some landslide-like  change. However, in my view, the voting base of the coalition  has not continued to decrease for a long time as shown by the  results of public opinion polls."  <H3>  Imre Szekeres, deputy chairman and campaign chief of the  MSZP: We Will Be a Significant Force in Political Life </H3>   "I first of all want the country to get as far as the  elections in order and without major problems.    "It is a decisive factor that all political forces should  show more self-moderation in the economy and in politics.  Another one is that programs and people, rather than passions,  should contend each other at the elections because otherwise we  will not be able to do anything with each other or with any kind  of election results. Third: I expect a government that will be  able to keep this country running and can show some kind of  results in the future.    "I think that the MSZP will reach around 25 percent at the  elections and will thus remain a significant force in Hungarian  political life; we will be able to influence the country's life.    "Looking at it from the end of 1993, it cannot yet be  decided  who the coalition partners might be. We can only answer this  after the elections, and I am not saying this for tactical  reasons. First of all, we have to know how much support the  various parties have because in a parliamentary democracy,  majority has to be shown. In Hungary, we cannot set up a  government by coming together and distributing the ministerial  and state secretarial positions and then wait and see what  happens.    "However, I can now say with whom I cannot foresee governing  together: These are the current government parties. I am not  saying this for ideological reasons: These parties have  governed very unsuccessfully and the citizens will vote for us  -- if they will -- to prevent this government from staying in  office."  <H3>  Zoltan Kiraly, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of  Hungary [MSZDP]: Getting Into Parliament Is a Realistic Goal  for Us </H3>   Many people think that, with this historic name, it was  difficult for you not to get into Parliament three years ago.  At that time, the MSZDP produced a fine example of a failed  election campaign. In view of the past three years, how do you  see your party's election chances, we asked Zoltan Kiraly.    "The parliamentary parties have a large advantage over us.  Except for the last few months, the MSZDP's past three and a  half years have been characterized by internal troubles while  our rivals left us far behind. While the other parties already  have complete lists, we are working on the criteria for  selecting candidates. However, the party's 103-year history is a  big advantage. All in all, I think that getting into Parliament  can be a realistic goal for our party.    "Unfortunately, our party is in a very bad financial  situation. Our sympathizers are helping us 'on credit.' We will  pay if we get into Parliament. We actually inherited 10 million  forints debt and the state support is very small, we cannot use  much of it for the campaign. From the western parties, we can  only expect moral and professional support in formulating our  program and during the campaign.    "According to the public opinion polls, the MSZP and the  FIDESZ have a considerable chance to win the elections.  However, we cannot yet know how the votes will reflect the fact  that people are turning away from the FIDESZ. The Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] will become stronger. The  socialists, the FIDESZ, the KDNP, and the SZDSZ will play a  determining role in the new Parliament.    "At least eight parties will be present in Parliament. I can  see a chance for the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP],  the smallholders, the Republic Party, and perhaps the Agrarian  Federation to get seats. Naturally, I hope that the social  democrats will also be there."   <H3>    Karoly Herenyi, spokesman for the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF]: No Government Can Be Formed Without the Forum in  1994, Either </H3>   MAGYAR NEMZET interviewed Karoly Herenyi on the MDF's  election chances in 1994.    "The MDF will continue to play a determining role in  Hungarian political life after the 1994 elections. It is  impossible to form a government without the MDF. I believe that  we will repeat our election results as a percentage proportion,  at least as far as the position is concerned, we might not do  this as regards the number of mandates.    "We can talk about coalition issues after we know our  election results. We can mainly work together with our natural  allies, the KDNP and the smallholders party that will hopefully  continue to pull itself together, and we hope that it will have  much better results than in 1990. Under no circumstances will  we enter into a coalition with the SZDSZ or the MSZP. We do not  have any contacts with the MIEP and the events of the last weeks  confirm that there is decreasing chance for any kind of  cooperation with this party. I am thinking of their statements  in the days of mourning, including the caption under the photo  on the front page of the MAGYAR FORUM on 16 December.    "In my view, the election results will not directly be  influenced by the unfortunate death of the former prime minister  Jozsef Antall because the MDF will continue his political line  in the future, too."  <H3>  Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the KDNP: Our Candidates Are  Examined </H3>   The KDNP expects 15 to 25 percent of the votes at the 1994  elections. According to Laszlo Surjan, the KDNP will come up  with a more impressive and younger list of candidates compared  to 1990. All candidates have to go through a compulsory  examination in the party and the list of candidates will only be  made public after this. As regards the possible coalitions,  Surjan is cautious because at least four parties have the chance  to gain 15 to 20 percent of the votes and, in this case, in the  interest of governability, compromises have to be made for which  cooperation among the four forces might be necessary. It is  only the MSZP that cannot be considered as an ally out of the  parliamentary parties. Surjan cannot exclude the possibility but  does not intend to take away votes from the MDF and he wants to  remain especially correct with the MDF. The KDNP expects that,  because of the SZDSZ's coming closer to the MSZP, a number of  former SZDSZ sympathizers will join the KDNP's voting base. In  1990, the KDNP was unable to set up a list in five counties  because of the lack of individual candidates, but it will have  candidates in all voting districts in 1994.    While its predecessor, Brankovics's Democratic People's  Party, had its main stronghold in the Transdanubia, today the  KDNP's biggest membership is in Nograd, Borsod, and  Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg counties. The KDNP expects to increase  the number of its mandates mainly from northern Hungary. In  1990, the KDNP was not a significant force in  Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county but, as a result of steady  organizational work, this is now one of their strongest  districts. Many of the individual candidates are leaders and  activists of civic organizations, and many of them have  experience in local affairs. Sandor Gergely, chairman of the  National Federation of Savings Cooperatives; Laszlo Nogradi,  leader of the Hungarian Entrepreneurs' Chamber; Istvan Mikola,  chairman of the Hospital Federation; and Gabor Jobbagy, one of  the leading figures of the Embryo Protection Movement, will run  for the KDNP.  <H3>  Geza Gyimothy, general secretary of Jozsef Torgyan's  Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]: We Feel We Are Strong </H3>   Bearing in mind the slogan of "God, Homeland, and Family,"  the Independent Smallholders, Agricultural Workers, and Citizens  Party with its 60,000 membership is the country's strongest  party; therefore, it has a reason to be optimistic about the  1994 elections, Geza Gyimothy told MAGYAR NEMZET. He said that  they would run a candidate in all 176 parliamentary electoral  districts, and they would mainly like to gain the trust of their  compatriots who have Christian and national sentiments. Before  the first round, they will not enter into an election alliance  with other parties, and they will conduct their election  campaign in coordination with the some 20 organizations that are  part of the Christian National Unity [Kereszteny Nemzeti  Osszefogas].    "We feel that the MDF has lost the trust of the citizens but  there is a strata with Christian national sentiments which, four  years ago, gave 62 percent of the votes on the parliamentary  coalition deputies. We are mainly expecting their votes,"  Gyimothy said.    According to Gyimothy, they have a realistic chance to get  20  to 25 percent of the votes. The smallholders had 12 percent of  the votes at the last elections.    "As our party has become stronger by now, we have reason to  hope that we will have better election results in 1994,"  Gyimothy thought.  <H3>  Ivan Peto, chairman of the SZDSZ: Even Fewer Mandates Might  Be Enough for Victory </H3>   "Compared to the 1990 elections, the only change that I  expect is that fewer mandates might be enough for an election  victory. It is our, just as every other party's, 'obligation'  to trust that we, namely the SZDSZ, will come up as winners. I  can see a good chance for this.    "It is difficult to answer the question whether the  representatives of the conservative, the socialist, or the  liberal parties will be able to form a government on their own.  However, I do not think it is likely that the liberal parties  and their election allies will be able to gain a strong  governmental majority."    "As far as I can see, no breakthrough can be expected in  the issue of which parties gain a seat in Parliament. As  opposed to the smaller organizations, it is the current  parliamentary parties that have a chance to get into Parliament  again. However, the MSZP will probably have better results at  the 1994 elections than it did in 1990."  <H3>  Janos Palotas, chairman of the Republic Party: We Do Not  Ally Ourselves With Extremists </H3>   Recently, the Republic Party has significantly decreased the  gap between itself and the parliamentary parties. In some 100  of the 176 electoral districts, it would already now be able to  have a candidate. They achieved all this in barely one year of  organizational work. What does Janos Palotas predict about the  results of the 1994 elections?    "In recent times, a relatively stable political image has  been formed of the six parliamentary parties. This can be  changed by an exceptionally good performance, another 1 or 2  percent can be gained but much more difference cannot be  expected. In my estimation, the MSZP will gain the largest  proportion of votes, some 22 to 23 percent. The chances of the  current government parties are much worse than this.    "It is much harder to predict the chances of the Republic  Party, it has many tasks whose good solution can significantly  influence the election results. It is a big challenge for us  whether we can run in all 176 voting districts. If we manage to  achieve this then we can even approach the peaks, otherwise we  will gain many fewer votes. Therefore, the election result of  the Republic Party can be between 11 to 12 percent or 25 to 27  percent. Whichever becomes reality, we will have to see it as a  success because we will be in Parliament. However, our final  goal can only be for our party to be a leading force of the  future government coalition.    "If we win, the Agrarian Federation, the SZDSZ, FIDESZ, or  the KDNP can be our coalition partners. We would not enter into  an alliance with the MDF or any extremist political forces,  namely the MIEP, the Market Party, or the Workers' Party. The  FKGP cannot be taken into consideration because, in our view,  politically they are not sufficiently serious. The MSZDP is  struggling with similar problems at the moment but it has  progressive signs. If we do not win the elections then the  program of the leading party will decide whether we can work  together with it."  <H3>  Zoltan Biro, co-chairman of the National Democratic  Federation [NDSZ]: We Can Equal the Challenge </H3>   The NDSZ would like to occupy the position of national  center  in the Hungarian political structure. What chances does the  party have to achieve this? Zoltan Biro gives the answer.    "As opposed to the parliamentary parties that are also well  endowed with financial resources, the NDSZ starts from a  disadvantageous position. In spite of this, our position is  encouraging because it seems that we will be able to meet the  challenge at the elections. I am certain that we will get into  Parliament. I hope for a parliamentary position for the NDSZ  from which it will indeed be able to have a say in forming  Hungarian politics.    "In my view, the unification of the social democrats will  not  significantly influence our chances. However, I believe that an  honest social democratic party will become strong within 10  years in this country; it may become one of the important  political forces, and might even be our ally in the future.  However, at the moment, there is a big difference between our  programs and political directions. The history of Hungary's  social democratic parties -- including the events of the past  years -- show that they cannot organize themselves on a national  basis to the extent we consider necessary.    "The KDNP and the MSZP will certainly gain strength but this  will not be of decisive proportions. After the elections, I  would like a coalition in which the center forces that are close  to each other -- either to the right or to the left -- work  together. In this coalition, the NDSZ will certainly be among  the influential parties. With the Agrarian Federation, for  example, we can only work together if the programs and political  directions can be well coordinated, and this also applies to  other parties. Before the elections, rather than among the  parties, we are seeking allies among the civic organizations  that have closer links with society."</p>

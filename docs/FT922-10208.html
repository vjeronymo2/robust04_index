Turkey hopes to host a summit meeting in Istanbul in September or October to review progress on cooperation. Mr Umut Arik, head of Turkey's newly-created development and cooperation agency, said Ankara was providing Dollars 1.1bn in credits to the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union. Mr Demirel was expected to sign agreements on road transport, civil aviation, investment protection, broadcasting and help for small and medium-scale enterprises in Ashkhabad.

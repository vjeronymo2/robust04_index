			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Personal View: Rewrite the rules for regulation Damaging disputes are raging in most of Britain's privatised utilities. The water companies and their regulators are arguing about the cost of environmental standards. The row between British Gas and Ofgas has not been quietened by a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. The electricity industry, its regulator and the government have reached a truce following their dispute over coal contracts. These battles illustrate an increasingly obvious point: the regulatory framework is in crisis and in urgent need of reform. In the British administrative tradition, the rules of the game (laid down in licences and legislation) are poorly defined. Director-generals are appointed with wide discretionary powers to ensure the utilities act in the public interest. General duties, such as 'promoting competition', allow regulators to interfere in virtually any aspect of the utility's business. Also, since terms such as 'competition' can be interpreted in a variety of ways, a regulator can choose which competition model he wishes to employ. The result is inevitable: unaccountable to anyone, regulators pursue their own agenda, leaving regulated companies, shareholders and customers to play a costly guessing game. Regulators not only have discretion over the interpretation of the rules; they can also change them. Almost all regulators have implicitly rejected many of the original terms of privatisations and have chiselled away at the structures of their industries. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has presided over a 'dash for gas' at a time of excess capacity, allowing the regional electricity companies to integrate vertically through long-term contracts. His counterpart in the water industry, Ian Byatt, rejects much of the rationale behind new environmental standards. At Ofgas, Sir James McKinnon has now decided that the gas industry should be broken up. The utilities' licences can be changed easily. The regulator proposes modifications, which the utility can accept or reject.  Rejection, however, leads to a referral to the MMC, the prospect of which is usually enough to make a utility accept a regulator's proposals. Core issues such as the closure of power stations and the accounting structure of BT are being dealt with in this way. This exploitation of discretion has meant that, contrary to its designers' intentions, UK regulation has turned out to be heavy-handed. While some discretion is desirable, a distinction should be drawn between the interpretation of licences and changes to them. The latter are fundamental. They touch on wider public interests, and should be debated publicly. The power of regulators to 'negotiate' amendments to licences without public debate should be curtailed. The licences were defined by government and sanctioned through legislation. These licences set the 'regulatory contract' between privatised companies and their customers. It is not appropriate to permit largely unaccountable regulators to alter their terms, behind closed doors. An automatic reference to the MMC, with a public consultation period, is a minimal requirement. However, reform should go further than this. A consistent set of principles for the conduct of regulation is required. In particular, these should define a common approach to setting prices. At present, each regulator chooses his own preferred method. However, it is time for a common methodology. This could be provided by a white paper on utility regulation, to complement the 1978 white paper, which still provides the framework for regulating nationalised industries. The institutional structure of regulation also needs to be reconsidered. The current system of a host of ad hoc semi-autonomous offices of regulation leads to inconsistency. An Office of Regulation should be set up, reporting to the Department of Trade and Industry. Given the present position, however, some mergers of regulators would be helpful. Offer, the electricity regulator, and Ofgas could be merged to create an Office of Energy Regulation. Likewise an Office of Transport Regulation and an Office of Communications could be set up. Measures such as a white paper on regulatory principles, a limitation on regulators' powers to modify licences without public debate, and institutional reform are essential to create a more predictable and stable climate for investment, while at the same time protecting the public from monopoly pricing. Failure to tackle the problem will continue to raise the price of investment, weaken the quality of the regulatory structure and ultimately undermine consumers' interests.

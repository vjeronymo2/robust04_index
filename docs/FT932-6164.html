			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone warns on profits again - Market value falls by Pounds 58m as negotiations begin with bankers THE BOARD of Hartstone Group was yesterday locked in negotiations with bankers as the group issued its second profits warning in less than three months. The news sent the shares crashing from 91p to 34p, wiping Pounds 58m off the group's market value of Pounds 92.9m. The shares have fallen steadily from a high in March of 272p. They were depressed by the announcement early in March of unexpected restructuring provisions totalling Pounds 8.5m and a profits warning. Analysts at that time downgraded their 1993 forecasts from Pounds 36m to Pounds 23m. Yesterday Hartstone announced that the provisions would actually total Pounds 12m, while profits after exceptionals were not expected to be less than Pounds 9m. The final dividend, which in March the group had promised would be increased, will now not be paid. The company denied that the larger provisions were the result of any one problem. The Stock Exchange said it had been monitoring the situation for some time. Yesterday's announcement is believed to have made a suspension of the shares unlikely. Mr Stephen Barker, who built the company into Europe's third-largest hosiery group and who holds 2 per cent of the company, is to resign as chairman and chief executive with immediate effect. He will remain on the board. Hartstone announced his departure and the profits warning after an all-night meeting with its financial advisers. Mr Shaun Dowling, the non-executive director earlier this month promoted to deputy chairman, becomes executive chairman. A new chief executive, and finance director to replace Mr David Grattan, were being sought. The group's difficulties appear to stem from the deepening recession in Europe, where Hartstone built up a sizeable hosiery business through the Pounds 82m acquisition of two companies in 1991. Analysts speculated that Hartstone was labouring under heavy stock and debt burdens. At the end of 1992, Hartstone was already carrying stock of Pounds 85.7m, largely due to the acquisition of the European hosiery groups, a little more than a third of the value of its total sales of Pounds 237.8m. The recession in continental Europe, however, is expected to have made matters worse. Hartstone suffered a sharp downturn in trading in the final quarter and is understood to have a serious cash flow problem. The group has defaulted on Pounds 13.5m in deferred payments for acquisitions, including Michael Stevens and Etienne Aigner, the leathergoods groups based in the US, and Aznar Industrial, the Spanish lingerie group. Net debt, which at the interim stage was Pounds 67m, is estimated to have risen to more than Pounds 90m. Gearing is expected to be more than 100 per cent. Hartstone said yesterday that it had breached at least one banking covenants calling for 2.5 times interest cover. Interest charges at the half-way stage had risen from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 3.3m.

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Austria launches new bond contract AUSTRIA will launch its first bond futures contract today, thus joining the growing number of national exchanges to increase liquidity with a debt derivatives market. Vienna's OTOB futures exchange will begin trading contracts based on a basket of eight to 10-year maturities which reflects the method used by most of the big bond futures markets, including Germany. Since the futures exchange began dealing index futures, stock options and index options nearly two years ago it had achieved turnover two to three times greater than the cash market, according to Mr Christian Imo, OTOB chief executive. 'The underlying bond market is four or five times the value of the stock market so we expect huge volume from the bond futures contract.' The first three contracts will have expiry dates in September, December and March of next year and be based on a notional bond with a 10-year maturity and a 7 per cent coupon. They will be traded by seven marketmakers - six domestic banks and Deutsche Bank (Austria). Five other banks will act as agent and principals. Mr Wolfgang Lichtl, head trader at Credit Anstalt, one of the accredited marketmaker banks, said there was general enthusiasm for the contract but reservations over the cost. 'My own opinion is that if it was cheaper, that might help liquidity.' The launch news helped a bond market already boosted by a surge in German debt prices. Buying pressure from overseas and position-building by domestic marketmakers ahead of the start of futures trading today sent the most recent 10-year 6.875 per cent Austrian government bond 0.35 higher to 100.50. Chase Manhattan Investment Services, part of the Chase Manhattan Bank group, has opened a retail investment office in New York City, Reuter reports from New York. According to Chase, it is the only commercial bank offering this service.</p>

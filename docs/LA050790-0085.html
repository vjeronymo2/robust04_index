			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> THE READERS TALK BACK -- IN PERSON  </P> <P> It's always an eye-opener for me to get out from behind my computer terminal  and meet some of the people who read this column. It's a great way to find out  what people are thinking and what they really care about. The other day, I gave  a talk sponsored by the Works Gallery at Five Feet Two restaurant in Newport  Beach, and when it was over the audience had many questions.  </P> <P> I had said in the talk that the kind of contemporary art most interesting to me  these days is "conceptual" in a broad sense -- meaning that the ideas  motivating the work are ultimately more important than its level of craft,  finish or emotional expression. Happily, the new wave of conceptual work tends  to be more engagingly quizzical on a visual level than the old wave, which  consisted largely of printed texts, with no visual content at all.  </P> <P> I made a stumbling attempt to describe some of the motivations of conceptual  artists, such as their investigations into the clash of cultures, tastes and  attitudes that exist side by side in daily life. This is an aspect of the  culturally relativistic outlook that conservatives love to hate.  </P> <P> Free to forage high and low for material, fascinated by the phenomenon of style  and beholden to no central definition of beauty or truth, conceptual artists  are researchers into the way we process information, the way we make  connections between one thing and another.  </P> <P> One woman in the audience said she figured that she could have the same  thoughts without bothering to look at the art. She wanted to know what I  thought about the contemporary watercolor painting scene.  </P> <P> To my mind, watercolor painting -- once a sideline of such significant American  artists as John Marin, Charles Demuth and Winslow Homer -- has become the  province of genteel illustrators utterly uninvolved with the issues of  contemporary art. The notion of even bothering to differentiate one  watercolorist from another frankly seems a waste of time.  </P> <P> I think I said something a tad less dismissive to the woman. Sometimes it seems  incredible how few things two people who both profess a love of art can have in  common. For the most part, it's the old split between those who like to think  of art as a friendly, constant North Star and those who view art as a shooting  star, a brief burst of illumination that dashes off to points unknown.  </P> <P> An older man in the audience also seemed plainly uncomfortable with all this  talk about conceptual art. He offered the example of British painter Francis  Bacon, subject of a recent retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of  Art, as the kind of artist who really grabs the viewer with the force of his  expressive painting.  </P> <P> I agreed that Bacon's work is powerful stuff, but I said I wouldn't rush to  embrace a 23-year-old fresh out of art school who painted in the same way. Why?  Well, Bacon, who was born in 1909 and began painting in the 1930s, is part of  the generation that gave birth to Existentialism. But that philosophy is no  longer current, any more than wearing sandals and black stockings or having  coffeehouse discussions about banning the bomb.  </P> <P> Today's exciting young artists respond to the social and intellectual currents  in the air today. It's the same in any field. Why don't they make movies like  they used to, people always want to know. Why did popular music ever forsake  the Big Band era? What happened to rock after the '60s? But, like it or not,  life is different today, and our art forms respond to that difference.  </P> <P> Another woman said she felt that my talk -- which included squawks about the  dullness and low level of the local gallery scene -- was too negative. She  wanted to hear what people in Orange County could do to help make the art scene  more sophisticated and well-informed. It was a good question, and I  unfortunately gave it short shrift.  </P> <P> "Support your local museums!" I said off the top of my head. I suggested  visiting top Los Angeles galleries as well as museums to get an idea of the  range of good contemporary art. I could have added becoming more involved with  community art centers and trying to "infiltrate" the ranks of stodgy boards of  trustees.  </P> <P> When you're confused or just need information, ask questions of curators  (museum support groups provide access) and art dealers. Develop opinions. Worry  less about what your friends think. What do you think?  </P> <P> My most uncomfortable moment came when someone asked me what I collect. It was  a perfectly reasonable question. It's just that I don't collect art. "I collect  books," I murmured. It's true. I own hundreds of volumes: fiction, biography,  books on art and dance. But I go home and feel perfectly content to see nothing  but light and shadow making their mark on the white walls of my tiny vintage  house.  </P> <P> I said I could imagine inviting artists to do site-specific installations on a  rotating basis, had I any space to spare. I said some critics deliberately  don't collect in any field of art about which they write, for  conflict-of-interest reasons.  </P> <P> Ah, excuses, excuses. Well, I love music but I also like to spend hours at home  with the stereo off, just vaguely aware of the sounds of domestic life: the  rustle of trees, the muffled sounds of kids playing ball, the hum of the  refrigerator. Maybe not owning any art to speak of is a form of visual R&amp;R.  You tell me.  </P></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Whitehall 'protected ministers on Iraq' Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, asked civil servants to draft parliamentary replies over the arms-for-Iraq affair with the aim of protecting the government from further embarrassment on the issue, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday. Mr Nicolas Bevan, a former Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office official, said Mr Heseltine had suggested to Whitehall officials and fellow ministers in November 1992 that there should be only a simplified statement on the government's involvement. The minister's intervention was to ensure the government would be seen to be consistent in fielding questions about its guidelines on arms sales. 'Mr Heseltine felt that the ground beneath his feet was shifting and he wasn't sure it could be solidified,' Mr Bevan said. In November 1992 cabinet officials, including Mr Bevan, advised the prime minister that ministers had considered a change in guidelines restricting arms sales to Iraq, but had decided against it. Ministers told officials to interpret the guidelines more flexibly, but there was, Mr Bevan advised, no change in substance. Mr Bevan's advice was challenged by Mr Michael Coolican, a senior DTI official. His view was that it was 'quite clear' that the way the guidelines had been operated was different to information previously given to parliament. According to an internal DTI memorandum made available to the Scott inquiry, Mr Heseltine believed that civil servants' drafts of parliamentary answers concerning the guidelines 'run the risk of storing up trouble for ministers when Lord Justice Scott delivers his report'. The inquiry was adjourned until Tuesday when evidence will be given by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.</p>

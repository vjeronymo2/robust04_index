			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tan Daobo (6223 6670 0590) and correspondent </F> Zeng Hong (2582 4767)]    [Excerpt] Chengdu, 24 May (XINHUA) -- The officers and men  of a certain division in the Chengdu Military Region have  seriously studied and implemented the party's nationality  policy, promoted unity within and outside the division, and  advanced all aspects of army building, social stability, and  social progress through unity among various nationalities.  During a meeting with the officers and men, Jiang Zemin,  chairman of the Central Military Commission, encouraged them to  serve as models of nationality unity, as well as staunch  defenders of the motherland.    The division is stationed in a minority area. Approximately  half of the troops are minority nationalities. In light of this  situation, the division party committee has, over the years,  carried out education about the party's nationality policy among  the troops, fostering a heartening atmosphere of mutual respect,  mutual assistance, and close unity between officers and men, as  well as among comrades-in-arms, who have made joint  contributions to army building. The troops have always been the  forerunners in conducting military training, performing duties  related to combat readiness, and carrying out other missions;  they have always been models of internal unity.

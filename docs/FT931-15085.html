			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Firmer tone in Europe THE BULLISH tone in Euro-pean cash and futures markets was a little more pronounced yesterday after the Bundesbank gave several new indications that it was relaxing its stance on monetary policy, writes James Blitz. In its weekly money market intervention, the Bundesbank offered securities repurchase funds for two weeks at the fixed rate of 8.60 per cent, as had been announced at last week's Bundesbank council meeting. However, to the surprise of some participants, the German central bank also agreed to offer 28-day funds at a lowest accepted rate of 8.60 per cent. Dealers said this underlined the market's belief that German rates are on a downward trend. There were several other technical indications that the Bundesbank was being more accommodating. First, it provided more liquidity than the market had expected, adding DM6.6bn, when dealers had expected DM2bn to DM3bn to be added at the very most. Moreover, the Bundesbank did not choose to add overnight liquidity through emergency funds, which could have been used to mop up the shortages created by tax payments. According to Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, the Bundesbank acted more generously by putting money into the banking system through its fortnightly and monthly repos. German call money yesterday dropped to around 8.68 per cent from the 8.75 per cent seen in recent days. Euromark futures already appeared to some dealers to be offering fair value. The March contract closed 6 basis points stronger at 92.05. The surprise of the day in the sterling cash market was the sharp fall in the overnight rate of lending to as low as 3 per cent at the very start of trading. Easy liquidity conditions may have triggered the low cost of money, with the Bank of England forecasting a shortage of Pounds 300m at the start of operations. There were rumours that the Bank had been selling sterling on the foreign exchanges to replenish its reserves in the wake of the events of Black Wednesday. But this could not be confirmed. Whatever the reasons, three-month sterling cash was much softer at around 7 per cent from a previous 7 1/8 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DRUG LORDS OFFER A 'DEAL';  </P> <P> WOULD 'LAY DOWN ARMS' FOR AMNESTY  </P> <P> A message purporting to be from Colombia's drug lords today declared the  government the winner in the war on drugs and offered to halt illegal  activities in exchange for an amnesty.  </P> <P> The communique was given to Patricia Echavarria, who was set free today after  being kidnaped with her daughter Dec. 16. Echavarria is the wife of a prominent  doctor in the drug capital of Medellin.  </P> <P> "We accept the triumph of the state," said the communique from The  Extraditables, the armed wing of the nation's powerful drug lords. "Thus we  will lay down our arms and abandon our objectives for the benefit of the  highest interests of the fatherland."  </P> <P> President Bush brushed off the offer by the drug lords. "They've got a  credibility problem with me," he said in Washington.  </P> <P> The communique came in response to a call Monday by the Roman Catholic Church  and political leaders for drug cartels to release their hostages and end drug  trafficking.  </P> <P> "We submit to the existing legal establishment in the hope of obtaining from  the government and from society respect for our rights and our return to our  families and communities," it said.  </P> <P> "We have decided to suspend the shipment of drugs and surrender the weapons,  explosives, laboratories, hostages, the clandestine landing strips and other  effects related to our activities at such a time as we are granted  constitutional and legal guarantees," the communique continued.  </P> <P> The statement appeared to demand an amnesty that would guarantee the drug  barons would not face criminal charges.  </P> <P> The Extraditables have previously demanded a full amnesty and an end to  extraditions of drug suspects to the United States.  </P> <P> While President Virgilio Barco Vargas said Tuesday that he would not rule out  talks with drug traffickers, Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds said  Colombian law does not allow an amnesty for common criminals.  </P> <P> Barco began his crackdown on the cocaine cartels after the assassination in  August of a leading presidential candidate. As part of the crackdown, he  revived an extradition treaty with the United States, which drew up a list of  the 12 most-wanted drug traffickers.  </P> <P> The Extraditables take their name from the list.  </P> <P> The communique said Echavarria and her daughter, Dina, had been freed as proof  of the cartels' desire to make peace.  </P> <P> The two were released in a neighborhood built by Medellin cartel leader Pablo  Escobar Gaviria for the poor people of Medellin.  </P> <P> In the 11-point message, The Extraditables said: "We undertake that there will  be no explosive bombings in any part of the national territory and have ordered  the suspension of all type of executions of political figures, government and  labor officials, members of the judiciary, newsmen, policemen and the  military."  </P> <P> They also offered to act as mediators in efforts to end activities by other  groups operating outside the law, "for the sole purpose of ending the violence  which harms and shatters our Colombian fatherland."  </P> <P> So far, Colombia has sent 11 drug suspects to the United States to face charges  but none are on the most-wanted list.  </P></p>

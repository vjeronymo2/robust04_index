			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: National Express back in the black National Express group, the inter-city coach operator, returned to profit in the 24 weeks to December 31. The privately-owned company, which was acquired last year by a consortium of investors after the 1988 management buy-out from the National Bus Company lapsed into losses, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.58m from sales of Pounds 56.1m. The figures were not comparable to previous periods because of restructuring undertaken since the consortium gained control.</p>

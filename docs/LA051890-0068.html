			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> IT'S 'FATHER GOOSE' TO THE RESCUE;  </P> <P> A STUBBORN CANADIAN, WITH SOME HELP, IS PUTT-PUTTING THROUGH THE SKIES HOPING  TO REINSTILL IN THE ENDANGERED TRUMPETER SWAN THE INSTINCT TO MIGRATE SOUTH.  </P> <P> Almost 300 years ago, trumpeter swans were so abundant in North America that  fur trader Antoine Laumet Cadillac, approaching the shore in his pirogue near  what is now Detroit, mistook their stately masses for a profusion of  waterlilies.  </P> <P> Soon afterward, alas, someone noticed what good pens the quills of the  trumpeter swan made, and a great swan kill-off began. By 1932, there were only  70 trumpeters left in the United States.  </P> <P> Today, the trumpeter swan has made a faltering comeback in remote parts of  North America, but even this modest rebound is imperiled by the bird's  inability to migrate to its wintering grounds in the eastern United States.  </P> <P> If quill fanciers and hunters failed to wipe out the swan altogether, their  depredations did erase the bird's knowledge of migration routes, which had been  passed on through eons from parent to cygnet.  </P> <P> And so it is today that when ornithologists try to repopulate the species by  releasing trumpeters into the wild, the birds fly off in all directions. Some  get lost, some get shot, some go north for the winter and starve. The clever  ones get on by hanging around the warm-water waste pools of power plants.  </P> <P> "When they're not raised by their natural parents, they're morons," Harry  Lumsden, a retired Ministry of Natural Resources biologist, said with a sigh.  </P> <P> Lumsden has spent a decade trying to re-establish trumpeter swans in Ontario.  One good epidemic at one of those sheltering power plants, he said, and a  sizable percentage of the trumpeter population worldwide would be lost.  </P> <P> David Weaver, executive secretary of the Minnesota-based Trumpeter Swan  Society, said: "The problem is such that we need to consider everything that  comes along, no matter how ludicrous it may sound."  </P> <P> Mother Nature, meet Father Goose.  </P> <P> On warm summer days, 51-year-old Bill Lishman can be seen in the skies of  southern Ontario, skimming over cornfields and pasturelands with a perfect  chevron of gray and black Canada geese honking along behind him. Lishman has  trained the geese to fly in formation with his homemade ultralight aircraft,  after three arduous years of trial and error, busted wings and broken feet.  </P> <P> Now, with the help of Canadian naturalist Bill Carrick, Lishman hopes to take  trumpeter swans to the air lanes. If the two men succeed in training the  trumpeters to fly with the ultralight, they will then guide the rare birds back  to their wintering places on Chesapeake Bay, re-establishing the migration of  old.  </P> <P> "The theory is extremely sound," said William Sladen, professor emeritus of  immunology and infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University and an authority  on swans and their migratory habits. "We believe the ultralight is the answer."  </P> <P> On 100 acres of fallow pastureland and pine groves here, northeast of Toronto,  Lishman has for three years been keeping gaggles of goslings in pens by the  side of a grassy airstrip. By day, in early summer, Lishman jogs up and down  the runway with his fluffy goslings in hot pursuit. Lishman swings a tape  recorder on a strap as he runs, blaring the sound of an ultralight engine at  full throttle. By night, Lishman beds the goslings down under the wing of his  parked ultralight. His neighbors call him Father Goose.  </P> <P> "Geese need a lot of mothering," Lishman explained. "The more attention you pay  to them, the more they'll stick with you. You can't just spend five minutes  with them in the morning and five minutes at night."  </P> <P> By running with the baby geese at least three times a day, every day, he says,  he accustoms them to the engine's roar, and to his strange, human form.  </P> <P> Lishman is motivated, he says, by a dream he has had since childhood of flying  with the birds. He was born in 1939 to a biologist mother and a  fighter-pilot-trainer father, who raised him on a steady diet of  daring-young-man stories featuring the pilots of Spitfires and Hawker  Hurricanes in wartime Europe.  </P> <P> When peace came, the Lishman family settled down on a farm. Young Bill would  spend hours watching the seagulls that trailed after his father's plow,  daydreaming about fighter planes. As soon as he was old enough, Lishman  enrolled in the Canadian Air Cadets, but it turned out he was colorblind, and a  medical panel declared him ineligible to fly. Lishman grew up to become a  successful sculptor, but he never abandoned his dream of flying with the birds.  When the first crude hang gliders emerged, in the early 1970s, he bought one,  added an engine, and began experimenting on a hill behind his house.  </P> <P> While all this was going on in Blackstock, Carrick -- himself a World War II  pilot -- had begun making nature movies.  </P> <P> "I enjoy animals and being outdoors, and I could never figure out why nobody  else does," he said, slogging from pond to pond during an interview on a  marshy, nine-acre nature preserve he keeps just outside of Toronto.  </P> <P> In 1973, Carrick got a contract to provide the animals for a film about "Gray  Owl," a British naturalist who lived with Indians in the Canadian wild and  wrote vividly about the antics of beavers. Carrick introduced half a dozen  beavers to his preserve and, for realism's sake, threw in assorted waterfowl.  He even built a wind tunnel for the birds to fly in on camera, and he set about  "imprinting" the ducks, geese and beavers that would star in the film.  </P> <P> "Imprinting" is a technique developed by Konrad Lorenz, the Nobel Prize-winning  Austrian pioneer of ethology, the study of animal behavior. Lorenz, who kept a  houseful of fish, fowl and wild animals, observed that baby birds instinctively  followed the first large creature that moved away from them after they hatched.  The hatchlings formed a parental bond with that creature, he wrote,  "imprinting" themselves upon it.  </P> <P> Carrick, an admirer of Lorenz, adopted the Austrian's technique to get his  geese up and flying in the wind tunnel. His children amused themselves by  training the imprinted geese to fly behind their bicycles. One goose even took  to flying behind a friend's car, Carrick says. A local newspaper told of these  goings-on, and the wishful Lishman read of them excitedly.  </P> <P> "He called me up," Carrick recalled. "He said he'd been flying for years and  years. He asked me if geese would follow an airplane. I said, 'No reason why  not.' "  </P> <P> Soon, the two men had formed a loose partnership.  </P> <P> The first summer, Lishman imprinted a dozen geese to fly behind his motorcycle,  assuming they would make an easy transition to the ultralight. He assumed  incorrectly: In one early experiment, a goose hit the ultralight's propeller,  breaking the prop and splintering the bird's wing. The next spring, Lishman  started over with a fresh batch of goslings, and a redesigned, goose-friendly  aircraft. But this time, on the maiden flight, a carburetor valve stuck, the  engine stalled, and Lishman tumbled into a ditch and broke his foot. He spent  six weeks in a cast.  </P> <P> The third year, Lishman designed and built yet another ultralight and imprinted  yet another gaggle of goslings. Each day, he said, he hauled himself out of bed  before sunrise, fed the geese, ran with them and played the sound of the  ultralight engine for them. He would taxi up and down the airstrip, the birds  flapping along behind.  </P> <P> Finally, one day, he decided the birds were ready to fly. He taxied down the  airstrip, revved the engine a few times to attract the geese's attention and  opened the throttle as they burst out of the gate. Lishman pulled up, executed  a 90-degree turn and looked back to see the geese far below, flapping madly in  an effort to catch up. He eased back to 20 m.p.h., just above stalling speed,  and the geese came up alongside, forming a ragged chevron off his wing.  </P> <P> Below, on the ground, his wife and children cheered. A friend filmed the scene  with a video camera, making what was to be an award-winning documentary that  will be shown at the National Educational Film and Video Festival, in San  Francisco, on May 26.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back at his preserve, Carrick was spinning more ideas. A member of  the Trumpeter Swan Society, he knew the difficulties swan lovers were having in  restoring trumpeters to their native habitat. As the trumpeter swan had died  out, it had been replaced with mute swans imported from Europe, "the ones you  see in parks and on toilet paper," Carrick sniffed.  </P> <P> To the uninitiate, mute swans may make a lovely sight, but North American bird  lovers consider them an unacceptable substitute for the trumpeters. Mute swans,  by definition, lack the trumpeter's sonorous call; they hiss a lot. They are  also aggressive, known to catch goslings and ducklings and make a meal of them.  </P> <P> Ontario, and some American states, have been running discreet programs to  dethrone the mute swan and bring back the trumpeter. They send field workers to  find mute swan nests, take out the eggs, shake them to kill the embryos, and  return them, along with a few trumpeter eggs, to the nests. The idea is to make  the mute swans unwitting foster parents to the baby trumpeters.  </P> <P> This gambit doesn't always work. Trumpeter eggs, for one thing, cost $200  apiece, and they don't always hatch. Then, the white hatchling trumpeters have  to be caught by biologists and dyed the dusky color of mute cygnets, so the  "parents" don't reject them.  </P> <P> Finally, if the trumpeters are lucky enough to reach maturity, there is no one  to teach them the old migration routes.  </P> <P> Knowing all this, Carrick got to thinking that as long as Lishman had trained  geese to fly with his aircraft, he might just as well train trumpeter swans and  guide them to safe wintering grounds. When he told Lishman his plan, the  sculptor was inspired.  </P> <P> Now, Lishman is building a new ultralight that will take off and land on  floats, since swans, unlike geese, must take off from water. Carrick began  working out with trumpeter cygnets and a motorboat last year. Sladen, the Johns  Hopkins swan man, is looking for financial backing and has found a safe  wintering spot for the first batch of birds, on the grounds of a conference  center near Washington.  </P> <P> Lishman plans to make a dry run with Carrick's dime-a-dozen geese later this  summer, and if all goes well, he, Carrick, and a ground crew will embark with  the precious swans in the fall.  </P> <P> "You have to be very careful," Lishman said. "With trumpeters, it's a whole  different ball game. Trumpeters fly much later in the year, so late in the  season that we might not get the weather (we need). You can't fly ultralights  in rough weather.  </P> <P> "And when the trumpeters first learn to fly, they're much more awkward than  geese. You could have a mid-air with one of them very easily."  </P> <P> But Lishman noted that it should take only one successful trip with the  ultralight to show the birds the way south. After that, the swans will be on  their own, and he can return to full-time sculpting.  </P> <P> Lovers of the trumpeter swan might argue that Lishman's airborne exertions as  the man who teaches birds to fly are themselves art of a high order.  </P> <P> "Surely the best art is always functional," says Lumsden, the trumpeter swan  restoration expert.  </P></p>

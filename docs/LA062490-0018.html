			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ASPECTS OF LOVE BY DAVID GARNETT (VINTAGE: $8.95)  </P> <P> First published in 1955, David Garnett's short novel is a superficial bit of  fluff that deserves to have been turned into a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber.  The skewed romantic polygon at the center of the story involves Alexis, a young  British ne'er-do-well; Sir George Dillingham, his wealthy uncle, and Rose, a  French actress who somehow rises from unknown to Great Star.  </P> <P> The reader never sees the intelligence or passion that would make Rose a  celebrated actress: Her success is a contrivance that enables her to take  lovers with the casual elan that French women invariably display in English  novels. The male characters fare no better. Sir George has all the depth of a  monomolecular film; Alexis, the idle drop-out, becomes a career Army officer  for no apparent reason. His new discipline allows him to conceive a deep but  chaste love for Jenny, the daughter of Rose and Sir George, and continue the  romantic improbabilities unto the second generation perdue.  </P></p>

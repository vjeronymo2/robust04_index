			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanchang, April 10 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangxi  Province is launching a drive to sow quality seeds in the  current spring farming season.    Several million farmers are joining forces in the selecting,  cultivating, testing and promoting of quality crop seeds and  animal stock.    Jiangxi hopes to lift its agriculture to a new level by  doing  so. Last year more than 90 percent of its major crops such as  soy beans, peanuts and cotton used quality seeds.    The use of quality stock has also been promoted in raising  pigs, cattle, sheep and aquatic products.    Governments at all levels have offered financial and  technological support for the cultivation of quality seeds and  stock and the construction of such centers.    Jiangxi has also set up organizations to make sure that no  inferior seeds or stock can find their way onto the market.</p>

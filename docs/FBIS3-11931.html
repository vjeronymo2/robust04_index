			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Three deputies resigned this morning to avoid being  stripped of their political rights and from being prohibited to  run for the next elections. They are accused by the budget CPI  [Congressional Investigative Committee] of embezzlement and  malfeasance in office.    While the defense witnesses for Deputy Cid Carvalho were  testifying before the Constitution and Justice Committee,  Carvalho presented his resignation to the committee. He said he  resigned because he cannot defend himself against the budget CPI  accusations.    [Begin recording] [Carvalho] I am ready to be processed  under  a common civil court, under which I will be tried anyway.    [Unidentified reporter] Does this mean the end of your  political career?    [Carvalho] Yes. [end recording]    This was the first resignation of the morning. Later the  plenary hall was informed that two other deputies charged with  the same crimes also presented their resignation. They are  Deputies Manoel Moreira from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement] Sao Paulo, and Joao Alves, who was expelled from the  PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] of Bahia.    The three deputies resigned two months after the budget CPI  decided to judge them. The final CPI report accuses the three  of embezzlement and malfeasance in office. This is why it  requested that they be stripped of their political rights for  lack of decorum. By resigning, the deputies avoid undergoing a  political trial and a sentence forbidding them to run for  elections for three years.    The Constitution and Justice Committee which met today to  approve the stripping of political rights of Deputy Joao Alves  was taken by surprise by his decision. Committee rapporteur  Deputy Moroni Torgan was this morning trying to make the  committee members vote on the issue by alleging that the  resignation is irrevocable only when it is published in the  congressional bulletin, which has yet not happened.    [Begin Deputy Thomaz Nono, president of the Constitution and  Justice Committee recording] I have listened to the committee.  As I said before, our action is merely political. The only  thing the Chamber of Deputies can do is to strip him of his  political rights. When a deputy resigns like this, even though  he may deny it, in practice he is really confessing his guilt  and loosing his mandate which is the political sentence that the  Chamber of Deputies would have imposed on him.

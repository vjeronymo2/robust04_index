			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, on 14 June the South  Korean puppets committed a provocative act of illegally bringing  recoilless guns into the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ].    At around 09:15 [00:15 GMT] on 14 June, the puppet army's  armed rascals brought in, and installed at an encampment, 90-mm  recoilless guns inside the DMZ 600 meters south of the Military  Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker No. 0412 in front of Kumsa-ri,  Chorwon County. They took a firing position at our side, thereby  gravely threatening the safety of our People's Army soldiers who  were on routine duty at a guard post.    At around 08:40 [23:40 GMT] on the same day, a numerous  number of the puppet army soldiers equipped with automatic  weapons were inciting a war atmosphere while touring about this  area by sneaking into the DMZ area southeast of the MDL Marker  Nos. 0140 and 0170 in front of (?Mt. Taedok) in Changpung County  on the western frontline and--prior to this, at around 07:50  [22:50 GMT]--into the DMZ area south of the MDL Marker No. 0468  in front of Mabang-ri, Chorwon County on the central front line.    This is the South Korean puppets' intentional and  premeditated maneuverings aimed at artificially aggravating the  situation inside the DMZ area on the MDL and arousing a  North-South confrontation.    The South Korean puppets should profoundly consider the  grave  consequences the rascals will cause by their reckless  provocative acts and should not do rash and thoughtless acts.</p>

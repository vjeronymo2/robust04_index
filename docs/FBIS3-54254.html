			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Islamabad, Jan 23 (AFP) -- Afghan President  Borhanoddin Rabbani Sunday [23 Jan] said he would allow the  nation to choose a new leader, stressing that the country's  war-ravaged situation would have to determine how this is done.    In a nationwide broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, Rabbani  said he would accept the people's choice.    The embattled president, whose 18-month tenure ends in June,  did not say if he was ready to immediately step down, as  demanded by his rival, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar.    Hekmatyar is allied with Uzbek warlord and former communist  general Abdol Rashid Dostam, who staged a coup attempt on New  Year's Day. The bloody power struggle continues to rage in  Kabul three weeks after the failed coup.    "I am offering the people (the right) to choose a new  leadership," Rabbani said, adding that the country's turbulent  situation would have to dictate the manner in which this is  accomplished.    A new leader could be chosen either through a consultative  council of elders or through elections, Rabbani added.    However, he said if the nation opted for elections, the  war-ravaged country would need assistance from the United  Nations or the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC). The  president did not set a deadline nor did he elaborate the  mechanism.    Rabbani said the January 1 coup had been orchestrated  outside  of Afghanistan. "It was an external conspiracy," he said.    But he did not identify any foreign power.    The president's speech came as Kabul was plunged into one of  the fiercest battles since he assumed office.    Rabbani said his forces would be ready to stop fighting  against the mujahedeen of Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic  Party of Afganistan] faction, "but the battle with Dostam troops  would continue until the communist militia surrendered or was  crippled."    "We can not allow conspirators to seize power by force," he  vowed.</p>

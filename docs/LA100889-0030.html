			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHECK OUT B-52S  </P> <P> After reading Steve Hochman's review (Record Rack, Sept. 24) of the Sugarcubes  latest album, may I suggest he listen to the B-52s for the "mischievous"  quality he seeks?  </P> <P> It still amazes me that no one has heard this obvious rip-off of a sound  created right here in the U.S.A. Good music doesn't have to come from an  exotic-sounding place like: Reykjavik to be "brand-spanking new."  </P> <P> PAM TATE  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

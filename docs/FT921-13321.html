			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Asfinag issue considered tightly priced AFTER the deluge of new dollar bonds in recent weeks, the Eurobond market yesterday was ill-prepared for more. The result was a poor showing for a Dollars 200m 10-year issue for Asfinag, the Austrian road financing agency, brought by Merrill Lynch. At a yield of 30 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury bond, the pricing was widely considered too tight for the market conditions. A further 3 to 5 basis points on the spread was generally considered necessary to shift the paper. But that did not stop a range of leading underwriters from joining the deal. The deal was priced with an eye on the 30 basis point spread in current trading of last week's well-received 12-year deal for the Republic of Austria, which had been scaled up from Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m. The shorter maturity of the Asfinag issue, together with the backing of a Republic of Austria guarantee, help explain yesterday's pricing. But the market had no appetite for any more dollar paper. By contrast, the Kingdom of Norway's appearance with a Y100bn five-year issue left investors asking for more. The prospect of a large, liquid issue from a highly-regarded name found demand particularly in Europe and the Far East. The 5.48 per cent yield - 18 basis points over the World Bank's five-year issue - was seen as fair, and in later trading the bonds were being bid at their reoffered price of 99.55. Commerzbank brought an aggressively-priced DM500m 10-year issue for the Kingdom of Belgium. The issue, with a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent was said to be slow getting underway. Demand is expected from retail investors on the continent. British Land, the UK property developer, launched an offer through Warburg Soditic to buy back SFr25m of its outstanding SFr75m 6 1/2 per cent bonds due 1994 at 87.5 per cent. Credit Foncier de France may issue French franc bonds in the Euromarket this week, finance director Mr Olivier Hassler said, Reuter reports. The mortgage lender had meant to issue domestic bonds with a special tranche set aside for foreign investors. But, under French rules, such a tranche must be fungible with an outstanding bond - and a legal snag has put all fungible issues on ice.</p>

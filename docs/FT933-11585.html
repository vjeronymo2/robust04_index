			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Bundesbank move raises hopes of discount rate cut THE BUNDESBANK yesterday cut the cost of lending short term funds to commercial banks, raising expectations that it would reduce its official rates at a council meeting today and quell growing currency tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The German central bank's cut in its repo rate from 7.15 per cent to 6.95 per cent was slightly larger than currency dealers had expected, and raised hopes that it would today cut the internationally sensitive discount rate, which sets the floor for all German money market rates. The bank cut its discount rate to 6.75 per cent from 7.25 per cent on July 2. The Lombard rate was lowered from 8.50 per cent to 8.25 per cent at the same time. Yesterday's repo rate cut helped quell tensions in the ERM at the start of European trading, including heavy selling of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo, and continued pressure on the French franc. Analysts were uncertain about what decision the Bundesbank would have to take today to quell tensions in the ERM during the remaining summer weeks. In UK financial markets, there was strong speculation that a large cut in German interest rates today might allow the British government to lower base rates, currently at 6 per cent. Some dealers in sterling interest rate markets were confident base rates would be cut within weeks. That speculation pushed sterling  1/4 pfennig down against the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.5675. It was little changed at DM2.5687 in New York. The Bundesbank meeting, the last before the summer recess, will be the most keenly watched event in currency markets since the ERM crisis of last September. There was a strong assumption in the London market that the Bundesbank would cut its discount rate by  1/2 a percentage point. Some analysts believed rates would need to ease  3/4 of a percentage point for France and other ERM countries to have an opportunity to lower the cost of short term borrowing. There were fears that the Bundesbank was giving priority to domestic price stability rather than the ERM. 'If we do not cut the discount rate, then the French franc might go the same way as sterling, and leave the system,' a German economist said. 'The view will be that the Bundesbank is not committed to ERM, or to the second phase of the Maastricht treaty.' Yesterday's cut in the repo rate halted intense selling of the Spanish peseta, which fell by about 2 per cent against the D-Mark in early European trading. There was also heavy selling of the Portuguese escudo, which fell to a historic low against the D-Mark, and neared its ERM floor against the German currency. Both currencies recovered after the Bundesbank's action, the Spanish peseta closing at Pta80.41 against the German currency. The French franc rallied to close at FFr3.405, amid a slight softening in French money market interest rates.

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Those that bite the bulletin: The Bank's low-profile economics division BEYOND THE hush of the Bank of England's marbled ground floor, a small warren of slightly shabby, narrow corridors leads to the Bank's economics division. Little is generally known about the economists who work there other than what appears in the Bank's quarterly bulletin, the latest copy of which is published today. But a favourite taunt of their City and Treasury colleagues is that their research is carried out in a vacuum, having little impact on the authorities' decisions. The role of central bank economists is bound to be slightly murky. The extent to which their work can affect big policy decisions is limited, given that the government has the final say on monetary policy. At the same time, much of their research cannot be published for fear of giving away intentions on base-rate movements and of upsetting the markets. Yet Professor Mervyn King, an executive director of the Bank who took over responsibility a year ago for the economics division - known internally as ED - was convinced that a department of about 35 economists could make a valuable contribution to the Bank's policies. He decided to reorganise the division to 'make it more central to the needs of the Bank'. Mr Lionel Price, head of ED, who was closely involved with the reorganisation, said: 'There was a feeling that ED had become detached from the Bank and didn't reflect the shift in its work that had taken place over the previous 10 years. 'We needed to act as adviser to the banking system on the macro-economic and monetary side but also on bank regulation and the promotion of financial services.' The question was how to reorganise more than 30 highly qualified, intelligent public-sector employees, who had been working to more or less the same brief since the late 1970s, in order to make their output more relevant to the needs of a central bank. The main change to the division was to reduce sharply the importance of its economic model, formerly the division's centrepiece around which all research revolved. The system, according to Prof King, had become ossified. Underemployed economists scrabbled around for something new to say about their section of the model, rather than addressing relevant issues. 'It is easy for any organisation to get stuck in a rut. A small group can sit on the same thing for 50 years, without asking themselves 'should we be working on this?',' he said. Withdrawing an established economic model from a group of economists is a bit like robbing an electrician of his tool kit. After all, many of ED's economists had defined themselves in terms of the model since they began working there. Professor King said: 'In the old days people had a clear link with a particular bit of the economy, for example, the capital account. That had to change - people had to start thinking about why they were doing what they were doing.' The model was slimmed down from 500 variables to about 350, and the number of people working on the forecasts was cut to about five. At the same time the rest of the department was divided into six groups, each focusing on a separate area of the economy relevant to the Bank's activities. The theory was that, released from the burden of the forecast, the Bank's economists would be free to carry out topical research. Few problems were encountered on the way. One or two employees left, and those responsible for the model before the changes felt a little bereft at its downgrading. But Mr Price said: 'On the whole I think those directly involved with forecasting rather liked the new system once they got used to it. They used to have about 40 other economists telling them what to put in their forecast. Now, with just four or five of them they felt they owned it.' The other groups, including two new sections, could now use their time to research projects relevant to the bank - the shape of the economic recovery, the pros and cons of gilts auctions, analysis of bond yields and prices, and the effect of repossessions on the housing market. A year on Prof King is pleased with the results of the reorganisation. He said that ideas generated by ED were beginning to be subsumed into the collective consciousness of the Bank. Most employees seem enthusiastic and busy, in spite of the collegiate, slightly laid-back atmosphere of the division. Complicated equations adorn the walls of the rather austere offices, alongside notices for the next Bank of England cricket match. Often a seminar - for example Mr John Wriglesworth of UBS Phillips and Drew on the UK housing market - interrupts the day. One or two of the younger economists grumble that their work goes unrecognised, and that ED research remains unlikely to influence policy decisions taken by the authorities. But other comments suggest that Prof King's desire to bring ED closer to the heart of the Bank is being fulfilled. A member of the monetary and exchange rate policy group said: 'The people you get here are those that want to do something useful with economics. Obviously there is no profit motive, rather a desire to see your thoughts become policy.' Another of the division's younger economists working in the quantitative financial economics group has recently returned from the City. He said: 'This place has changed a lot. Getting me to come back would have taken about five or six months and a sub-committee a few years ago, but this time it took a couple of phone calls.'</p>

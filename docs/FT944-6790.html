			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire stirs societies' pudding - The sector's reaction to the merger plans For the second time this year building societies are hoping to prove that reports of the sector's demise are premature. But the agreement between Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies, two of the UK's biggest, to merge and then to become a public limited company and a bank has set them a serious challenge. Reaction now is different from responses to the announcement in April of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth largest. Then there was less to put societies on the defensive. The Lloyds offer could be seen as a sign of its strength in the core markets of home loans and retail savings, while increased interest from potential purchasers could not be a threat since the mutual ownership regime protects societies from hostile takeover. By contrast, last week's announcement by the two Yorkshire-based societies planted two doubts. First, if Leeds, the fifth largest society with assets of Pounds 20bn, did not feel large enough to survive alone, what would happen to smaller societies? Second, if Halifax - almost twice as big as the second largest - believed it had to convert to plc-status in order to compete effectively in personal financial services, how could other large societies do so while still shackled to the regulatory restrictions on societies' activities and funding? Despite these concerns, the remaining large societies are not planning a suicide pact. 'You can never say never, but there are no powers we want that we will not be getting anyway, and capital is not a problem, so why convert?' says Mr Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest. Indeed, societies can see some advantages for themselves from the Halifax move - for example in the disappearance of the Leeds brand and discussions with the Treasury about new powers for societies. Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, has said the government wants a separate societies' sector to flourish. Consequently, Mr Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide, the second largest society, believes the deal strengthens the case for greater flexibility so societies can compete more effectively in their present form. The common refrain among large societies is that above a certain minimum, size is not everything. They can focus either on developing a particular niche - as Bradford &amp; Bingley is seeking to do as the largest independent financial adviser - or on a strong regional franchise - such as Northern Rock's position in north-east England. While in the short term those tactics are not undermined by the Halifax move, the agreement does intensify the pressures for change over the next few years. In particular, the deal makes it much more likely that a large society planning to merge or convert will now decide to do both. The case for a pre-conversion merger is that the larger a society is when it becomes a plc, the better-placed it is to deter potential predators. If the Leeds had decided to float on its own, it could have been destabilised by speculation about a hostile bid well before it could have been taken over. The argument for adding conversion is that, as members are increasingly aware of the value of their membership, they need the promise of shares tomorrow to persuade them to back a deal which does not bring much, if any, immediate financial benefit. Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, says the society will not be making any 'panic decisions', since getting the right partner is more important than simply enjoying the idea of a match. Societies do not need to panic now. But with the reasonable assumption that there will be further large mergers, they would probably be well-advised to join a dating agency so as not to be left on the shelf.</p>

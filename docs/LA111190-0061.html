			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION RESULTS  </P> <P> On Election Day we voted in the local elementary school down the street from  our home in Westwood.  </P> <P> The school auditorium was old, shabby, poorly lit, cluttered with decrepit  furniture and grungy.  </P> <P> Our bank in Westwood is beautiful. It's new, made of marble, its floors covered  with plush carpeting. It has the latest in lighting, a three-story ceiling and  exquisitely styled furniture.  </P> <P> Where are our priorities?  </P> <P> JEFFREY HAYDEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

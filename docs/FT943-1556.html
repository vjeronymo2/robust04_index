			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / RMC buoyed by UK recovery The continued strength of the German construction market, and a firm recovery in the UK, helped RMC Group achieve a 60 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 61.6m to Pounds 98.8m. Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 1.92bn (Pounds 1.69bn), with Germany contributing Pounds 782.2m, an increase of Pounds 55.4m on the previous year. Profits from German operations - where RMC has a dominating 16 per cent share of the ready mixed cement market - grew 8 per cent from Pounds 52.9m to Pounds 57.2m. UK profits more than doubled from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds 33.3m on turnover 16 per cent ahead at Pounds 527m (Pounds 454.3m). Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said price increases of around 8 per cent in the UK concrete business were being passed on to customers. 'We are simply recovering some of the ground lost during the recession and getting back to something like adequate returns,' he said. However he did not expect price rises to continue at the same rate during the second half, although RMC would benefit from the 'plateauing' effect of the new higher prices at the full-year. RMC confirmed recent evidence from others in the construction industry of a strong recovery in the UK's new house market, with the south-east in particular seeing good demand. Margins in eastern Germany remained firm and Mr Jenkins forecast double-digit growth in volume terms for the foreseeable future. The country's housing market was also maintaining solid expansion and RMC said that fears that the market may peak would be offset by the beginning of a pick-up in the commercial market. The transfer of the government from Bonn to Berlin - close to RMC's German operations centre - would underpin this growth, according to Mr Jenkins. Turnover from RMC's other European operations rose 19 per cent to Pounds 421.6m (Pounds 353m) with profits 33 per cent higher at Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 12.1m). France was undergoing a 'gentle recovery', while Spain was beginning to pick up after its recent slump. Improved conditions in Israel and the US saw profits from the non-European division jump 75 per cent to Pounds 10m (Pounds 5.7m) on turnover 24 per cent ahead at Pounds 188.3m (Pounds 151.2m). Earnings per share almost doubled from 13.4p to 24.6p. The interim dividend rises from 6.6p to 7p. Lex, Page 22</p>

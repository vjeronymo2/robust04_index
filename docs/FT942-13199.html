			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Ascom slides deeper into the red Ascom, the deeply troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment group, has revealed a loss of SFr336.7m (Dollars 233.8m) for 1993, compared with a SFr46.4m loss last time. The directors admitted the group, formed by a merger of three protected domestic suppliers in 1987, had made a significant strategic mistake in trying to become internationally competitive in too many product areas. 'We have too wide a product range,' Mr Fred Sutter, chief executive, said at the group's annual press conference. The dash for growth detracted from the important task of unifying management from the predecessor companies, so when in 1992 many operations turned sour and liberalisation cut into sales to the Swiss PTT, Ascom was slow to retrench. The result last year was an operating loss of SFr130m and rationalisation costs of SFr139m. Last December, the former chief executive, Mr Leoardo Vannotti, was sacked. In January, the finance director quit and in February, Mr Heinz Frey, the chairman, said he would stand down in May. So far, no successor has been found for Mr Frey, and some analysts have suggested that Ascom's most likely fate is to be broken up. Mr Sutter insisted yesterday that the group had a future following the closure or sale of some lossmaking businesses and the planned creation of joint ventures in mobile radios with Bosch of Germany and in public switching systems with L. M. Ericsson of Sweden. Ascom could then focus on its internationally competitive product lines  - telephone sets, in-house networks for companies and service automation machinery, such as payphones and bank cash dispensers. He said the group would break even this year at the operating level and achieve a net profit of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of sales in 1995. Sales, down 6.3 per cent last year to SFr3.16bn, would continue to decline, to SFr2.5bn this year and to between SFr2bn and SFr2.5bn next year, depending on the timing of the formation of the two joint ventures in which Ascom would be the minority partner.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close for equities as bonds advance again - Market Report A firm performance from bond prices again helped UK equities move higher to challenge the FT-SE 3.000 mark, brushing off a scare about reported developments on the Kuwait border as Wall Street opened positively in the wake of the keenly-awaited US employment data. The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed 14.3 ahead at 2,998.7 and long dated gilt-edged stocks were around 3/4 of a point higher. Equity trading volume remained modest but the market looked more confident as the US employment statistics failed to dislodge an early gain which took the Footsie to within five points of the 3,000 mark. Confidence was challenged in the second half of the session when reports flashed across the trading screens suggesting Iraqi troop movements on the Kuwait border. Oil shares, and also sterling, flicked higher on the news agency reports from the Middle East, and the Footsie gain was trimmed from 11 to 4 points very quickly as investors pondered the implications of a renewed threat to oil prices and bond yields as well as currencies. But the news agency reports could not be fully sustained in UK market hours. Markets soon settled down again, and the Footsie rallied behind a Dow Industrial Average which added 12 points in UK trading hours. At last night's closing reading, the Footsie Index was down just under 1 per cent over a week which has seen the market unsettled by fears that the US Federal Reserve may soon raise its key interest rates again. Worry over upward pressures on global rates are focused sharply on the possibility that UK base rates could be forced higher again before the end of the year. But the gilt-edged market, where a recovery is seen as the necessary requisite for a return to health in equities, has been in better form this week. Short-dated gilts, those most closely linked to base rate perceptions, edged forward yesterday and longer dates, more keenly aligned to views on inflation, extended their early gains in the second half of the session. Past weeks have seen investment cash moved from equities into gilts. Nevertheless, sentiment remained unsettled and an erratic equity market dipped sharply in early trading when futures selling fell on an unwilling equity market. Next week brings a heavy list of economic data from both sides of the Atlantic. On the home front, investors will focus on the Retail Price Index for September which is due, together with average earnings and wage cost statistics, in the middle of the week. Later, markets will face the producer price index from the US, with retail sales and consumer price figures to follow. Most of the action lay in the Footsie stocks yesterday, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was left to edge ahead by 2 points to 3,447.5. Business in non-Footsie stocks made up only just over half of yesterday's Seaq volume total of 512.4m shares which was nearly 12 per cent down on the previous session. While retail business, life-blood of the big securities firms, has remained satisfactory, it has become more narrowly focused, threatening the financial health of the less prominent names in the market. On Thursday, retail, or customer business, was worth Pounds 1.2bn, maintaining the flow of profitable trading sessions for the London-based securities industry. In spite of the weakness of the stock market, many market strategists have repeated relatively bullish forecasts for prospects for the F-SE 100 Index over the final three months before the end of the year. Economic recovery, in the form of corporate earnings and dividends is still seen the near-term prop for the stock market, although two leading firms warned yesterday that consumer spending might continue to face restraints both this year and next.</p>

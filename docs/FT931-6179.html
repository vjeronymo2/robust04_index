			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Triffin, far-sighted economist: Obituary ROBERT TRIFFIN, who played a major role in the recreation of European currency convertibility after the second world war and correctly diagnosed the critical weakness of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system, died on February 23 in Ostend, Belgium, at the age of 81. Born in Flobecq, Belgium, Triffin was educated at Louvain and Harvard Universities, becoming a US citizen in 1942. Between 1942 and 1949 he held positions with the Federal Reserve System and the International Monetary Fund. His most important official role, however, was in Paris as special policy adviser at the Economic Co-operation Administration and alternate US representative at the European Payments Union, between 1949 and 1951. Thereupon, Triffin taught at Yale University, before returning to Belgium in 1977 and reassuming Belgian citizenship. Triffin's main practical contribution to international monetary economics came shortly after the second world war in the establishment of the European Payments Union. The EPU set the European currencies on the path towards currency convertibility and provided a framework for the renewal of multilateral trade within Europe. Triffin's most important intellectual contribution, however, was his seminal critique of the Bretton Woods system, first published in 1959 and reprinted in 1960 in the most famous of his books, Gold and the Dollar Crisis. Though proved largely right, his fate was to be a Cassandra, unable to persuade policy makers to make the changes that would have preserved a system in whose underlying principles he strongly believed. Triffin argued that the fundamental flaw in the operation of the international monetary system agreed at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944 would turn out to be not a shortage of dollars, as most economists had argued, but a glut. Inadequate growth of the stocks of monetary gold would make the world increasingly dependent on rising US dollar reserves, which would have to be supplied through a deficit in the US balance of payments. Sooner or later, however, the US would have to correct its deficit, since the rest of the world would become increasingly unwilling to accept the US currency at a fixed exchange rate. At that stage, he argued, the world would face a three-fold choice: revaluation of the gold stock; generalised floating; or internationalisation of foreign exchange reserves. Triffin preferred the last alternative. As was probably inevitable, however, the US pre-empted that choice by terminating US dollar convertibility into gold in 1971, a decision that left the world with its subsequent regime of floating exchange rates among major currencies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Richard von Weizsaecker by Michael </F> H. Spreng and F. Weckbach-Mara in Bonn; date not given: "What  Will You Do When You Are Retired, Mr. President?"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [BILD AM SONNTAG] What are  the political issues that you will be dealing with in the future?    [Weizsaecker] The priority of my political work has always  been connected with overcoming the division of Berlin, Germany,  and Europe. After the unification of Germany, the next item on  the agenda will be the inclusion of the free and democratic  nations of Central, Eastern, and southeastern Europe. It is no  coincidence that my last trip as president will be to Warsaw.  Poland is among the countries whose history, culture, and  values are just as European as that of our western neighbors and  ourselves. The unification of Europe will take a long time, but  it is a very significant historic process. I feel particularly  committed to that process. Another priority is the future of  the United Nations.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] It has been said that you have been  specifically asked by the UN secretary general....    [Weizsaecker] Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has asked a  group of 12 people to present proposals for the reform of the  United Nations in the summer of 1995 on the occasion of the  organization's 50th birthday. I am chairman of that group with  former Pakistani Prime Minister Qureshie.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Are you also dissatisfied with UN peace  missions, like the one in Somalia, and with inaction in the case  of Rwanda?    [Weizsaecker] At the moment, the world community does not  have the necessary instruments to fulfill its peace task. But  who is responsible for this situation? Not the organization of  the United Nations but the lack of political will, especially on  the part of important member countries. The secretary general  very emphatically asked for means to help Rwanda, yet in vain.  This is just one of the examples that have made him demand that  the United Nations should have forces at its disposal when  needed.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you share this view and do you expect  Germany to participate in the future?    [Weizsaecker] I share the secretary general's view. As to  our country, we have to take the obligations of a member state  seriously. We cannot expect the United Nations to be capable of  acting and responsible for peace on the one hand while refusing  to participate in enforcing it on the other.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will Germany then be given a permanent  seat on the UN Security Council?    [Weizsaecker] First, Germany will probably be voted into the  Security Council as a temporary member for two years as of 1  January 1995. The future permanent composition of the Security  Council will then have to be decided in a reform of the United  Nations, which will certainly not be restricted to Germany.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] What sort of reform?    [Weizsaecker] First of all, the United Nations must be  strengthened in terms of funds, supplies, organization, and  logistics. The Germans are providing much more support in these  fields today than other important countries. Of course, the  United Nations is not heading toward a world government with a  world police force. Conflicts will not stop nor will violence.  Events like the ones in Rwanda, where we as a community of  states have failed, are no reason to condemn the United Nations.  They are a signal to wake up in order to enable it to act more  efficiently than it has done in the past.    I would, however, warn against seeing the activities of the  United Nations exclusively against the background of avoiding or  ending military conflicts. Living conditions in the north are  still completely different from the south. In addition to a  lack of justice, deprivation, and starvation, overpopulation and  the dangers to our environment are the major tasks of today.  They will determine the course of the reforms.

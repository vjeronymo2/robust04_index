			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG BRASS OF CLASSICAL APPEAL;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE FIVE-MEMBER CANADIAN BRASS HAS FOUND THE RIGHT MIX FOR PRODUCING  GOLD.  </P> <P> The Canadian Brass is traveling proof that classical music can lure the masses.  </P> <P> The five-piece ensemble, which plays the Civic Theatre in downtown San Diego at  8 p.m. Wednesday, has struck gold with its mix of classical, New Orleans jazz  and pop songs. From the sale of its nearly 30 albums, 100 or more annual  concert appearances and other sources, the group grosses more than $2 million a  year.  </P> <P> Behind the success is a rollicking live act designed to help the band gain and  keep the attention of diverse audiences.  </P> <P> A typical evening with the group ranges from an adagio by Samuel Barber to jazz  tunes by Fats Waller or Jelly Roll Morton -- reworked for brass -- and, this  time of year, a handful of Christmas favorites.  </P> <P> Shows begin with the group's slow procession from the rear of a concert hall to  the stage as it plays a New Orleans funeral march. After that, band members  don't just sit there as they play. They have been known to pirouette while  delivering ballet music, or dance their own version of the Russian Dance from  "The Nutcracker."  </P> <P> Yet, unlike pop performers who lip-sync to recorded tracks as they go through  choreographed moves, the Canadian Brass plays it all live and uniformly  receives excellent reviews.  </P> <P> "We must be careful not to let the antics get in the way of the real message  here," said French horn player David Ohanian. "We're really not comedians.  Without the music, we have no show at all. People may find it hysterical that  we sometimes do our tribute to ballet or a mini-opera on stage in costume. But  we've found that audiences who have been to see a string quartet, or chamber  music audiences, find our approach refreshing."  </P> <P> Although band members are all classically trained, their shows include several  jazz numbers. Serious jazz fans may find the group's versions of songs such as  W. C. Handy's "St. Louis Blues" and "Beale Street Blues" a bit sanitary  contrasted with renditions by pure jazz bands.  </P> <P> The musicianship is faultless, but spontaneity and swing are in short supply.  Ohanian acknowledges that the group makes no attempt to improvise on jazz  numbers, sticking to charts prepared for the band by Luther Henderson, who has  also arranged period jazz for Broadway musicals.  </P> <P> "You can't improvise in this music," Ohanian said. "You're replicating, just as  when we do a Handel organ concerto. Luther's intent is to create a written  record of the classic Dixieland sound, with the classic licks and harmonies.  </P> <P> "The trombone is very important -- and the trumpet and the clarinet, which we  impersonate with a muted piccolo trumpet. The licks Luther uses are indigenous  to Dixieland players. The trombone has a sliding sound, the trumpet has that  growling sound. He has coached us so we can emulate the sounds."  </P> <P> The band's recorded jazz has done extremely well. The group's 1987 "Basin  Street" album stayed on Billboard's Crossover chart (for pop-oriented music by  classical players) for 42 weeks and sold more than 120,000 copies.  </P> <P> One reason for this success is the jazz renaissance in America.  </P> <P> "It's coming back," Ohanian said. "During the 1970s, it almost went underground  when rock came to the forefront, but jazz is really enjoying a resurgence. It's  always stayed big in Europe, but in the United States, we kind of let it wane.  I see much more evidence of jazz in record stores and on classical music  stations. In Canada, there's quite a bit more jazz on the radio than in the  States. It seems like everywhere but where it was invented, it's been really  hot."  </P> <P> Not that classical music is any slouch for the Canadian Brass. "Art of the  Fugue," for example -- an album of Bach's music for organ, rearranged for brass  -- sold more than 40,000 copies.  </P> <P> Classical music purists may question the group's adaptations of classical organ  pieces, since the compositions were never intended for brass.  </P> <P> "We're brass players, not organists, but we want to play the music," Ohanian  said. "If you believe in the music, try to make it yours, share that enthusiasm  with the audience, the audience seems to pick up on it.  </P> <P> "When offered the criticism of, 'Hey, you're brass, leave the organ alone' --  well, there isn't a lot of repertoire for brass from the earlier periods of  music, because the instruments really weren't perfected like they are today.  The technique of the players was not as advanced either. So this is a really  modern phenomenon, a brass quintet that fills a 3,000-seat auditorium without  amplification."  </P> <P> Popularity and the ability to fill large venues didn't come overnight. The  group has diligently built a following during 20 years together.  </P> <P> Tuba player Charles Daellenbach and trombonist Eugene Watts met in Toronto in  the late 1960s while Daellenbach was teaching music at the University of  Toronto and Watts was principal trombonist in the Toronto Symphony. They  founded the Canadian Brass in 1970, and are the only remaining original  members.  </P> <P> Trumpeters Fred Mills and Ronald Romm, who played with the Houston Symphony  Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, have been in the band since the  early 1970s.  </P> <P> Ohanian, an 11-year veteran of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the band's  newest member, joined in 1986, moving over from the Empire Brass.  </P> <P> Besides touring and recording, the group is attempting to appeal to the MTV  generation. It has released four videos during the past five years: three of  concerts plus an instructional tape for music students.  </P> <P> "And we just got back from London, where Philips (the group's recording label)  produced the Canadian Brass on Laserdisc. This will be our first release in the  high-definition television format, next fall."  </P> <P> The new video project weaves the group's music through a fictional tale about  their boyhoods, with young actors playing the musicians as youngsters.  </P> <P> "This really is quite a litmus test for the brass," Ohanian said. "We'll see if  we can organize and tape classical music in an interesting, attention-grabbing  way that can be sold commercially to a general audience. If so, that bodes very  well for other groups of our kind."  </P></p>

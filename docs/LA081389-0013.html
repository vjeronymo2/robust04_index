			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELING: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> BUYING HARDWOOD  </P> <P> REMODELERS ARE FACED with a bewildering choice of materials, most of them  fairly bland. Why not opt for a natural substance with deep, rare colors and  patterns? Why not try wood?  </P> <P> Wood, always a basic element of house building and furniture making, is all too  often relegated to a supporting role. Yet hardwoods of all types are easily  found in Southern California -- hardwoods that can be the crowning touch to a  new fireplace mantle, a strip of molding to highlight an entryway, a special  table you've always wanted to try your hand at building.  </P> <P> Choosing the right hardwood can make or break a project, not to mention a  pocketbook. A lumberyard carrying hardwood might have a mix of as many as 60  different domestics (ash, walnut, the many varieties of oak) and exotics,  including such intriguing types as ziricote, Pernambuco, bubinga and koa.  Prices range from less than $5 a board foot (12 inch square by 1 inch thick)  for birch, maple and red oak -- most popular with remodelers -- to $28 for true  exotics such as macassar ebony. Some are even sold by weight: Pink ivory from  Zimbabwe sells for about $25 a pound.  </P> <P> "Buy the best quality you can buy," says Richard Mandroian, owner of Arroyo  Hardwoods in Pasadena. "On a remodeling project that is going to take  significant time and effort -- as well as cost several thousand dollars -- it  doesn't pay to save $50 or $75. You're only cheating yourself."  </P> <P> Keep an eye on the end result: Variables include grain, texture and darkness as  well as color. Another tip: Find a lumberman whom you trust, one who will tell  you, for example, the difference between Honduras mahogany -- a true mahogany  -- and African mahogany, a less expensive substitute. The latter won't have the  easy workability of Honduras mahogany, nor show as interesting a grain after  finishing.  </P> <P> There are woodworkers who feel a special relationship to a choice piece of  wood, who believe that every tree has a soul. There is a piece of hardwood out  there that deserves to live again -- in your living room.  </P> <P>  Find hardwoods at House of Hardwood in West Los Angeles; Arroyo Hardwoods in  Pasadena;MacBeath Hardwood in Montebello; Austin Hardwoods in Santa Ana; Davis  Moulding (limited selection) in Oxnard, and Frost Hardwood Lumber Co. in San  Diego.  </P></p>

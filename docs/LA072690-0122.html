			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE KIDNEY DISEASE;  </P> <P> DISCOVERY OF HORMONE HOLDS PROMISE  </P> <P> California and Utah researchers have succeeded in preventing one form of kidney  disease in rats, potentially opening the door to prevention of kidney failure  in humans.  </P> <P> The disease, called glomerulonephritis, is one of the most common causes of  chronic kidney failure, afflicting as many as 100,000 Americans each year. Once  the kidney fails, the patients must either receive a transplant or remain on  dialysis for the rest of their lives.  </P> <P> Researchers from the University of Utah and the La Jolla Cancer Research  Foundation report today in the British journal Nature that glomerulonephritis  in the rats is caused by excess concentrations of a hormone called transforming  growth factor-beta (TGF-B).  </P> <P> They found that specialized antibodies can be used to remove the hormone from  the blood of the animals and thereby prevent the onset of the disease.  </P> <P> But Utah nephrologist Wayne Border cautioned that it could be many years before  the proposed therapy could be used in humans. For one thing, the recently  discovered TGF-B has not yet been linked to kidney disease in humans --  although, he said, "it would be incredible if it weren't also playing an  important role in man."  </P> <P> Researchers have not shown in animal experiments that the therapy can halt the  disease process once it has begun, he added, but test-tube experiments indicate  that it can.  </P> <P> "This important observation opens the door" to the treatment of humans, said  Dr. Saulo Klahr of the Washington University School of Medicine, president of  the National Kidney Foundation.  </P> <P> Healthy kidneys act as filters that remove both excess water and cellular  wastes from blood. When the kidneys fail, an individual will die of poisoning  within days unless those wastes are removed artificially by dialysis. More than  130,000 Americans undergo dialysis routinely to maintain their health.  </P> <P> The filtering is carried out within the kidney by small units called glomeruli.  Kidney disease occurs when the glomeruli become clogged by abnormally large  amounts of a material called "extracellular matrix," a fibrous meshwork of  proteins and other materials.  </P> <P> This scarring and clogging can be produced by diabetes, high blood pressure and  glomerulonephritis, in which the immune system attacks the glomeruli, often as  the aftereffect of an infection. Physicians do not know the precise mechanism  by which the damage occurs, and no effective therapy exists to prevent or halt  the scarring.  </P> <P> Scientists study glomerulonephritis in rats by injecting a protein that attacks  cells in the glomeruli, damaging them and inducing the formation of  extracellular matrix. Studying this phenomenon, Border and cellular biologist  Erkki Ruoslahti of the La Jolla foundation discovered that the formation of the  matrix was triggered by TGF-B, which was released when the kidney cells were  damaged.  </P> <P> The researchers then prepared antibodies to the hormone and injected them into  15 rats at the same time they injected the protein that produces the disease.  The rats also received daily injections of the the anti-TGF-B antibody on each  of the next six days.  </P> <P> After seven days, the researchers examined the rats that received the  anti-TGF-B antibody and found that their glomeruli were normal, Border said,  indicating that disease had been prevented. In contrast, the glomeruli of 15  control animals who were given only the disease-producing protein showed marked  scarring and inflammation.  </P> <P> So far, there is no evidence that TGF-B plays a similar role in  glomerulonephritis in humans. "But our paper is the first to describe a link to  TGF-B in kidney disease," Border said, "so no one has looked for it before."  </P> <P> They are now collecting human blood samples to look for the hormone, he said,  and they are also conducting studies to determine if the anti-TGF-B antibodies  can halt the disease process once it has been initiated.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ruoslahti and his colleagues in La Jolla have discovered a naturally  occurring protein, called decorin, that in the test tube binds to TGF-B and  neutralizes its activity in much the same way that the antibody does.  Researchers at Telios Pharmaceuticals of La Jolla are developing techniques to  produce large quantities of decorin in order to study its potential therapeutic  use.  </P> <P> The research may have other applications as well, Ruoslahti said. TGF-B may be  involved in other diseases where excess scarring occurs, such as lung disease,  and it may play a role in the process by which cancer cells from a tumor  metastasize, invading other parts of the body. Developing the ability to  interfere with TGF-B, he said, might thus have therapeutic potential in those  disorders as well.  </P> <P> Maugh reported from Los Angeles and Monroe reported from San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Kidney disease, caused by diabetes, high blood pressure and glomerulonephritis,  affects as many as 100,000 Americans a year. The only treatments are dialysis  and kidney transplants. The number of Americans on dialysis has been growing  about 10% a year, reaching 130,000 in 1989 and costing the federal government  about $2.5 billion a year.  </P></p>

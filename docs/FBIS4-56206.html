			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 1 May (EFE) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro  said today that the measures that must be adopted to put the  economy on a sound basis "are hard and difficult" and warned  that "we cannot take half measures."    In an address to the National Assembly, which is holding a  special session today to decide what measures will be adopted,  Fidel said: "I do not think it would be worthwhile to do  nothing, to stop halfway, because it would be a disaster if the  measures we adopt are insufficient."    "We are far from having a full idea of the problem; not even  the comrades with a better education have it, although we have  certainly made progress," the Cuban leader added.    Castro referred to the series of proposals presented this  morning by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who outlined  the need to create a tax system, reduce some subsidies and  benefits, increase prices for nonessential products, and create  a convertible currency, among other things.    Castro added: "Everyone is prepared to find solutions, but  no one wants to pay taxes on their salary or to have even a cent  cut from their salary. Everyone wants a solution but they want  solutions without having to take these types of measures."    Castro termed the country's current economic situation as a  "cancer" characterized by over 11 billion pesos in circulating  money, which has virtually nullified the purchasing power of the  national currency, and a 1993 public deficit of 4.2 billion  pesos.    "A human policy of solidarity with the people that neglects  no one involves a surplus of circulating money -- which is  tolerable for some time -- but, within the special period, the  time has come to solve the problem, and that is not so easy,"  Fidel Castro said.    He insisted that it is necessary to carefully decide what  must be done so the situation does not reoccur. He said that it  is necessary to "get to the root of the problem," otherwise "it  would be a tremendous waste of time."    "We must create real solutions," the Cuban leader said after  concluding that there "is no other choice but to take measures  that are part of the special period, a special period that is  much worse than we ever imagined."</p>

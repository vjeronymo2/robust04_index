			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Trade News: BAe Malaysian delivery soon Malaysia will take delivery before the end of the month of the first of 28 British Aerospace Hawk trainer and fighter aircraft ordered under a controversial memorandum of understanding between Malaysia and the UK. The Hawk order forms part of a Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.46bn) defence agreement signed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then British prime minister, and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, in 1988. The Malaysian national news agency, quoting Royal Malaysian Air Force officials, said that all 28 Hawks are to be delivered to Malaysia by February next year. British opposition politicians have alleged that the sale of the Hawks and other British defence equipment was linked to Pounds 234m of British aid for a dam project in Malaysia. Such a linkage would contravene British government guidelines on aid. Malaysia is undertaking a multi-million dollar programme to modernise its armed forces. It will be the first country in south-east Asia with the Hawk, though Indonesia has made a provisional order. Under the terms of the Malaysian purchase, about MDollars 400 (Pounds 98m) of the cost of the Hawks will be offset by the manufacture of various defence equipment in Malaysia. British Aerospace will also provide substantial training and technology transfer so as to make Malaysia self-sufficient in maintenance of the Hawks.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> TREATMENT FOR HEPATITIS B FOUND  </P> <P> Interferon is the first treatment to relieve and even cure lingering hepatitis  B infections, the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and one of the  world's biggest killers, researchers have found.  </P> <P> A study to appear in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine found that  injections of the natural protein can stop the hepatitis B virus from  destroying the liver in almost half of the patients who are chronically  infected. One in 10 is cured.  </P> <P> Until now, there has been no treatment for the hepatitis B virus. While  interferon clearly does not help everyone, having any therapy at all is  considered to be an important step in controlling this infection.  </P></p>

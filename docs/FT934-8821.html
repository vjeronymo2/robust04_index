			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / Brooke outlines lottery rules THE government yesterday outlined restrictions on where and how tickets for the national lottery can be sold, Raymond Snoddy writes. Mr Peter Brooke, National Heritage secretary, said he planned to issue draft directives preventing the rolling-over of prizes that have not been won for more than three consecutive games. Mr Brooke made clear he does not want to see games or machines, including video machines, which encourage excessive playing; games which would encourage under-age playing or excessively priced tickets. Mr Brooke also said tickets should not be sold by or to those under 16 or sold in the street - apart from kiosks - or in betting shops, at horse or dog-racing tracks, in bingo or gaming clubs or even commercially in homes. The lottery's operator should be chosen by next spring.</p>

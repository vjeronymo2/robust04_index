Indeed, at their Brussels meeting, the Sixteen  found a series of balances which are promising for the Atlantic  alliance's future. They also largely cleared up two major  misunderstandings that could have clouded their future  relations: The action to be taken in Bosnia and opening up the  alliance to new members.    First, there is a Euro-American balance. Bill Clinton fully  recognized the political dimension of the European Union  acquired by the Maastricht Treaty and the role which the Twelve  intend to give themselves in the security and defense sphere.  Speaking of a "new spirit" in transatlantic relations, Francois  Mitterrand said: "The consent wrested from the Americans in Rome  (in 1991) with regard to recognizing the European defense  identity seemed perfectly natural in Brussels.... Distrust has  been replaced by great mutual confidence."    The U.S. President, for his part, did not seem to use this  affirmation of European identity to dissociate himself from the  "Old Continent." He promised to leave 100,000 men there -- a  sign of the strategic importance which Europe continues to have  in the Americans' view. Moreover, he seems to be really  involving himself in the fight for the continent's integration,  including Russia, and is even taking the lead in it. The  determination with which he defended his Partnership for Peace  plan clearly demonstrates this.    In this respect, too, NATO found a degree of balance between  the expectations of the Central European countries and Russia's  fears. Although the link between the Partnership and NATO  membership remains unofficial, it was reaffirmed that the  neighboring countries of Central Europe can have a fairly clear  prospect of future club membership. British Prime Minister John  Major moreover explicitly mentioned Poland, Hungary, and the  Czech Republic. That was no accident. German Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe, the most ardent advocate of NATO's expansion  within the German Government and the most skeptical about the  Partnership for Peace plan, yesterday described the summit as a  "great success" and said that it offered Germany's eastern  neighbors "a clear prospect of membership." This did not  prevent Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev from seeing it  as "a step in the right direction."    Finally, with regard to Bosnia, NATO unanimously adopted a  very measured stance. The threat of air strikes against Tuzla  and Srebrenica is a "tactical" use of the stick, mid-way between  a purely verbal threat and the risk of escalation which the  announcement of an intervention in Sarajevo could, for instance,  prompt. It is a calculated risk but one which, at least for the  time being, safeguards NATO's credibility.    Even more significantly, France and Britain, which last year  were strongly opposed to the American idea of air strikes,  rallied round to it while the United States, hitherto critical  of the Europeans' conciliatory approach, finally gave approval  to the Twelve's plan to try and secure a peace agreement.</p>

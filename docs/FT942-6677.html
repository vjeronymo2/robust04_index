			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead De La Rue, the bank note printer which ended bid talks with Portals yesterday, is expected to report strong profits growth when it announces its full-year figures on Tuesday. Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 121m are expected, up from Pounds 104.7m the previous year. The share price of Beazer Homes, which closed last night at 156p, has consistently under-performed the issue price of 165p since the company was floated in March. The next test for the shares will be on Tuesday when the company is due to announce figures for the six months to the end of March. Forecasts have been made more difficult by the company's decision to change its year-end, but the market appears to be expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m for the first six months, rising to Pounds 30m after nine. Northern Ireland Electricity, the last of the UK power companies to be privatised, is expected to announce 1994 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 81m on Wednesday, a sharp improvement on the Pounds 58m of 1992-93. The dividend payment is likely to be about 11.3p, against 10.02p last time. The City is expecting considerable growth and expansion when Granada, the leisure, television and computer services group, reports its results for the 26 weeks to April 2 on Wednesday. Last time, before the takeover of London Weekend Television, Granada had pre-tax profits of Pounds 68m. This time, analysts are expecting between Pounds 90m and Pounds 100m - which would be a considerable achievement given that little more than a month's profits will be included for LWT. Yorkshire Water, the third of the big 10 water companies to report finals this year, is expected to show an advance from Pounds 137m to about Pounds 144m on Thursday. But profits are likely to be depressed by a restructuring charge of Pounds 10m, arising largely from cost-cutting measures in the core utility business. Analysts are expecting the dividend to be pitched at between 22 and 23p. Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is expected to complete the latest round of retailers' results on Thursday with an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 406.7m to about Pounds 460m before Pounds 35m exceptional charges for the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug. MEPC, the UK's second-largest property company, is likely to announce a small decline in its profits when it announces results on Thursday. Analysts expect pre-tax figures of about Pounds 50m for the six months to end-March, compared with Pounds 52.5m, for the same period last year. The company's profits will be affected by the loss of rent from disposals made in 1992 and 1993, and a decline in the amount of interest capitalised, although it might benefit from the ending of some of the rent-free periods given to tenants in recent years.</p>

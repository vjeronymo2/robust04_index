			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / BBC urged to end recognition of unions AN END to automatic union recognition by the BBC has been suggested by one of the internal task forces on the future of the corporation. The proposal is one of the recommendations of the employers' task force which recommends that the clause in the BBC's Royal Charter providing for union recognition should be removed in the new charter which will run from the beginning of 1997. The proposals make it clear that the members of the employers' task force would like the BBC to move towards more direct negotiations with its employees. Under such a scheme BBC employees would still be able to join unions. However, those unions fear they could be derecognised for the purposes of collective bargaining. The introduction of individual personal contracts has become common in the media industries, particularly in national newspapers, in recent years. The proposals on future recognition of unions at the BBC are among those expected to be leaked by Bectu, the broadcasting union, today. The union is believed to have detailed information on all of the recommendations made by the task force. They are due to be considered next month by the BBC board of man-agement and the governors. Some individual task-force proposals have already been rejected. One committee suggested that the corporation should review the potential for contracting out of BBC services. However, Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, has said that no such policy would be implemented.</p>

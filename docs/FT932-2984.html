			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank merges US securities divisions DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's biggest banking group, announced yesterday it was combining its US securities activities into a single subsidiary, Deutsche Bank Securities. Previously, Deutsche Bank's securities operations in the US were divided between three units: the Wall Street equity research and brokerage firm C. J. Lawrence, the international securities and asset management businesses of Deutsche Bank Capital, and the treasury market primary dealership Deutsche Bank Government Securities. Under US banking and securities industry regulations, the businesses of C. J. Lawrence and Deutsche Bank Capital were kept strictly apart, preventing the German bank from co-ordinating its activities between the two units, and hindering the overall development of its securities business in the US. The new subsidiary, however, will operate under Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which allows banks to engage in corporate securities dealing and underwriting activities if revenues from these activities do not exceed 10 per cent of the company's gross US-based revenues. Mr John Rolls, Deutsche Bank chief executive officer in North America, said the reorganisation was to ensure that a co-ordinated strategy for its US securities operations could be developed under one roof. He said the regulatory restrictions involved in having two key units, DBCC and C. J. Lawrence, operate under separate banking and securities laws had been burdensome. The newly-united Deutsche Bank Securities will take aim at the rapidly expanding market in cross-border securities, underwriting, broking and dealing. It hopes to help feed the growing appetite of US investors for European securities, and benefit from the growing interest in US stocks among European investors. Mr Rolls said the US operations of Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank 100 per cent-owned by Deutsche Bank, would not be affected by the reorganisation. Deutsche Bank Securities will be based in New York, with about 500 staff. It will be run by Mr James Moltz, currently chairman and chief executive of C. J. Lawrence, and Mr Horst Risse, head of DBCC.</p>

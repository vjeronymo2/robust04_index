			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has strongly  attacked Greece's EU [European Union] partners and the Vatican.  Departing briefly from a prepared speech yesterday, he accused  them of having triggered a crisis in the Balkans, of which the  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue  was only an extension.    Addressing the organising committee for a PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] party congress later this month, Mr  Papandreou said: "We want to remind everyone that the drama of  Yugoslavia is the creation of the European Union, particularly  Germany and the Vatican...Europe should recognise that Greece is  its furthest eastern point, to understand our pending national  issues and especially our role in the Balkan region, whose  crisis has sorely tried efforts to forge a common EU foreign  policy. We Greeks know this better than anyone else."    On Skopje, Mr Papandreou stressed: "We hope the EU would  understand that we are forced to defend our national interests  the best way we can."    The premier's remarks coincided with U.S. envoy Matthew  Nimetz' return to Washington. The Greek and Skopje foreign  ministers will meet separately with UN mediator Cyrus Vance in  New York on April 11.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Cambodia is reinstated as full member of IMF THE International Monetary Fund has reinstated Cambodia as a full member and approved a Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m) loan under its Systemic Transformation Facility, designed to help once centrally planned countries make the leap to a market economy. The decision follows pledges from donor countries gathered in Washington under the chairmanship of France and Japan to pay off Cambodia's Dollars 52m arrears to the IMF. Cambodia took advantage of last week's annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington to complete negotiations on a Dollars 62.7m emergency loan from the World Bank, intended to let the country finance essential imports. A World Bank mission is to visit Cambodia next month to examine the need for infrastructure investment. But Cambodia's needs present unusual problems because of years of war.</p>

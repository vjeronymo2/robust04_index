Serbian civil policemen provoked Albanian traders and under  the pretext of non-observation of new monetary measures to help  dinar which is going bankrupt, order the closure of their shops.  As a result of these measures, 35 shops have been closed until  now in Mitrovice, five in Serbice. During the past 15 days  alone, the daily Serbian newspaper JEDINSTVO, published in  Prishtina, writes 70 Albanian private shops have been closed in  the regions which are called "Circle of Kosova."</p>

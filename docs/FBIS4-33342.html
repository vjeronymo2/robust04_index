			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero said  yesterday that as of 1 July -- when the real will replace the  real cruzeiro as legal tender -- and for an unspecified time,  one real will be worth one dollar.    The issuance of the real will be backed by part of the  Brazilian exchange reserves, which currently stand at $38  billion, considering the concept of international liquidity  (which includes both available and applied resources).    The opening of checking accounts in dollars will not be  permitted and the current rules governing the exchange of  foreign currency will be maintained. Thus, there will be no  free convertibility of the real.    Ricupero stated that the real will be backed only by  exchange  reserves, consisting of foreign currency and gold. Stocks of  state-owned companies will not be used to back the issuance of  the real. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aid pledge to US farmers MR MIKE Espy, the nominee for agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, yesterday vowed to continue export promotion and subsidies to ensure that US farmers could 'compete on a fair and equal basis' with the European Community. Speaking at his confirmation hearing before the Senate agriculture committee, he pointed to a record of six years in the House of Representatives where he supported programmes to boost US exports. The US, he said, must let its trading partners know 'we will not be pushed around'. The tough talk could not but gratify the senators. Mr Espy, the first agriculture secretary from the south, proved equally pleasing with his promise to continue the restructuring and streamlining of the Dollars 62bn-a-year US department of agriculture 'from top to bottom'. Unlike his predecessor, who was planning to consolidate field offices, he would begin the reforms in Washington. In a sometimes impassioned opening statement, Mr Espy promised to support farmer income (without saying whether or not he would raise price supports) and the poor and the 'dying' small towns of America. 'Hungry children don't just exist in Somalia,' he said. He won a rare round of applause from the onlookers. 'This may be the best time you'll ever have up here,' Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader, warned. The mood of jocularity evaporated when Mr Espy was asked about irregularities found in the book-keeping of his election campaign for the House of Representatives. 'This has caused me the most grief,' the nominee said, beginning a halting explanation of how his brother, Tom, had kept his books; Tom was not an accountant but 'just a brother'; and the Justice Department had cleared him of wrongdoing. Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican, seemed to accept the explanation, but admonished the nominee to appoint a strong, skilled administration team, so he could 'avoid being blindsided'. It was a day of warnings. Senator Ken Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, cautioned him that he was entering 'a cauldron' of competing interests - involving those who wanted higher domestic prices and those who wanted to raise the volume of exports. 'Mr Espy will come under pressure from those opposed to export-oriented farm policy,' Senator Lugar said. 'Policy changes that result in reduced exports, such as higher loan rates, the abandonment of meaningful Gatt discussions or failure to ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement would be a grave error.' As expected, Mr Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, which is endorsed by Mr Espy, urged higher loan rates.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Boxing clever to keep your title - Charles Batchelor looks at one way of limiting the damage when a customer goes bust With more than 1,200 businesses failing each week, you can be certain that some of your customers will be among them. Suppliers often take the view that there is little they can do to retrieve unpaid-for deliveries because they will be sold off or used in the business by the receiver. But there is a way to protect your interests. This is to write a 'retention of title' clause into your terms and conditions. This allows a supplier to hang on to the ownership of a consignment after it has been delivered and to reclaim the goods if the customer goes bust. Retention of title is not a new legal concept - it has been around since 1976 when what was known as the Romalpa case established new rights for suppliers - but it has been given added urgency by the present recession. This has prompted the London Chamber of Commerce to produce a guide.* 'Banks used to scoop the pool in receiverships,' says Mark Dyer, a partner in the law firm, Clifford Chance. 'There wasn't even a race. But after the Romalpa case, the odds moved in favour of suppliers.' Chemco, a supplier of photographic equipment, film and plates, has found its 'retention of title' clause useful in dealing with many of the 46 customers who went bust over the past 12 months, says Robert Kerr, financial controller. But while the clause has been useful in recovering equipment supplies, it has been less helpful in recovering deliveries of the film and printing plates, because it is less easy to identify them as having come from the Amersham-based company. The important thing about your terms of trade, including the retention of title clause, is that they are made clear to your customer before, or at the time, that the contract is made. It is not enough to print your terms on the back of invoices since these go out after the contract has been struck. Your terms need to be printed on every document you send out, from your customer contract form, through orders and invoices to delivery notes. 'Don't worry about being boring,' says Colin Wiseman, a partner in Booth White, insolvency specialists. If your terms are printed on the back of contract documents, they must be clearly signposted on the front and they must be printed large and clearly enough to be easily legible. If you have long-established customers who are not aware of your terms of trade, you should send them a copy by recorded delivery mail or with a response form to acknowledge receipt. If you supply customers in response to telephoned orders, without a written contract, you should send out a copy of your terms and make clear that all future dealings will be on that basis. If you add a retention of title clause to your terms, keep it simple. 'It is easier to pick holes in a long clause,' says Dyer. 'Receivers work by attrition. If there is anything to argue about in the clause, they will hold on to your goods.' It is important to win what the lawyers call the 'battle of the forms'. The terms of a contract are determined by the last document which is sent out. If you receive an order on your customer's order form, make sure that you return an 'acknowledgement of order' form which carries your own terms. If you hear that a customer has gone into receivership, you must let the receiver know as soon as possible that you have a retention of title clause in place. You should try to visit his premises and make an inventory of your delivery. The qualities needed to get your goods back are speed, insistence, energy and litigation, says Dyer. 'You are dealing with people whose job is to give nothing away.' If need be, the threat of an injunction or a winding up petition can be used to back your case, Dyer told a London Chamber of Commerce conference last week. If a receiver disposes of goods which he could reasonably be expected to think belonged to a supplier, he may be held personally liable. Receivers, not unnaturally, believe that this approach is too strong. 'We don't like having to hand back goods, so you must expect a fight,' says Wiseman. 'But don't back the receiver into an entrenched position. Be firm rather than nasty.' The Romalpa legislation shifted the balance of power in favour of the supplier but there are still limitations to the power of a retention clause. They are: The difficulty in applying it to service businesses. An accountant cannot take back a set of accounts and a repair business cannot undo repairs. A supplier cannot reclaim goods which have been sold on to a third party or become part of another product. He cannot get back bricks which have gone into a house or the resin that has gone into making a piece of chipboard. He may, however, be able to reclaim a large electric motor in a factory which needs only to be unbolted. You must be able to identify your goods. Chemco is considering how it might identify small deliveries of photographic paper, at present only traceable through a batch number, by means of a delivery note number. Unlike receivers, administrators have the right to ignore retention clauses. The supplier could apply to the courts for a ruling but this might cost more than the goods were worth. In theory, a retention clause allows a supplier to reclaim the value of the goods if they have been used or sold, but in practice, it has proved impossible to so. A retention of title clause is not a guarantee that you will get your goods back, but not having one is as good as a guarantee that you will be the loser. *Retention of Title Clauses.

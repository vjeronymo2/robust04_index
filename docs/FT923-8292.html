			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / A hiatus for the high-tech dream: The revolution promised by IT may be running out of steam The information technology revolution seems to be losing momentum, less than two decades after bitter competition in microchip development in the 1970s between US and Japanese electronics companies held out the promise of a new economic era. The developing technology was expected to usher in a period during which information would succeed labour and capital as the dynamo of growth. Today, electronics manufacturers, on whose products the revolution is based, are reporting declining revenues and profits and are finding it difficult to fund further developments. One-time competitors are being forced to form alliances, to pool knowledge and resources in order to create the next generation of high technology products. Development costs have become so great that no single semiconductor company is prepared to risk the investment. ng on capital equipment and R&amp;D alone for a large semiconductor company such as Intel of the US is nearly Dollars 2bn. The consequences are becoming painfully obvious. Fujitsu of Japan, for example, one of the leading companies in chip technology, warned last week that it would make its first interim loss for more than a decade. The plight of the chip makers is a watershed in the turbulent development of the 'information technology' sector. The expression was coined to describe collectively semiconductors, computing, consumer electronics and telecommunications. These industries, through their potential to influence every aspect of life, would drive the engines of the third industrial revolution in succession to steam and electricity. Since the beginning of the IT revolution, industry estimates have forecast that by 2000, the IT sector would generate Dollars 2,000bn a year in sales. Employment would be created through the formation and expansion of companies in the sector and through its effect on other businesses which use IT. Jobs created through the exploitation of IT would more than compensate for those lost through automation, it was believed. There has been little to challenge that optimistic scenario for more than 15 years. Growth in every sector of IT has been robust, sometimes explosive. Microelectronics has been the key to progress. New industries and companies have emerged as a result of the ready availability of low-cost, miniaturised electronic components. The modern facsimile machine market, for example, has grown in a few years to a value of Dollars 2bn a year in the US alone. Over the past two years, however, the broad picture has deteriorated rapidly. Many leading IT companies, among them the US computer manufacturers International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, have fallen into loss. The Japanese consumer electronics companies Sony and Matsushita are reporting sharply reduced revenues and profits. Profits at Philips of the Netherlands, Europe's biggest consumer electronics company, have fallen sharply despite a radical restructuring of the group. Overall growth in the semiconductor market this year will average less than 11 per cent; for computers, it will be about 5 per cent. For consumer electronics, growth will be flat. In mature industries, these would be unremarkable figures, but IT businesses have been used to growth of 20 per cent a year or more. The downturn has a chilling significance for high-technology industries. It indicates that in each area, the market may not be growing quickly enough to generate the cash needed to fund development of the next generation of products. According to Mr Brian Attwell of the Gartner Group, a US-based IT consultancy, unless the market grows by at least 15 per cent a year, it becomes difficult for companies to afford the level of investment necessary for successful innovation. Why has the optimism which drove the industry in the 1970s and 1980s turned sour? Can there be a return to the growth rates of earlier decades - which would seem to be necessary if the industry is to make progress? The answers are complex. The IT business is at the confluence of several separate trends which are conspiring to slow growth, drive down prices and reduce the attractiveness of IT products to customers. These include the world recession and the falling cost of semiconductors and computer hardware. Leading semiconductor manufacturers, for example, have been unable to reap the benefits of heavy capital investment in the present generation of memory chips because overcapacity has depressed prices. The price of the industry workhorse, the 4MB fast-memory chip, has fallen by 55 per cent over the past 12 months to a mere Dollars 12. There have also been moves to standard computer systems, which are intrinsically less expensive than custom-designed equipment, and a general disenchantment with electronic technology. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, sums up the position: 'I still worry enormously both about the amount we spend on IT and the increasing difficulty of justifying that expense in terms of the bottom line.' His comment explains why this recession is different from those of the past. In previous recessions, companies continued to invest in IT, especially in the US, in the belief that it would improve their efficiency and competitiveness. This time, the simple efficiencies have already been achieved and there is little faith that further investment will bring improved performance. A glance at companies in each of the major IT sectors reveals the difficulties that they face. It also shows how some 'star performers' which have focused on products with a high added value have managed to buck the trend. Semiconductors. While Japanese and Korean manufacturers - such as Fujitsu and Samsung, which make the lion's share of the world's commodity memory chips - face declining profits, Intel of the US produced record results in 1991, pushing both revenues and profits up 22 per cent. Intel is the world's largest supplier of microprocessors, the chips at the heart of most personal computers and telephone exchanges. It is profiting from its decision not to license its most advanced microprocessor technology to other manufacturers. Consumer electronics: the decline in growth at companies such as Sony, Toshiba and Philips also reflects a lack of current products with high added value. The industry is between product cycles; customers are weary of minor improvements in old products such as hi-fi and television. It will, however, be several years before the price of innovations touted to become successes on the scale of Sony's Walkman fall sufficiently to attract mass audiences. These include the digital compact cassette, the mini-disc, high-definition television (which offers cinema-quality images) and interactive video. Where a company can add value through innovation, however, it can buck the downward trend. Sharp, for example, which has developed a relatively cheap high-definition television, is almost alone among Japanese electronics companies in not having had to revise downwards its profits forecast. The computer industry is undergoing a transformation more profound than any other IT sector. Computers, especially personal computers, are falling in price by 20 per cent or more a year as microprocessors and memory chips become cheaper and competition intensifies. Manufacturers, distributors and dealers are being forced to accept narrower gross profit margins to the point where there is concern that resources will not be available to support existing products or develop new ones. Typically, margins in the computer industry have averaged between 40 and 60 per cent. In the case of personal computers, however, margins are less than 20 per cent. The problem has been intensified by a sudden slowdown in the market, which is only partly the result of the recession. It also reflects a dissatisfaction among customers with investments in IT. In a forthcoming study, Mr Carl Dahlman and Mr Ashoka Mody of the World Bank argue: 'The aggregate impact of IT on productivity performance has been disappointing.' Dr Peter Weil, author of a study on the value of IT in manufacturing, notes: 'What makes managers uneasy about IT is the lack of evidence that previous investments have generated business value.' Computer manufacturers are increasingly turning to computing services - helping their customers get the best out of their investments - to counter disenchantment with their products and to restore falling revenues. Services such as facilities management - operating a customer's computer systems - command higher gross profit margins than making computers. Telecommunications is a relatively distinct member of the IT sector. It is linked to the other electronics industries only by its prodigious use of semiconductor technology. While the growth of the other members of the IT group has been based on products, telecommunications has operated as a service operated by monopolies under strict regulation. The outlook for telecommunications is broadly encouraging. Growth will be driven by continued deregulation and the removal of state monopolies. In the competitive US market, the average person makes twice as many telephone calls as in Europe, where the authorities are only now starting to liberalise What conclusions can be drawn from the hiatus in the IT industries? First, the technologists have done a good job; the industry has moved from youth to maturity in only a few years. The revolution has not been halted, but the corporate structures of its leading players have found it difficult to respond to the rate of change. Second, there will be an increasing trend towards products and services that provide high added value, and therefore respectable profit margins, rather than the production of commodities such as memory chips and basic personal computers. There are already moves in this direction. Mr John Diebold, a US computer consultant sometimes known as the 'father of automation', has been examining new uses for IT in intelligent road systems, environmental monitoring and health care. The IT industry is like a train forced to slow unexpectedly; there is little chance of it being derailed but passengers without a handhold have been severely shaken. Without developments of the kind Mr Diebold is encouraging, it may be difficult for it to pick up speed again when the way ahead is clear. Additional reporting by Michiyo Nakamoto and Hugo Dixon.</p>

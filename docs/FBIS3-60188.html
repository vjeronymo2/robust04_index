Sinfuego] </F>   [Text] The Philippines has become a major transshipment  point for international drug trafficking because of its  proximity to the Golden Triangle, the major source of heroin and  opium in the world.    Drug trafficking in the country, particularly Metro Manila  and other urban centers, has also developed into a billion peso  mega-business, according to the Narcotics Command (Narcom) under  the Philippine National Police (PNP).    Narcom Director Ramsey Ocampo, in briefing four visiting  officers of the National Police Agency of Japan (NPAJ) at Camp  Crame yesterday, estimated that some 300 drug syndicates with  about 3,000 active members catering to about 600,000 drug users.    The NPAJ group, which is here on a drug-related police  coordinating mission is composed of Chief Superintendent Yukata  Takahena, director of the drug control division and leader of  the team, and Superintendents Osamu Murashita, Kenichi Tadokoro  and Hiroshi Sawanobon.    Senior Superintendent Ocampo described as "disturbing" the  drug trafficking situation in the country, primarily because it  has also become the major source and exporter of marijuana to  many parts of the world.    He admitted that the drug menace has remained despite the  relentless and aggressive campaign waged by the PNP and other  law-enforcement agencies as well as the active involvement of  religious and civic groups which has achieved modest success in  1993.    Ocampo told the NPAJ officers that his command shifted its  drive from street operations to a more vigorous campaign against  the druglords and pushers, resulting in the arrest of 60 big  time drug traffickers through "Operation Thunderbolt" last year.    International drug trafficking is dominated by drug  syndicates operating from Taiwan and Hong Kong which supply the  popular "shabu" [methaphetamine hydrochloride] to the Philippine  drug market.    Takahena and his group were accorded honors upon their  arrival at the PNP general headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon  City. A parade was held by a special police battalion and  Senior Superintendent Benjamin Advincula, PNP chief of protocol  and foreign liaison escorted the visitors.</p>

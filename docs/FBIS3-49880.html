According to the Prague-based newspaper  LIDOVE NOVINY today, production will halt at the refineries from  tomorrow.    According to Vladimir Krasa [name as received], head of the  Czech state company Benzina, the interruption is  "administrative." For unknown reasons, the private Russian oil  exporters have not received new export licenses from the  responsible ministries. The Czech refineries in Litvinov,  Kralupy, and Pardubice are currently working by using reserves  belonging to the Slovak firm Transpetrol. These, however, will  last four days at most. After this a crisis staff will have to  decide whether oil from the state reserves is to be used or  imported from other countries.    Krasa assumes that there will not be a crisis as the Russian  side has so far always fulfilled its obligations. Regardless of  this, both the government and the Chemapol company, which  imports 90 percent of the Czech Republic's oil, are pressing for  deliveries to be restarted.    The successors to the CSFR [Czechoslovak Federal Republic]  normally receive 82,000 tonnes of oil a day through the  "Druzhba" pipeline, of which each state receives around half.  The situation at both countries' refineries has been difficult  for around two months because of irregular supplies.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Arts: Cheers for Peter Grimes - Opera This should not be remembered simply as the year of the Glyndebourne boos. At the end of Peter Grimes a cheer went up which was as large as any heard at Glyndebourne in recent years, even if the enthusiasm of the occupants of the new standing places probably accounts for a few extra decibels. It is an irony that the most challenging of the season's five operas should be getting the most audience-friendly performance. Trevor Nunn's production, dating from 1992, is traditional down to the last stitch of the fishing nets. It has sets by John Gunter that are more like the Sadler's Wells' originals from 1945 than any other Peter Grimes of the last 20 years: one can almost smell the salt spray on its East Anglian pebble beaches. I have little doubt that Britten would have preferred it to the modern re-interpretations this year in Glasgow and London (not to mention the rest of Europe, where his operas are at last winning serious attention). But how quaint the opera seems in these pretty village sets, inhabited by the full range of amusing parochial stereotypes. When the crowd sets out on its witch-hunt ('He who despises us we'll destroy') it is hard to take them seriously, despite Nunn arming the villagers with medieval helmets and a Ku Klux Klan burning cross. At ENO, this scene was for real. One shuddered at the hatred being revealed on stage. Glyndebourne's production treats the opera more gently. In Anthony Rolfe Johnson it has the right Peter Grimes, lyrical, sensitive, at his best whenever Grimes is dreaming of the home life he longs to lead. In the duet outside the church, as he and Vivian Tierney's impressionable, young Ellen discuss their future, one senses happiness so near at hand and yet painfully out of reach. Neither she nor Alan Opie's sympathetic Balstrode are the people hardened by a cold, wind-swept, East-coast life that we usually see. In the scenes with the 'Borough' locals Nunn permits a lot of charming, old-fashioned staginess that has been banished by most of his contemporaries. John Fryatt's old woman of a Rector fusses about with flapping wrists. Yvonne Howard's Mrs Sedley is just a silly old nuisance, not malevolence wrapped in lace, and John Graham-Hall's caricature of Bob Boles as an elderly nutter never becomes a serious threat. Donald Adams is a splendid Swallow and Menai Davies a friendly Auntie with two serviceable Nieces in Paula O'Sullivan and Sarah Pring. Darren Wheeler acts naturally as the Boy. It is difficult to get David Atherton's electrifying conducting of this opera a few months ago at ENO out of one's mind, but Franz Welser-Most offers an acceptable alternative, allowing each act to build up from a gentle start to some fierce (and loud]) climaxes. The London Philharmonic played well for him. It will be interesting to see if this Britten cycle at Glyndebourne is to progress further. Further performances until August 25</p>

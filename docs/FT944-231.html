			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Research spending at DTI lowest for a decade The Department of Trade and Industry is spending less on research and development than at any time for at least a decade. Figures released by the department this month show that its R&amp;D expenditure is about to fall to Pounds 245m in the present financial year from an estimated Pounds 310m in 1993-94 and about Pounds 500m a year in the late 1980s. R&amp;D spending is expected to account for just 17.8 per cent of total departmental expenditure in 1994-95, down from 23 per cent in 1993-94 and more than 33 per cent at its peak in 1987-88. Labour pounced on the figures, saying they made a 'farce' of the government's claims to be a supporter of British manufacturing and innovation. Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour frontbench trade and industry spokesman, said nobody but the government believed cutting support for R&amp;D made sense. 'In our competitor countries, R&amp;D is regarded as essential investment rather than an easy target for spending cuts,' he said. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, said he was 'very concerned' about the downward trend which 'we ignore it at our peril'. 'If we are going to claim to be competitive, then clearly we have got to invest in R&amp;D and have good technology transfer,' he said. He said he had asked Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, to answer questions from the committee on the competitiveness of UK manufacturers. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the decline in R&amp;D spending reflected fluctuations in the amount of aid provided by the government in civil aerospace investment over the period in question. In the first half of the decade, launch aid payments far outstripped receipts, Mr Heseltine said. That situation had now been reversed. From Pounds 32.9m in 1992-93, launch aid payments are expected to fall to an estimated Pounds 4.6m in 1993-94, Pounds 6.6m in 1994-95, Pounds 25.3m in 1995-96 and Pounds 8.4m in 1996-97. The government's net receipts, which it gets once projects reach a certain production stage, were an estimated Pounds 58.1m in 1993-94 and are budgeted to rise to Pounds 80.9m by 1996-97. Mr Heseltine said there had also been a 'substantial' cut in energy R&amp;D spending. He said the principal factor was the decision to withdraw from research on the prototype fast nuclear reactor at Dounreay. Mr Wilson retorted that if support fell off in one area, such as the Dounreay reactor, it was 'reasonable to expect a boost in some other needful area'.</p>

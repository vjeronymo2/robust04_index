			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (6): An emphasis on partnership - Facilities management used to be a relatively simple idea - but not any more / Facilities management IN the 1960s, 1970s and even early 1980s computers were so expensive that companies could easily cut costs by 20 per cent or more by contracting out the processing of their business systems. In addition, the systems were well-suited to such arrangements. They were fed with details of transactions, such as orders and payments, and printed reams of reports, cheques and payslips. But the dramatic fall in the cost of computing power and the development of fast and reliable telecommunications services have cut the price of the equipment, put business people on-line to information and inspired them to new thinking about ways to exploit information technology. And these developments have raised totally new approaches to facilities management. Many traditional contracts lasting five years or more are still being signed: UK market leader Hoskyns, for example, has won orders from the likes of Prudential and Woolworths in the last year. The Inland Revenue is now examining tenders for a contract put at Pounds 300m and covering 2,000 staff working at 16 data centres. In such contracts a service supplier takes over a company's central computer and the computing staff. The service usually eventually moves away from the customer's premises. The supplier makes much of its profit from its skills in running the maximum of processing work on the minimum of equipment. In this sort of arrangement the supplier usually takes on the maintenance of the customer's programs. This is especially so now that companies are using facilities management increasingly to keep their old systems running while they introduce new systems, typically based on smaller, networked machines installed in business departments. Customers and suppliers generally agree on the benefits of traditional facilities management arrangements. Studies by research firm Romtec and service supplier CMG show that users see the biggest benefits as being a guaranteed service at a fixed cost, known well in advance, and the fact that they are freed to concentrate on their core business. However, the falling costs of mainframe computers and the fact that customers are looking at facilities management as a temporary measure while they move to new systems mean suppliers are having to rethink their approach to the business. The 50 per cent annual market growth of the 1980s is now down to less than 20 per cent. Meanwhile more suppliers are going for facilities management business: leading computer manufacturers such as IBM see much of their future in services rather than equipment sales; and companies with big computing set-ups are looking to the external market: Barclays Bank is a recent example. 'It's a very competitive market now and some suppliers are taking a long view,' says Mr Jon Whiteley, a consultant at Romtec. 'They are looking at making a profit only after three or four years, for example from new development work.' A note of caution is sounded here by Mr Gary Shepherd of service supplier AT&amp;T Istel and chairman of the Computing Services Association's facilities management committee. 'There are thought to be 150 companies in this business now and there are some very poor deals being made, with users just looking at cost cutting and suppliers taking very low margins,' he says. 'This isn't doing the client, the supplier or the industry any good. 'These days the main suppliers are talking to customers more about partnerships, where we work together on long-term strategy and where there might be a sharing of the risk and the rewards.' Pioneering deals are certainly appearing. BP Exploration has signed agreements with service specialist Sema and British Telecom under which the suppliers win or lose depending on their performance. 'We only make a very small profit if we meet BP's targets for cost savings but we share the rewards if we beat them,' says Sema director Mr Paul Hopkins. 'We also stand to lose money if fail to meet the targets.' All suppliers now talk of partnerships with customers rather than service contracts. Indeed, contracts are being negotiated on new terms. Computer Sciences Corporation has entered an 11-year agreement with BhS under which it will take over the company's computing and 115 staff but also work with it to sell the combined expertise of the two organisations to the retail industry. EDS is going even further. The company is now signing contracts under which it will take on system development at no cost. But in return it takes a percentage of the business gains made by the customer. Its first contract of this type in Europe is in Sweden with retail group Kooperativa Forbundet (KF), which EDS expects to be worth a massive Dollars 1bn over the next 10 years. The contract involves a traditional facilities management arrangement, which KF is paying for at normal market rates, under which EDS is taking over KF's existing computing and 530 staff. But it also involves an agreement for the two companies to work together on a new information technology strategy for KF. 'We have a basic contract but the real incentive for us is to improve the way information technology supports KF's business,' says Mr Tom Butler, managing director of EDS-Scicon, the UK operation. 'People look at facilities management in terms of reducing computing costs. Cutting those costs by 10 per cent looks good - but it's very little compared with the savings from, say, cutting your stock turnover from eight days to three. With this sort of contract we're saying we'll put our money where our mouth is and do that for you in return for a percentage of your savings.' The terms of the agreement with KF are not revealed but the partners are looking initially at the potentially lucrative areas of automated money transfer and credit cards. Tom Butler expects this type of contract to account for 70 per cent of EDS' growth in the next three to five years. So the company which invented facilities management in the 1960s looks set to take it on to a new plane in the 1990s.                          *      *      * BENEFITS OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT Frees managers to focus on the company's core business: 77 per cent. Provides greater financial control: 48 per cent. Moves IT from capital to expense item: 33 per cent. Reduces the operational risk: 24 per cent. Provides a strategic partner: 22 per cent. Provides a competitive advantage: 12 per cent. Source: CMG.</p>

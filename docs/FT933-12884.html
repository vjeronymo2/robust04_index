			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Lottery launched with Dollars 10m first prize MR STEFAN Mandel, the man who mastermined a controversial Dollars 27m win in the US Virginia Lottery last year, yesterday launched what he claimed was the world's richest lottery. Mr Mandel announced in London that Globalot, a consortium of private investors of which he is chairman, had been awarded a 50-year licence to run an international lottery by Gibraltar. The lottery, which will be drawn every three months, will have a first prize of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.66m), five second prizes of Dollars 1m each, 10 third prizes of Dollars 500,000 each as well as 20 prizes of Dollars 50,000 and 5,000 free tickets for the next lottery. Higher first prizes such as the recent Dollars 100m prize in the US result from the rolling over of jackpots. Mr Mandel said that his lottery would not compete with low-ticket-price lotteries such as that being launched in the UK next year. Tickets would cost Dollars 100 and be bought directly from Globalot in Gibraltar by bank draft or credit card. Unlike the UK national lottery, where proceeds will go to good causes such as charities, the arts, and sport, only 5 per cent of the proceeds of the Globalot lottery will go to unnamed charities. Advertising such a lottery is against the law in the UK and a number of other European countries so Globalot will advertise in specialist media  - such as international flight magazines. A total of 300,000 tickets will be on sale for each of the Gibraltar lotteries. Mr Mandel, an Australian accountant, caused a sensation last year when he put together a syndicate of more than 2,500 businessmen, each investing Dollars 8,000, to use his system for winning lotteries. The syndicate spent a total of Dollars 20m on tickets in Virginia to win a Dollars 27m prize. Mr Mandel said: 'They made a 30 per cent profit and they have still got their initial investment.'</p>

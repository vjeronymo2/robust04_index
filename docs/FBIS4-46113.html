			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Cortes and Luis Jimenez] </F>   [Excerpt] Cortes: The explosion took place  exactly 800 meters from the Plaza Paitilla Inn on Via Italia.  This happened at approximately 0820 [1320 GMT] this morning.  Information gathered by RPC Radio from PTJ [Judicial Technical  Police] agents reveals that the person wounded is Colombian Adan  Schwartz. He was seriously injured. His car was parked outside  the Tamaco Building.    Jimenez, interrupting: The Tamanaco Building.    Cortes: Excuse me -- the Tamanaco Building, where  he lives. This is where Colombian citizen Adan Schwartz lives.  He was injured and taken to Paitilla Hospital.    On 13 May, Mr. Schwartz witnessed a kidnapping attempt in  this same building. It seems the kidnappers were constantly  following him. Last night, they managed to place a bomb in the  rear of his car, a Cherokee four-wheel drive vehicle. It is a  blue vehicle with brown molding on the sides and the license  plate 521054.    It is worth noting that he was being tailed because he had  witnessed a kidnapping. The kidnappers felt he gave some  information to the PTJ linking them to a kidnapping attempt in  the Tamanaco Building in the Punta Paitilla area. [sentence as  heard]    This is the part of the information we have been able to  gather in the area of Punta Paitilla. The National Police are  still cordoning off the area. Another vehicle was also damaged  as a result of the explosion. By the way, a black Cherokee  four-wheel drive vehicle was behind the vehicle that exploded.  Some shrapnel also hit nearby homes.    This is what is happening. The National Police are still  investigating the incident and promise to provide details later.    We should also note that the driver of the black Cherokee  who  was driving behind the car that exploded this morning was  unhurt, although the vehicle was badly damaged. The driver is a  Jewish citizen. We tried to talk to him -- this man who  witnessed everything -- but he refused to comment.    Jimenez: In terms of the injured, we first learned  one person was injured in the explosion. Later, we were  informed someone else was injured.    Cortes: This is what we have. We talked to some  witnesses, and one told us that he was walking nearby when he  heard the blast. When he turned around, he saw someone exiting  the vehicle. It seems this person was seriously wounded. This  is what the witness said. [passage omitted]</p>

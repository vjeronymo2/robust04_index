			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Management: To Russia with no love lost - Andrew Jack reports on a gulf of misunderstandings The recent political upheavals in Russia have added to the uncertainty about the future of western investment in eastern Europe. But ask corporate executives in the west about joint ventures in eastern Europe and they are as bullish as ever. Ask their managers on the ground - let alone their eastern partners - and the view is different. After several years of experience of east-west joint ventures, many companies have had their expectations dashed, according to a survey from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the international accountancy network. Western managers in headquarters of companies with joint ventures said they would recommend them. But only two-fifths of their eastern partners and one-third of their own managers based in the east agreed. Deloitte interviewed more than 168 companies with joint ventures or direct foreign investment in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Russia. The key business problems identified in the east were the banking system, telecommunications, fiscal laws and lack of market data. The most significant staffing problems were management and language skills, followed by the absence of the profit motive, salaries and the work ethic. Eastern partners consistently rated these less important hindrances than western partners. Western managers complained about their partners' lack of understanding of the western way of doing business and the lack of finance; easterners said the westerners lacked understanding of local conditions and had excessive short-term expectations of profit. Part of the difference may be explained by their varied objectives. Eastern partners said they entered joint ventures mainly to gain access to new products and capital. Westerners rated local market knowledge and access as most important. Based on its survey, Deloitte highlights four factors to help successful investment in eastern Europe: PEOPLE: Select staff who can understand different cultures; who are patient, flexible and tolerant and who know the language. Hire local people with good basic skills and the ability to be trained, not on 'relevant experience'. FINANCE: Expect only long-term returns. Do not depend on local finance. Phase investment and keep fixed costs low, given the uncertain future of the region. LOCAL ENVIRONMENT: Identify people who can track legal and regulatory changes, who are familiar with the local public sector and banking system and can find suppliers and sources. MARKET: Adapt to local demands and cultural differences in brand and product perceptions. The only way to sustain sales may be through export markets. Some Russian experts recently questioned whether imported management expertise is always relevant to the challenge of restructuring Russian industry, writes Jane Goodsir. Consultants attending a recent conference of the International Organisation Development Association in Coventry agreed that partnerships between Russian and foreign consultancies were the most effective approach in Russia. Delegates also suggested that in future western consultants might take on the new role of 'coaching' Russian consultants, rather than dominating consultancy projects. Nikhail Albertjian, a Moscow academic and consultant, said Russian clients were showing less deference to western experts. 'Russian managers still think that western consultants have much to offer, but they're no longer seen as gods. As human beings, they have failings.' The work of 'expert' strategy consultants is still valued and respected, however. And there is great demand for practical solutions to immediate implementation problems. But Russians distrust slogans and respond badly to consultants who work with collective 'mission' and 'vision' approaches. Cultural differences between western consultants and their Russian counterparts can hinder partnerships. Reijer van Vegten, a director of the German-based Mercurius Consulting, believes Russian consultants are strong on theory but are often self-promoting and need better practical skills. A 'Business Cultures Bridge' project, co-ordinated by the Academy of National Economy aims to develop partnership work between Russian and western consultants. A workshop is planned in Moscow next summer. Workshop details from: Academy of National Economy, 82 Vernadsky Avenue, 117571, Moscow.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / N Sea oil and gas projects approved THE Department of Energy yesterday gave the go-ahead for two North Sea projects, worth a total of Pounds 2.4bn: the development of a new oilfield and the construction of a gas pipeline system. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, said the announcements were a 'positive indicator of the continuing potential of the UK continental shelf'. He announced the approval of the Alba oilfield, which will be developed by Chevron, the UK arm of the US oil company, at a cost of about Pounds 1.3bn. He also approved the Pounds 1bn-plus construction of a gas-gathering system by a joint venture headed by Amoco, the UK exploration arm of the US company, to transport gas to Teesside in north-east England. The Alba oilfield has an estimated 400m-plus barrels of recoverable oil but is complex and difficult to drill. The field is scheduled to start production by 1994 to reach peak output of 100,000 barrels a day by the end of the decade, when the field's second facility comes on stream. Mr Charles Smith, managing director of Chevron UK, said he believed Alba to be one of the largest oilfields that remain to be developed in the UK sector. The Amoco gas pipeline system, which should be complete by 1993, will take gas for the first time into the UK's industrial heartland at Teesside. It will supply the proposed Enron power station project, planned by ICI and a group of four regional electricity companies, but could be extended to serve other industrial customers. The pipeline system will transport 300m cu ft of gas a day from Amoco's Everest and Lomond gas fields. Its 1.4bn cu ft daily capacity would allow it to take gas from other fields. Other partners in the project include Gas Council Exploration, Amerada Hess, British Gas, Phillips Petroleum, Fina Exploration and Agip.</p>

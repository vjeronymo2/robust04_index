			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD;  </P> <P> DEES WINS, FUELS U.S. TO VICTORY IN INDOOR MEET  </P> <P> Tony Dees equaled the second-fastest time of the year in the 60-meter high  hurdles, leading the United States to victory over Britain and the Soviet Union  in an indoor track and field meet Sunday.  </P> <P> Dees' time of 7.46 seconds matched Greg Foster's mark and was three-hundredths  of a second off the year's best of 7.43 by Britain's Colin Jackson.  </P> <P> Jackson didn't compete Sunday because of a hip injury and Dees took advantage.  He led from the first hurdle in his final indoor race of the season.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to run that fast because I've been off for three weeks," Dees  said. "I only started training again when I got here. I strained my hamstring  in our national championships."  </P> <P> Dees, who has beaten Foster and two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom this  season, said the indoor season was merely a stepping stone to his 1990 goal.  </P> <P> "I want Roger's 110-meter outdoor world record," Dees said. "Beating them all  is no big thing now. It seems like everyone is trying to get a world record,  and I'm part of that plan."  </P> <P> Dees' performance was the highlight of a low-key meet the Americans won with  121 points. Britain had 100, and the Soviet Union, using mostly  second-stringers, had 93.  </P> <P> Michael Johnson, two-time national collegiate champion from Baylor, was upset  in the 200-meter dash by Britain's Marcus Adam, but was satisfied with his  second-place time of 21.19.  </P> <P> "I'm not disappointed," Johnson said. "The climax of my season was the national  championships and the NCAA championships.  </P> <P> "I just came over to have a good time, but I feel like I did my best. Had I  been in another lane, I may have run a faster time. Lane two gave me a lot of  trouble on the first turn."  </P> <P> Guy Kochel, coach of the U.S. team, said of Dees and Johnson: "Barring injury,  you're going to see great things from both of them. And not just those two. Our  youngsters will be as good as what we've had in the past."  </P> <P> The proof, he said, will come at the Barcelona Olympics.  </P> <P> "Everything we are doing this year is preparation for the 1992 Olympics,"  Kochel said.  </P> <P> Olympic 100-meter silver medalist Linford Christie of Britain ended his indoor  season by winning the 60-meter dash.  </P> <P> Christie, who missed the record by one-hundredth of a second at Athens  recently, suffered a stomach illness Saturday and decided to run only at the  last minute. After three false starts by other sprinters, Christie was timed in  6.59, nine-hundredths of a second off the record.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I'd even make it to the track," Christie said. "But the public  paid a lot of money to watch me run."  </P></p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Hurd holds the line against isolationists BRITAIN'S foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, yesterday set out the thinking behind Mr John Major's decision to press ahead with ratification of Maastricht by warning that failure meet the commitment would deprive Britain of vital political and economic influence. In a speech approved in advance by the British prime minister as a formal statement of government policy, Mr Hurd warned his party's Eurosceptics that the government would not bow to isolationist calls. He signalled that although the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty might not return to the House of Commons until next year, ratification would not have to wait for the outcome of a second referendum in Denmark: 'We want to help the Danes, not hide behind them.' Speaking to the European Policy Forum in London last night, Mr Hurd sought to allay fears that Maastricht would provide the blueprint for a European super-state. He confirmed that a commitment to give substance to the clause in the treaty on the principle of subsidiarity would be a priority at this month's EC summit in Birmingham. The Twelve needed to show their citizens that in practice 'the Community, so far from smothering national identity, builds on the work of nation states, that national parliaments are crucial to the democratic control of the Community, that none of us wants a bureaucratic centralised homogenised Europe'. He played down concern about a two-speed Europe, commenting: 'In fact we already have a multi-speed Europe and no harm done.' However, Mr Hurd insisted that the government had to stick to a principle which had run through the heart of British foreign policy through the centuries: 'It is against our fundamental interests so to isolate ourselves from the continent of Europe that policies are organised there which crucially influence our security or our prosperity but in which we have no say.' In a sideswipe at the Eurosceptics he added: 'If that happens, we keep our sovereignty as a slogan, and lose its substance.' The foreign secretary signalled that the government would not scrap its commitment to eventual re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. Despite indications that Mr Major believes that it will be more than a year  -and perhaps as long as two - before sterling can again be linked to the D-Mark, Mr Hurd suggested that abandonment of the ERM would threaten in the medium term to 'drain the strength away from our own financial sector'. He marked the start of a campaign by the government to rebut what it sees as the scare tactics of opponents of the treaty by insisting that Maastricht was 'by no means as revolutionary' as the Rome Treaty or the Single European Act. The intergovernmental basis of the latest treaty meant that 'under Maastricht co-operation will develop, but with national governments firmly in the driving seat'. He dismissed the notion that the concept of 'union citizenship in the treaty threatened national indentities'. He concluded that 'as applied to Britain its (the treaty's) substance is neither miraculously splendid nor destructive of national identity'. But without the agreement it would be much harder for Britain to ensure that its agenda for Europe - full implementation of the single market, freer trade with the rest of the world and enlargement - remained the EC's priorities. 'We are winning the arguments. Now is not the time to knock over the table.'</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Target for inflation 'in jeopardy' THE GOVERNMENT'S target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent 'may be exceeded' next year as a result of sterling's devaluation and the recent loosening in monetary policy, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research says in its latest quarterly review, published yesterday. The institute is fairly confident about a recovery, projecting economic growth next year of 2 per cent after a contraction of 0.7 per cent this year. But it says unemployment is likely to continue rising - to peak above 3m in the second half of next year - with the south-east continuing to suffer large job losses. An early downturn in unemployment - which the institute expects to stay above 2.5m until the end of the decade - is likely only in the north of England and Wales. Pay pressures can be expected to re-emerge as demand rises next year. That will be because of the 'deeply entrenched' inflationary psychology in the UK, the institute explains. That will give an impetus to inflationary pressures, which are generally subdued at present. The institute believes the gross domestic product deflator - often regarded as the best way of measuring underlying inflation - might rise by about 4.75 per cent in 1993 and more than 5 per cent in 1994, with the prices of imported goods and services increasing by more than 9 per cent next year. That might place at risk the government's desire to see underlying inflation  -as measured by the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index less mortgage payments - kept between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. While the cuts in bank base rates from 10 per cent to 7 per cent since September will help consumer and business demand, confidence is likely to gain strength only slowly, partly because of the continued difficulties in servicing high debts. The institute expects unemployment in the south-east to continue to climb in the next year, to reach nearly 1m by the end of 1993. Total UK unemployment is 2.87m. Like the south-east, the south-west and East Anglia are likely to suffer rising unemployment for most of next year, because of the concentration of service industry and the effects of high debts and large falls in house prices. Northern regions have been spared the worst effects of the recession, with more moderate falls in house prices. Because of the higher concentration of manufacturing industry in those areas, they should benefit from the increased competitiveness of British goods overseas, arising from the 13 per cent devaluation of sterling after its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16. By the end of next year, the proportion of the workforce registered as jobless in the three 'super-regions' of Britain - the north, central regions and the south-east - will have converged to within about half a percentage point of each other at between 10 per cent and 11 per cent. That would contrast with the position six years ago, when the three regions had widely differing rates of unemployment - 14 per cent, 11 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. High long-term unemployment should be regarded as a national issue 'with deep-seated roots', the institute says. Sterling's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism will, according to the institute, consign Britain to the 'outer circle' of Europe economic affairs for some time. Before the UK makes any attempt to join the inner core, based on France and Germany, public support for the concept of economic and monetary union should be tested with a referendum.

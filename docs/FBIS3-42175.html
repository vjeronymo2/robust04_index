Getachew Mulat, 25, a native of the Ethiopian province of  Gojan and a Coptic Christian, told authorities after he  surrendered that he had been an Army officer under the regime of  Mengistu Haile-Mariam and belonged to a rival clan of the ruling  power in Addis Ababa. He accused the current regime of Zenawi  Meli of being "a dictatorship that had stripped Ethiopians of  their freedom."    Getachew hijacked the Ethiopian Airlines flight 972 heading  from Dakar to Addis Ababa, with stops in Bamako and Niamey,  shortly after it took off Saturday at 8:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) and  ordered it flown to Rome. Witnesses on board said he was armed  with a switchblade but never threatened any of the 32 passengers  and was calm throughout the entire episode. He repeatedly  insisted on being flown to Rome, where there is a large  Ethiopian community, and said he would surrender on landing.  True to his word, Getachew gave himself up shortly after the  plane touched down at Ciampino Airport near Rome at 3:30 a.m.  (0230 GMT).    Authorities said they allowed the aircraft to land as it  only  had enough fuel left for 10 more minutes of flying. Getachew  was immediately taken in for questioning and was to be charged  with hijacking.    Addis Alam, the Ethiopian ambassador in Rome who spoke with  Getachew, described him as a desperate man. "He claimed to have  committed this act for political reasons and not as a militant  act for a specific organisation," Addis said. Authorities who  questioned Getachew said he appeared to be very religious and  wore a wooden cross around his neck. They said he also carried  several Copt religious books in his suitcase.    Five Ethiopians, also seeking political asylum, hijacked an  Ethiopian Airlines plane to Rome in August 1992. They were  sentenced to four and a half years in prison. No one was hurt  in the 1992 hijacking.</p>

TSE Magistrate Eduardo Colindres told ACAN-EFE at the voting  sites [colegios electorales] "the police are tasked with looking  after the people's safety, and I can assure you the Army is not  there."    Shortly after the general elections started today in El  Salvador, Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the leftist  coalition, which comprises former guerrillas and the Social  Democracy, claimed soldiers were present in seven countryside  towns, although this is banned by the Electoral Law.    Francisco Flores, deputy candidate for the ruling  Nationalist  Republican Alliance (right-wing ARENA), also told ACAN-EFE there  is no military presence in the countryside but added certain  policemen are clad in olive-green uniforms, and this makes them  resemble soldiers. Flores said "this does not imply an Army  presence."    At least 2.5 million Salvadorans will elect today, in the  first elections since the civil war ended, a new president and  vice president, 84 deputies to the Legislative Assembly, 262  municipal mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central American  Parliament (Parlacen).    The TSE, government, political parties, and UN observers  have  reported the elections have progressed normally so far, without  any serious incidents.</p>

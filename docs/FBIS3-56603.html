The letter, addressed to the Polish president, the prime  minister, the foreign minister and the Polish parliament's  speaker, appeared in the Lithuanian press last week. The 72  demand that Poland observe 5 principles when signing an  agreement on friendship and cooperation with Lithuania. The  agreement has been under negotiation since last summer.    In its statement, the Polish ministry assures lawmakers that  it is no less concerned about the interests of Poles in  Lithuania than the Polish parliament. According to the  statement, the Polish Foreign Ministry holds that Lithuanian  Poles must be guaranteed equal rights in Lithuania.    As previously reported, 72 Polish lawmakers, mainly members  of the parliamentary majority, demanded to create a cultural  autonomy of the predominantly Polish-populated Vilnius and  Salcininkai regions, to return nationalized property to Polish  social organizations, to exclude history from the main agreement  with Lithuania, etc.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (9): Klestil shocks Austrians as president MR THOMAS KLESTIL, the former austere and thoughtful head of Austria's diplomatic service, has surprised most Austrians by becoming an extremely affable and outgoing president. According to one recent opinion poll, he has displaced Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, as the country's most popular public figure. Mr Klestil succeeded the unfortunate Mr Kurt Waldheim in early July after an unexpected election victory. He was Austrian ambassador to the US from 1982 to 1987 - it was noted in his presidential campaign brochures that he knew US president George Bush as George. Mr Klestil has put his prestige and popularity behind the campaign to win public support for EC entry.</p>

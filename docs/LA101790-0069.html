			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL WILL AMEND GENERAL PLAN TO ADD HOPE'S LAND;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY: THE CITY TAKES STEPS TOWARD ANNEXING THE PROPERTY. THE PROCESS OF  ALTERING THE DOCUMENT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE TWO YEARS.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council has voted to authorize its staff to begin amending  its General Plan to include Bob Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch, located in an  unincorporated area south of the city.  </P> <P> A General Plan amendment, which could take up to two years to complete, is  necessary before the city can apply to annex Hope's property, where a 750-house  development and tournament golf course are planned.  </P> <P> Hope and Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option to buy the Jordan  Ranch, have asked Simi Valley to annex the ranch property because of fears that  the Ventura County Board of Supervisors would reject the proposed subdivision.  </P> <P> "Somebody needs to take a look at this project," Mayor Greg Stratton said at  the council meeting Monday night. "If nobody else is going to, then I think  Simi Valley has an obligation to look at it."  </P> <P> Councilman Glen McAdoo said the Hope proposal provided the city and the county  with an opportunity to acquire and preserve thousands of acres of open space.  If annexation and the Jordan Ranch development are approved, Hope has promised  to sell and donate 5,700 acres in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains  to park agencies for a below-market $10 million.  </P> <P> The rest of the council agreed with McAdoo and so did the majority of the more  than 20 speakers who commented on the issue during a two-hour public hearing. A  few speakers, however, argued that the Jordan Ranch project would have  regionwide effects on air quality and traffic and that its fate should be  decided by the County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> Council members admitted that there are a number of obstacles that may  ultimately prevent annexation of Jordan Ranch. But they stressed that the  decision to go forward with a General Plan amendment would help determine if  annexation is worth pursuing. It would not commit the city to the proposal.  </P> <P> Although she said she supported the city's decision to pursue a General Plan  amendment, Councilwoman Vicky Howard said she felt that there was little chance  the Local Agency Formation Commission would allow the city to annex the Hope  property.  </P> <P> Howard, who is a member of LAFCO, said the main reason the commission would  probably reject the annexation proposal is that the Jordan Ranch subdivision  does not follow Ventura County's Guidelines for Orderly Development, which  requires development to be clustered in or near cities.  </P> <P> Howard said Simi Valley is separated from the ranch site by a mountain range  that would make it difficult to provide some city services to the area.  </P> <P> But she said it is possible that those problems could be worked out and that  the Hope proposal deserves further study.  </P> <P> The city has asked LAFCO for an early ruling on the annexation proposal, and  the panel is scheduled to hear the matter today. However, LAFCO Director Bob  Braitman has said he will ask the commission to delay any decision until Nov.  21.  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Council tendering gives 'average saving of 6.5%' COMPULSORY competitive tendering by local authorities in England has yielded an average cut in costs of 6.5 per cent, research by the Department of the Environment shows. Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, told a seminar at Oxford University that the main findings, to be published next week by the University of Birmingham's Institute of Local Government, 'proved the success of CCT so far'. The department said the findings mean the average authority had made savings of Pounds 500,000. Mr Baldry said: 'Where they existed, inefficient working practices have been exposed and tackled. CCT prompted authorities to review services and standards - sometimes for the first time.' The figures are similar to those of the Audit Commission, published in March, which estimated a reduction of 7 per cent in the cost of contracted services. The research by Birmingham University is less optimistic than that produced last week by Dr Stefan Szymanski of the London Business School. He found that competitive tendering produced an average cost saving for refuse-collection contracts of 27 per cent. Birmingham's research covers all blue-collar services - including building cleaning, street cleaning, catering, ground maintenance, vehicle-fleet management, and sport and leisure management as well as refuse collection. It includes the administrative costs of managing the contracts, unlike Mr Szymanski's research. Mr Keiron Walsh, who wrote the Birmingham report, said savings varied widely between different types of authorities and between services. Refuse collection had seen some of the greatest savings. He suggested that the savings could not be explained by technological improvements, such as the introduction of wheel-bins for refuse collection, because in all cases the comparison was made between the years immediately before and immediately after the contracting out of services.</p>

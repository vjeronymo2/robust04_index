			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Loss of lustre in the golden state: California's economic dynamism is being tested by recession, budget deficits and social pressures With a drink in his hand and a spectacular view of the sun setting over the Golden Gate bridge behind him, Mr Peter Schwartz ticks off the advantages of San Francisco bay: near perfect climate, stunning scenery and one of the world's most vital intellectual communities. A former head of strategic planning at Shell in London, Mr Schwartz now lives in a spacious home in the hills above Berkeley and runs his own consulting company, Global Business Network. 'This is not utopia,' he says, 'but it is the wealthiest place on earth where people have the highest aspirations.' Don't pay too much attention to press reports predicting the end of the Californian dream, he warns. 'This state will always reinvent itself.' As an enthusiast for California, Mr Schwartz is in good company. After decades of effortless growth, the state's economy is larger than that of all but seven nations. The population is 30m, having grown by more than a quarter during the 1980s. As immigrants swarm in, the number of Californians is set to rise by a further 6m in the 1990s. Yet the Golden state's capacity to realise its citizens' dreams is being doubted as never before: Jolted by the worst recession since the 1930s, Californians are questioning the long-run competitiveness of the state's economy; The second year of budget crisis points to a basic incompatibility between Californians' demand for public services and their reluctance to pay taxes. Failure to agree a way to cut the prospective Dollars 11bn deficit means the state will almost certainly begin the new financial year tomorrow without a budget. In the aftermath of the Los Angeles riot, the state's ability to assimilate immigrants and bridge a growing divide between rich and poor is in doubt. Whether measured by jobs, income or spending, California's recession is more severe than the nation's. The state's gross domestic product, for example, fell 3.4 per cent last year compared with 0.7 per cent in the US as a whole. Employment has contracted by more than 600,000, or about 5 per cent, more than twice the US rate of decline. The national economy is growing, sluggishly. In California, by contrast, few definite signs of recovery are discernible. 'This trough is so deep,' says the state department of finance, 'that employment may not return to the pre-recession peak until late 1993 or early 1994.' Is California experiencing more than just a cyclical downturn? Mr Bob Arnold, a veteran forecaster at the Centre for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, remains optimistic. He says the depth of the downturn is fully explained by three factors: national recession, defence cuts and sharp retrenchment in commercial real estate. The ill effects, moreover, are mostly being felt in the Los Angeles basin, which accounts for 80 per cent of the job losses. He points out that defence spending as a share of state output is less than 8 per cent compared with 14 per cent in 1967. Since California adjusted successfully to defence cuts following the Vietnam war, it should absorb today's cuts relatively easily. Indeed, he claims clean-air legislation will lead to greater economic disruption than will the loss of Pentagon contracts. Sceptics, however, worry that public policy is much less supportive of growth than in the past. After the second world war, says Mr Bruce Cain, a political scientist at the University of California's Berkeley campus, the state created the world's finest system of publicly financed higher education, built an unrivalled network of highways and turned semi-deserts into fertile farmland by investing heavily in water infrastructure. The trouble is that belief in public goods rapidly dissolved. As people moved into the state in large numbers during the 1980s, public services deteriorated. Californians now face rationing of water, cuts in higher education and chronic congestion in some urban areas. The quality of life and economic efficiency are both threatened. Many businessmen claim the public sector is impeding rather than facilitating growth. The charge is made most eloquently in a recent stinging critique of public policy by a council on competitiveness set up by Republican governor Pete Wilson. Led by Mr Peter Ueberroth, the businessman appointed by President George Bush to oversee the reconstruction of riot-torn Los Angeles, the council claims that companies are being 'discouraged, harassed, shut down and driven off'. It says corporate migration to states such as Idaho, Nevada and Utah reflects a 'regulatory quagmire that overwhelms small and medium-sized business managers'. So far only a trickle of companies is leaving the state. But there is truth in the Ueberroth committee's claim that poorly implemented public policies are impeding economic growth. Does southern California, for example, really need 72 agencies to oversee environmental controls? The casual visitor to Sacramento, the attractive seat of state government, would hardly guess that California also faces chronic budgetary problems. The restored State Capitol stands serenely in a park dotted with cedars, elms and cypresses. Inside, officials are frantically looking for ways to eliminate a projected deficit of Dollars 11bn, which is equivalent to almost 20 per cent of revenue. The scale of the deficit came as a cruel shock because Mr Wilson supposedly resolved budgetary problems last year with a Dollars 7bn tax increase, the largest in US state history. The immediate cause of the deficit is a collapse in revenue growth. But the state finance department draws attention to adverse demographic trends. In the 1980s rapid population growth was manageable because the fastest-growing group was taxpayers aged 18-64. The 1990s look very different because the number of children aged five to 17 is expected to jump by 40 per cent, far outweighing the growth of the tax-paying population. The surge in the number of children - many from minority groups - critically affects the budget, because four-fifths of spending goes to education, health and welfare. The state expects welfare cases to more than double during this decade, and forecasts a 60 per cent rise in the numbers receiving subsidised health care. With 100 languages spoken in Californian schools and a majority of pupils in many areas from disadvantaged backgrounds, the cost of special educational services is soaring. The Republican state government is in a fiscal straitjacket, largely as a result of voters' refusal to face reality. In 1978 Proposition 13 halved property taxes and left the state precariously dependent on income and sales taxes. A decade later the public voted for Proposition 98, which effectively dictates that education spending rises in line with enrolment and the cost of living. Aware that nobody wants higher taxes, Mr Wilson is trying to achieve big cuts in the less well-protected welfare budget. Mr Russ Gould, the state secretary for health and welfare, recognises that welfare cuts are not a long-term solution to budget problems. 'We have to reassess the government's role,' he says. 'We need a new social covenant.' Mr Alvin Rabushka, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, agrees. He points out that real per capita state spending has more than tripled in three decades, while real per capita incomes have less than doubled. His solution is to challenge the philosophical rationale for the single biggest item of state spending: elementary and secondary education. In a state as rich as California, he argues, it makes no sense to offer publicly financed education for all children. Most parents can afford to pay at least part of the cost. He thus favours the sale or contracting out of schools to private groups and the restriction of state support to means-tested educational credits for poor families. Such policies could save about Dollars 9bn a year, enough to halve the state income tax. Mr Rabushka's radical plans are rejected even by tough-minded Republican politicians such as Mr Gould, the welfare chief. He stresses the importance of education as a melting pot, pointing out that in his own child's class 19 out of 29 children are from minority backgrounds. Adverse demographic trends, corporate complaints about excessive regulation and the rioting in Los Angeles pose challenges to the Californian economy, but are unlikely to prevent a cyclical recovery. California's natural advantages are then likely to reassert themselves: it has more than its share of rapidly growing high-technology businesses and is perfectly positioned to benefit from expanding US trade with the Pacific Rim economies and Latin America. But the longer-term strains have to be addressed. California's ability to generate wealth at the pace demanded by its third world rate of population growth is already in doubt. In 1980 per capita incomes in California were 17 per cent higher than in the US as whole; by 1990 they were only 11 per cent higher. By 2000, many expect the gap to be only about 5 per cent. If the state is to return to its previous growth path, reform of the public sector is necessary. The root problem is voters' reluctance to pay the taxes required to finance the needed improvements in education, transport infrastructure and so forth. This is partly a reflection of the growing heterogeneity of the population: affluent whites in northern California have no wish to pay for services that mainly benefit minority groups in the Los Angeles area. Some, indeed, are pressing for a division of the state. One radical option would involve a retreat from the universal provision of free public services. It would be easier, for example, to meet the educational and social needs of poor immigrant families if affluent Californians paid directly for schools. The cost of relieving congestion in urban areas, meanwhile, could be greatly reduced if road pricing were introduced. And water shortages could be eliminated, some believe, if water were priced and traded like other scarce commodities. A 'fee-for-service' market-oriented public sector may seem unthinkable today. Yet it is consistent with fundamental Californian values - such as reverence for personal autonomy - and may prove the only way to resolve deep-seated conflicts over the appropriate level of taxation. If by reinventing the public sector the state can again play the nurturing role it perfected in previous decades, the instinctive economic optimism of Mr Schwartz and other entrepreneurs is unlikely to prove misplaced.</p>

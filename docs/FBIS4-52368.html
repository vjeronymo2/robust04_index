			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "A Very Difficult Road To Choose"] </F>   [Text] During the past few weeks, the military situation  in the western and northwestern parts of the country seemed to  be murky, thus causing some persons who lack the common sense to  accuse the Royal Government of provoking war and prolonging the  Cambodian bloodshed.    However, it is known to all that before the Khmer Royal  Armed  Forces [KRAF] launched the counterattacks on Anlung Veng, An  Seh, and Pailin, the Khmer Rouge [KR] had continued to harass  and attack the KRAF positions everywhere, especially in  Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap, Kompong Thom, Kampot,  Kompong Speu, and Kompong Chhnang Provinces. Not only have  these arrogant activities of the Khmer Rouge [KR] caused losses  to the KRAF, but they have also wreaked untold destruction on  the lives, property, and food of our people in those areas.  Thousands of families have become refugees. They have been  compelled to leave their villages and homes to take refuge in a  safe area.    Moreover, not only has the Khmer Rouge used its bases at  Anlung Veng, Pailin, and so forth (?for waging war), but it has  destroyed national property by allowing the foreigners to carry  out fishing and gem mining activities that have ruined the  environment, thus seriously affecting the future of the entire  Cambodian motherland.    Concerning the stubborn Khmer Rouge continuing its illegal  control of a small part of the territory and its military  activities that affect the lives and property of the population,  the KRAF and Royal Government have the task and duty to provide  the people with security and ensure public order in the face of  the Khmer Rouge's suppression, massacre, and looting.    Moreover, in line with Article 3 in Chapter 1 of the  Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia, which states clearly  that the Kingdom of Cambodia is an indivisible state, the Royal  Government has been compelled to take measures to resist the  Khmer Rouge's offensives and to eliminate their military and  economic bases.    Everyone still remembers well that before making this final  decision, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime  minister, braving all obstacles, made one attempt after another  to hold a discussion with Khieu Samphan to jointly seek ways to  end the bloodshed. In addition, the Prince Krompreah's  colleagues, such as His Excellency [H.E.] Tea Chamrat, H.E. Toan  Chay, H.E. Veng Sereivut, and Eng Roland, also tried to hold  secret meetings and negotiations with the Khmer Rouge, such as  Ho Bunheng, Mak Ben, and [name indistinct], to find an  appropriate formula for reducing tension and seek a way out.    But all these efforts have produced nothing good at all. The  Khmer Rouge still refuses to accept the cease-fire. It has  continued to raise the same old issue of Vietnamese being the  obstacle.    During the recent new year's day, Samdech Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen proposed a cease-fire on several  occasions, but the Khmer Rouge stubbornly rejected it as a trick  of the Vietnamese and their allies.    In the face of this situation, what kind of a position  should  the Royal Government take? Should it continue the defense of  the security, public order, and the people's property, food, and  land while the Pol Pot clique stubbornly refuses to cease fire,  resulting in the government being accused by some senseless  persons and some newspapers as being the warmonger? Or should  the Royal Government stop its military activities, stop  defending the territory, security, and the people, and just let  the Khmer Rouge do anything at will, thus pleasing some persons  and some newspepers?    These are the difficult paths for the government to choose.  However, the Royal Government, which was born from the people's  will expressed through the election, can do nothing without the  support of our people throughout the country. The Royal  Government cannot do anything that is against the people's will.    Concerning this matter, our people, who are the owners of  the  country, should make thorough considerations before making any  decisions. You should not allow yourselves to be misled at the  instigation of those persons who lack common sense to an extent  that might cause grave danger to the survival of our motherland.    As voters, we should be confident in the leadership of the  Royal Government, headed by the Prince Krompreah and Samdech Hun  Sen, which always unconditionally follows our adored king.</p>

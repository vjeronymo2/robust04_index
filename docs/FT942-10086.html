			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Observer: Walls have ears With less than a month to go, reverberations from the D-Day fiasco continue to rumble in the UK. But it's a very touchy subject. Latest offering is purported to derive from Michael Baldwin, keeper of weapons at the National Army Museum in Chelsea: 'It's a good job those organising the D-Day celebrations didn't organise the actual invasion - they wouldn't have got beyond the beach.' Not at all, says Baldwin, who runs the MoD-sponsored museum. 'It would be most improper to suggest I originated that,' he says. So he didn't say it? 'Well, everybody is saying it, aren't they - but I am not the originator.' All clear?</p>

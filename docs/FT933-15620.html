			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / People: A Curry joins Dixons The chairman of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, who is also the founder and chairman of USM electronics company ACAL, will join Dixons as a non-executive director with effect from September 7. John Curry succeeds Oxford University's Peter Oppenheimer, who is retiring after six years on the board. 'It sounded an interesting company and one where I thought I could make a contribution,' remarks Curry (right), who was headhunted for the position. 'Dixons needs to develop in Europe and I know about Europe,' he says, adding that he believes his entrepreneurial style will fit the Dixons culture. Curry, who says that 'unfortunately' he has no connection with the family which founded the Currys retail chain, built up, with his brother Peter, Unitech, a manufacturer of power supplies, industrial controls and connectors. In 1987 he himself branched out to set up ACAL, a distributor in the same line of business as Unitech, which was floated the following year. Gaining both a rugby and tennis blue when he was at Oxford, Curry, 55, has been chairman of the All England Club, a part-time position, since 1989.</p>

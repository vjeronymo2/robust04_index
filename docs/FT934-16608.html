			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas trails Shares in British Gas trailed the market closing a penny lower at 325 1/2 p, following volume of 5.9m, after analysts at Nomura urged investors to sell the stock. The new oils and gas team at the securities house believe the outlook for the stock remains uncertain as 'it looks increasingly unlikely that the government will accept the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the break up of British Gas.' Sentiment was further dented by news from the company that it expects its share of the firm contract gas supply market to drop to 55 per cent by the end of next year from its current level of around 68 per cent.</p>

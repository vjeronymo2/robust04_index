			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is anticipated that Participating Insurance Companies will rely on Rules 6e&hyph;2 or 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act with respect to their scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts, respectively, although some Participating Insurance Companies also may rely on individual exemptive orders. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts is referred to herein as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to herein as ``shared funding.'' Applicants request an order of the Commission exempting the Participating Insurance Companies and their Separate Accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any principal underwriter and depositor of such an Account) from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(B)(15) under the 1940 Act, to the extent necessary to permit mixed and shared funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides the exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act that are discussed below only if the separate account is organized as a unit investment trust, all the assets of which consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer their shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurer. Thus, those exemptions under Rule 6e&hyph;2 are not available if a separate account invests in a fund engaged in mixed and/or shared funding. Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provides similar exemptions, but only if the separate account is organized as a unit investment trust, all the assets of which consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer their shares exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company, offering either scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company, or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account. Thus, the exemptions set out in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) are available if the underlying fund is engaged in mixed funding, but are not available if the fund is engaged in shared funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act provides, among other things, that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a)(1) or (2) of the 1940 Act. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(i) and (ii) and Rules 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(i) and (ii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying management company. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) each provide a partial exemption from Sections 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent those sections have been deemed by the Commission to require ``pass-through'' voting with respect to an underlying fund's shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants state that the partial relief granted in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) from the requirements of Section 9 of the 1940 Act, in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of Section 9. Applicants states that those 1940 Act Rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization. Applicants state that it is unnecessary to apply Section 9(a) to individuals in various unaffiliated Participating Insurance Companies (or affiliated companies of Participating Insurance Companies) that may utilize the Fund as the funding medium for variable contracts. According to Applicants, there is no regulatory purpose in extending the Section 9(a) monitoring requirements because of mixed or shared funding. The Participating Insurance Companies are not expected to pay any role in the management or administration of the Fund. Moreover, those individuals who participate in the management or administration of the Fund will remain the same regardless of which Separate Accounts or insurance companies use the Fund. Applicants argue that applying the monitoring requirements of Section 9(a) because of investment by other insurers' Separate Accounts would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. Further, the increased monitoring costs would reduce the net rates of return realized by contractowners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

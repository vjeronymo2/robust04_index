			<p>BFN     [Text] On 22 April the Ukrainian Defense Ministry press  service issued a statement. It, in particular, says that  despite the initially realistic nature of the sides' approaches  to the fleet's quantitative indices at the negotiations in  Sevastopol, the Russian side was trying to understate the  numerical strength of the personnel of the Black Sea Fleet ships  by more than two times. A well-reasoned stand of the Ukrainian  military allowed to coordinate the quantitative parameters,  including the lists of the Black Sea Fleet amphibious means,  ships, and vessels that are to become part of the Ukrainian  Naval Forces.    At the same time, the problem of the temporary basing of the  Russian Navy on the Ukrainian territory failed to be solved,  says the statement. The Russian side was insisting that the  Russian Navy should be based at all the facilities in Crimea  while Ukraine's Naval Forces should be based beyond the borders  of the peninsula. The Ukrainian delegation provided a  well-reasoned proof of the fact that a functioning naval fleet  cannot be created without the Crimean bases. However, Russia's  approaches remained unchanged. Moreover, says the statement,  showing no wish to pay attention to common sense, to understand  the legitimate stand of Ukraine regarding the basing of its own  naval forces on its own territory, the Russian delegation  terminated the negotiations and disappeared without any  explanations.    The Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service is authorized  to  declare that the Ukrainian side regrets such a behavior of the  Russian delegation, which does not comply with the norms of the  international negotiations ethics.    Ukraine's Defense Ministry places all the responsibility for  the breakdown of the negotiations upon the Russian side and  reports its readiness to continue the disrupted negotiations at  any time.</p>

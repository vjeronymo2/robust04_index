			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Commercial property market faces'double dip' THE stalled recovery in the UK economy threatens to produce a 'double dip' in the commercial property market, according to a report by an independent research group. The Investment Property Databank, which analyses institutional property portfolios worth Pounds 40bn, says the slow recovery in investment returns, which began last year, has run out of steam. It blames an accelerating fall in rental values. The slide in rental values, which was largely confined to London and the south-east until the start of this year, has now spread to northern England and Scotland. Industrial property, which performed relatively well until this year, suffered a particularly sharp decline in rental values. The IPD review shows that annualised total returns (which measure yields and rental movements) have slipped from 3.6 per cent at the start of 1992 to 1.4 per cent in June and may fall below zero in the second half of the year. In the past three months, investors have sharply reduced their expectations of total returns for 1992, according to a survey of fund managers by IPD. Total returns are now expected to be barely positive in 1992, whereas in April they were expected to be 5-6 per cent. The IPD statistics show that the pressures on the commercial property market have changed markedly in the course of the recession. In 1990, the fall in the market was chiefly due to a rise in yields - the ratio of income to capital value - as investors lost confidence in property. Since then yields have largely stabilised but capital values have come under intensified pressure from the decline in rents. The fall in rental values has accelerated from 5.2 per cent a year to 8.3 per cent in the course of 1992. Retail property is the best performing sector while the office sector is the worst performer.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolution of the Coordinating Meeting of the Communist </F> Parties of States Formed on the Territory of the USSR on the  Political and Socioeconomic Situation in States on the Territory  of the USSR and the Tasks of Strengthening the Unity of  Communists," signed by party representatives in Moscow on 22 May  1994: "Common Goals"]    [Text] A meeting of delegations of communist parties of  states formed on the territory of the USSR and a delegation of  the Council of the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU [UCP-CPSU]  was held in Moscow 21-22 May 1994.    An exchange of opinions was held on the political and  socioeconomic situation in the states on the territory of the  USSR and on further steps to strengthen the unity of the  communist movement.    The participants in the meeting note that the years since  the  criminal destruction of the USSR -- contrary to the will of the  peoples -- have confirmed the correctness of the fundamental  assessments of the congresses of the communist parties of the  states and of the conclusions of the 29th CPSU Congress. The  pursuit of sovereignty has checked the economic development of  all the states, while the economic reforms being pursued are a  mere screen for a tiny section of the population to appropriate  the national wealth created by generations of Soviet people.    The collapse of the Union, the plundering of national  wealth,  and the emergence of unbridled nationalism have split the Soviet  people up into national compartments and divided them into a  handful of rich and millions of poor. All this has resulted in  economic catastrophe and a drastic worsening of ethnic and  social conflicts. The economic damage inflicted on the Soviet  people and our common Homeland is five times greater than that  caused during all the years of war against fascist Germany.  Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people have perished in ethnic  wars and millions have become refugees or jobless, doomed to  suffer misery and poverty.    The lofty achievements of our national culture are being  displaced by Western mass culture, with its cult of money and  violence. Free medical care and education are being replaced by  paid services, which are becoming beyond the means of an  ever-increasing number of citizens. Millions of people waiting  in line for housing or actually homeless are losing hope of  obtaining accommodations. Only the death rate, corruption, and  criminality are on the increase. The death rate exceeds the  birth rate in the majority of former Union republics. Three to  four times as many people die each year at the hands of  criminals than during the 10 years of the Afghan War.    In these conditions the peoples of the states are beginning  to realize the antipeople nature of the ruling regimes and to  pin their hopes on replacing them by establishing people's power  based on an upsurge of the communist movement and progressive  left-wing forces.    The states' party organizations have drawn the requisite  lessons from their heavy defeat. They have cleared out the  traitors, careerists, and timeservers. The majority of the  states' Communist Parties are completing their organizational  formation and are waging a hard-hitting campaign on behalf of  the interests of workers, the working peasantry, and the  people's intelligentsia.    The common goals of the states' communist parties are as  follows:     -  service to the working people;    -  socialism and communism as  the historic future of mankind, freedom and social equality,  collectivism, social justice, and genuine humanity;    -  the  achievement, defense, and strengthening of the political power  of working people in the form of soviets and the development of  socialist democracy and broad self-management by the  people;    -  resistance to the restoration of capitalism and the  resumption of a socialist path of development in the republics  of the USSR -- which most fully meets working people's social  needs;    -  the ending of ethnic conflicts and the prevention of  civil wars on the territory of the USSR;    -  the restoration of the  USSR as a voluntary association of sovereign states based on the  principles of Soviet patriotism, internationalism, the  fraternity of the peoples, and respect for national traditions  in accordance with the decision of the nationwide referendum of  17 March 1991, when three-quarters of the adult population of  the country expressed itself in favor of retaining the USSR;    -  the  reconstitution of single republic Communist Parties and their  amalgamation as the USSR is restored into a single Communist  Party of the Soviet Union.        In defining their political strategy and tactics the parties  are guided by Marxist-Leninist teaching and materialist  dialectics in their creative development and underpinned by  analysis of the specific historical situation and the  achievements of national and world science and culture.    The parties employ both parliamentary and nonparliamentary  means of political struggle within the bounds of existing  legislation to achieve their set goals.    While endorsing the correctness and timeliness of the 29th  CPSU Congress decision on the temporary reorganization of the  CPSU into the UCP-CPSU, the participants in the meeting consider  that the states' communist parties are, while maintaining their  own organizational autonomy, program documents, and rules, an  integral part of a single communist movement on the territory of  the USSR.    The participants in the meeting note that certain provisions  of the UCP-CPSU Rules and Program are out of date and do not  take full account of the special features of the work of the  states' communist parties in modern conditions. The conference  instructs the UCP-CPSU Council, in conjunction with authorized  representatives of the parties, to draft common principles  governing programs and rules and to submit them for examination  at the 30th UCP-CPSU Congress and other partywide forums.    The participants in the meeting regard the present  coordinating conference of leaders of the communist parties of  all the states formed on the territory of the USSR as a standing  conference.    The participants in the meeting instruct all communist  parties to concentrate their efforts on elaborating and  theoretically validating our common goals, coordinating the  parties' joint efforts to achieve them, propagating the  experience of political work in labor collectives, and  supporting and disseminating communist and opposition  socialist-oriented mass media.    The participants in the meeting condemn all attempts to  split  the communist parties and their regional organizations and the  creation of multiple communist centers and advise communists to  unite in single organizations to enhance their influence among  workers, peasants, and the intelligentsia. Parties can and  should observe proper standards of party ethics in debating  questions relating to different understandings of theoretical  problems and the tactics and strategy of practical actions in  discussions within the party.    The participants in the meeting urge all communists to  campaign actively for the unity of the communist movement on the  territory of the Soviet Union, to be resolute in defending the  interests of working people, and to enhance the level of  organization and party discipline. Our goals are: the Soviet  Union, power to the soviets of working people's deputies, a  single Communist Party, and socialism.    [Signed] On behalf of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, R.

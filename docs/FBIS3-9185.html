			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "is": "According to Slovak National Bank Data, </F> Meciar Government's Debt Amounts to 60 Billion"]    [Text] Bratislava--The foreign currency reserves of the  Slovak National Bank [NBS], excluding gold reserves, represented  about $415 million as of 31 December 1993, $405 million as of 9  March 1994, and $439 million as of 14 March 1994. Slovakia's  total foreign currency reserves (NBS reserves plus foreign  exchange assets of commercial banks) reached $1.853 billion by 9  March. "Both NBS reserves and total foreign currency reserves  can be considered stable, and, therefore, I see no reason to  correct the targets of the monetary program for 1994," NBS  Governor Vladimir Masar said within the framework of a meeting  of the NBS Banking Council.    The external indebtedness of the government sector increased  from $1.6 billion on 31 March 1993 to $1.9 billion by 31  December 1993. The overall external indebtedness of the Slovak  Republic, including the debts of banks and the entrepreneurial  sphere, increased from $2.35 billion on 31 March 1993 to $3.169  billion by 31 December 1993. "The NBS has met all of its  commitments," Vladimir Masar added. The servicing of the Slovak  Republic's debt, including commitments toward the Czech  Republic, represents $346 million this year, of which $229  million is principal and $117 million interest. Asked by SME  about the situation of the current account of Slovakia's balance  of payments (account of the trade balance plus account of  services), NBS Vice Governor Marian Jusko said that the NBS does  not avail itself of complete data yet. "The likely result is  indicated by Slovak Statistical Office data about the results of  our balance of trade in 1993, which ended with a deficit of 26.7  billion Slovak korunas [Sk]," he noted. The balance on the  clearing account between the Slovak Republic and the Czech  Republic reached 114 million European Currency Units [ECU's] in  the Czech Republic's favor by 15 March, which falls 16 million  ECU short of the set marginal credit. Hence, there is no  imminent danger of payment in freely convertible currency for  reason of exceeding the marginal credit.    The state budget deficit reached Sk5.4 billion by 14 March  1994, and, according to the NBS governor, it "evolved within  planned limits." Last year's state budget deficit amounted to  Sk21.5 billion. When we include payments to the Czech Republic  for exceeding the marginal credit on the clearing account,  however, the deficit amounted to as much as Sk29 billion. The  NBS covered the deficit, which, according to Vladimir Masar,  increased drastically toward the end of the year, by means of a  direct credit, which led to an inordinate growth of money supply  and to the threat of inflation growth. Since 1 January, the  state budget deficit has figured in the "state debt" item, and  parliament will decide on how it will be covered. The former  government's debt came close to Sk60 billion, also as a result  of the inclusion of the state budget deficit for last year.    [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 18 March on page 21  carries an 800-word interview with Julius Toth, outgoing  minister of finance, by Igor Zvach. The place and date of the  interview, in which Toth assesses his 21 months in office, are  not given. Asked about the development of the state budget this  year, Toth says: "The latest data suggests that meeting the  targets of this year's budget is realistic. In March a year  ago, the deficit stood at Sk11 billion; this year it will not  exceed Sk3.5 billion. At the same time, we must remember that  we have already paid Sk3.5 billion to the Czech Republic for  exceeding the marginal credit [on the clearing account] and that  we have released more than Sk1.1 billion for the National  Insurance Company. The development since January therefore  justifies my optimistic assertion that, given a very rational  management of resources, it may even be possible to use a  certain portion of the projected Sk14 billion deficit not for  patching up holes but for development programs. And, inasmuch  as the economy has already become stabilized, in my opinion, the  budget management could end with much better results than in  1993."]</p>

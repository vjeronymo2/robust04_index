			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / EC poised to rule on capital A COMPROMISE EC directive, removing one of the City of London's most important competitive advantages, could be agreed by member states by next month. The Capital Adequacy Directive, under discussion for four years, will set minimum levels of capital for EC securities firms. This will abolish a key advantage of UK-based securities firms, which have to carry less capital to back their business than their continental European competitors. In a last-minute compromise, the proposed rules have been watered down to make them more palatable to underwriters in London's equity and international bond markets. The compromise is due to be put to EC economic and finance ministers tomorrow, and could be adopted before the end of June. An earlier proposal by the commission - a ban on firms taking exposures to particular securities of more than 25 per cent of their capital - has been scrapped. The commission has opted instead for a sliding scale of additional capital requirements, which become more onerous the longer the exposure remains. Existing underwriting practices and 'bought deals', under which firms buy blocks of shares or bonds from a company before selling them on to investors, will continue. However, this will require more capital, and so become more expensive. so In the first 10 days of taking on a large exposure, firms would need three times the normal capital backing. After this, the amount of capital would rise sharply.</p>

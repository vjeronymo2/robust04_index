			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Decisive pro-treaty vote by assembly - Paris FRANCE yesterday took a critical step towards ratification of the Maastricht treaty by completing the first phase in the necessary revision of the French constitution. At the end of an all-night sitting, the National Assembly endorsed by 388 to 43 the text of the constitutional revision passed earlier in the week by the Senate. The change will now be finalised in a joint sitting of the two houses, known as a Congress, which will take place in the Palace of Versailles. The size of yesterday's majority together with the Senate vote suggest the government should secure the necessary three-fifths majority in this Congress. Originally scheduled for Monday June 29, the Congress may be brought forward to next week, before the European summit in Lisbon. If so, the French and the Irish would both be able to take encouragement to a summit which is bound to be dominated by the problems of ratifying the Maastricht treaty. Yesterday's vote again underscored the deep divisions over Maastricht in the conservative opposition parties, between the RPR Gaullists and their allies in the centrist and centre-right UDF parties. The Gaullists made another abortive attempt to prevent the debate with a procedural blocking motion; when that failed they refused to take any further part in the debate. After the vote, the Gaullist leadership accused the UDF and Centrists of seeking to form an alliance with the Socialists. But the government paid a price for its large majority, since it was forced to concede an increase in the constitutional powers of the Senate (which is dominated by the conservative parties).</p>

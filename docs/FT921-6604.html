			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Perez seeks broader base in reshuffle VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has used this week's cabinet reshuffle to achieve a stronger political base, more support from his own Democratic Action party, and a tougher image on crime and corruption. The changes, carried out late on Tuesday, represent an effort to recapture the political initiative following the failed military coup of three weeks ago. However, they do not signal an economic policy shift. The President named Mr Carmelo Lauria, an important official in two previous governments, to the key post of interior minister; Mr Ricardo Hausmann to the ministry of planning; Mrs Arminda Quintana to the justice ministry and Mr Celestino Armas, formerly minister of energy and mines, to the ministry of the presidential secretariat. The Venezuelan press said other changes would be announced soon. The most important change in the economic sector was the moving of Mr Miguel Rodriguez from the ministry of planning to the presidency of the central bank. Mr Rodriguez, 39, has been a leading architect of economic reform and one of the most powerful figures in the government. He is expected to devote much time to fighting inflation. Mr Rodriguez has declared he is in favour of regular mini-devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar, and is also said to favour strong banking reform. He replaced Mr Pedro Tinoco, who announced his resignation last week. The appointment of Mr Lauria, who offers a rare combination of broad experience in the public and private sectors, reflects the president's desire to control one of the country's most sensitive problems: violent crime. Figures from the two main opposition political parties refused Mr Perez's invitation to join the cabinet. However, Mr Perez yesterday established a new presidential consulting committee to provide advice on key national problems. The panel is made up of prominent individuals from the private sector and the opposition. An announcement on the energy and mines portfolio is expected soon.</p>

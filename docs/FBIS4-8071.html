			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>   [Excerpts] Several questions are being raised in Gorazde:  Are the chetniks really going to enter the town, will Mirsad  Dragolj [not further identified] blow up the nitrogen factory  (?despite the fact) that the U.S. Phantoms [as received] have  bombed the Chetnik positions.    It is impossible to give precise answers to any of these  questions. Since 1700 two Phantoms have been flying over the  Gorazde area. We do not have valid information about their  actions, but according to some reports from the ground, strong  explosions were heard 13 kilometers southwest of the town center.    Since the attacks against the territory on the right bank of  the Drina River have been organized and carried out from there  in the last 13 days, it seems possible that the report on the  Phantoms' actions is true.    This, however, did not stop the Chetnik forces continuing  [word indistinct] toward the center. Some eye-witnesses claim  that the Chetniks even shot at the planes.    The part of the town on the right bank on the Drina River  has  been evacuated. The town was again heavily shelled this  evening. There were fatalities and wounded in several suburbs.  Chetnik snipers fired on the town center and around the UNHCR  [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] offices.    Heavy small-arms fighting is under way on the approaches to  the town. Some people have been killed and wounded. [passage  omitted]    Around 2030 the howitzer-shelling of the town center  intensified. Unfortunately, there were fatalities again. I am  afraid that the casualty toll today is extremely high. Gorazde  is entering the most uncertain night in its long history.</p>

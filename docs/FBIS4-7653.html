			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 3 (BTA) -- Today the Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP, the former communists) held a meeting  behind closed doors to discuss its attitude to the cabinet of  economist Professor Lyuben Berov (not affiliated to any party).  It decided to give this cabinet which is no longer supported  even by President Zhelyu Zhelev a month and a half to get the  crisis under control.    A six-point resolution on the price and currency crisis was  adopted. The party's leadership is to formulate clear  requirements to be presented to the government, said BSP floor  leader Nora Ananieva. "We give the government a month and a  half to resume control," said ex-Prime Minister Andrey Lukanov.  In his opinion, the government stands an approximate 10 per  cent chance of success but it should be allowed to try. It is  unrealistic to consider the formation of a new cabinet within  this parliament, he said.    The BSP will demand from the government control over price  formation, rapid completion of the activity of liquidation  commissions in regard to the land reform, stabilization of the  foreign exchange market, no politically motivated dismissals in  the army before the passage of the armed forces bill on second  reading, and information on the progress of negotiations with  international financial institutions. Emergency measures have  to be taken to save the municipalities, health care, education  and welfare payments. The government must present a clear stand  on the issues of social policy together with the central bank's  report in May.    The party's leadership and the parliamentary BSP will  develop  a stand on structural, functional and personal changes in the  cabinet, more particularly in its economic team.    If the government fails to stabilize the situation elections  are the only alternative, the socialists maintain. The Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) whose government was overthrown in  November 1992 took a firm stand for early elections.</p>

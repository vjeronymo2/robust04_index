			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Leclerc du Sablon in Beijing: "France and </F> China: The Age of Maturity"]    [Text] In the last few years, General de Gaulle's name as  pronounced by Chinese leaders had a reproachful ring, being  directed at governments which proved too accommodating with  their Taiwanese nationalist rivals. Again yesterday, they  repeatedly invoked his name, this time as a moral warning for  their renewed assertion that they are the sole masters of a  single country -- greater China.    On 27 January 1946, the father of the French Fifth Republic  [de Gaulle] repudiated Chiang Kai-Chek's China in favor of Mao  Zedong's. Thirty years after this mutual recognition, the two  states have been through a few "hurdles" before reaching "the  age of maturity," said Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen on welcoming the delegation sent by Edouard Balladur to  celebrate this 30th anniversary.    This, he noted, was a "highly symbolic" delegation, being  led  by Alain Peyrefitte, "an old friend of China's, a member of  General de Gaulle's government, a fervent champion, and an  important witness" of Franco-Chinese relations, as well as  Admiral Philippe de Gaulle and Claude Chayet, the first French  ambassador in Beijing. The recognition of "Asia's oldest  nation-state" by "the Western world's oldest nation-state," said  Alain Peyrefitte on unveiling a plaque at the French Embassy,  meant that "the state ruled by the Beijing government was the  one which embodied the Chinese nation."    Courteously reserved on the "meandering" history of  relations  between Paris and Beijing -- a near-divorce when France  condemned the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, almost consummated after  the sale of 60 Mirage fighter aircraft to Taiwan -- the chinese  minister chose to insist instead on political grandeur and trade  relations, those very relations which French firms were denied  by a vengeful Beijing two years ago.  <H5>  `Vast Opportunities' </H5>   "As influential world powers," said Qian Qichen, China and  France bear a special responsibility for maintaining peace" and  they must "intensify their consultations." As for  manufacturers, economic reform offers them "vast business  opportunities: We are hoping that more of them will invest [in  the Chinese economy]."    At a dinner offered by China's foreign minister, Alain  Peyrefitte recounted with equal subtlety the successive steps  toward "restored trust": the history, the contracts, and human  rights. The 1964 "act" "implied neither approval nor  disapproval" of the Communist regime, but common interest  required such an attempt at "undermining the bipolar world that  had come out of Yalta."    According to Mr. Peyrefitte, the French will contribute "all  the more willingly" to China's economic growth if "they feel  they are contributing to increased dignity and freedom for the  Chinese people." While unwilling to "impinge on a sovereign  state's internal affairs," he thinks that "one must understand"  that the country of the 1789 Revolution and the Declaration of  Human Rights "cannot be insensitive to matters relating to the  respect of individual and group freedoms."    However, the "clouds" in the Franco-Chinese relationship are  supposed to have vanished on the release of the 12 January  communique, in which the French Government was undertaking not  to sell any more weapons to Taiwan.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Amic's profits slip to R352m ATTRIBUTABLE earnings at Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic), the industrial arm of the Anglo American group, fell in line with market expectations by 12 per cent to R352m (Dollars 111m) in the year to December, from R401m in 1991. Owing to the larger number of shares in issue, earnings per share fell by 15.6 per cent to 617 cents, from 731 cents. The dividend, however, was maintained at 350 cents a share. Turnover rose to R6.78bn, from R6.46bn, but operating earnings fell to R295m, from R434m. Amic's share of earnings from associates rose to R210m, from R206m, and income from investments and interest rose to R93m, from R78m. Of the main operating subsidiaries, Highveld Steel was hardest hit, with attributable earnings falling by 26 per cent to R71m, from R96m. Mondi, the unlisted forest products offshoot, posted a 54 per cent fall in attributable earnings to R51m, from R110m. Earnings of associates AECI and Dorbyl fell by 12 and 22 per cent respectively. Although earnings at Scaw Metals, a wholly-owned subsidiary, fell by 9 per cent to R76.5m from R84m, it was still the largest contributor to Amic's earnings. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, defended the performance of Mondi, saying many of its main international competitors were making large losses. He said temporary machine shutdowns, mothballings and closures had been necessary to keep tight control of inventories and working capital. A feature of the year was a review of the structure of Amic. The objectives were threefold: to make the group more financially efficient; to rationalise industrial interests held jointly with Anglo American; and to reduce the group's exposure to commodity cycles. Although Mr Boyd predicted another difficult year, he anticipated earnings would bottom out in 1993.</p>

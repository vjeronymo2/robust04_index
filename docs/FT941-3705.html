			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Detroit summit moves to tackle jobs crisis: Germany warns unskilled workers are at risk Ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations yesterday began work on a five-point plan to tackle mass unemployment as the German labour minister warned that Germany faced the loss of 3m unskilled jobs over the next eight years. US President Bill Clinton, opening a two-day summit of G7 employment and economics ministers on measures to boost job creation, called on the G7 to tackle down-to-earth economic issues rather than concentrating exclusively on macroeconomic policy and high finance. But a US plan to set up a G7 working party to study employment policy has already been dismissed by several countries. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, said a working party would be 'superfluous', since the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development already performs a similar task. 'If you set up machinery, a lot of the work goes into setting up the machinery rather than into substantive work,' added another official at the meeting. Germany has been the least enthusiastic participant in the Detroit meeting, with Mr Rexrodt dismissing US calls for more expansionary macroeconomic policies as part of an overall jobs strategy. Mr Clinton proposed the jobs summit at the G7 summit meeting in Tokyo last year. The summit, on the shores of Detroit's East-West river, is expected to yield a framework for the full G7 meeting in Naples this summer. G7 officials declined to discuss details of the five-point plan, but it is likely to address subjects such as re-employment, open markets and technology, and to remain general in order to avoid offending any country. Mr Clinton did not abandon the traditional subjects of G7 discussion. While he promised that the US would continue to bring its budget deficit down, he also called on Japan to stimulate domestic demand and for Europe to work for lower interest rates. But he also called for more fundamental structural changes in unemployment benefit systems, training systems and employment regulations, in order to reassure people that they can gain from a dynamic economy. 'Unless people believe they are prepared for the jobs of the future, that productivity benefits them and they can have both strong work lives and strong families in a dynamic economy, they will turn against change,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Clinton made a plea against age discrimination. 'If you want people to embrace change, we all have to change our attitude about who is employable, and especially on each end of the age spectrum,' he said. 'We have people that won't hire kids because they don't have any experience. How are they ever going to get any experience if they don't get a job, right? Then we have people who won't hire older people because they've got too much experience,' he added. Mr Clinton's message won broad acceptance from delegates of varying political hues. 'We are completely in agreement with the policies outlined in Mr Clinton's speech,' said Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. In, out, share the work about, Page 25</p>

The  session's main purposes are to further study and implement the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; to convey and implement the guidelines of the  national economic meeting held by the State Council; to  summarize the work of 1993; to study and formulate ways to  further deepen reform in an effort to establish a socialist  market economy; to optimize restructuring; to raise efficiency;  and to continually maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development.    Attending the session were members and alternate members of  the provincial party committee; members of the provincial  advisory committee and the provincial discipline inspection  commission; party members who are responsible comrades from the  provincial people's congress standing committee, the provincial  people's government, and the provincial Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference committee; principal  responsible comrades from party committees and governments of  various prefectures, cities, and counties (districts); and  principal responsible comrades from various provincial-level  departments, various universities, and some large enterprises  and institutions.    The provincial party committee standing committee chaired  the  meeting. Lu Rongjing and Fu Xishou delivered important speeches  at the meeting on implementing the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  national economic meeting. Chen Guanglin made a progress report  on Anhui's anticorruption drive. The provincial advisory  committee submitted a written work report to the meeting.    The third plenary session adopted the "Resolution on  Implementing the `14th CPC Central Committee's Decision on  Several Issues Regarding the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economy' [the "Decision"]"; and adopted the "Resolution on the  `Anhui Provincial Party Committee Advisory Committee's Work  Report'," agreeing to abolish the provincial advisory committee.    The meeting held: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee was an important meeting held at a time when  reform in China's economic system was entering a new phase. The  "Decision" -- adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee -- has sketched the basic framework of a  socialist market economy; is a splendid blueprint for  transforming the traditional planned economy into a socialist  market economy; and is an action program that guides us to  promptly accelerate the pace of reform and progress. In  accordance with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, the national economic meeting  has made specific arrangements for various reform and economic  tasks in 1994. Party committees and governments at various  levels must earnestly study the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; must adhere to the  national economic meeting's arrangements; and must pay close  attention to and meticulously organize related tasks so as to  realistically and properly perform them.    The meeting proposed: The general guiding ideologies and  requirements for the work in 1994 follow: We should earnestly  implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics; should persistently intensify  anticorruption drive while carrying out reform, opening up, and  economic progress; should further liberate the mind; should  seize opportunities; should accelerate the pace of reform in an  effort to expeditiously establish a socialist market economy;  should open wider to the outside world; should maintain the  favorable momentum of rapid economic progress while ensuring  that quality and efficiency in 1994 will be improved over that  of 1993; should considerably raise the provincial comprehensive  strength; and should improve our work performance in various  fields.    The meeting pointed out: To properly perform the work in  1994, we have to accomplish very arduous tasks. While regarding  reform as the main theme, we should make efforts to do a good  job in the following aspects: 1) We should expeditiously  smoothen the relations between producers and enterprise owners  and strive to invigorate state enterprises in an effort to  establish a modern enterprise system. 2) We should accelerate  rural economic restructuring and strive to raise peasants'  income in an effort to realize the goal of becoming well-off.  3) We should expeditiously develop factor-of-production markets  and strive to enable market mechanisms to play their full roles  in an effort to optimize resource allocation. 4) We should  accelerate the pace of opening up to the outside world and  strive to enhance the export-oriented economic sector in an  effort to reach a situation whereby the economy is open in an  all-round manner. 5) We should expeditiously develop scientific  and technological progress, make use of related achievements,  and strive to increase high-technology levels in an effort to  transform scientific and technological achievements into  economic benefits.    The meeting pointed out: Reform is progress. We cannot  achieve economic progress unless we have breakthroughs in  reform. We should make greater efforts to accelerate reform;  should earnestly study various central reform policies; should  fully understand their guidelines; should make use of favorable  conditions from a macroeconomic viewpoint; should be fully  prepared; and should strictly implement the guidelines.  Meanwhile, we should actively create conditions through our own  efforts and effective work; should strive to seek opportunities  for progress under a new relationship among various interest  groups arising as a result of reform; and should use new reform  breakthroughs to enhance rapid economic progress. We should  realistically change our concept of economic progress, and  should earnestly shift to performing the central tasks of  restructuring and raising efficiency.    The meeting stressed: Strengthening party organizations at  various levels and raising the leadership's ability to regulate  the overall situation in accordance with the party's basic  theories and basic line are important guarantees for us to  establish a socialist market economy. All Anhui residents  should thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In particular  at present, we should earnestly and properly study Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Leading cadres  should lead the study so that we can conscientiously reach  common understandings on Comrade Xiaoping's theories and the  guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. We should further uphold  the ideology and line on liberating the mind and on seeking  truth from facts; should continually eradicate backward ideas  that are incompatible with development in the new situation;  should respect the masses' creative spirit; and should summarize  and promote fresh experiences initiated by the masses.  Furthermore, we should unwaveringly and persistently uphold the  policy of simultaneously and strictly launching the  anticorruption drive while carrying out reform, opening up, and  economic progress. We should intensify ideological and  political work; should strictly crack down on various crimes;  should continually launch the anticorruption drive; and should  ensure that we accomplish related achievements at various  stages. Additionally, we should continually strengthen the  party's own development, especially development in leading  bodies and grass-roots organizations; and should raise the  rallying force and fighting capacity of party organizations at  various levels so as to more appropriately fulfill the  requirements for reform, opening up, and modernization in the  leadership.    The meeting earnestly deliberated the provincial advisory  committee's work report. The meeting fully affirmed and highly  commended the provincial advisory committee for its enormously  effective work, since its establishment, on enhancing Anhui's  reform, opening up, and modernization drive; on fostering party  building and spiritual civilization drive; and on consolidating  a stable and united political situation. The meeting also  expressed lofty respects to veteran comrades of the provincial  advisory committee for their important personal contributions to  abolishing the previously existing permanent leading posts, to  replacing old cadres with new ones, and to facilitating  cooperation between the two groups. The meeting urged party  organizations at various levels to be more concerned for old  comrades politically and in their daily lives; to pay attention  and listen to their suggestions and proposals; and to  continually attach importance to the roles they will play in the  future. Meanwhile, the meeting expressed the hope that old  comrades will be concerned with and support, as they have  previously, the work in various sectors, and will make fresh  contributions to enhancing Anhui's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive.</p>

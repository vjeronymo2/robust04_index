			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tsao Hsiao-heng (2580 1420 5899): "Taiwan's </F> Trade Deficit With Japan Hits Another Record High"]    [Text] Measures Are Available, But Strength Is  Lacking To Remedy the Situation    Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan has been a longstanding  problem. The annual deficit was roughly between $2.1 and 3.7  billion for the first seven years of the 1980's, but has soared  dramatically since 1987. It rose from $4.862 billion in 1987 to  $9.7 billion in 1991. The figure nearly doubled in five years,  averaging a 39.8 percent increase annually. Calculated on the  basis of the 1991 figure, which was already high, the 1992  deficit surged further by more than 24 percent. As for 1993,  Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan for the first 11 months  already totaled $12.9 billion. An estimate made by Taiwan's  "Board of Foreign Trade" puts the whole year's deficit at $14  billion, which is a new record high, standing 8.5 percent above  the $12.9 billion deficit registered in 1992.    Over the past few years, the Taiwan authorities have left no  stone unturned to solve the trade deficit with Japan. To explore  new markets, Taiwan's "Ministry of Economic Affairs" formed a  "Commission for Reduction of the Trade Deficit With Japan" in  early 1993. Since then, several Taiwan commodity sales  exhibitions have been held in Japan, and delegations have been  sent there for sales promotion purposes. Other actions taken  include establishing the Taiwan Trade Center and the Joint  After-Sale Service Center in Japan, requesting Japanese  manufacturers in Taiwan to sell their products back to their  home country, diversifying sources of imports, and removing  trade barriers. With respect to industrial structural  adjustment, the Taiwan authorities have adopted seven measures,  namely, assisting industries in raising their product quality,  helping improve industrial designs, strengthening the  central-and-satellite-plant system, beefing up quality control  and inspection, encouraging manufacturers to develop their own  technology and make key parts and components independently,  actively introducing advanced technology from abroad, and  promoting investment. In implementing the above measures, the  "Industrial Development Bureau of the Ministry of Economic  Affairs" in Taiwan has, among other things, energetically  promoted the production of 66 key products, parts, and  components to ensure the independence of the island's industry  and free it from Japan's control in a bid to radically solve the  trade deficit problem. The results are not so effective, however.    What is noteworthy is the relations of trade between Taiwan  on the one hand and Japan, the United States, and the Chinese  mainland on the other. Generally speaking, in the mid-1980's,  Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan was offset by its trade  surplus with the United States. When the trade deficit with  Japan increased, the trade surplus with the United States  generally went up; that is, they changed directly with each  other. In those years, Taiwan's exports to the United States  rose with its increased imports from Japan. After 1987, Taiwan's  trade deficit with Japan continued to climb each year, but its  trade surplus with the United States kept declining, except for  a slight pickup in 1989. In 1993, Taiwan's trade deficit with  Japan continued to surge sharply while there was only a slight  upturn in its trade with the United States. In contrast,  Taiwan's direct trade with Hong Kong and indirect trade with the  mainland both shot up considerably. In 1992 the total of these  two trade sectors reached $17.2 billion, accounting for over 12  percent of Taiwan's external trade. The trade surplus with Hong  Kong and the mainland that year totaled $13.6 billion, way above  the $7.8 billion surplus with the United States. As of the end  of November 1993, Taiwan's trade surplus with Hong Kong and the  mainland already reached $15 billion, up 23.9 percent over the  corresponding period of the preceding year. That was roughly 2.5  times the $6.3 billion surplus registered with the United States  for January-November 1993. It is estimated that the 1993 trade  surplus with Hong Kong and the mainland will exceed $16.5  billion. As can be seen, Taiwan's trade surplus with Hong Kong  and the mainland in the 1990's has been approximately equivalent  to its trade deficit with Japan, playing a key role in  maintaining Taiwan's overall trade balance.  <H5>  The State of Over-Reliance on Japan Cannot Be Changed Shortly </H5>   Economic and trade relations between Taiwan and Japan are  centered on vertical international division of labor. Japan is  moving overseas its industries and enterprises with decreasing  comparative profits, whereas Taiwan's economic and other  conditions are suited to the acceptance of such Japanese  industries and technologies. This has resulted in Taiwan's  sizable trade deficit with Japan and the relatively large amount  of Japanese investment on the island.    From 1952 to December 1991, Japan's direct investment in  Taiwan was $4.2 billion, accounting for 32.7 percent of the  direct investment the island received from overseas. During this  period, Japan made 2,181 technology transfers to Taiwan, or 60.4  percent of the technology transfers Taiwan received from  abroad--an indication of Taiwan's heavy reliance on Japanese  technology. After the third post-war surge in its overseas  investment in the mid-1980's, however, the share of Japan's  investment in Taiwan in its total overseas investment has been  declining. In 1985, Japan's investment in Taiwan accounted for  1.19 percent of its direct overseas investment, which totaled  $12.2 billion. In 1989, its direct overseas investment surged to  $67.5 billion, while only 0.95 percent of this amount was  invested in Taiwan. In other words, while its overseas  investment expanded 5.5 times, the share of its investment in  Taiwan dropped 20 percent. The first half of 1993 saw only 29  new Japanese investment projects in Taiwan, with a 60 percent  drop in the total investment amount compared with the record  registered a year ago. Technological cooperation projects  numbered only 39, down by 20 percent from the 1992 record. As  can be seen, the Taiwan authorities' policy of absorbing  Japanese technology to upgrade the island's industry has not  produced any appreciable results.    On the surface, Japan's investment and technological  cooperation projects have enabled Taiwan manufacturers to  purchase more raw materials, spare parts, machinery, and  equipment from Japan. Moreover, while Taiwan is changing its  economic mode, high-tech enterprises on the island have to rely  more on Japan for the supply of parts and components for making  high-tech products. On the other hand, most of the export  products made with Japanese technology, materials, parts, and  components are not sold back to Japan, but are destined for  European and American countries. This is why Taiwan's trade  deficit with Japan has become greater each year.    A radical analysis reveals that the development and  structure  of economic and trade relations between Taiwan and Japan are  principally subject to the following factors:    Firstly, as far as Taiwan's economic and industrial  structures are concerned, small and medium-sized enterprises are  the main producers of export products. Many of them are  original-equipment manufacturers (OEM) for big Japanese  companies, which manipulate their raw material supply and sales  channels. Under such circumstances, these small and medium-sized  enterprises can hardly free themselves from the Japanese  companies' control. Given the current technological and  industrial conditions in Taiwan, there are two reasons for  Taiwanese manufacturers to choose Japan instead of any other  country for their OEM operation: Either the Japanese products  are of good quality or they are more competitive in price. It  may be said that Taiwan-Japan economic and trade relations are  founded on the comparative advantage of international division  of labor necessitated by industrial development. Such relations  can give some benefits to both sides within a certain period of  time.    Secondly, the Japanese market is of a closed nature, which  is  seldom seen in Western economic systems. Its quality and  specification requirements and the inspection system are almost  overcritical, and its marketing process and practice are highly  intricate. Certainly, without a thorough knowledge of the  Japanese market and a sufficient strength, it will be difficult  to enter into that market. What is more, most of the Japanese  companies doing business or making investment in Taiwan are  aimed at exploiting the local market or using Taiwan as a place  to manufacture or process their products to be sold to the  United States. They are different from those American investment  projects in Taiwan whose products are by and large sold back to  the United States. Such being the case, it is, of course,  inevitable for a double imbalance to exist between the two  countries--Taiwan suffers a trade deficit with Japan, and  Japan's investment in Taiwan far exceeds Taiwan's investment in  that country.    Thirdly, in the field of science and technology, Taiwan's  research and development are still at a relatively low level and  cannot form a foundation for upgrading its industry. As Taiwan  has been inclined to follow Japan's example in every aspect of  its post-war economic development, it still relies on technology  imports from Japan even today. Taiwan manufacturers import from  Japan a sizable portion of their raw materials, parts,  components, machinery, and equipment for making products to be  exported. Take the electronics industry as an example. Taiwan's  export of electronics amounted to some $18 billion in 1991,  ranking the sixth in the world. However, it should be noted that  Taiwan's electronics design and manufacturing capabilities are  still rather inadequate despite its 30 years of development  efforts and the decision made in 1982 by the authorities to  designate the electronics industry as a "strategic industry." Of  the parts and components required by the electronics industry,  only a fraction is made domestically. For the industry's  downstream sector, over 80 percent of the parts and components  have to be imported, especially from Japan. As a striking  example, over 90 percent of Taiwan's requirement for integrated  circuits--an essential component for information electronics--is  met by imports.    Taiwan's economic development is not accompanied by the  optimization of the entire economy, nor is it a process  associated with a gradual progress in science and technology.  Instead, it is a quantitatively expanding profit-making process  through continuous absorption, but not digestion, of foreign  technology and capital to make products for export. This process  has resulted in the present pattern of economic and trade  relations between Taiwan and Japan.  <H5>  Despite the Environmental Change, the Prospect Is Not </H5> Optimistic    Taiwan's industry is in the course of upgrading. Industrial  upgrading and product updating will certainly boost the demands  for new technology, equipment, parts, and components. In recent  years, over 80 percent of Taiwan's imports from Japan are  machinery, equipment, and various parts and components. Such  imports are prerequisites for Taiwan's survival and development.  Meanwhile, Taiwan has adopted the following measures to improve  its economic and trade relations with Japan: 1) exploring  markets in Japan for Taiwanese goods so as to cut trade deficit;  2) adjusting industrial structure to reduce reliance on Japan;  and 3) improving the status of export-processing zones,  diversifying markets, and exploring new sources of technology  and equipment through "liberalization and internationalization"  measures.    Development of Taiwan-Japan economic and trade relations are  affected by the following external factors:    In the first place, it is affected by the slowdown of  economic growth of Western developed countries. According to  forecast by international organizations and research institutes,  the economic growth rates of the seven major Western developed  countries for the 1990's will be lower than the 1980's. During  the late 1980's and the early 1990's, Japan's economic situation  is that following a 4.6 percent growth rate in 1988, a rather  quick growth was scored in 1990, pushing the growth rate to 5.2  percent. In 1991, however, the economic growth rate fell to 3.3  percent. Following that, the growth rate is expected to remain  at a level below 4 percent, as forecast by most people. This  provides a favorable condition for Taiwan to import Japan's  technology and equipment to meet its industrial-upgrading  requirements. But the negative effect is that Taiwan will  encounter hard-to-overcome obstacles in exploring markets in  Japan.    Secondly, the acceleration of global economic  regionalization  will also have some impact on Taiwan-Japan economic and trade  relations. Progress in building a Single European Market and the  signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement have made it  a general trend of the times that countries of the central  Pacific-Asia region want to cooperate in checking and balancing  the control and blockade imposed upon them by European and  American countries. For this reason, both Taiwan and Japan have  deliberately strengthened their ties, adjusted their bilateral  relations, made a number of proposals, and sent delegations to  visit each other from time to time in a bid to reinforce and  improve their economic and trade relations.    In addition, the 1990's will witness the acceleration of  science and technology advance in the world. Accordingly, the  international diffusion of technology will also become faster.  Based on its relatively large foreign exchange reserve and  fairly sound economic and technological foundation, Taiwan will  speed up the absorption of advanced technology from abroad. It  will become a major potential recipient that Japan will consider  for further accelerating nonsophisticated technology transfers  in the Pacific-Asia region.    From the above it follows that before Taiwan completes its  industrial upgrading, there will be no radical change in its  unfavorable trade balance with Japan. Because of its limited  market capacity, however, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan will  slide down slowly after attaining a certain level. What is worth  mentioning is that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, with  their increasing contacts, will enter a new phase of economic  and trade relations in the late 1990's. Escalation of their  economic cooperation will assist Taiwan in upgrading its  industry, thereby reducing its reliance on Japan.</p>

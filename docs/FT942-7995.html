			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Arts (Openings): David Byrne The Scots born musician made the New York band Talking Heads one of the most innovative and eclectic pop groups of the 1980s, weaving African and Latin American influences into mainstream rock. He arrives in London tomorrow for a solo concert at the Palladium. Sometimes Byrne provides an acoustic set of confessional intensity; sometimes he fills the stage with Latin musicians. But with a new album, the eponymous 'David Byrne' to promote, expect a bit of both.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENT SAYS GRIFFIN TO SIGN WITH DODGERS  </P> <P> Randy Hendricks, the agent for Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin, said Friday  that Griffin has decided to sign a contract he agreed to in November.  </P> <P> Griffin had been considering a grievance procedure because he forfeited his  rights to free agency by agreeing to contract terms before the Dodgers'  deadline for signing their eligible free agents. The club then lifted the  deadline to continue negotiations with Steve Sax and Mike Marshall.  </P> <P> Griffin contended that the Dodgers had curtailed his bargaining power by  pressuring him to sign before a deadline they later dissolved.  </P> <P> Griffin's contract calls for a guaranteed $900,000 in 1989 and 1990, and  another $900,000 that is not guaranteed in 1991. Griffin failed in an attempt  to have the Dodgers guarantee that final year as compensation for dropping the  threat of a legal procedure.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, meanwhile, announced that they had reached 1989 terms with three  players who were eligible for salary arbitration, first baseman Franklin  Stubbs, pitcher Ricky Horton and infielder Mariano Duncan.  </P> <P> Stubbs got a $110,000 raise to $345,000. Duncan agreed to the same $200,000 he  earned last year. Horton's terms were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Five Dodgers -- Orel Hershiser, Tim Leary, Rick Dempsey, Dave Anderson and Ray  Searage -- remain eligible for arbitration and have until 9 a.m. Monday to  file.

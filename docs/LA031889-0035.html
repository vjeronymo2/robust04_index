			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA, WITH NO QUOTES  </P> <P> I was at the March 4 performance of "Tancredi" by the Music Center Opera  Company and I found the handling of Chris Merritt's laryngitis ingenious. I  enjoyed seeing him perform and lip-sync the words, and I found the generosity  of Merritt and the rest of the cast toward Stephen Gould (who did the actual  singing) refreshing.  </P> <P> If that makes me an "opera" lover rather than an opera (no quotes) lover, so be  it.  </P> <P> William Stockman (Letters, March 11) says we got what we deserved. He thinks  someone else deserves his seat. I think he does not deserve our splendid Music  Center Opera Company.  </P> <P> MARY W. BAILEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (11): Boost for women's role in the workforce A SURVEY of more than 300 companies in Dyfed, Powys, Gwynedd and Clwyd found that while a third had seen an increase in the proportion of women employed over the past five years, only one in five had seen an increase in women in senior management, writes Roland Adburgham. The survey was carried out for Chwarae Teg/Fair Play, a pioneering consortium led by the public sector, which is designed to improve women's position in the workforce. Researchers interviewed 865 women in the four counties and found that almost a third felt they had no skills and only 15 per cent had received any advice on training. Chwarae Teg, which after a pilot project in south Wales last year was extended this year to include Dyfed and north and mid Wales, also interviewed training organisations. It found that lack of childcare often prevented women who wanted to take up training from doing so. This month, Chwarae Teg urged the Welsh Office to support an 'under fives' childcare initiative to provide 5,000 new places to help women return to the labour market. The kind of initiative encouraged by Chwarae Teg is that at Dewhirst Ladieswear which employs nearly 600 people, mostly women, at Cardigan and Lampeter. Infants come to work with their mothers and are then taken by bus to a nursery, 'Kidz Children's Services.' They are bused back to the factories at the end of the working day. The nursery places are heavily subsidised by Dewhirst.</p>

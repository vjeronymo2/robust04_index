			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Letter: Police still face many problems in combating serious fraud Sir, The article by Robert Rice ('Dilemma over dealing with City cases', January 27) commenting on the working party report by the bar highlighted many of the problems faced by the authorities in combating serious fraud. Apart from the retention of the jury, there were a number of matters in the working party's recommendations with which I could disagree. I do not believe that the Serious Fraud Office, the Crown Prosecution Service  - or indeed City regulators  - are capable of deciding whether a defendant is likely to receive a custodial sentence. If offences which are investigated by the SFO are not serious enough to warrant prison sentences, why would that office be dealing with them? Self-regulation is not at present working  - some disciplinary proceedings are almost as costly as many Crown Court trials] They can be too fragmented, have only powers over members and while they can impose substantial financial penalties, they are powerless to deal with non-member accomplices. I agree that some elements of 'compounding,' as practised by the Customs and Excise, are attractive, but would prefer a formal system of plea bargaining. However, what is essential to reduce important fraud trials to a manageable status is an end to what the working party call the defendants' 'right of non-co-operation'. 'Common sense and the weight of evidence submitted' led Lord Roskill's Fraud Committee to conclude that non-co-operation 'is a hindrance to efficient handling of many fraud cases'. The committee dismissed the argument that an obligation to disclose would be an infringement of fundamental principles of criminal law. Following that committee's report, Section 9(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 requires that, after the service of a case statement by the prosecution, defendants may be directed to give a written statement outlining the 'general' nature of the defence. Unfortunately, in practice the intentions of parliament have been thwarted whenever a defendant does not see fit to co-operate. Possibly as a result of the word 'general', in more than one trial since the act, defendants' 'statements' have called on the prosecution strictly to prove all of the case for the Crown. Other than being later commented upon by the judge to the jury, such compliance is not compellable.

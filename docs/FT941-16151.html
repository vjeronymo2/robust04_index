			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Deeper payments crisis in prospect: Debt servicing expected to swallow up foreign exchange earnings Nigeria's budget, reversing economic reform, has left the country with no prospect of satisfying International Monetary Fund terms for debt rescheduling and will deepen the balance of payments crisis. Nigeria needs to reschedule last year's unpaid debts to the Paris Club of official creditors, worth more than Dollars 4.5bn, but the Fund's mission due in Lagos later this month, is unlikely to produce a clean bill of health in view of the increased regulation of the economy, removal of export incentives and the continued funding of uneconomic industrial projects outlined in the budget. Without rescheduling, external debt service this year is expected to reach Dollars 6bn, or 97 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, according to finance minister Mr Kalu Idika Kalu. The government has provided for Dollars 1.8bn of external debt payments this year, out of forecast government revenue of Dollars 6.5bn based on an Opec oil production quota of 1.8m barrels a day at an average price of Dollars 14 per barrel. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) will receive more than 62 per cent of forecast revenue to fund its joint ventures with the international oil companies. According to Mr Don Etiebet, the oil minister, this year's budget allocation would make up the shortfall in investment in recent years which has seen NNPC fail to meet its costs for the past six months and a decline in Nigeria's production capacity. The budget gives priority to some notorious projects such as the Ajaokuta steel works, the aluminium smelter and the new capital in Abuja which, according to a budget monitoring committee set up by previous head of state Mr Ernest Shonekan, should no longer be funded. The remainder of the budget leaves little scope to maintain the size of government and its target of a balanced budget would require harsh cuts in spending. The budget is a U-turn in policy for the finance minister who has argued forcefully until now for complete deregulation of the economy and an early medium-term agreement with the IMF. Mr Kalu said in Abuja yesterday that he saw the budget measures as inevitable if Nigeria is to stimulate industrial output, estimated to be about 35 per cent of capacity, and stabilise the value of the naira, which fell from about N25 to the dollar to about N49 to the dollar in the past 12 months on the parallel market. Mr Kalu, who was finance minister in 1986 when former military president General Ibrahim Babangida floated the naira to free the Nigerian economy, said Gen Abacha's measures were not a 'total retreat from free markets'. He justified the ban on free movement of capital into Nigeria by saying that the government had to ensure that priority sectors were adequately funded. This is despite official figures showing that over 75 per cent of foreign exchange sold by the government went directly to industry. 'This must be the only government in the world which thinks that you can strengthen the foreign exchange rate by cutting interest rates,' said a banker in Lagos yesterday. The 1994 policy places a large burden on the Central Bank of Nigeria which has to allocate scarce foreign exchange to commercial banks for on-lending to priority customers. This system has been applied in Nigeria before and led to widespread abuse. The head of a leading industrial company said yesterday: 'We have tried policing before in Nigeria and it has never worked. These measures are especially damaging to exporters who no longer have an incentive.' Many businessmen are sceptical. The ban on free movement of export proceeds could have a devastating effect on the cocoa crop, Nigeria's second largest source of export earnings. Cocoa farmers who are earning N51,000 per tonne this season will receive only 21,000 per tonne from exporters if they are paid at the rate of N22 to the dollar. Mr Paul Ogwuma, the central bank governor, said the new regulations were needed in 1994 to bring sanity to the foreign exchange market. The situation could be reviewed next year if the government found the controls were no longer needed.</p>

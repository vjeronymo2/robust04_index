			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Do Phu Tho] </F>   [Summary] "The coal production output of military units is  growing larger and larger, from 500,000 tons in 1991 to 570,000  tons in 1992 and 630,000 tons in 1993. Its expected output for  1994 is 720,000 tons. Coal exports have also increased rapidly  with the export volume increasing from 170,000 tons in 1992 to  200,000 tons in 1993 and to an expected 300,000 tons this year."    With its organizational advantage, military units engaged in  coal production have operated effectively as state enterprises  under the Army's Truong Son, Song Hong, and 11th Engineering  General Corporations and have made their adequate contributions  to the state budget. The first two general corporations have  become members of the Coal Exporting Council since 1992.    "The export through only one outlet has helped eliminate the  state of competitive buying and selling and the forcible  reduction of price. This export system is beneficial to both  the state and the enterprises concerned. However, this system  has created a situation in which military enterprises have  concentrated only on production without paying any attention to  world market demands."    As these military enterprises do not have any frequent  foreign customers, "they have been adversely affected by a  decision of the COALIMEX (Coal Import-Export and Supply)  Corporation under the Ministry of Energy to stop helping units  outside the coal sector export their coal, beginning April 1994."    "As of 1 April 1994, coal-exploiting military units had  registered some 150,000 tons of coal still in backlog, including  100,000 tons exploited in the first quarter of 1994 and 50,000  tons left behind since last year. During the first quarter of  1994, military enterprises could only export 10,000 tons of coal  or so, including 6,000 tons from the Truong Son Engineering  General Corporation and over 5,000 tons from the 11th  Engineering General Corporation. Should the managerial system  for the production and sales of coal remain unchanged, it is  certain that coal-producing military units will not achieve  their marketing targets."</p>

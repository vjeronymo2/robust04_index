			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: SPANISH CASSEROLE IS FAMILY FARE OR ELEGANT ENTREE  </P> <P> Bonifacio Guenechea is a very generous man and has some very special cooking  ware. I first met Boni only a few months back when I borrowed three of his pans  to cook at a benefit beach party for cystic fibrosis at my brother's home in  the Florida Keys. Boni's pans (he calls them magic pans) are giant paella pans  that come with their own butane burner and tripod, and are perfect for cooking  for a crowd. With three of them, I cooked beef, chicken and Florida lobster for  250 people in just over an hour.  </P> <P> My brother called again last month, "Hey how about coming down and cooking for  the Florida Keys Fishing Guides Assn.? They do a lot of conservation work and  they are gonna be doin' a fund-raiser and thought maybe you'd help out. Whadda  ya say! Maybe we could use Boni's pans again."  </P> <P> I called Boni.  </P> <P> "Sure," he replied, "you can use 'em. How many will ya be cookin' for?"  </P> <P> "I'm not sure," I said, "maybe 200, maybe 400."  </P> <P> "Tell ya what," he said, "I'll come down and help ya. I'll bring my big pan. We  can do paella."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paella's Spanish History  </P> <P> Boni's big pan is almost 4 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep -- big enough to  cook paella for about 150 people at a time. Two batches was all it took. As we  stood around his pan stirring, Boni told me a bit about the world-famous dish  from his native Spain.  </P> <P> Paella gets its name from the pan it is cooked in. The pan is the paella. The  dish can be made from a variety of different ingredients, meat, fish, poultry  or a combination. The only ingredients that are traditionally used are olive  oil, rice and saffron. Boni said he sometimes uses yellow food coloring in  place of the very expensive saffron, "but it's not nearly as good." He also  said that you don't have to have the traditional paella, you can make it in any  casserole dish, "but it's not quite the same."  </P> <P> Paella can be simple, inexpensive family fare with chicken and pork, or elegant  festive fare with lobster and stone crab. Either way, it's fun food. Boni sent  me the following recipes to document paella's versatility.  </P> <P> PAELLA A LA AMERICANA  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive oil  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, chopped  </P> <P> 1 small onion, chopped  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 chicken, cut into several pieces  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can corn  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin  </P> <P> 5 cups water  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon yellow food coloring  </P> <P> 2 cups rice  </P> <P> 1 lemon  </P> <P> Pimientos  </P> <P> Preheat oil in paella pan over medium heat.

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Indian telecoms A whiff of controversy overhangs telecoms offerings from the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan Telecom vouchers were offered to international investors earlier this month despite there being no proper prospectus and with Jardine Fleming, the global co-ordinator, unable to go through the normal due diligence process. Even so, Dollars 900m of vouchers were snapped up. Now India is wondering whether to revive the sale of shares in VSNL, the international operator whose Dollars 1bn offering was pulled in May when investors refused to pay the price the government demanded. Ministers, who held out for a price set before global equity markets dived in February, were condemned for failing to understand that prices must be fixed in the light of market conditions. Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson, their bankers, were also criticised for failing to educate their client adequately. Such neglect certainly carries a price. Investors, who have once witnessed unpredictable behaviour will worry about further political surprises if they buy VSNL stock. Set against this is the group's undoubted appeal as an investment. Not only does India - with only eight lines per thousand people compared with a global average of 100 lines - have great scope to develop its market; international traffic, over which VSNL has a 10-year monopoly, is the fastest-growing and most profitable part of the market. Provided ministers do not try again to over-price the issue, such attractions should persuade investors that buying shares is worth the risk.</p>

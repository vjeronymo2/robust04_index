			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Melnikova and Yuriy </F> Sizov]    [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  has declared in his interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent  after the ceremony in which a package of bilateral documents  were signed: "The Russian-Latvian documents signed today in the  Kremlin have been elaborated with the full consent by the both  sides."    The head of the Russian state said that "as a whole, five  documents have been signed: the Treaty and four agreements in  which, in particular, the protection of servicemen was  determined and the question of pensioners and former servicemen  was solved."    Boris Yeltsin paid special attention to the treaty signed by  him and Guntis Ulmanis, which ensured the withdrawal of Russian  troops from the territory of Latvia. He said that "the final  date of the withdrawal was determined to be 31 August." In  addition he said that "the Russian side will try to do this as  soon as possible because we want children of the servicemen to  go to school in Russia already this 1 September."    The president also said that during the negotiations the  delegations of the both countries "worked on about 10 economic  documents as well." In this connection he underlined that "the  presidents of the two countries have reached an agreement that  the questions on free trade, the regime of the most favored  nations on a mutual and equal basis, taxation, tariffs, and  duties will be prepared by a special group and Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Riga where the signing  of these documents will take place."    Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis answered a question by the  ITAR-TASS correspondent and said that in one of the documents  signed today "we were talking about the regime of the most  favored nations between the two countries." He believes that  "this is a very valuable achievement." He said that  entrepreneurs of the both countries can now breathe freely  because, speaking frankly, the politics "minded its own  business, and the economy suffered from that."</p>

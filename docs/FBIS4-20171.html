			<p>BFN     [Text] Swedish Defence Minister Anders Bjoerck says this  neutral country is likely to join NATO's Partnership for Peace  programme next month. Bjoerck says the centre right  government's proposal to join the programme will probably pass  through parliament with little or no opposition. But the  defence minister adds, joining Partnership for Peace does not  mean Sweden is abandoning its traditional neutrality.    Fourteen countries--all East European states and former  Soviet republics--have so far signed up to join the scheme.  Another neutral Nordic country, Finland, has also said it will  join the programme. The other three Nordic countries--Denmark,  Norway and Iceland--are already full members of NATO.</p>

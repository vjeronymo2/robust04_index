			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Election puts lira under pressure Nervousness in the financial markets over the outcome of Sunday's run-offs in local elections put the lira under pressure again yesterday. The lira has been unsettled throughout the week because of continuing political uncertainties and doubts about the Ciampi government's ability to push the 1994 budget through parliament. Yesterday the lira was being traded below the pyschological barrier of L1,000 to the D-Mark; but then recovered to L998. The slight improvement was attributed to signs that the government had agreed how to tackle the 2,500 amendments tabled to the budget. This has increased the likelihood that the legislation, reducing the public sector deficit in 1994 to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product, would be approved before Christmas. However, the likely result in Sunday's local elections remained far from clear yesterday as the campaign closed. Opinion polls suggested candidates backed by alliances sponsored by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) would do well. But in Naples and Rome they are being closely challenged by the neo-fascist MSI. In either event the result will provide a further big shake-up in Italy's political landscape against the backdrop of early elections next spring. The first round on November 21 saw the collapse of the vote for the long ruling Christian Democrats and their allies. Sunday's elections cover almost 450 towns and cities and involve 11m voters, nearly a quarter of the electorate. The focus has been on Naples and Rome where the neo-fascist MSI has run a strong campaign picking up votes from the centre parties - especially the Christian Democrats and Socialists. Rome magistrates yesterday notified 22 journalists and technicians working for the RAI, the state-run television network, that there were under investigation for alleged fraud for L250m (Pounds 100,880). The move follows detailed inspection of expenses claims submitted by television crews covering trouble-spot news in former Yugoslavia and Somalia. It came on the day when the new RAI management unveiled unpopular news that the traditional Christmas bonus of an extra month's pay, due in early December, would be held over until the end of January to save L40bn to pay suppliers. The RAI is likely to lose L500bn this year and is in danger of being put into liquidation.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / 3i moves into fund management 3i, the UK's largest investment capital company, has raised a Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) fund for investment in continental Europe in a move that takes it for the first time into the business of managing funds for other institutions. The group will co-invest equity with the fund in unquoted investments mainly in France, Germany, Italy and Spain where it already has offices. Mr Neil Cross, international director, said the UK would remain 3i's core market. But moving into fund management was an 'important strategic venture' for 3i that would probably lead to other funds being raised and managed. The fund will be one of the largest ever raised for equity investment in continental Europe where the venture capital market is growing more quickly than the more mature UK market. 3i already makes about 25 per cent of its equity investments in continental Europe. It has invested Pounds 250m in some 200 continental European companies and believes it is already the leading independent private equity investor in France and Germany. Mr Cross said the group's capital base was not currently proving to be a constraint on that level of investment while the main European economies remained at the current levels, but by raising the fund the group had increased its flexibility. The fund will allow 3i more scope to syndicate deals and to structure more of the equity investments required in the growing European private equity market. 3i, which is owned by the UK clearing banks and the Bank of England, was due to float last year, but the issue was pulled after a number of the shareholders changed their minds. Yesterday's launch of 3i as a fund manager - a move which will boost the revenue stream in its profit and loss account - has sparked speculation that flotation might again be moving off the back burner. 3i's shareholders will have noticed that venture capital investment trusts are trading at discounts to asset value which are historically very small. Mr Cross denied the launch of the new European fund had anything to do with plans for a flotation which remained no more than a long-term objective. 3i, which is itself contributing Ecu100m to the fund, will have raised the Ecu300m from about nine institutions in Europe, east Asia and the US, a comparatively small number for the size of fund.</p>

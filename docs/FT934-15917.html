			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Money Markets: UK sees high liquidity THE UK money markets sailed through their fourth consecutive day of calm conditions as another unusually high shortage was taken out with no trouble at the start of official dealings. The high shortages have been created by the government's speedy exercise of its funding programme - so far it has raised some three quarters of its annual requirement through gilt sales and auctions and is only half way through the financial year. This anticipation has taken advantage of the exceptionally high price of government bonds, driven ever upwards by the seemingly insatiable appetite of overseas buyers. On the other hand, it has drained billions of pounds from the national balance sheet and left the clearing banks generally short of funds. However, as the third quarter drew to a close last week, the banks balanced their books and were able to operate with more flexibility. Yesterday's forecast shortage of Pounds 1.85bn, revised by the close of official dealing to Pounds 2bn, was the highest for a month but was nearly all taken out at the first opportunity. At the early round of assistance, the Bank of England bought Pounds 1.7bn of bills for resale to the market on October 27,28 and 29 at a rate of 5 29/32 per cent. This was followed shortly afterwards by a further Pounds 100m of assistance via Band One bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent. Among the main factors affecting the position were bills for repurchase by the market which were expected to take out Pounds 921m and Exchequer transactions which would remove another Pounds 555m. The Bank did not operate in the money market in the afternoon but came in with Pounds 70m of late assistance, which is carried out after official hours and carries an unspecified lending rate. The relaxed conditions allowed overnight rates to fall as low as 4 1/2 per cent at midday before climbing back above 6 per cent in the late afternoon. In the futures market, short sterling closed marginally higher at 94.35 with turnover of only 12,500 contracts. The German futures contract for three-month money traded on Liffe saw reasonable two-way business as the Bundesbank held rates unchanged. The December Euromark contract closed two basis points lower at 93.77 with 31,000 lots dealt.</p>

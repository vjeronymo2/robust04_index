			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Peshawar -- The Pakistan government Wednesday sealed  the border with the war-ravaged Afghanistan, rendering several  thousand Afghans stranded at Torkham.    Almost 10,000 uprooted Kabulis are waiting on the Afghan  side  of Torkham for the gates to open, informed eyewitness when  contacted by telephone. The figure appeared to be on the high  side but the number of people who reached Torkham was  substantial and had certainly grown to a few thousand by  Wednesday evening. Pakistani border guards estimated that more  than 66 vehicles which brought the refugees were also denied  entry and now parked on the Afghans side of the border.    The border was sealed on a day when Kabul was bombed at  least  seven times by Gen Rashid Dostam's warplanes and even the  relatively safe Khairkhana area in northern part of the city was  rocketed, killing 10 people and injuring many more.    Habibullah Khan, political agent, KHYBER AGENCY, told THE  NEWS that they had sealed the border on the instructions of the  federal government, which apparently communicated the decision  to the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] government Tuesday.  He said the Afghans possessing Pakistan's visa were being  allowed to enter Pakistan.    Beside Torkham, the second official crossing point between  Pakistan and Afghanistan is Chaman in Balochistan province. The  gates at the two border towns are opened at sunrise and closed  by sunset. There is a large number of other passes and routes  on the 1300-mile Durand Line which serves as a boundary between  the two neighbouring states. The border is long and porous and  cannot be policed.    A federal government official, requesting anonymity, while  confirming the sealing of the border, said the stage had come to  implement an administrative decision that was long overdue. He  said the decision was reached after exhaustive discussions and  weighing all pros and cons. We are willing to provide the  required support to the displaced Afghans in their own country,  he argued.    He said Pakistan with help from the UN and NGOs  [non-governmental organizations] had sent tents, flour and other  relief goods for the refugees in Jalalabad and would provide  more help once these people were resettled in camps set up in  Samarkhel and Dosaraka Hissarshahi.    Earlier in Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman had denied  reports about the closure of border. He, however, added that  Pakistan and the UN were trying to resettle the Afghans fleeing  the fighting in Kabul on Afghan territory. He also said 14,410  Afghans who entered Pakistan since the outbreak of hostilities  on New Year registered themselves. An unspecified number of new  arrivals, he added, had also come through other crossing points  on the border.    The federal government had taken a decision about sealing of  the border in the past as well but it was subsequently  withdrawn. It remains to be seen how serious is the government  in implementing this decision. In any case, the Afghans wanting  to enter Pakistan may use the other unofficial crossing points.    As the stranded Afghans prepared to spend a chilly winter  night at Torkham in miserable conditions, the closure of the  border also blocked the routine flow of hundreds of the people  from both countries across the border.    The federal government decision took the NWFP government by  surprise. Only a couple of days ago, the Foreign Office had  said no Afghan refugee would be turned back at Torkham. A  high-ranking provincial government officer, who wished  anonymity, wondered at the logic behind the sudden decision. He  recalled that 100,000 Afghans who crossed in to Pakistan after  the battles of Kabul last year were all accommodated in NWFP  without putting much burden on the government. He argued that  most of them were settled in camps vacated by the repatriating  refugees while a substantial number took up residence with  relations and friends in Peshawar. The new arrivals, he  pointed, too were from Kabul and would like to live in Peshawar  or other urban centres in the province.    Meanwhile, reports from Kabul said Dostam's aircraft bombed  Rabbani government installations in the capital and in Charikar,  Jebel-us-Straj and Bagram. The Television hillock was another  target for these jet-fighters, which reportedly flew from  Mazar-e Sharif.    Radio Kabul, which had gone off the air on the first day of  the ongoing battle for Kabul on January 1, resumed its  broadcasts Wednesday on another frequency.</p>

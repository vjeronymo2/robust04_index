			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE A REGULAR JOE  </P> <P> Joe Flanagan, who holds the career scoring record for the Cal State Dominguez  Hills soccer team, has found it difficult to get into a game in his first  professional season with the Los Angeles Heat. He has started two games, played  in six and has scored only one goal.  </P> <P> But when the Heat, who have had difficulty scoring goals, play the California  Emperors on Saturday at 3 p.m. at the University of Redlands, Flanagan might  prove to be a pivotal player, as he was on Monday against Real Santa Barbara. A  surprise starter in the midfield, he created several opportunities for his  teammates as the Heat won, 2-1.  </P> <P> Flanagan also got the start in the ensuing mini-game that the Heat won, 1-0.  </P> <P> "He was steady," general manager Jill Fracisco said. "He didn't let anyone  down. He made no major errors."  </P> <P> The winner of the L.A.-California game, which decides the Southern Division  title of the American Professional Soccer League West, advances to play the  Northern Division champion in a home-and-home series. The Heat (11-9) twice  defeated the Emperors (10-10) in overtime this season, but California has won  seven consecutive games since losing to the Heat on July 1.  </P> <P> The Emperors climbed out of the cellar to win the Southern Division title. The  Heat, which briefly fell into last place as California moved upward, clawed  back and finished second. Despite having a poorer overall record, the Emperors  scored three more goals than the Heat to win the division title.  </P> <P> Scoring goals in playoff games is always more difficult because teams often sit  back and bunch in front of the net. Scoring hasn't been the Heat's forte all  season. In 20 regular season games, L.A. managed only 29 goals, although in its  past four games it has scored 10. Flanagan will try to add to that, one way or  another.  </P> <P> "I think the thing I offer the Heat is that I give them my best work rate," he  said. "I want to make a difference, whatever it is, I just don't want to go out  on the field and be a statistic."  </P> <P> The Heat will be without spirited defender Danny Pena, who will sit out the  game because he has accumulated five yellow cards. Also expected to miss the  game is midfielder Mike Getchell, another player with five yellow cards. The  Heat filed a protest over the Getchell matter, but should he be unavailable, it  will more than likely be Flanagan who starts at center half.  </P> <P> "This is my chance," Flanagan said. "It's the thing I dream about."  </P> <P> Flanagan has heard his name shouted from the stands several times this year as  he took his seat on the Heat bench. South Bay soccer fans remember his scoring  prowess at West Torrance High and Cal State Dominguez Hills, where he scored 38  career goals and in 1988 helped the Toros to a share of the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. title.  </P> <P> Fracisco insists Flanagan's time will come.  </P> <P> "With all the very talented players we have on this team, it's unfortunate that  anyone has to sit," she said. "Joe has proven against top professional players  that he can play (in practice). He has really come around."  </P> <P> Against California, Flanagan has extra incentive. He would like nothing better  than to collect a ball in the midfield, dribble up the middle and turn toward  the goal from 15 yards out. He would see goalkeeper Chris Wilson, a former high  school and college teammate.  </P> <P> "I know Chris and he knows me," said Flanagan. "I would love nothing better  than to stick one in the back of the net."  </P> <P> They remain the best of friends. Earlier this summer they worked together at  youth soccer camps and Flanagan spent much of his free time this past week with  Wilson.  </P> <P> "It's odd that all the time we were together in high school and college we  never got to play together in the playoffs," Flanagan said. "But here we are,  our first year out of college and we will be playing against each other."  </P> <P> Even if he does not play Saturday, Flanagan thinks he has solidified his future  as a professional player. He also thinks the Heat can continue its winning  ways.  </P> <P> "We need to be creating things, playing within our roles, not overdoing  things." he said.  </P> <P> Flanagan is just hoping to have a chance to contribute to a victory.  </P></p>

But if it is not required under section 177,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the OTC recommends that the ``individual States within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic incentives designed to increase the sales of ZEVs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the programs they adopt.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The effective date for the OTC LEV program would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996, allowing two vehicle model years prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability of the standards in 1999, but does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude earlier State implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

That bill, as introduced, established an ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport region for the Northeast, and incorporated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures specified for general transport regions under what was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finally enacted as section 176A of the Act. That provision in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the House bill did not involve a plan for specific additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control measures. See H.R. 3030 at 92&hyph;93 and 49 (July 27, 1989),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reprinted in 2 1990 Legislative History of the Clean Air Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1990, 103rd Cong., 1st. sess. (Nov. 1993)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (hereinafter ``1990 Legislative History'') at 3828&hyph;29 and 3785.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The House committee then marked-up H.R. 3030 to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions as finally enacted. See H.R. Rep't No. 101&hyph;490, part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. at 527&hyph;28 (May 17, 1989), reprinted in 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 Legislative History at 3551&hyph;52. It described the bill as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing ``a public procedure and structure'' for an OTC to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmit recommendations to EPA and explained that EPA's response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``should be buttressed by supporting material.'' It further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated, ``The Committee expects that the Administrator's review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional control measures recommended by an ozone transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commission will fully acknowledge and respond to the dimensions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the transport problems addressed by the commission's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations.'' The report also set out the timetable for EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response within nine months, and for EPA to issue a finding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP inadequacy ``[u]pon full or partial approval'' followed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States' SIP revisions within one year. H.R. Rep't. No. 101&hyph;490  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 256, reprinted in 2 1990 Legislative History at 3280.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Senate bill, in contrast, as introduced provided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commission could, without any independent EPA review or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval, ``after notice and opportunity for comment, require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional control measures to be applied within such transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region if the commission determines such measures are necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to bring all areas in such region into attainment by the dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by this subpart.'' See S. 1630, 101st Cong., 1st Sess.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Sept. 4, 1989), reprinted in 5 1990 Legislative History at 9111.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Senate bill, as introduced, was amended in committee to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for EPA review of an OTC ``plan'' for additional control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures. Under the Senate committee mark-up, the OTC could,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after notice and comment, develop a plan for additional control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures for the OTR, and would then transmit the plan to EPA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. The committee then included the general framework for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA review that survives in section 184 as enacted, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's obligation to explain any disapproval and recommend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives. The bill differed from the statute as enacted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, in that: (1) EPA was obligated to state in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice upon receipt of the plan that ``written data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> views, or comments on the plan may be submitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator within ninety days beginning on the receipt date''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but was not obligated to conduct a public hearing; (2) EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period to determine whether to approve the plan was 120 days,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than nine months; and (3) the bill provided that the plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be deemed approved if the Administrator failed to act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 120 days. The Senate committee mark-up also included the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism for implementation whereby EPA would issue a finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the States' plans were inadequate, and that the finding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require the States to revise their SIPs to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved additional control measures within one year after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding is issued.

No. 101&hyph;228, 101st Cong., 1st  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sess., at 34 and 610&hyph;11 (Dec. 20, 1989), reprinted in 5 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Legislative History at 8950&hyph;51. This version was reported out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee to the full Senate.

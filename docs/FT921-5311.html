			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Saudi seeks 14% of Citicorp A SAUDI Arabian prince has asked the US Federal Reserve for permission to convert Dollars 590m of preferred stock in Citicorp, the US's largest bank, into common shares, making him the biggest single Citicorp shareholder, with over 14 per cent of the bank. Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal has asked to be allowed to convert the preferred stock into a further 9.6 per cent of Citicorp common, while retaining a separate 4.8 per cent common equity stake he already owns. If the Fed agrees, this would boost the Saudi's overall stake to nearly 14.4 per cent, larger than the 8.05 per cent shareholding owned by Wellington Management, a Boston-based investor presently the biggest single Citicorp shareholder. The Federal Reserve confirmed it received the request, but would not comment on it. In February 1991, when Prince Al-Waleed invested Dollars 590m in the convertible Citicorp shares, he told the Federal Reserve he would file a notice if he wished to retain his 4.8 per cent of common stock as well as the preferred paper. Under the terms of the agreement, the Saudi cannot own over 15 per cent of Citicorp for the next four years.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Devalued dividends It is perfectly understandable that the knee-jerk response of the equity market to devaluation should have been to mark sharply equities higher. Equally understandable is that the rate of advance should slow as investors start to take stock. The market managed to put on only 32 points over the past week. Obviously recovery is going to be a slow process. While the outlook for corporate earnings is better than it was before, it is still for fairly modest growth through next year. Dividends may rise more slowly still. At around 1.8 times, average dividend cover for the market as a whole is well below the 2.5 level regarded as normal during the 1980s. The devaluation effect on earnings will scarcely be immediate, even for export companies, as these frequently hedge their exposure in advance. There may be some instant relief on the interest bill. Otherwise the outlook for the rest of 1992 has barely changed. It would take a pretty strong recovery next year for earnings to rise as much as 20 per cent. Even then companies would then have to confine dividend growth to around 7 per cent to bring the payout ratio back over 2. Some companies that might otherwise have been expected to cut their payout may now maintain it. The signal function of dividends could become doubly important when earnings figures are distorted by the new accounting rules. There is also an argument that companies can afford to live with a low payout ratio in a period of relatively high growth and rising prices. That theory may be tested eventually, but there is unlikely to be much economic revival in the air when final dividends for 1992 are declared next spring.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- The Russian Foreign  Ministry "is not fully satisfied" with the content of  yesterday's resolution of the U.N. Security Council to prolong  the U.N. observer mission mandate in Georgia, head of the  Russian Foreign Ministry's information and press department  Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here today.    In the opinion of the Russian side, the mere prolongation of  the mission mandate "can hardly be viewed as an adequate answer  to the moderate but real progress achieved at Geneva  negotiations in December 1993 and January 1994, repeated  requests of the Georgian and Abkhazian side to send peace-makers  to the conflict zone, and the real situation in the region."    Karasin expressed regret with the "lack of worthy response  to  Russian proposals of a genuine peace-making operation in  Abkhazia". Further delay in such decision objectively confirms  the current status quo -- isolation of Abkhazia and Georgia --  and freezes the soonest and safe return of refugees, which is a  key humanitarian and political problem.    In the opinion of the Russian diplomat, this policy reduces  chances for an agreement on political status of Abkhazia and  increases the risk of a new bloodshed as result of spontaneous  actions of refugees and displaced persons, whose number has  reached 200,000 in the conflict zone. Karasin believes this  reality should be foreseen.    "We are convinced that the introduction of peace-makers in  the conflict zone is the only chance to achieve regional  stabilization and create a real basis for final political  settlement of the conflict, including the establishment of a  political status of Abkhazia," he said.    In the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the mere  beginning of a peace-making operation throughout Abkhazia by  U.N. forces or other peace-makers authorized by the United  Nations may create conditions for the implementation of  agreements on lasting settlement by the warring sides. On its  part, Russia is ready to make a positive answer to the sides'  requests for its participation in the operation.    Karasin expressed the hope the U.N. secretariat will timely  consider military-technical, financial and other aspects of a  peace-making operation in Abkhazia in accordance with the U.N.  Security Council's resolution of January 31, 1994, in order to  enable members of the Security Council to discuss the operation  in detail and decide on its beginning.</p>

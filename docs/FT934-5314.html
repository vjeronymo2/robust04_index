			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Long gilts climb as traders digest falling oil prices European government bonds were little changed in thin trade ahead of today's UK Budget and the Bundesbank's announcement of its latest round of securities repurchase agreements. UK gilts had a mixed day as traders prepared for today's Budget and the Bank of England's gilts auction announcement. The long end of the yield curve put on the strongest performance, underpinned partly by the continuing decline in oil prices. London futures for Brent crude oil fell below Dollars 14 per barrel for the first time in five years following Opec's decision not to cut output quotas. 'This is a further factor indicating that inflationary pressures will stay subdued through 1994,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilts analyst at UBS. The 10-year sector was overshadowed by next Wednesday's gilts auction. The Bank of England will announce the terms and amount of the auction at 3.30pm today. Most dealers are betting on another Pounds 3bn-Pounds 3.25bn of the 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 2004. 'That would add liquidity to the issue, which should become next year's 10-year benchmark,' said one gilts trader. The long gilt futures contract ended at 116 1/32 , up  3/16 point. German government bonds erased their early gains to end broadly unchanged on the day. The December bund contract on Liffe closed at 99.97, up 0.05 point from Friday but off its intra-day high at 100.17. Prices were underpinned early by firmness in the US Treasuries market, but late profit-taking in the futures pits dragged bunds lower into the close. Following the Bundesbank's fixed-rate repo at 6.25 per cent last week, some dealers expect another fixed-rate repo at the same rate today to dampen easing speculation ahead of Thursday's council meeting as a variable-rate tender might tempt banks to test for a lower repo rate. However, others argued that recent tight money market conditions, which necessitated the injection of extra liquidity via two-day repos yesterday, might mean the repo rate would remain close to 6.25 per cent even if bidding was at variable rates. The rally in longer-dated US Treasury securities continued yesterday, as further declines in oil prices offset fresh evidence of a stronger economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 100 11/32 , yielding 6.221 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 4.151 per cent. Prices firmed from the start at the long end, thanks to another big decline in oil prices. They have been falling since last week, when Opec failed to reach an agreement on production cuts. This, along with declines in other commodities, have helped spark a much-needed rally in bonds. At one point, the 30-year bond was up  3/4 , but afternoon profit-taking brought the issue down, and pushed the yield back above 6.2 per cent. If it were not for falling oil prices, the market probably would have reacted badly to yesterday's news that existing home sales rose 3.6 per cent in October. French bonds outperformed bunds in quiet trading, boosted by the continuing appreciation of the franc, which hit its highest level against the D-Mark since the August 2 revamp of Europe's exchange rate mechanism. Despite the franc's strength, the Bank of France left its 6.45 per cent intervention rate unchanged at its latest repo operation, and is expected to refrain from easing key interest rates until the Bundesbank moves again. Japanese government bonds posted more gains following yet another slide in stock prices. The March JGB contract rose 0.22 point to 115.12. Sentiment was slightly dampened by supply worries ahead of today's JGB auction, and fears that some banks may offload bond positions ahead of the year end to make up for losses incurred in the stock market. However, in the longer term, 'the outlook is still very bullish for Japanese bonds,' said Mr Stuart Thomson, senior economist with Nikko Europe. He expects the yield on the benchmark bond to fall to 2.75 per cent by next June from some 3.45 per cent currently.</p>

The Chairman as CEO, after consultation with the other Board members, is responsible for appraising the performance of the COO, the Inspector General, the Director of OCPA, the Director of OSMO, and the EEO Officer.

Pre-Confirmation Travel <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Travel expenses incurred by an FCA Board nominee that are solely for the purpose of attending his or her Senate confirmation hearings will be considered personal expense of the nominee and will not be reimbursed by FCA. However, consistent with existing General Accounting Office interpretations, the FCA will pay for a nominee's travel expenses to the Washington, DC metropolitan area (including lodging and subsistence), if payment is approved, in advance whenever practicable, by the Chairman or Acting Chairman based on a determination that the nominee's travel is related to official business that will result in a substantial benefit to the FCA. That determination will be made on a case-by-case basis and is within the sole discretion of the Chairman or Acting Chairman. The same standards and policies that apply to the reimbursement of Board members' travel expenses will apply to the reimbursement of nominee's expenses. As part of the documentation for the approval process, the Chairman or Acting Chairman must execute a written finding that a nominee's travel would substantially benefit the FCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Travel that may result in substantial benefit to the FCA could include meetings, briefings, conferences, or other similar encounters between the nominee and FCA Board members, office directors, other senior agency officials, or other senior congressional and executive branch officials, for the purpose of developing substantive knowledge about the FCA, its role, its interaction with other Government entities, or the institutions that it regulates. Meetings or briefings of this nature may enable a nominee to more quickly and effectively assume leadership of the agency after confirmation by the Senate and could thus substantially benefit the agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2. Board Member Relocation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Board members will be reimbursed by FCA for travel and transportation expenses incurred in connection with relocation to their first official duty station. Expenses for which reimbursement will be allowed generally include, but are not limited to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Travel and per diem for the Board member; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Travel, but not per diem for immediate family of the Board member; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Mileage if privately owned vehicle is used in travel; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Transportation and temporary storage of household goods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each relocation will be considered separately and all rates and allowances will be determined at the time of authorization, notwithstanding the limitations of 5 U.S.C., Chapter 57 and the Federal Travel Regulations. Reimbursement of additional expenses may be authorized if warranted by specific circumstances. Board members will be issued a specific prior written authorization by the Chief of the Human Resources Division detailing the expenses that may be reimbursed and will be required to execute a one year service agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3. Representation and Reception <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, authorizes the expenditure of Farm Credit Administration (FCA) funds for official representation and reception expenses. Expenditures of funds for official representation and reception expenses shall not exceed any statutory limitation placed on the expenditure of such funds. Additionally, use of the representation and reception fund is discretionary and the Board may determine in any fiscal year that it will spend no funds for official representation and reception activities. Furthermore, the official representation and reception fund shall be a fund of last resort and shall not be used for expenditures that can properly be classified as another type of agency expenditure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All expenditures of funds for official representation and reception expenses shall be in accordance with the guidelines contained in this rule. Furthermore, all such expenditures shall be consistent with the decisions of the Comptroller General of the United States pertaining to official representation and reception expenses, except that no expenditure of representation and reception funds shall be made for paying expenses of FCA or other Federal Government employees at any official representation and reception function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

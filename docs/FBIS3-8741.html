According to the paper, the Slovak Information Service (SIS)  did not offer jobs to former members of the Federal Security and  Information Service [FIS] who had undergone training in Western  intelligence services but, quite the contrary, has employed  several former State Security Corps [communist-era secret  service] members.    Because of the operation of a permanent Russian intelligence  adviser with the SIS, the Slovak secret service disqualifies  itself from close cooperation with the secret services of  Western countries and reduces this cooperation to the mere  exchange of essential information. The new Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service, which is a direct successor to the First  KGB Administration, is identical to its predecessor in terms of  staff, the paper writes, adding that "SIS members will be  dealing with essentially the same people as under Brezhnev." In  this context, the daily draws attention to the fact that the  seizure of power by the communists and the enforcement of  Moscow's will in the former socialist countries after World War  II had also been anticipated by agents and advisers of the  former NKVD [People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs,  predecessor of the KGB] occupying the ministries of interior and  the secret services.    According to Yevgeniy Primakov, chief of the Russian Foreign  Intelligence Service, and his Slovak interlocutors, cooperation  between the two services will be geared mainly toward the  struggle against terrorist and drug mafias. The daily points  out, however, that the Law on the Russian Federation Foreign  Intelligence Service does not provide for such activity.  "Rather, this is a matter for counterintelligence," PRACA adds.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Away days, off days IT PROBABLY won't surprise you that on Thursday I was called back to see the sports minister, following my bumptious prediction nine days ago that London, rather than Manchester, was bound to win the go-ahead to mount Britain's bid to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000. 'Bit of a wrong steer, wasn't it?' said the sports minister crossly, blowing his whistle and firing his starter's gun. 'Just a teensy bit addled, your notion that London was home and dry and that Manchester - 'provincial,' you called it - was too dire a place to win the nod in this week's vote by the British Olympic Association?' I still haven't caught the man's name. But I am confident that he is the sports minister, given that on Thursday he was wearing another range of vestments and accessories, among them a boxer's head-guard, a hockey club blazer, tennis shorts, running shoes and an archer's quiver (containing, I chanced to notice, two wickedly barbed arrows). As before, the minister was attended by his political secretary, a fresh-faced youth who looks like, but is not, a founding member of the Bruges group. 'If you are going to be our Olympic consultant and receive from us Pounds 300 daily in return for guiding us through the minefield of the full-scale bidding process in September 1993,' said the minister, 'then we want our money's worth - not some yuppified drawly-pawly about the shocking commercialism of the modern-day Olympics; or how the Games of 2000 will be an opportunity for the planet to revert to paganism; or telling us the number of Games you have personally attended; or regaling us with reasons why London was favourite to win the UK vote just because you, in all your splendour, had never visited Manchester because you've been too busy island-hopping in the eastern Caribbean and hadn't actually realised that in this day and age Manchester is served by motorways - yes, actually has motorways, plus a prize-winning airport - and that the pushy Duke of Westminster was in fact a racing certainty to win the bid for Manchester and thus blow your predictions clear out of the water. Anyway, I saw you described this week as the FT's racing correspondent. Is that what you really do?' 'Minister,' I replied. 'You mustn't believe everything you read in Private Eye. It makes things up, you know. Plucks them from the air. Puts words in people's mouths. My tasks at the FT are in truth wide-ranging. Because I am cheerful and energetic I write on many topics. Racing is one of them, albeit a minor one. Ditto the Olympics. You name it, I write it - cheerfully, with vigour, and with fashionable intellectualism. In sentences short or long, depending on requirements. As for my prediction that London, not Manchester, would win this week's vote - well, we all have our off-days. 'Anyway,' I added, 'for Pounds 300 a day you are buying my advice. Rudery is more expensive. I can be insulted, but the cost is prohibitive. Ask those who've tried.' 'All right,' said the minister, reloading his starter's gun and signalling to his political secretary - 'Hurry up, Julian: please stop dithering' - to pour more coffee. 'No doubt your remarks last week about the government apply just as forcibly to Manchester as to London,' said the sports minister. 'The government has got to get its finger out. No more wobbling. Billions more on infrastructure. Support Manchester to the hilt and make the Games of 2000 an opportunity for national resurrection. So . . . who have we got to watch? Who is going to want the Olympics even more desperately than Manchester?' I said: 'We can forget Peking. Can you imagine what it would be like if the marathon runners lined up and the communists simply shot them? Or if the Chinese called out the tanks the moment some running-dog weightlifter was caught taking drugs? Those boys need their medicines. What weightlifters do is so intrinsically silly that they have to be high. 'We can also forget Milan. Ditto Brasilia. Also Belgrade. Which leaves Sydney and Berlin - wonderful cities, formidable rivals, money no object. They're the ones to beat. But Manchester is wily. Also determined. It will more than punch its weight. Study their documentation and you will see it stated that 'Manchester is the city where Mr Rolls and Mr Royce met and decided to build cars; the atom was first split; the first commercial computer was developed; flash photography was first used; the first British plane flew.' Did you know those things?' 'No,' said the sports minister. 'Like you, I've never been to Manchester. We're at the start of our learning curve. Julian, ring Intercity. We want three first-class tickets - sleepers, if necessary, it's probably quite far, God knows how we get there. Ring the Duke of Westminster. Tell him we'll join him for tea. Then we'll fly to Berlin, then on to Sydney, returning via Brasilia. If a job's worth doing, it is worth doing properly.' And again, he fired his starter's gun. * * * SOME TIME ago I wrote a grumpy column about my non-winning premium bonds, saying that I believed that the authorities thought me dead and had removed my numbers from the ones they feed each month to their computer. How wrong I was. This week I received a gaily-hued cheque from National Savings to the tune of Pounds 50, in respect of bond number 1GP 319934. I half expected a jaunty note from the chief of National Savings to the effect that their computer was back to normal after some mid-life crisis and that I could anticipate a steady stream of cheques - but you cannot ask for everything. In the meantime, to the hundreds of readers who wrote to me with pathetic tales about non-winning premium bonds, I can only say - Tough.</p>

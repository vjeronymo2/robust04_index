			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / EC's limit on duty-free gifts doubled EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday doubled the value of duty-free gifts which travellers within the Community will be able to bring home from the beginning of next year. The ministers agreed to increase the outdated Ecu45 (Pounds 35) limit on duty-free purchases of watches, camera equipment and other gifts, to Ecu90. They also increased the tax-free allowances for gifts bought outside the Community from Ecu45 to Ecu175. Yesterday's deal leaves the allowances for duty-free wine, spirits and tobacco unchanged, but it will provide a consolation for EC duty-free shops as they wind up their EC activities. Duty-free shopping on journeys within the Community will end on June 30, 1999. The European Commission had resisted prolonging duty-free sales within the EC, because it believed limits would be difficult to enforce once internal controls on goods were abolished on January 1, 1993. However, ministers agreed last year that duty-free shops could police the system themselves until its abolition in 1999. German objections to an increase in duty-free limits were overcome yesterday, after ministers agreed that Germany could enforce lower travellers' allowances at borders with Poland and the Czech Republic to avoid fraud. Ministers also discussed ways of harmonising tax on investments and savings across the Community, although such a system is some way off. In 1989, the Commission proposed harmonising such taxes at 15 per cent to end the flight of private savings to EC countries with low or non-existent taxes. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance minister, who chaired the meeting, said an existing working group would now examine how to build a system which could include countries where tax is withheld at source, and countries which oblige banks to declare interest earned on savings.</p>

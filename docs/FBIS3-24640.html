			<p>Acknowledging  problems in implementing the January 1992 Sino-U.S.  memorandum of understanding (MOU) on protecting intellectual  property rights (IPR) in China, Beijing has announced new steps  to enhance its protection of IPR, while also warning Washington  not to make the issue an obstacle to better trade relations.  Reflecting this dual approach, Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, in remarks to a press conference on  28 January, took Washington to task for its alleged criticism of  China's IPR protection efforts.  Complaining that the United  States "does not understand" China's "positive measures" on IPR  protection, she pointedly noted that the "level of IPR  protection" in China has "surpassed the average world level"  (Beijing TV, 28 January).  Wu went on to warn Washington not to  make compliance with the MOU the focus of a "trade dispute" with  China, saying that would be "extremely unwise for the U.S.  Government to apply pressure" on China.   At the same time, Wu indicated that Beijing recognizes the need  to  continue to respond to the "demands" of foreign countries as  well as to the growing internal pressures from its own market  reforms for better IPR protection.  Announcing new steps to  enhance Chinese protection efforts, she said that Beijing will  begin a "universal" education campaign to enable "people across  the country at different levels" to understand the "importance"  of IPR protection.  In addition, Wu indicated that Beijing will  "actively suggest" that IPR courts be established in "some key  cities."  A 31 January report on Wu's press conference in  Beijing's English-language paper China Daily indicated that the  drive to establish special IPR courts has already begun, noting  that "last week" a "patent court" had been set up in Haikou in  Haninan Province.  Last August, Beijing's official press agency  Xinhua had reported on initial efforts to set up a legal  structure to handle IPR violations, announcing the establishment  of a new court in Beijing to deal with IPR disputes.

The Confederation of British Industry [CBI] yesterday joined  most other economic forecasters in predicting that the economy  was poised for only modest growth -- 2.3 per cent this year and  2.4 per cent next year.    The CBI said the downward revisions from last November's  forecasts -- 2.4 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively  reflected the expected impact of tax rises and cuts in public  spending in the next two years.    Meanwhile, its latest industrial trends survey showed that  the net proportion of companies assessing order books as below  normal is the least negative since September 1989. Some 19 per  cent reported their books to be above normal, while 30 per cent  said they were below. The negative balance of 11 per cent  compares favourably with negative balances of 21 per cent and 36  per cent in January and February last year.    Export order books are also significantly better than they  were a year ago, although there has been no improvement since  December, suggesting a rise in home demand.    The survey, carried out between January 24 and February 16,  covered 1,360 of the UK's biggest manufacturers, which account  for about half of manufactured exports.    It shows that slightly more companies expect to increase  domestic prices in the next four months than to reduce them.  The CBI expects inflation to reach 3.1 per cent by the end of  this year and 3.7 per cent by the end of next year. The  underlying measure which excludes mortgage interest payments --  will stay within the governments 1 per cent to 4 per cent target  range, but nearer to the top end.    Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director, said:  "Last November's Budget introduced a more restrictive stance on  personal taxation than we had previously anticipated. This has  contributed to our downward revision of growth in national  output."    He added that the tax changes had altered the composition of  economic growth. Consumer spending was now expected to rise  moderately this year and next, but this would depend on  individuals running down their savings to offset the slow growth  in take-home pay.    The CBI expects the balance of payments to stay flat this  year at about 9.7bn pounds -- compared with 9.5bn pounds last  year -- as recovery in continental Europe leads to a rise in  exports. Unemployment will fall only slowly.    It stressed that a big risk to the forecasts was uncertainty  about the way in which the economy was likely to respond to the  spring tax rises. Although the forecast assumes that consumer  spending will continue to rise, the CBI pointed out that  consumers could turn out to be more cautious than expected.</p>

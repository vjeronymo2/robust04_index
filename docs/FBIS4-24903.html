			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (AFP)--China appeared to leave the  door open Thursday [2 June] to possibile sanctions against  Pyongyang, while reaffirming its commitment to resolving the  Korean nuclear crisis through negotiation. Fresh "difficulties"  had emerged in resolving the crisis but "I don't think things  have yet reached a point where the final resort has to be  adopted," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofeng, giving  the first indication that sanctions might be an option if the  situation on the Korean peninsula deteriorates further.  However, Shen stressed that "at this time" Beijing was opposed  "to resorting to means that might sharpen the confrontation."    The row over the nature of North Korea's nuclear programme  intensified recently after Pyongyang rejected a request by the  UN Security Council to suspend the removal of fuel rods from a  five- megawatt reactor, suspected by the United States of being  a nuclear bomb factory.    Shen said China's stance that the dispute should be solved  through negotiation "remains unchanged." "I believe that as  long as the parties concerned remain calm ... the difficulty is  likely to be overcome," he added.    North Korea issued a new threat Thursday to withdraw from  the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if the United Nations and  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continued to  pressure Pyongyang to accede to their nuclear inspection  demands. The IAEA says the fuel rod operation at the Yongbyon  reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang, is crucial  for determining whether any plutonium has been secretly diverted  for military use.</p>

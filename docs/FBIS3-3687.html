The Ecuadorian president is scheduled to pay a state visit  to  China from March 18 to 23 at the invitation of Chinese President  Jiang Zemin.    President Duran Ballen attaches importance to the visit and  is expected to exchange views on bilateral ties and issues of  common interest with the Chinese leadership, said Cesar Roman  Gonzalez, Ecuadorian ambassador to China, in an interview with  XINHUA.    The visit is aimed at deepening mutual understanding,  enhancing friendly co-operation and developing economic and  trade ties between the two countries.    Ecuadorian businessmen will accompany the president on the  trip and discuss co-operation with their Chinese partners,  Gonzalez said.    Since the setting up of diplomatic ties between the two  countries in 1980, the co-operative relations of friendship,  based on mutual respect and understanding, have made steady  headway, the ambassador noted.    As a developing country, Ecuador practises reform and  opening  policies, and is seeking more investment from the outside, he  said.    Ecuador wishes to promote more extensive economic and trade  ties with China, he stressed.    "Our bilateral co-operation is at the beginning of a new  phase," Gonzalez said, expressing the belief that the bilateral  ties have bright prospects for development.</p>

Sources said  the meeting was expected to endorse IFP President Mangosuthu  Buthelezi's proposal for provisional registration, pending  international mediation on the constitutional deadlock.    Friday's meeting also follows the ANC's acceptance of  mediation, opening the way for Inkatha's registration before the  Friday midnight deadline.    Central Committee members were tight-lipped on their arrival  for the 10AM Ulundi meeting. IFP sources said on Thursday  however that details of mediation and the time period remaining  for electioneering would also come under the spotlight at the  meeting.    Inkatha officials said it could last several hours.</p>

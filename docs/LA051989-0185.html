			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS PULSE;  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS IN ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> THEIR GIFTS TO CHARITY ARE NO SMALL AFFAIR;  </P> <P> MODEST BANK ACCOUNTS, BIG HEARTS ADD UP TO SIZABLE CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> One day each month, Thomas Gaglio and a crew of fellow beauticians from the  Thomas Jsalon in Newport Beach head to Orangewood Children's Foundation for a  day of hair styling. The clients: abused and neglected children, 20 to 40 at a  time. The bill: $00.00.  </P> <P> It's a service that Orangewood might not get otherwise, said William G.  Steiner, Orangewood's director. And for the recipients, it's not just a matter  of money. "Many of these girls have been molested," Steiner said. "This is  tremendous in increasing their self-esteem, just this one activity."  </P> <P> A Thomas J cut normally costs about $35, and the value of the services the  salon donates to Orangewood averages $12,600 per year. That's not a huge sum  compared to the six-figure charitable contributions made by many big  corporations. But it's a lot for Gaglio.  </P> <P> Like many small-business owners, Gaglio's heart is bigger than his bank  account. And any gift he gives or service he provides represents a bigger  commitment than a similar donation from a big company. But he gives anyway. And  he's not alone.  </P> <P> From laboratory tests to loaves of bread, hair ribbons to auto repairs, lima  beans to cold cash, donations from Orange County's small business community  flow into the region's charitable organizations in a strong and steady stream.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $4.6 Million From Corporations  </P> <P> "I think small businesses do give a lot," said Tom Hassell, vice president for  resource development at the United Way of Orange County. "They give a lot at  the neighborhood level. If you could do an accurate survey of all of the small  businesses . . . I suspect you'd find most are giving of their dollars and  their services, as well."  </P> <P> But no one has ever done such a survey, said Nathan Weber, editor and publisher  of Giving USA: The Annual Report on Overall Philanthropy. Total contributions  of cash, products and services from the large corporations included in the  report were estimated at $4.6 billion in 1987, the most recent year for which  statistics are available.  </P> <P> Unlike their big-business counterparts, smaller firms are not equipped with  multimillion-dollar charity budgets. In fact, in Orange County, 82% of all  small businesses ultimately fail; many others have trouble meeting payroll and  paying bills.  </P> <P> "The poorer you are, the more difficult it is to give," Weber said. "That's  naturally the case."  </P> <P> Yet small businesses give, for reasons ranging from the philanthropic to the  pragmatic.  </P> <P> Michael Anderson, president of Anderson Asphalt Paving in Santa Ana, figures he  donates between $5,000 and $6,000 each year to such groups as El Modena  Community Center in Orange, Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana and Share Our  Selves in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "It's not a great amount, but it's what we can do," Anderson said. "My favorite  of anyone is SOS. I think that SOS does the real work that needs doing. They  feed and clothe people."  </P> <P> Gaglio, who was introduced to Orangewood through clients who support the  foundation, said he gives of his time because foundation children bring him  back to the real world.  </P> <P> "In our industry, we get caught up in this fast-paced Orange County life  style," said Gaglio, whose 12-year-old salon has 26 employees. "But being there  at Orangewood, it's real. . . . This is something that feels incredible  compared to charity balls and luncheons."  </P> <P> At the same time, fund-raising experts note that many companies donating their  products are creating new markets by exposing more people to their goods and  increasing their name recognition. Or they are able to clear out unwanted  inventory that would otherwise be tossed in the trash.  </P> <P> For example, Sun Glass Products, a Fullerton manufacturing firm, has donated  about 7,000 hair ribbons, barrettes and curlers to the Southwest Community  Center in Santa Ana over the past 3 years.  </P> <P> "We had some merchandise that we wanted to get rid of," said Jessie Coffman,  assistant manager. "We thought that giving it to a charity would be a fast way  to do that. I thought this might help our cause and their cause."  </P> <P> Paul Kong owns Pain Dore, a French bakery that opened in 1982 on the edge of  Little Saigon. Nearly six years later, the bakery started to make a small  profit, and it's been in the black for about 18 months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Free Laboratory Tests  </P> <P> Kong spends 7 days a week at the retail store and nearby factory, churning out  French rolls and baguettes for hotels, supermarkets and individual customers.  And 7 days a week, a battered truck rolls up to the back door of Pain Dore at  11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., loads loaves and departs.  </P> <P> This truck, however, doesn't head to the Holiday Inn or Man Wah market. Twice a  week, the truck trundles over to Abrazar Elderly Assistance, a senior center in  Westminster. On other days it makes trips to other agencies. Kong figures that  he sends Abrazar alone more than 100-day-old loaves per day, worth about $100.  </P> <P> "In place of throwing away, I give it to somebody who needs it," Kong says. "It  makes me happy that someone who needs it and has nothing to eat has something.  I can't sell all the bread. I prefer to give it to the people who need it."  </P> <P> Jay R. Stern is another small-business operator who can't afford to make cash  contributions. But the services he provides are just as valuable: an estimated  $12,000 to $15,000 worth of free laboratory tests for Share Our Selves Free  Medical Clinic in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Stern is a partner in Specialty Medical Laboratory, a clinical lab in Garden  Grove that employs 28 full-time and part-time workers.  </P> <P> Four years ago, when the SOS clinic opened, Stern was asked to teach clinic  workers how to draw patients' blood and do simple laboratory tasks. The clinic  wanted to start its own lab, said acting director Vicki Mayster, but was  overwhelmed by the job. So Stern taught a few clinic workers and then decided  it would be better if he did the lab work himself.  </P> <P> Every day, Specialty Medical does anywhere from three to a dozen lab tests,  ranging from simple blood counts and throat cultures to complex tests for  hormone and thyroid troubles and checks for exotic parasites.  </P> <P> "We couldn't afford to give $12,000 a year," Stern said. "For us, it would be a  lot of out-of-pocket cash. We were not galloping along when we started doing  this. We are now breaking even."  </P> <P> SOS sees about 1,000 patients every month, up to 20% of whom need laboratory  tests as part of their diagnosis and care.  </P> <P> And without Stern's help, Mayster said, "I don't think there's any way we could  continue to see the number of people we see and offer them the kind of services  we do."  </P></p>

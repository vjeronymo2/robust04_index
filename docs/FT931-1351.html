			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Blow for Jubilee line funding BANKERS were disappointed yesterday that the European Investment Bank directors failed to agree on Tuesday to inject funds into the project to extend the Jubilee underground line to east London. The Jubilee extension will only go ahead if the private sector makes a Pounds 400m contribution towards its costs. Talks with the EIB are continuing.</p>

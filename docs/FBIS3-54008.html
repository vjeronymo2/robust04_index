In a statement received today  by the Algerian Press Service, Mrs. Louisa Hannoun, WP's leader,  pointed out that her party refuses to take part in the  conference because the state of emergency still exists,  political prisoners continue to be detained, and democratic  freedoms continue to be absent.</p>

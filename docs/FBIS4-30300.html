			<p>BFN     [Text] A hearing on the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula was held at a meeting of the International Affairs  Committee of the Russian State Duma on 20 June. Participating  in the hearing were Vladimir Lukin, chairman of International  Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma; deputies to the  State Duma who are members of the committee; Mikhail Titarenko,  director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Far East Institute;  functionaries of relevant sectors; and functionaries of the  publication and reporting sector.    Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, and functionaries  of  the embassy were invited to the meeting.    The DPRK ambassador spoke first at the hearing, which was  headed by the chairman of the Russian State Duma International  Affairs Committee. He said that reports in Russian publications  on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula were mostly  distorted and showed sympathy with the U.S. and other Western  countries' reports. He explained the origin of the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula and our Republic's consistent position  and efforts to resolve it.    Ambassador Son Song-pil answered questions by the State Duma  deputies and those concerned in Korean affairs. Answering the  question related to Russia's proposal for an international  meeting on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, he said:  We admitted that if the international meeting proposed by  Russia is held on the principle of equality and impartiality, if  the DPRK-U.S. talks broke down, it can be a way to resolve the  nuclear issue peacefully, aadding that we would study it if a  specific plan is put forward. However, we cannot approve of it  if you urge us to hold an international meeting while sanctions  are imposed on us. Dialogue and sanctions are incompatible. We  will take appropriate countermeasures against sanctions  according to their scale. Our position is to respond to  dialogue with dialogue and to war with war.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F> domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in  Manila -- live; italicized passages in Tagalog]    [Excerpts] [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, how will the  government's development projects be affected by the suspension  of the oil price increase, considering that the reason for the  imposition of the one-peso oil levy is for the government's  infrastructure projects?    [Ramos] Well, the estimate of the finance people, the  revenue people is that, under the present parameters, a  one-month suspension would amount to the loss of about P1.2  billion [Philippine pesos] in revenues. But precisely  government agreed to this three-week suspension. It's really a  three-week suspension -- from today 7 February to 28 February --  21 days, because we feel there could be some alternatives, new  ones, alternatives that have not yet been factored into their  original computations. Example, is the P1.9 million saving that  is going to arise out of the 5 percent additional reserve that I  imposed on the MOOE [expansion unknown] of all government  departments, agencies, and offices.    Another possible alternative could be a recomputation of the  oil price hikes, because we are seeing, and this is based on  some very intensive study that we made over the weekend up to  early this morning, including myself, we are seeing a plus-21  centavos in all of the computations arising out of the lower  price of crude oil in the world market and the stable foreign  exchange rate -- the pesos versus the hard currencies including  the dollar.    There are other alternatives of course that were suggested,  such as the so-called P150 billion supposedly in the vaults of  the Central Bank. But the secretary of finance, Secretary Bobby  de Ocampo mentioned that this is tantamount to just printing  paper bills without any backing; and so, they are going to look  into that also, just to be sure. And I'm talking about the  entire committee of 14.    Other possible resources could come from still unfactored  privatization benefits. I say unfactored because most of the  government assets already scheduled to be privatized, and the  processes are ongoing, were already considered in the  computations of the fiscal gap.    We also, I suppose, can derive some resources, although this  is probably already going to be marginal, from further belt  tightening. But we do not want to touch what we have already  programmed for capital expenditures and infradevelopment  programs because that would be of a negative effect toward  investors who want to come to the Philippines. We must enhance  our infrastructure. We have enhanced already the power  situation, so that there are no more brownouts. That kind of  thing, we will pursue.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, point of clarification,  the one suspended was the oil price, the 28 January oil price  hike. But how about the one-peso levy which was imposed last  September?    [Ramos] It is the oil price hike that is suspended, it is  not quite a rollback yet, but suspended for a period of three  weeks, while the joint committee is working on the longer-term  solutions. And, we are inputting all the suggestions from all  sectors, especially the KRB [Kilusang Rollback or Rollback  Movement] and government, and for others, because there were  others here who were neither connected with government nor with  KRB who spoke their opinions.    [Unidentified correspondent] How about the one-peso oil levy  which was contained in the executive order?    [Ramos] Well, that will now be considered by the committee.  The disposition or future of that one peso levy will also be  thrown into the deliberations of the committee because their  mission is to come up with a long term and enduring and just  solution to our perennial problem of deficit. It is really the  consolidated public sector deficit that we must solve.    Now, the secretary of finance showed a trend of the behavior  of the consolidated public sector deficit. Will you kindly  provide them a copy of this [addressing a government official],  and it does show a downtrend, very, very significant downtrend  from the time this administration took over. That is the  permanent or enduring way of preventing inflation, interest  rates, and foreign exchange rates from running away, to the  detriment of the economy and our people.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, one thing more; with the  suspension of the 28 January oil price hike, does it mean that  the planned second round of increases will not push through  anymore?    [Ramos] The committee will look into that because neither  the committee nor the president can tell the ERB [Energy  Regulatory Board] what to do. We are all suggesting to the ERB  these proposed actions and solutions. Of course, the collective  influence and clout now of this committee supported by the  president would be so much that perhaps the ERB would  immediately respond positively to the two resolutions. In fact,  Secretary Lazaro on the part of the government was assigned by  me to follow up with the ERB their response to these two  resolutions. Why Lazaro, not because he is the boss of ERB or  the supervisor of ERB, but it is his department that is most  closely related to the ERB because of their functions.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, thank you.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, may I inquire why did it  take the threat of a transport strike and a massive [labor]  strike and a massing of protest to prompt government to  implement that suspension of the oil price hike?    [Ramos] Well, of course the threat cannot be minimized.  And this is coming from a broad coalition of forces -- from the  extreme left to the extreme right -- as the KRB themselves  described it. But it is also a part that government has been  conducting dialogues with the leaders of congress on both sides,  the multisectoral basic sectors as they are called, meaning the  urban poor, the rural poor, the disabled, the women, the  farmers, the fishermen, since we had the social pact of 8  September 1993. And our principal action officers here are  Secretary Oscar Santos of the Peace Process Office, and  Secretary Ernie Garilao of the Department of Agrarian Reform.  In fact, tomorrow we are scheduled to have another meeting with  that group here in Malacanang.    What I'm trying to say is that because of these dialogues,  we  feel comfortable with the so-called marginalized sectors of our  society. But since they have joined this broad coalition, we  also want them to get the message from the government that  certain hard decisions are being made. At the same time, we  want to hear directly from them again what are their most urgent  concerns. And so, we are acting on the basis of our own  well-studied decisions and conclusions.    I'm not doing this under the guns, so to speak. There were  some comments even by some of you, that this was done because  the IMF was here. No, again I say, and this was clarified by  the chairman of our Philippine negotiating team as well as  Secretary of Finance Bobby de Ocampo who was part of that team,  that what was presented to the IMF was the Philippine  Government's plan of action up to year 1998 and into the 21st  century which would do many good things. Number one, put us on  the growth path. Secondly, effect what would be an exit program  for the Philippines in relation to the IMF, and bridge the  fiscal deficit that has been perennially bugging our economy.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, follow-up question: Isn't  the preferred solution something like the perennial creation of  another committee to meet the problem, and there has been some  criticisms aired that this suspension is just delaying what is  really inevitable?    [Ramos] I think that is a mindset that we should correct now  because if there is a new committee to tackle a problem,  your usual response is, there he goes again. There  is a need at this time to facilitate coordination and to open  lines of communication. And in this particular case, the joint  committee was agreed to, not because the president ordered it.  The suggestion in fact came from somebody in the private sector  seconded by another one, I think it was Ronnie Concepcion, and  so we picked it up as a means to gain time for the study of a  comprehensive and enduring solution to this problem because  that's really our task.    Our task is not to avoid a strike, although if we  can avoid it, so much the better for everyone. But we want to  get out of this perennial problem of fiscal deficit. And the  committee now precisely, has been empowered by their respective  constituents to get into both the short-term and the long-term  solutions. That is why a period of three weeks was agreed upon.  Government wanted about two weeks because government felt that  would be sufficient time for consultations and coordination.  The ERB wanted one month. Well, the two sides just split the  difference and we came up with three weeks which coincidentally  falls at the end of the month -- 28th of February.    [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] We  have a telephone question, Mr. President, from Ditas Gualberto.  She wants to find out if the prices will be automatically  lowered with the suspension.    [Ramos] About the transportation fare, if the Land  Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board will respond to  the request of the joint committee, I think it will also be  reduced because that came out with the oil price increase  which involved P1.55 for gasoline and some other prices for  other types of petroleum products. The other components that go  into pricing, well, market forces will play, but I would like to  assure the consuming public that we do have a very effective  price monitoring system now. This is under the Department of  Trade and Industry basically, but this is now being assisted by  the local government executives who have been ordered by me to  monitor prices and prevent and punish, even profiteering.  What is profiteering -- a 10 percent or more  increase of the price of a commodity over the average increase  of the month before.    [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison]  Another question from Iloilo, Mr. President, Radyo ng Bayan  [People's Radio], Rene Monteclaro: What is the president  planning to do to restore the citizen's trust on those that will  be implementing the projects wherein the source of funds comes  from the oil levy?    [Ramos] Our projects will continue. I think you will  believe this because the president has proof. You just look at  the result of our investments in power plants; the  rehabilitation of roads, bridges; restoration of public  utilities destroyed or damaged during the calamities;  improvement in our telecommunication system, transportation  system. They are very visible on the ground.    We will not lessen the capital outlay because it  already has an allocation in the 1994 General Appropriations  Act. Nevertheless, we will add the BOT [Build-Operate-Transfer]  component, and that will come from the private sector. If the  society is in order, if the so-called economic policy  environment is steady, predictable, continuous, and  would give a fair return on investment to the investors,  the BOT area for projects may widen.    We have already issued data portfolio on what are  the doable [as heard] BOT projects all over the country divided  into transport, power, communications, and geographically --  region one to region 15.    [Press Secretary Jesus Sison] Second question sir, [from  Monteclaro] What are the chances that Congress will pass  the tax measures so that the oil levy will be scrapped?    [Ramos] Since September, the Executive and Legislative  have already agreed on what should be given priority among  the various legislative proposals proposed by the senators and  the congressmen themselves proposed by the executive branch and  also recommended by the multisectoral people's organizations.  In fact, 93 such bills came out of that Social Pact, so-called  summit last 8 September. Overtime, that has been refined to a  really, top, top priority of 15 bills which both houses of  Congress has committed over and over again, since even before  they resumed their session on 24 January. And I want to  read these priority bills so that our people will know that we  are not only talking about tax measures but enhancement of  the economic environment, enhancement of the revenue effort, and  these are the following:    -- Amendment to the BOT law. So that we can have other  arrangements for firming up and completing BOT agreements and  contracts because it is not only BOT that is feasible  nowadays. We are trying to get other arrangements which  are existing in other countries, like ROL, Rehabilitate, Operate  and Lease. There is also ROT, Rehabilitate, Operate  and Transfer, there is also BOO [expansion unknown],  etcetera, etcetera, which create new opportunities for investors  in the Philippines.    -- Liberalizing the entry of foreign banks. Finally, a  composite bill has been forged in committee in the Senate so  that this proposal is as perfect as human talent can make it,  according to the committee. And I have certified that composite  bill.    -- Alien legalization act. We must finally resolve the  status of overstaying aliens in the Philippines. Many of them  are Chinese, mainly Filipino-Chinese who are still considered  stateless. Because some of them came out of that  original group in 1949 when the Chiang Kai Shek forces, the  Kuomintang fled the mainland, and of course they have children  and grandchildren already.    -- Commission on Higher Education. This is to improve the  administration of education especially at the higher levels.    -- Science and Technology Scholarship Program. Again,  this is to improve our human development. All of these  lend impact to our competitiveness for our economic growth.    -- Amending Foreign Investments Code, again, to improve  our attractiveness to investors.    -- Resolution on citizenship. This is a different action  from the Alien Legalization Act because this pertains to  authorizing the executive branch to set up the procedures, the  fees, and the other arrangements to facilitate citizenship of  foreign residents in the Philippines.    -- National Health Insurance, dual training system.  These two are important in the improvement of our  skills, our health, etc.    -- Geothermal energy sources, antipilferage of electricity  and transmission lines; again, this to improve our energy mix at  the same time deter criminals from pilfering electricity,  transmission lines, etc.    -- Shelter and Urban Development Financing Act, this is to  finally package the financial programs for housing, especially  socialized housing, because right now there are so many agencies  that are involved. There is no single focus on the priority for  developing a more aggressive housing program.    -- The one called TESDA, Technical Education  and Skills Development Authority. Again, this is related to  human development.    VAT [value added tax] refinements. This is a  proposed tax measure, and there are two more bills pertaining to  population stabilization and next, the set or the family of  resolutions, ratifications and bills for the implementation of  GATT agreement resulting from the settlement of the Uruguay  round, because we are going into a world trade organization set  up, starting about April 1994.    [Phone-in read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] We have  a statement from Bacolod, from Raul Gacagculo of Bombo  Radyo [Big Drum Radio] that says there is a big rally  going on in public plaza of Bacolod, and this is relayed to you  for your information and guidance.    [Ramos] With our brand of democracy, the people are  free to demonstrate, to rally. But it is the responsibility of  our officials on duty to explain to our countrymen, especially  on the profound and complicated issues such as the oil price  increase. And maybe, their being together in a rally is a  good opportunity for our authorities to meet the crowd and  dialogue with them so that there will be a clearer understanding  of what is going on.    All we ask is let's not make these meetings bloody and  violent because it will not only hurt our brothers and  countrymen, especially the children, the women, and the aged,  but it might also send the wrong signals to our neighboring  countries, especially at this time when we are receiving a  favorable impression from these countries especially the  investors towards the Philippines, especially after our  breakthrough in 1993.    The visit of Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia here  in the past four days is a very good indication for us and other  nations on what is really the prevailing condition in our dear  motherland, the Republic of the Philippines. And so I hope  that that message to our friends in Bacolod will get through.  Yes, go ahead and rally as much as you want. But be sure it  does not become violent or unruly or riotous. And we must also  observe the rights of the others who are not involved in the  rally because they must not suffer from this mass action. But  better yet, give everybody a chance as we have done here in  Malacanang to dialogue with each other, consult with each other,  and determine what are really the genuine issues involved. So  that we can come to a comprehensive and permanent solution of  the problem.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, the passage and  implementation of revenue-generating measures normally take  time. Since the suspension of the oil price increase will only  be for three weeks, what will happen if the options proposed by  the joint committee are not implemented before the end of the  month. Will the oil price increase be implemented?    [Ramos] We do not know yet. I don't think we should be  second-guessing that committee because they're composed of  bright people. Let's give them a chance to work out something  for the good of the country. But there are inputs that are  already available, for instance, the 5 percent reserve on MOOE  could be diverted immediately to some other needs especially in  regard to infrastructure development that might be prejudiced  due to the three-week suspension of the ERB decisions.    We are also seeing some hitherto unlisted privatization  measures. Unlisted because they are not yet been factored in.  Such as the proposed privatization of government shares of the  Meralco [Manila Electric Company]. Only this morning, I issued  the directive to [Finance] Secretary De Ocampo, who is the  chairman of our committee on privatization, to go ahead with  that Meralco privatization, but certain parameters and standards  must be observed because we do not want the government to be  prejudiced. Those are some of the things that we can use to  offset.    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, are you confident that the  P10 billion revenues that can be lost from the oil price  increase can be generated within three weeks?    [Ramos] The reported loss is P1.2 billion per month  from the OPSF, [Oil Price Stabilization Fund] which,  according to one of the private sectors, that's peanuts.  But they said at the same time, they will be happy to absorb  some of the financial impact so that it will not be the poorer  sectors that will suffer. And so, we welcome that.    What will this commitment from the private sector  translate to in terms of a practical formula? Well, maybe  we can price gasoline in a socialized way especially for private  car owners. Probably, we can still increase beyond  P1.55 because if someone owns a car, the conclusion is, he  can afford it. Socialized pricing, what shall we  reduce? Maybe the price of LPG [liquefied petroleum gas].  And so, these are some of the solutions being suggested. But,  obviously we couldn't find all the solutions in the two and a  half hours that we've met.    And so, we threw all the proposals, the bright ideas to this  committee, and we are giving them three weeks to come up with  comprehensive, enduring, and just solutions to the basic problem  which is the deficit, specifically the consolidated public  sector deficit. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, it was pointed out that  the 18.40 centavo per kilowatt hour of Meralco has nothing to do  with this recent P1.00 or to P1.55 per liter oil price hike.  And you mentioned that this Meralco rate hike was intended to  enable Meralco to expand its facilities. Will this 18.40...    [Ramos] I did not say that, somebody here said that. But  anyway, let's answer this question.    [Unidentified correspondent] Will this also be rolled back,  this Meralco rate?    [Ramos] Those hearings are not yet finished; there is no  decision yet as far as I know. But maybe we should just tackle  that when the problem comes. According to the ERB, and this is  according to them, there are really three issues that they have  tried to address because they are all interrelated. The first  one is the levy. The second is the build-up of the oil price  stabilization fund which went into deficit by the end of  December 1993, sooner than their predictions. And the third, is  the so-called return on rate base or RORB of oil companies.    This one about Meralco is to enable them to expand  so that they can provide better service here in their franchise  area, and also to pay their bills some of which have become due  already because if it is not paid and the interest will  balloon, again this probably is going to be passed on to  the consumers. But in any case, this is something that is not  yet finished. We hope that Meralco, just like government, is  trying to do, can find some alternatives. [passage omitted]    [Phone-in question read by Press Secretary Jesus Sison] From  Michelle Lopez Antonino of Las Pinas, she wants to find out if  she goes to the gasoline station today, will the price of the  gasoline before....    [Ramos] The process is like this. Our joint  committee and this is supported by the president, is now  communicating with the ERB, presenting these two resolutions to  the ERB, the Chairman Mr. Tantiongco I suppose will receive  this. I asked Energy Secretary Lazaro to help in its  delivery. And it is up to ERB to decide on the resolutions.  Probably, if they will approve it and they will issue a new  order to amend the orders that were mentioned in the  resolution, maybe it will return to the status quo ante.  But as of now, they still have to act on it. Maybe you  are looking at another day. [passage omitted]</p>

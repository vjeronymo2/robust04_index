			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Accommodating system growth Unlike computers, which keep shrinking, the amount of basic input/output system (BIOS) code needed to support the sophisticated features of today's desktop and portable computers and other digital equipment keeps growing. To accommodate this growth, while also providing the ability to upgrade PC BIOS easily, Intel has launched high capacity two and four megabit 'Boot Block' flash memory storage devices. These new re-writeable high-speed chips, which also offer users significant power saving benefits, will also be used in the new generation of digital cellular telephones which are beginning to emerge. Intel: Germany, 89 909 9144; UK, 0793 696000.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Co-op Bank calls 'unethical' customers to account THE CO-OPERATIVE Bank is planning to tell corporate customers involved in blood sports and other activities of which it disapproves to change their ways or close their accounts. The action will accompany the bank's publication next month of a formal ethical policy which will be heralded in an advertising campaign including television commercials. It follows a market research exercise late last year in which the bank canvassed the views of 30,000 of its 1.5m customers. The Co-op said yesterday that up to five 'businesses or commercial organisations' would be approached to 'discuss whether it is appropriate to continue banking with us'. Individuals would not be approached, because the bank assumed that most of them already shared its values. The policy would stress attracting new sympathetic customers rather than targeting ones who did not conform. 'We are confident it will gain us business,' the bank said. 'This isn't a one-off campaign. It's a question of stand up and be counted.' A draft of the ethical policy says the Co-op will not engage in business with manufacturers, importers or farmers involved in the fur trade. Equally unacceptable will be those involved in animal experimentation in toiletries and cosmetics, or animal exploitation such as blood sports, intensive farming and the breeding of dangerous dogs. The ethical policy precludes the bank from engaging in business with manufacturers of tobacco or tobacco products promoted in the less developed world, with foreign regimes which are in breach of human rights, or with arms manufacturers supplying these countries. In addition, it says it will maintain procedures and training programmes to detect illegal activities such as drug trafficking, money laundering and tax evasion. It will co-operate with the authorities to stop and prosecute any such action, and instantly dismiss any staff who are involved. The Co-op and its parent, the Co-operative Wholesale Society, have long taken strong stands, including refusing to do business with South Africa and banning fox-hunting on their land. The bank issued a Customers' Charter last year under which it refuses to give out credit information without customers' specific permission.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Global agenda accepted in Cairo More than 150 governments last night accepted a sweeping UN document setting a global agenda for population stabilisation policies into the next century, enshrining for the first time a concept of 'reproductive rights'. What some delegates described as the 'toughest day yet' of negotiating at the International Conference on Population and Development cleared up almost all remaining contentious issues regarding 'reproductive and sexual health' and the reunification of migrant workers' families, ready to submit a final text for approval at a plenary meeting today. 'There was a semblance of divergence,' said Mr Nicolas Biegman, the Dutch diplomat and vice-chairman of the committee discussing the text. 'But on a great proportion of issues of population and development, including family planning, the nations of the world think largely in the same way.' The final document is set for approval by participating states today, though some, including the Vatican, are expected to voice reservations on at least some parts of the text regarding abortion and reproductive health. A formal Vatican reservation is expected today. Yesterday's haggling focused mainly on definitions of 'reproductive and sexual health' which had raised opposition from Moslem and Catholic countries. Delegates said many misunderstandings surrounding these issues had been cleared up, particularly with Moslem states. Western medical delegates praised the document for defining for the first time in 'international language' a broad concept of reproductive and maternal health.</p>

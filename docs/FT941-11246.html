			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Greek corruption probe launched Greece's Justice Ministryyesterday launched a new investigation into allegations of corruption during the sale of a state-controlled cement company to a subsidiary of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi group. The move, coming after a supreme court prosecutor, Mr Athanassios Sioulas, refused to hand over files on a preliminary inquiry into thesale, signalled that the Socialist government is preparing for a political confrontation over the issue. Mr Sioulas, accused by the government this week of trying to delay the inquiry, must now surrender all the documents in the case to a criminal prosecutor appointed yesterday by the justice minister, Mr Giorgos Kouvelakos. Several former conservative cabinet ministers could face charges of fraud and breach of trust as a result of the minister's decision to intervene. The killing last week of Mr Michalis Vranopoulos, a formergovernor of the state-controlled National Bank who was the chief Greek negotiator in the sale of Heracles General Cement, brought the affair back to prominence. The left-wing Greek terrorist group November 17 said it carried out the killing, claiming former government members had accepted bribes in the privatisation of Heracles. Heracles was sold in 1992 to Cal-Nat, a Greek-Italian joint venture controlled by Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of Ferruzzi, for Dr124bn (Pounds 330.6m) in the biggest deal carried out under the former conservative government's privatisation programme. Ferruzzi officials have claimed that kickbacks were paid to Greek officials to ensure the sale went through. The Socialist government is considering whether to renationalise the company byacquiring Calcestruzzi's 52 per cent share in Cal-Nat, which is being offered for sale.</p>

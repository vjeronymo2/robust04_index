			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Ireland beckons - Travel Update Virgin Airlines has started a new service to Dublin from London's underused City airport in the east-end of the city. Aer Lingus is to fly non-stop between Dublin and New York later this year by leasing three new Airbus A-330 aeroplanes. The Irish national operator plans an introductory 20 per cent price cut and a Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) promotional campaign in the US. Although the Airbus aeroplanes are smaller than the Boeing 747s they replace, the increased frequency of flights will increase Aer Lingus' transatlantic capacity by 33 per cent.</p>

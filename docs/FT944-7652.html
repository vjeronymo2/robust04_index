			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Belgian metals group to float Swedish arm Correction (published 25th November 1994) appended to this article. Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, is to reduce further its interests in the zinc business by floating Ammeberg Mining Corporation, its Swedish mining subsidiary, on the Stockholm stock exchange on terms which value it at about SKr1.26bn (Dollars 170m). UM plans an initial public offering of nearly 11m Ammeberg shares, or 95 per cent of the company, at between SKr103 and SKr112 each. Underwriters have the option to buy additional shares to cover over-allotments and, if this is taken up, UM will have no further ownership interest in Ammeberg. Gross proceeds from the offering before the exercise of over-allotment options and commissions were expected to be between SKr1.2bn and SKr1.39bn, UM said. The offering will consist of retail and institutional offerings in Sweden and an international institutional offering. About 30 per cent of the shares available will be offered in Sweden, including about 5 per cent to retail investors. It is scheduled to be completed by mid-December. Ammeberg operates the Zinkgruvan underground mine, in south central Sweden, which opened in 1857 and last year produced about 63,000 tonnes of zinc, 15,000 tonnes of lead and 30 tonnes of silver. UM said last year it wished to give up its role as the world's biggest zinc producer. It has closed its zinc refining plant at Overpelt in Belgium, and last year cancelled plans to double capacity at its Balen zinc refinery, also in Belgium. In February, UM sold its Union Zinc subsidiary in the US to Savage Resources of Australia for USDollars 200m. Flotation of the Swedish zinc subsidiary will round off this rationalisation process. CORRECTION The price range for the offering of shares in Ammeberg Mining by its parent, Union Miniere, is SKr112 to SKr130, not SKr103 to SKr112 as stated yesterday. This values Ammeberg at between SKr1.26bn and SKr1.46bn (Dollars 170m to Dollars 197m).</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 'BEGIN LEADING,' PRESIDENT URGED  </P> <P> The chairman of the Democratic Party, describing President Bush as offering the  nation timid leadership, called on the Republican President today to begin  "matching his actions to his charming words."  </P> <P> "It would be wonderful to have an American President seize this time of change  and begin leading the world again," Ronald H. Brown told a meeting of the  Democratic National Committee.  </P> <P> The party chairman's speech reflected his earlier statements that it is time to  "start taking on George Bush," and it received an enthusiastic response from  his partisan audience.  </P> <P> "Are we going to go forward with a public spirit, a commitment to doing what it  takes at every level of American society using every American political  institution?" asked Brown. "Or are we going to continue the ethic of greed,  humming the lemming-like melody -- don't worry, be happy?"  </P></p>

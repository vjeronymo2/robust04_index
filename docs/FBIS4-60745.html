			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fatah Central Committee member Hani al-Hasan </F> by AL-SHIRA' correspondent Zaynab Farran; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Farran] Does the PLO continue to serve as a  framework for Palestinian national action?    [Al-Hasan] Our view is that Israel's chief aim in  negotiating  with the PLO is to terminate it. Because we represent an  Arab-affiliated patriotic Palestinian movement, we are not  seeking to abolish the PLO. That would only go along with the  Israeli scheme. At the same time, the PLO's current political  line contradicts its original aims and charter. For this  reason, Palestinian officials opposed to the Oslo agreement are  confused and face complex contradictions. Our proposal is this:  The first task must be to reform and change the PLO's political  line, not abolish the PLO itself. The PLO continues to  represent most Palestinian factions and to advocate its  abolition would serve Israeli objectives. Our primary duty is  to adhere to the PLO Charter while criticizing its current  policy and the Israeli enemy who occupies our land.    [Farran] If we think of the agreements that have been  concluded and the concessions that the Palestinians have made as  representing the end of the negotiations, can we say that  'Arafat is finished?    [Al-Hasan] The interim solution that has been reached is a  prelude to the final solution and determines its shape. We in  the opposition have lost some points but won others. We have  lost because the general framework of the final solution has  been drawn. However, we have made two important gains so far.    The first gain is the growing opposition within and outside  the PLO. Major intellectuals and the patriotic press have  mobilized our people against the political line pursued in the  negotiations. This is why the latest Cairo Agreement was coolly  received, unlike the reception accorded to the Oslo agreement  and the first Cairo agreement. The people had the illusion that  the agreements called for the return of 800,000 displaced  Palestinians, that the Israelis were going to withdraw from the  occupied territories, and that a Palestinian state was going to  be established. This illusion has dissipated.    Our second gain is in our ability to prevent, so far, the  ratification of the mutual PLO-Israeli letters, which included  mutual PLO, Israeli recognition and offered a pledge to overturn  the PLO Charter. We declared that if PLO institutions ratified  those letters we would adopt a course other than dialogue. This  means we would seek the people's support for more far-reaching  measures. The Palestinian people's reception of the second  Cairo agreement offers hope that the public response will be  even stronger.    The danger lies in the final solution. The result of our  struggle against this solution will determine whether in the  future we will live in an Israeli era marked by Israeli hegemony  or in an Arab-Israeli era that has some form of balance.    [Farran] You suggest that there is a possibility for  reforming the political line. Knowing that the second Cairo  agreement prohibits provocation [al-tahrid], how do you see this  as a possibility?    [Al-Hasan] We do not see the deployment of Palestinian  police  as a negative development. Nor do we see it as a historic  achievement. It is an event with no historic significance. The  economic agreement and Israeli hegemony have a negative historic  significance, however. We are faced with two major achievements  of the Zionist scheme: The political annexation [ilhaq] and  economic annexation [of Palestinians] to Israel.    Economic annexation undermines the most important victory of  the intifadah. The latter made our people self-reliant in the  face of the Israeli blockade. Because of the intifadah, our  people developed their agricultural and industrial resources.  Under the intifadah, agricultural production went up 11 percent  and industrial production by 4 percent.    The recent economic agreement, however, restored economic  interdependence because it treated the West Bank, Gaza, and the  land occupied in 1948 as one open trade zone with one tariff  system. With some exceptions, the tariff system is basically  unified. Economic interdependence does not lead to independence  but to closer unity.    Political annexation is clearly manifested in the tasks of  the legislative council that will be elected. The recent Cairo  agreement states that the legislative council will examine bills  referred to it by a joint Israeli-Palestinian committee. Once  the council makes a decision, the bill will be referred back to  the committee. If Israel agrees, it will go into effect,  otherwise it will be overruled.    Several matters will be decided upon in the near future.  Most important of these is the future of the land. This will  be a test of whether economic and political annexation will be  temporary or permanent. The issue of land and the issue of  Jerusalem and its future are matters that will shape the final  settlement.    We have to prepare ourselves to fight the battle concerning  the final settlement on the following principles:    First, we should resist the economic annexation introduced  by  the Paris agreement. The agreement involves practical measures  and we should call on our people to resist this annexation.    Secondly, we should resist political annexation. The  agreement says that the Israelis and Palestinians on one hand  will meet with the Jordanians and Egyptians on the other hand to  discuss ways of promoting cooperation. This means that  Palestinian relations with the Arabs have become an  Israeli-Palestinian, not a Palestinian, matter.    Furthermore, Israel does not want to withdraw from the West  Bank. It wants to legitimize its presence in the West Bank  through a Palestinian-Israeli agreement that would keep the  Israeli Army in the West Bank as an allied army. We seek to  unite Palestinian and Arab efforts to prevent Israel from taking  the land. We want to reverse the imminent military annexation.    We have to understand that we will only defeat the Oslo  agreement through defeating the Israeli concept of a final  settlement, that is, through establishing economic unity between  Palestine and Jordan first and then between Palestine, Jordan,  Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.    [Farran] You still hope that 'Arafat, despite all the  concessions he made, will lead the battle for a final settlement?    [Al-Hasan] The Palestinian people and their political forces  are divided. The split appears in every Palestinian  organization. Therefore, I think that we should not waste time  on secondary issues.    [Farran] Such as?    [Al-Hasan] Such as discussing the pattern in which  Palestinian decisions are made, because this pattern will not  change. Not that we support this pattern, of which I am one  victim. But focusing on this issue will not do us much good.  The battle for the land, however, can rally the people.  Defending the land, defending Jerusalem and the right of  return, staying firm on matters that fire up the people, these  are matters that will rally the people and entice them to defend  their rights. For example, the farmers in the al-Mawasi in  Gaza, an agricultural area of 13 square km, shouted foul when  the recent security agreement gave their land to the Israelis.  The Israelis, they noted, have not taken this area since Gaza  was occupied in 1967, why should the Cairo agreement give it to  them now?    Worrying about the interests of the people makes our  movement  acceptable. Our battle is to address the people and create new  facts that will help our people restore their rights.    [Farran] Would you say that questioning 'Arafat's  leadership and seeking to replace him is a marginal issue?    [Al-Hasan] Handling an issue politically, that is, seeking  to  alter the political line, does not mean marginalizing it. I  believe that in politics a marginal issue is one that you cannot  settle, even if it is a real task. If we focused on merely  important issues rather than actually vital ones, we would be  serving the Oslo policy line. The really vital thing is to seek  the public's support. The opposition cannot make internal  changes because current Arab and international circumstances do  not help it to do so. The important thing is to seek the  people's support, who will be encouraged by our opposition to  demand their rights. I will give you an example. A large  number of personalities were invited to the second Cairo  agreement signing ceremony. Some 93 of them, including 25  important figures living inside the occupied territories, did  not come. The absence of Hanan 'Ashrawi, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Ahmad  Rashid, Bassam al- Shak'ah, and Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, and the  cool popular response to the latest agreement are good signs.  They will help us wage the struggle for the final solution.    [Farran] Don't the Fatah oppositionists intend to find a  replacement for 'Arafat?    [Al-Hasan] No such thing is being considered.    [Farran] You used to be a nominee to replace 'Arafat. Is  this matter still in the cards?    [Al-Hasan] At one time the various opposition forces thought  of forming an alternative PLO. There were discussions about its  structure and so on. Personally, I do not think this is the  answer. What is coming will be worse than Oslo. What is coming  is a proclamation of a Palestinian state based on an  Israeli-Palestinian military alliance. The Israelis want a  barren Palestinian state that will be an economic, political,  and military annex of Israel. In articles I wrote I described it  as the illusory state. Why wouldn't the Israelis accept such a  state? What we must do is alert the public to future  possibilities. We must create facts that will prevent these  possibilities. I want to raise a basic point here: The battle  is no longer between two sides alone because the solution will  be part of a regional arrangement. What happens in the West  Bank will affect the interests of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria  because the agreement will be general. For this reason, I hope  and wager that these countries will have an opinion on what will  happen to defend their interests.    [Farran] Which Palestinian opposition factions agree with  your views on how to confront the Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Al-Hasan] I do not think that there are great differences  between me and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [PFLP], the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [DFLP], and the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC]. I also believe that the  brothers in Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], following their  recent political declaration, have only one course of action  open. They -- together with the PFLP, DFLP, and the PFLP-GC --  will have to escalate the confrontation with the enemy, explain  the issues to the people, and mobilize them against concessions  pertaining to Jerusalem, other territories, and the right of  return. They must turn the confrontation into one between all  the people and the Oslo policy, not between a group of  oppositionists and a group in Tunis.    [Farran] Can you be active abroad or will you return to the  territories?    [Al-Hasan] I will not be a member of the authority that is  being established, although my name is being proposed. It is  not reasonable for me to be part of an authority whose current  policy I oppose.    [Farran] You will stay abroad then?    [Al-Hasan] Probably.    [Farran] Is there a deal between 'Arafat and Hamas? What  does it call for?    [Al-Hasan] I do not think there is a deal between Hamas and  'Arafat. Nevertheless, it is illogical to allow Palestinian  internal strife for two reasons: The public would not accept it  and it would serve Israeli interests. The situation in the Gaza  Strip is different from the situation in the West Bank. In  Gaza, where Israel has withdrawn from 70 percent of the  territory, there is a strong Hamas presence and there will be a  large deployment of Palestinian police. I do not believe that  local conditions in Gaza encourage conflict between the police  and Hamas. We must wait and see how things will develop,  however. The PLO Executive Committee is sending envoys to all  local forces to ensure no infighting occurs and to encourage  dialogue.    [Farran] Will Faruq Qaddumi be part of the Palestinian  Authority?    [Al-Hasan] The Political Department is not supposed to be  part of the authority. Furthermore, Israel will not allow  Abu-al-Lutf (Qaddumi), who is actually opposed to the Oslo  agreement, to enter the territories as head of the Political  Department. He might become part of the Civil Authority and be  given another post.    [Farran] Is Qaddumi's name being proposed?    [Al-Hasan] Regrettably, we have reached the stage where  Israel is deciding who will enter and who will not. Personally,  I do not know what is happening exactly, but I do not believe  that brother Abu-al-Lutf will be part of the Palestinian  Authority.    [Farran] Does this mean that he is an actual opponent of  'Arafat?    [Al-Hasan] He is among the opposition but has a special way  of doing that. He does not agree with my way of presenting  issues. I believe that all issues must be submitted to the  people to let them know what is happening. I wager on the  people and their role in defending their interests.  Abu-al-Lutf, who is Fatah Central Committee secretary, has a  different view. Nevertheless, he is really opposed to the  current policies.    [Farran] Will two Palestinian axes appear, one in Gaza and  the other in Tunis? Where will you stand on this?    [Al-Hasan] This is what we began our dialogue with. I do not  believe it will happen. We will not adopt stances on behalf of  the people. Let the people themselves adopt a stance. Without  a definite stance the people will not be able to do anything.  Matters are very complicated now. The people are asked to vote  in elections, although the autonomy authority in the West Bank  will not take over the settlements, Greater Jerusalem, or the  large Israeli Army's deployment areas in the West Bank and the  Jordan Valley. The Palestinian authority will not take over  more than 40 or 50 percent of the West Bank's territory. The  remainder, inhabited by more than 250,000 Palestinians, will  remain under Israeli sovereignty. Is this not a major problem  that requires much thought?    In Gaza the situation is different because the Israeli  settlements are border territories, not Palestinian population  centers. In the West Bank the situation is very entangled and  the implementation of autonomy will be plagued by frictions. In  actual terms there will be a canton in Gaza, another in Jericho,  a third in Hebron and the villages around it, a fourth in Nablus  and its villages, and a fifth in other Palestinian populated  areas whose status will not be discussed until the final stage.  Add to this that an Israeli autonomy already exists in the  settlements themselves.    In this complex situation the people will discover that they  cannot travel from one point to another and that Israel controls  two-thirds of the water resources, which will make it difficult  for them to develop their agriculture. In view of all this,  shouldn't we explain these problems to the people and invite  them to adopt the position they wish to hold?    [Farran] Can 'Arafat go beyond the articles of the  agreement and endorse the Palestinian people's will to fulfill  his demands?    [Al-Hasan] The question should be whether the counteropinion  will succeed in making the Palestinian people force their  leadership in Gaza and Jericho to stand by them rather than by  Rabin if a dispute develops with him.    If they fail to do that, the people will have their say. We  wager on the people. If we fail to develop grassroots support  to undertake that task, we will turn into mere commentators on  events. Our task today is to find ways to cope with future  eventualities. I am optimistic because this agreement bears the  germ of contradiction. Welcome to these contradictions. If a  day comes on which Rabin says to hell with the agreement, we  will have a unique point of accord with him.    [Farran] Then you do not think that it is probable that  these  axes will develop?    [Al-Hasan] I do not favor a dispute among various axes. I  prefer to push the people to take a stance. Hence the role of  popular instigation, which is done by confronting the enemy via  propaganda, the media, and organization.    [Farran] But the agreement leaves no room for instigation?    [Al-Hasan] The current political line and events have given  birth to two or more stances and the process continues. What  you call axes I call generated stances. The question is will  matters be handled through conflict at the top level? This is  what some brothers in and outside Fatah believe.    I believe that a conflict at the top will not stop the Oslo  agreement. What will stop the Oslo agreement is doing what we  believe will stop it. It is the people who can do that. The  conflict among the various stances in Tunis is a conflict within  closed rooms that achieves nothing.    Therefore, we have to clarify matters and draw up a plan.  Since the agreement bears the germ of contradiction, let us try  to exploit these future contradictions.    [Farran] What is the role of Faysal al-Husayni in Jerusalem?    [Al-Hasan] Al-Husayni's failure to attend the signing  ceremony in Cairo affirms that he has returned to himself and  realized that an agreement was being signed while Jerusalem was  still under siege and that in a few months it would become clear  that Jerusalem had nothing to do with autonomy. This is exactly  what 'Abd-al-Shafi discovered. Al-Husayni is going in the same  direction we are. But he is not coordinating with us because  this will shower him with curses. This certifies that the  opposition has succeeded in turning its words into deeds to the  extent that the leaders who are living among the people are now  obliged to take the popular stance into consideration in their  areas, without having to pay much tribute to Tunis.    The growth of these powers and figures will prompt us to  bolster them and demand a popular referendum on the issues they  raise.    [Farran] Can 'Arafat rule democratically?    [Al-Hasan] Personally, I do not believe the Palestinians are  being offered a democratic rule. I therefore refuse to discuss  the issue of Palestinian agricultural and industrial development  as long as there is an occupation. I think that the most  serious thing that the Palestinians were lured into was  discussing these issues under occupation.    For instance, elections will be held to guarantee democracy  for the Palestinian people according to the Oslo agreement. I  want elections that ensure my right to self-determination; I do  not want elections for democracy. What kind of democracy is  that exercised under occupation? Therefore, we have to focus on  the central issue of ending the occupation before we discuss  things like agricultural or industrial development. Development  under occupation consecrates the idea of integration with the  occupation.    [Farran] You don't support the elections?    [Al-Hasan] Elections under occupation will not achieve their  goal. If the council that will be elected will only discuss the  decisions referred to it, it will not be completely sovereign.  I am not opposed to the principle of elections. I believe in  democracy and in the people's right and their rule. I believe  that an expanded parliament has the final say, but we must  obtain sovereignty. I will not state my final view of the  elections until after the elections law that is being discussed  in Washington has been endorsed. If a party is deprived of  participation in the elections because it was not a party to the  Oslo talks, we will then state our stance on these undemocratic  elections. This is because, as we have seen today, to be  released from jail a detainee must sign a paper affirming his  agreement on the Oslo talks and pledging not to carry out  terrorist operations. So what is this independence, democracy,  and freedom of expression? In this respect I support the  appointment of all members of the Palestinian authority from  inside [the occupied territories].    [Farran] You were threatened with dismissal from the Central  Committee at its latest meeting in Amman. Have you prepared  yourself for such a situation?    [Al-Hasan] My dismissal was discussed and I was surprised at  the number of those who defended me and rejected this measure  against me inside the Central Committee. Since I enjoy this  great support, there is no fear. I do not think of this issue.    [Farran] Do you think of establishing a legal office as  Hanan  'Ashrawi has done?    [Al-Hasan] I greet my brothers in the Legal Committee that  was formed by important figures. We have full confidence in  them and that they will defend Palestinian human rights.    [Farran] Can the self-rule authority control the  contradictions in the situation and how?    [Al-Hasan] We believe that it will not be able to control  the  situation because it is overlapping. The Israelis phased the  negotiations to enmesh the Palestinian Authority in these  contradictions so that they may impose new conditions because  they do not want to leave the West bank. In addition, the size  of the opposition inside [the occupied territories] is large and  reaches 60 to 90 percent.    [Farran] Which organizations inside [the occupied  territories] are more embarrassing to Yasir 'Arafat?    [Al-Hasan] Fatah first and then the Islamic trend  represented  in "Hamas" and "al-Jihad." Both these groups are organized and  perform social work in addition to confronting the occupation.  It is no coincidence that they managed to gain support from  other forces. However, we will compete with them and try to  restore our positions. Let the rivals compete.    [Farran] If you believe that the concessions that 'Arafat  has  made violate the logic of the revolution and of Palestinian  rights, do you think this justifies a call for his trial, given  these concessions and the U.S. and Israeli statements that his  personality is moody and unbalanced?    [Al-Hasan] I will not answer this question because it is  useless.    [Farran] Do you believe that the United States has a  replacement for 'Arafat?    [Al-Hasan] I have no answer.</p>

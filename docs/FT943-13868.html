			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Frosted coffee not so chilly for Brazil The Brazilian media sped down south last week, and drove past the main story. Television crews were in a rush to film snowfalls in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, unusual in even the harshest Brazilian winter. Residents were shown making snowmen (well, knee-high snowmen) and writing rude messages in the snow about the new currency introduced this month. Further north, though, in the country three main coffee-growing states, frost rather than snow was making the headlines abroad and raising coffee prices in London and New York. What with damage from a previous frost last month, up to half of the harvest next year may be threatened. London Robusta coffee prices have nearly doubled in a month, reflecting worries about reduced supply. The media priorities were understandable, even so. Coffee is still one of the main products which the rest of the world associates with Brazil. But the coffee industry has lost its importance within the country and, although it has always been a popular drink among Brazilians, coffee still leaves a bad taste with those who link it with inequality of land tenure and the economy's reliance on foreign markets. Coffee became big business in Brazil a century ago, when the state of Sao Paulo was found to have suitable land and climate. Slavery had been abolished nationally in 1888 and the state filled its need for cheap labour by attracting immigrants from poor regions of Europe, such as southern Italy and Germany, as well as Japan. The fortunes made on coffee in the next decades, mainly by a few dozen landowners, turned Sao Paulo into Brazil's richest state. Accumulated capital helped to launch the country's industrialisation and led to the decline of coffee's relative importance. Brazilian coffee exports, once responsible for more than half of foreign exchange earnings, last year represented only 3 per cent of total exports, or Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 774m). Sao Paulo has slowly forgotten its roots. The Avenida Paulista, once the choicest address in Sao Paulo city for coffee barons, has been invaded by Brazilian and international banks. In the countryside, coffee has been overtaken, in terms of area planted and export values, by soya and orange juice. But it is still an important crop and one of the biggest employers in the three main coffee growing states - Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo and Parana. In these areas, the recent frost has caused severe problems for local growers and workers. The Guaxupe co-operative, Brazil's largest, groups 6,500 producers from the three main regions. Mr Joaquim Goulart, technical manager, says the latest frost spared less than half of the co-operative's plants. 'I'm 44 years old and remember the frosts of 1965, '69, '81 and '85. This was more serious, it hit areas which had survived before.' Brazil's winter lasts until the end of August, and forecasters are already predicting further frosts. 'It's already serious, but it could become grave depending on the weather,' Mr Goulart says. 'About 80 per cent of our producers are small. They will feel the effects worse and have no other source of income. They have suffered from low prices in the last years, so there has been a lack of investment. In the worst-hit areas, they will not get back to normal for three years.' This disruption does not appear to concern customers in Cafe Martinelli, one of central Sao Paulo's smartest coffee houses. A group of brokers from the nearby stock exchange, sipping espressos at a price equivalent to 50 US cents joked that Brazilians may now have the chance to enjoy top-quality coffee, which is usually exported. 'The government holds 16m bags which would normally be sold to Europe, but which will now be sold locally to keep domestic prices down,' according to one. This attitude partly reflects the popular Brazilian belief that the country's best products go abroad. The image of European superiority, which stems from colonial times, is also reflected in advertisements in many bars for 'Italian roasted' coffee, even though the same coffee probably grows in Brazil. The country's poorer consumers, who drink their coffee in tiny cups, cafezinhos, often with much sugar to change its bitter taste, have little time for such musings. In a large supermarket beside the Avenida Paulista, one housewife had decided to stock up with 500g bags of ground coffee and was advising fellow shoppers to do the same. 'The coffee companies will use the frost as an excuse for higher prices, whatever the government says,' she argued.</p>

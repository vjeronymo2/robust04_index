			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Braque and Picasso lift market: Saleroom THE art market received a boost in New York on Monday night when Christie's sold 91 works from the collection of the late Bill McCarty-Cooper for Dollars 21.5m, (Pounds 12m), with an important late (1952) work by Georges Braque, 'Atelier VIII', making Dollars 7.7m. The other exceptional painting in the auction, 'Compotier et Guitare' by Picasso, went to a private US buyer for Dollars 3.85m. Not only did these two important paintings find buyers, but spirited bidding ensured that the auction was 95 per cent sold by value. Mr Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in the US, said the results were 'tremendous, sensational'. Christie's was fortunate in offering a collection with an excellent pedigree. It had been put together by Douglas Cooper, a friend of Picasso and Braque and one of the greatest collectors of 20th century art. In 1949 Cooper adopted McCarty-Cooper, then aged 25, who inherited the collection on Cooper's death in 1984. Many of the paintings were acquired directly from the artist. In the case of the Braque this included the provision that the work should never leave France. In addition to offering fresh paintings of undoubted quality, Christie's had the advantage of dealing with a deceased estate. That helped to ensure that reserves and estimates were kept low to encourage bidding. Three years ago, at the height of the art boom, the Braque might have sold for nearer Dollars 12m and the Picasso Dollars 10m. 'Guitare sur une Table' by Juan Gris sold for Dollars 1.485m, slightly below estimate, and another Picasso, 'Homme a la Sucette', for Dollars 968,000. Both went to US collectors. A Giacometti sculpture in bronze, 'Buste de Diego', almost doubled its estimate at Dollars 935,000. This was the first successful auction for two years in the troubled Impressionist and modern art sector. It will give confidence to the market, but the very high quality of the works makes it untypical.</p>

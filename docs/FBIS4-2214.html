			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The Fujian provincial  authorities have issued a set of provisional regulations to  tighten the management of investment by overseas companies in  the form of assets.    A leading official of the provincial commodity inspection  bureau said that the regulations are intended to protect the  legitimate rights and interests of both Chinese and overseas  investors, and meet the needs of opening Fujian wider to the  outside world and deepening the reforms.    He said that, in accordance with the regulations, his bureau  and its subsidiaries are in charge of evaluating assets of  foreign investment, primarily machinery and equipment.    Meanwhile, the provincial departments of foreign trade and  economic cooperation, planning, finance, industry and commerce,  and taxation will assist the provincial commodity inspectors in  evaluating such assets, he added.    In accordance with the regulations, a contract on the  establishment of an overseas-funded enterprise must contain an  article stating that imported assets of foreign investment are  subject to evaluation by the provincial commodity inspection  bureau and other government departments.    The authorities will not approve the establishment of any  overseas-funded enterprise if its contract does not contain such  an article, the official said.    He explained that in recent years more overseas companies  have put machinery and equipment as investment in co-production  projects with Chinese firms.    Machinery and equipment currently account for at least 90  percent of investment by overseas partners in overseas-funded  companies in Fujian, he said.    He criticized some overseas business people for resorting to  fraud in this regard.</p>

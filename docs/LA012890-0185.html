			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: A SOBERING STORY OF PROGRESSIVE PARENTS AND GRAD NIGHT FUN  </P> <P> It was just another phone call with a story idea, but it ended up affecting my  life directly and very pleasantly.  </P> <P> The call came in June, 1985, when I was the education writer for the Orange  County Edition of The Times. A pleasant, friendly voice on the other end said,  "Hi, Bill. I'm Lori Warmington, and a friend suggested I call you about a story  that's related to education."  </P> <P> Inwardly I groaned. Feature story ideas about education are as prevalent as  sand pebbles on the beach. Nonetheless, Warmington's call quickly became  intriguing. "This is about parties three coastal-area high schools hold on  graduation night," she said. "It's to make Grad Night safe -- without any  alcohol or drugs. It's something we hope will spread to other high schools."  </P> <P> I agreed to meet Warmington and some other parents of Newport Harbor High  students who were building Grad Night party props in a vacant warehouse. The  party theme for Newport Harbor that year was "Evening in Paris," and I was  slack-jawed by the professional-looking Parisian street scenes being built by  these enthusiastic parents.  </P> <P> I learned from Warmington that Laguna Beach High, Corona del Mar High and  Newport Harbor High had held Grad Night parties for several years. She was  coordinating public relations for those three high schools. Later, I found out  that Valencia High in Placentia was actually the trailblazer, having started  Grad Night parties in 1957.  </P> <P> But in 1985, only those four high schools in Orange County had Grad Nights. The  concept involves having parents plan a year in advance for an all-night party  for graduating seniors, to be held on the high school campus. The parents raise  money for elaborate decorations, live bands, all-night entertainment booths,  free food throughout the evening, and scores of prizes and games.  </P> <P> High school graduation night, according to the California Highway Patrol, can  be one of the most deadly. Celebrating seniors sometimes have fatal car  accidents as they drive to or from parties, the CHP has said. Valencia High's  Grad Night, in fact, was started by parents because one student had been killed  and another paralyzed in a 1956 graduation-night car accident.  </P> <P> At Grad Night parties, strict security keeps out any alcohol or drugs. But  seniors I talked to said they didn't resent the rules because Grad Night was so  much fun. "It's our last time together, and we really jam," said one graduating  senior. "And, like, there's an incredible amount of food," said another.  </P> <P> Warmington, like many other parents of graduating seniors, found it  exhilarating to work on her son's Grad Night party, getting to know other  parents and school staff better during the process.  </P> <P> "My dream is to have this spread to all the other high schools in Orange  County," Warmington said in 1985. When she found out I had a son who would  enter Huntington Beach High School in the fall of 1986, Warmington said: "I  certainly hope your high school takes up Grad Night. It would be a great  present for your son, and, Bill, you can't believe how much fun it is for  parents."  </P> <P> Warmington and another Newport Beach parent, Judy Hemley, co-founded the  nonprofit Grad Night Foundation in September, 1986. The foundation, based in  Costa Mesa, helps high schools start Grad Nights by giving them "how-to"  instruction and guidance. Warmington said that 47 of the 65 comprehensive  public and private high schools in Orange County will have a Grad Night this  year -- compared to only four in 1985.  </P> <P> "It's also spread to high schools in every county in California and to every  state in the nation," Warmington said. "This week we got inquiries from Hong  Kong, Japan, West Germany and the Philippines."  </P> <P> Thanks to the leadership of two parents at Huntington Beach High -- Allison  Barsh and Pat Will -- that high school last year joined the growing ranks of  those sponsoring annual Grad Night parties. My son Patrick was a junior last  year, and I was among parents who volunteered to work for the first party for  graduating seniors.  </P> <P> The experience -- as Warmington had predicted -- was great fun. I met scores of  parents of other students, in all grades, who also volunteered. I saw bankers,  accountants, airline pilots, regional business executives and police officers  all working together in old clothes on many a Saturday. These parents painted,  hammered, sawed -- and formed lasting friendships and closer ties to the high  school.  </P> <P> Now it is 1990, and my son is a graduating senior. I am again working on the  Grad Night Committee -- this time very selfishly, as my son is among those who  will be at the party.  </P> <P> Recently I had the chance to thank Warmington and the Grad Night Foundation for  their work. The story that I had covered back in 1985 has now become a growing,  continuing, national phenomenon. And it is one of those stories that has  personally touched and enriched my own life.  </P></p>

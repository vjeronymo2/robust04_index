			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Salad growers plead for state help Salad growers last night urged the government to take action to prevent the collapse of the Pounds 154m sector in the face of cheap imports. Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, led a delegation of growers who told MPs from both sides of the Commons that many UK salad businesses would go bankrupt unless the government helped. He said overproduction of salad in the European Union had pushed down prices for UK growers. Imports of iceberg lettuces from Spain alone had more than doubled since 1988 to 70,000 tonnes last year. Mr Roger Sayer, managing director of Humber Growers, which produces nearly a quarter of the country's cucumbers, said spring prices were 40 per cent down on last year. Mr Sayer said the government should investigate whether other EU growers were receiving state aid which distorted competition. He also called for government funding to promote fresh fruit and vegetables, and faster approval of pesticides so UK growers had access to the variety available to EU competitors. 'We're just as efficient as our European colleagues, but unless we get a fair crack of the whip the business will disappear,' he said.</p>

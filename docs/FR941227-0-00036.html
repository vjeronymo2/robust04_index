			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Neither does the FAA agree that this is ``not consistent with previous AD's.'' The FAA has issued numerous AD's over the past years that have called for the removal of discrepant parts that have been determined to create an unsafe condition; those AD's normally contain a statement indicating that none of those discrepant-type parts may be installed on any airplane in the future. Such statements are necessary in order to prohibit the installation of spares of the discrepant part. In general, once an unsafe condition has been determined to exist with regard to a part, it is the FAA's normal policy not to allow that condition_or that part_to be re-introduced into the fleet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, in developing the technical information on which every AD is based, one of the important considerations is the availability of parts that the AD will require to be installed. When it is determined that ample numbers of those (safe) parts are immediately available to operators, it is the FAA's policy to prohibit installation of the ``unsafe'' parts after the effective date of the AD. Removing an unsafe condition that already exists on an airplane necessarily involves performing maintenance on the airplane, and the FAA always provides some kind of ``grace period'' in order to minimize disruption of operations. On the other hand, prohibiting installation of spares that have been determined to create an unsafe condition does not require any additional maintenance activity; it simply requires use of one part rather than another. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Put in other terms, the purpose of the AD's compliance time is to give the operators time to get the discrepant parts  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> off <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the airplane. The time interval selected takes into account not only safety implications, but the size of the fleet and convenient maintenance schedules. However, the compliance time is not meant as a time for operators to put discrepant parts  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> on <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the airplane in the meantime. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the FAA considers that the period of time between publication of the final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the effective date of the final rule (usually 30 days) is sufficient to provide operators with an opportunity to determine their immediate need for modified spares and to obtain them. Of course, in individual cases where this is not possible, every AD contains a provision that allows an operator to obtain an extension of compliance time based upon a specific showing of need. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these issues, the FAA finds that prohibiting installation of uninspected (non-identified) subassemblies on an airplane as of the effective date of this final rule does increase safety and does not impose undue burdens on operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to the final rule to clarify this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour. The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The AA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $35,280, or $840 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Leading Article: Mr Major on trial THE jury is still out on Mr John Major. Not yet six months into his job, the new prime minister has yet to demonstrate that he is up to it. This does not mean the verdict, when it comes, will be adverse. For the evidence is more in his favour than against. He has revived the fortunes of the Conservative party simply by not being Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Those who point to the difficulties facing the Tories today sometimes forget how much more intractable they seemed half a year ago. A party that was politically trapped by its own ideology is now busily recapturing the centre-ground, which is where the next election will be fought. Not being his predecessor has also helped helped Mr Major to transform Britain's relations with the European Community. No longer the exasperating outsider, it is now becoming one of the respected leading players. This is a testament both to his perception of Britain's true place in the EC and his diplomatic skills in winning the understanding of President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. His proposal a week ago that the EC should take part in an initiative in promoting a safe haven for the Kurds may have been rough at the edges, but its general thrust was positively European. Mr Major was an excellent leader during the Gulf war; if he appeared at the time to be marching in tune with Washington he has since shown a canny awareness of the need to maintain Britain's EC position while yet maintaining the transatlantic link. Right-wing sniping Some of the right-wing sniping against him is partly a consequence of this European vision; some is a consequence of his not being Mrs Thatcher. The leader of the Young Conservatives and the 22-year-old secretary of the Bruges Group would not normally attract much attention for their bilious remarks but they have reflected what some of their elders, who should know better, have been saying in private. Mrs Thatcher herself has not helped, particularly if her own reported private remarks in New York, that Mr Major's government is the 'B-Team", are an indication of her general attitude. There are also divisions on domestic policy. Mr Norman Lamont's remarks to the Adam Smith Institute on Friday night sounded like a warning shot by the chancellor against the perceived 'wet' inclinations of the party chairman, Mr Chris Patten. If so it was a needless intervention. Those members of the government who understand the term 'social market economy' are agreed that in British conditions it merely means allowing capitalism to create wealth, some of which is spent on public services. Seeking consensus Neither Mr Lamont nor Mr Patten, both of whom understand the term very well, would advocate an extension to the German interpretation, which involves seeking consensus between business and the trade unions. There is room for debate over how much should be spent on health, education and the like. Mr Major's job is to settle that one. It is also his job to complete the dismantling of the poll tax, and to show courage in so doing. The trick has been to win public favour by abandoning the community charge while maintaining party unity, which requires a continued element of personal taxation. So far Mr Major has neither united the party nor won public favour, in spite of cutting the bills to be paid by transferring the cost to VAT. It is his performance on this, the trickiest of the challenges, that has caused both friend and foe to call him a ditherer. The title will stick if he is not soon shown to be decisive. That said, Mr Major is not devoid of good luck. The recession appears to have bottomed out. Movements in the German and the US economies favour a reduction in British interest rates without threatening sterling's position within the exchange rate mechanism. Economic optimism is returning. True, the Labour party is in its best shape for 20 years. It presents a formidable challenge. But the prime minister stands a fair chance of winning the election on his own policies, in his own way. If he is bold, he will do so.</p>

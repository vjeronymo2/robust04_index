			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Johanna Garam: "Membership Hinges on the Money </F> Flow"]    [Text] The European Union [EU] is Russia's most important  trading partner. The EU's trade with Russia is about 4 percent  of the Union's total foreign trade. In other words, the EU is  very important to Russia, and Russia, of course, is very  important to Finland. A trade agreement between the EU and  Russia has yet to be completed but, when signed, it will offer  future advantages to EU members and, especially, better  conditions for financing trade. These benefits will also be  available to Finland if and when it joins the EU.    The enormous requirements of Russia and the CIS countries  call for projects and funds exceeding the resources of Finland  and Finnish enterprises. The future of Finland's eastern trade  depends on international financing and access to international  support programs.  <H5>  Cooperation and Partnership Does Not Lead to Free Trade </H5>   The EU and Russia have been negotiating a cooperation and  partnership agreement since November 1992. Problems like  aluminum and the scope of activities of foreign banks have  delayed its conclusion.    This agreement will not implement free trade between the EU  and Russia, but discussions concerning the abolition of customs  duties are on the agenda for 1998.    This cooperation and partnership is not intended to bring  about Russian membership in the EU.    The EU is negotiating similar agreements with the CIS  countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.    Finland has a simple GATT-based trade agreement with Russia.  Finland could expand its current share of trade with Russia via  the EU. This would offer clear advantages in terms of  protection against market interferences such as dumping and  quotas. The EU also has access to forceful methods like  boycotts.  <H5>  Political Conditions Arouse No Interest </H5>   Unlike the EU cooperation and partnership model, the Finnish  trade agreement does not include political fringe conditions  related to continued democratization in Russia.    Finns are not particularly enthusiastic about features of  that sort, since Finland has traded and wants to go on trading  with Russia regardless of the situation in the country.  <H5>  Finland's Eastern Trade in Full Expansion </H5>   "Finland is in the forefront of commercial relations with  Russia and the Baltic states." Tapio Vilkama of TT [expansion  unknown] points out that, for instance in the area of new joint  ventures, only Germany and the United States are ahead.    "Talk about Finland missing the train to the east is  unfounded," Vilkama adds.  <H5>  Complexities Must Be Sorted Out Before Membership </H5>   A recent problem is the compulsory special-product  certificate for all consumer goods. Only a certificate issued  in Berlin or Switzerland is accepted, the fee for each shipment  is 250 Finnish markkas [FMk], and there is a FMk5,000 charge for  annual visits by experts to companies. That is why some 60  trailer-truck shipments were returned to Finland last fall.    Vilkama points out that the problems must be resolved by  means of a bilateral agreement before Finland joins the EU.  This would ensure that certificates issued by the Finnish  Standards Federation have the same validity as foreign ones.  Metal, food, and manufacturing industries -- especially  electric and electronic industries -- are the busy sectors in  trade with Russia. Contracting is another active area, and the  construction material and furniture industries have regained the  trading levels of the peak years in the early eighties.    Finland's participation as a member of the EU in the Union's  cooperation and partnership program would create better  uniformity in trading procedures for Finnish companies. Only  then could Finland fully benefit from its Eastern trade know-how  that has been fully recognized in Brussels.    Access to development projects will become possible via  Brussels. The EU conducts an extensive program for East Europe  and the Baltic states. This program (PHARE [Economic  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]) with funds worth 1.4  billion ECU [European Currency Unit] is designed to assist  countries of East Europe on their road to democracy and a market  economy. TACIS [Technical Assistance Program to the CIS] with a  budget of 510 million ECU is a development program for Russia  and the CIS countries. But East Europe occupies a more central  position in Brussels' eyes.    These development programs are internal to the EU. Early  information about projects and the opportunity to take part in  their early planning stages is important. This includes the  definition of technical standards, which are vital for  commercial suppliers investing in such things as energy  projects. Otherwise there is a risk that these standards will  be set by large multinational companies, thus finishing off the  chances of smaller Finnish enterprises.    EU membership would open information channels for Finnish  enterprises about these development programs. Training in the  use of these opportunities has been launched. We are mentally  prepared, assures Nina Vaskulahti of the Foreign Ministry. She  has worked at PHARE and is familiar with the methods of that  organization.  <H5>  Finland Must Get to the Sources of the Funds </H5>   The Finnish list of support projects and development funds  for Russia, the Baltic states, and East Europe is long and  diversified. The Finnish support program for East Europe  includes FMk3.3 billion worth of grants and loans with a state  guarantee. The volume of loans for bilateral projects with the  Baltic states, namely FMk818 million, is the highest in the  world.    The action program for the neighboring Russian regions --  Murmansk, Karelia, St. Petersburg, and the Leningrad district --  has a FMk300 million budget for technical assistance and grain  deliveries worth in total about FMk250 million. Thousands of  people have participated in programs offering training,  consultancy, and the development of administrative systems.    The total Finnish assistance package, including loans and  support, is worth approximately FMk5 billion.    Finland is a member of the EBRD [European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development], but the bank's rules are rigid  and bureaucratic. The projects financed by the institution are  very large by Finnish standards: The EBRD loan sector is worth  at least ECU5 million, with a shareholder participation of 25 to  30 percent of the total project value. The EBRD has invested in  more than 100 East European projects, but there is no Finnish  management participation in any of these. It is believed that  Finnish opportunities via the EBRD will improve when we can  participate in the study and preparation phases of the projects.  <H5>  Assistance From EU's Own Bank </H5>   The EU's own bank, the EIB (European Investment Bank), has  considerable investment resources. The EIB will become  accessible to the Finnish business community through membership  in the EU, although a certain level of cooperation is currently  being discussed under an agreement with the EFTA [European Free  Trade Association] countries.    The IFC (International Finance Corporation), a subsidiary of  the World Bank, which is the largest financer of development  programs, differs from its two host institutions, the IBRD  [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development] and the  IDA [International Development Agency], inasmuch as it also  finances projects in the private sector. IFC is active in East  Europe, promoting joint ventures, privatization, legislation,  capital markets, and foreign investment. Finland has up to now  been an outsider in terms of the main flow of international  financing. Trading, even with neighbors, may become difficult  in the future if we attempt to go it alone.</p>

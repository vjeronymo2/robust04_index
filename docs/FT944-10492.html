			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Observer: Gergantuan problem For Bill Clinton it never rains but it pours. Now he's been deserted by David Gergen, the shrewd 52-year-old spin-doctor who helped presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush in many a jam. Gergen is off to teach at Duke University, where his father was once head of the mathematics department. Clinton brought Gergen, former editor of magazine US News and World Report, into the White House in May 1993 to stop the administration drowning in a tide of disasters. Gergen scored: Clinton's approval rating jumped from 37 to 60 per cent in February this year. But some prophetic words were printed in February this year by The Economist magazine: 'Watch the Gergenometer. When it reads 'jump ship', it should be a good indication of when one consummate insider reckons this presidency has peaked.' At Duke, Gergen will be teaching a course in 'governing in today's America'. He should sign up the Clintons, pronto.</p>

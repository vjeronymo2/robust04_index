			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum shaft closed Impala Platinum, the world's second biggest platinum producer, has closed a marginally-profitable shaft with the loss of more than two thousand jobs. It now employs about 35,000 workers, having shed more than a third of the workforce in the past two years in a bid to preserve profitability at a time of steadily declining metal prices. A company official yesterday said that the six-year-old shaft had been beset by underground mining difficulties, which had led to it being operated at only half of its rated capacity. Its closure would have a marginal impact on the group's overall platinum output of more than 1m troy ounces a year. She added that the closure of the shaft would improve Impala's working costs in the year ahead. 'Limited development work will continue as Impala plans to re-open the shaft when market conditions improve,' she said.</p>

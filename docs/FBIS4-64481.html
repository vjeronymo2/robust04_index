			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["J.K."-initialed report: "Several Thousand Jobs To Go at </F> Opel"]    [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main -- Opel will cut another several  thousand jobs. According to information received from the  German subsidiary of the U.S. automobile group General Motors,  the management and the work council are currently talking "about  necessary measures to adapt the size of the work force to  requirements." In the enterprise, which has 47,600 employees,  the work force will be reduced by some 2,000 men and women  "beyond natural fluctuation for structural reasons by the end of  the year." In plain English this means that twice as many jobs  as the figure that was mentioned are to be cut as part of  streamlining measures. After all, with a company of the size of  Opel, "natural fluctuation" should involve about 2,000 people a  year. [passage omitted]</p>

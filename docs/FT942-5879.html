The directors said an increase of Pounds 1.6m in stockbroking income to Pounds 7.95m was more than offset by a reduction of Pounds 2.9m in insurance agency income to Pounds 4.85m, which resulted from lower capacity under management and reduced levels of run-off management fees. The operating loss of insurance agencies was Pounds 1.84m (Pounds 1.99m) while stockbroking profit was Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 951,000). Net profit emerged at Pounds 243,000 (Pounds 196,000) and earnings per share were 0.5p (0.4p). The interim dividend is held at 1p.</p>

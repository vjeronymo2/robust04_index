Major Andy Evans said the event was also intended as an  exercise for the paratroopers, who had been in the ground in  Mmabatho since the SADF moved in last week. The SADF troops  would also assist in clearing up debris from the streets.    The SADF will distribute pamphlets in Mmabatho on Wednesday  thanking residents for their cooperation and encouraging them to  return to their normal activities.    On Tuesday an aircraft fitted with loudspeakers flew around  the area with the same message. Petrol will be brought into  Mmabatho, where fuel stations have been running dry, on a train  accompanied by an SADF escort on Tuesday.</p>

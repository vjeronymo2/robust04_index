			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (1): Institutions spur the recovery - Investors are prepared to look beyond current uncertainties, because yields are higher than on gilts THE UK property market, which has suffered the worst recession for at least 50 years, has finally turned the corner. After falling by an average of 42 per cent between November 1992 and May this year, property values have begun to recover. The pressure of funds going into the market is the highest for at least five years. As much as Pounds 7bn has been earmarked by institutions for property investment, according to recent surveys. Property companies are also in a strong position to make acquisitions. The virtual doubling of their share prices between mid-1992 and mid-1993 allowed them to raise close to Pounds 1.5bn in new funds. Even bankers, who are still grappling with serious problems on their property lending, have become less depressed about the industry's prospects. A recent survey by Chesterton reported a 'dramatic and comprehensive' change in outlook by bankers in the first half of this year. At first, the enthusiasm for property seems paradoxical. The property industry is still clearing up the damage left over from the late 1980s. The expansion of the economy and a sharp upturn in bank lending triggered the development of an excessive amount of new buildings, which were unable to attract tenants when the country went into recession. More than 15 per cent of offices in the UK's city centres are empty. Rents are still falling, except in parts of the retailing sector, and demand for new space from tenants remains feeble. Even those tenants who feel sufficiently confident to take new space are often prevented from doing so by difficulties in disposing of their existing leases. Rents may have further to fall. An examination of real rental performance, after adjusting for inflation, shows that rents have fallen no more since 1989 than they did during the mid-1970s crash, even though the fundamental problems facing the industry are more severe, particularly in the office sector. Investors are also concerned that the security of property's income stream is being undermined by the shift in the balance of power between landlord and tenant, which is eroding the traditional 25-year lease with upward-only rent reviews. In recent years, tenants have often been granted options to break their lease at certain times, which drastically reduces the value placed on a property. The government has announced changes to privity of contract, whereby a tenant who signs a lease is responsible for the rent owed by subsequent tenants throughout the lease's duration. The new rules, which will only apply to new leases, will restrict landlords' rights to claim unpaid rent. Landlords are anxiously awaiting the outcome of a Department of the Environment review of other aspects of leases, including upward-only rent review clauses. Landlords consider that, if these clauses were outlawed, it would reduce the security of a building's income and have a severe impact on property values. The reason why investors are prepared to look beyond these uncertainties is that property prices have tumbled to a level where yields - the ratio of annual income to capital value - are significantly higher than on gilt edged securities. The result is that a building with a financially strong tenant on a long lease is an investment with a security of income that resembles a bond. This relationship has increased the sensitivity of property to shifts in bond yields. Accordingly, property values increased as bond yields fell in the course of this year. But the boost to property values from declining bond yields is unlikely to be sustainable. The fundamental reason for investing in property is the prospect for a resumption in rental growth. Most commentators do not expect a resumption in rental growth until the latter part of next year, although already retail rents have stabilised. Even when rents begin to recover, the speed of the recovery will be slow unless there is marked improvement in the prospects for employment growth or retail spending. One factor stimulating a recovery in rental values is the fact that development is still at a low ebb. Only 6.2m sq ft of offices are currently being built in the UK's cities, compared with the 15m sq ft completed in the peak year of 1991. Even though more than 72m sq ft of office space remains in the planning pipeline, a shortage of bank finance will limit the scope for new building. With the exception of a handful of prominent schemes, the development projects currently being undertaken are limited to schemes that have already secured a tenant. The shortage of bank finance is proving a more general constraint on the recovery of the market. The willingness of banks to lend on property is generally confined to a small sector of the market, which has financially strong tenants on long leases. Many, probably most, properties are still unsaleable because of the difficulties of raising finance. So far, this emphasis on security of income, which is paramount for bankers and investors alike, has limited the resurgence in the property market. The importance that investors have traditionally placed on location when buying a property has fallen into second place behind security of income. Even buildings that are very over-rented - where the rent paid by the tenant exceeds the open-market rent - have proved highly popular, if the income stream is sufficiently secure. Opinions differ on the popularity of this type of building once the recovery in rental values gets under way. It is likely that high-yielding, over-rented buildings may lose some of their appeal, because it will be many years before an increase in rents will have an impact on their value. An improvement in tenant demand is also likely to make investors more adventurous in their choice of property, as there is a diminishing risk of being left with an empty building if the existing tenant defaults. property is confined to relatively few properties, which are often held by long-term investors. The result is that large sums of money chasing a relatively small pool of attractive properties are forcing values up sharply. As a result, there is concern in some quarters that the market is over-heating. The sceptics believe that rental prospects are not sufficiently good to justify the yields on which properties are changing hands. They believe that, unless bond yields remain on a downward track, the recovery in the property market will slow down next year as investors wait for more evidence of rental improvement. Nonetheless, those investors who bought property when the market was in the depths of depression have already reaped their reward. After a prolonged period in the doldrums, this was the year when property became fashionable again.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Unions 'will use the law' The government will face legal challenges from unions next year if it tries to exclude British workers from the benefits of European Union social affairs directives, says Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union. He argues in a prediction of the future of organised labour published in The Economist's World in 1994 that unions 'are learning to use a tool that has long been used against them: the law'. Mr Edmonds says the government will next year have to negotiate with the unions over 'its policy of cutting the pay and conditions of public-sector workers through the contracting-out of services or be sued for millions in compensation claims'. Unions will 'build on the best European practice to increase prosperity and raise standards at work', Mr Edmonds says. He predicts 'a new central role in formulating European Union law through the social protocol with its backing for negotiated European-wide framework agreements between employers and unions.' This is an opportunity for unions and employers 'to improve life at work'. He points in particular to the proposed EU directive on European works councils for large transnational companies. He says UK unions will be 'fully involved in the process, and once European works councils are set up, trade unionists across Europe will insist that British employees are represented'.</p>

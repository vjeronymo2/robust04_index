			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Export surge for Hungary Hungarian trade figures released yesterday demonstrated export resilience in the face of the international economic slowdown, reports Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Exports rose 12.5 per cent in the first three-quarters of 1992 compared with a year earlier, while imports fell back 2 per cent, leaving trade in balance. Deliveries slowed over the year as Germany, Hungary's largest trading partner, lost economic momentum. Nevertheless, the Hungarian government hopes that exports will lift the the economy in 1993.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE BEGINNING: BUSH  </P> <P> George Bush has been President of the United States for three months and he's  still "out of the loop." Instead of dominating the national agenda like his  predecessor, Bush seems to have trouble making the evening news.  </P> <P> On April 30, Bush will complete 100 days in office. It seems appropriate to ask  the usual questions at the end of the honeymoon. Was it good for us? And was it  good for him?  </P> <P> The answers are: It was pretty good for us. But it wasn't so good for him.  </P> <P> Politically, Bush seems to have defined himself as a weak, almost passive  President. The honeymoon is almost over and he hasn't won anything. Bush has  had only two experiences on his honeymoon -- losing and compromising. He lost  the big fight over the confirmation of John G. Tower, his first choice for  secretary of defense. And he compromised at the outset on a whole range of  issues: the federal budget, U.S. policy in Central America, gun control and the  minimum wage.  </P> <P> In no instance has Bush taken a firm stand, rallied public support and gotten  what he wants out of Congress. That was Ronald Reagan's style. Bush's style is  to make a deal. He negotiates quietly, outside the glare of publicity and with  as little rancor as possible. He then announces a compromise, shifts his  position to accommodate the outcome and invites the country to applaud the  spirit of bipartisanship and the new climate of cooperation.  </P> <P> Being seen as a great compromiser tends to diminish a President's stature. He  may be respected for his achievements but he loses his standing as a popular  hero who inspires loyalty. It seems unlikely that people will say about Bush  what one experienced observer said about Reagan. "Ronald Reagan was a  successful candidate and an effective President above all else because he stood  for a set of ideas," said this admirer. "He stated them in 1980 -- and it  turned out that he meant them -- and he wrote most of them not only into public  law, but into the national consciousness."  </P> <P> That assessment was offered by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) on March 6 at  Yale University.  </P> <P> A deal-making President also runs the risk of weakening his base. Conservatives  were delighted last year by Bush's hard-line, take-no-prisoners election  campaign. The Reaganites concluded, "He's one of us."  </P> <P> Now they're not so sure. He has let them down on "Star Wars," the Contras, the  Palestine Liberation Organization, gun control and the minimum wage, and  they're worried about his commitment on taxes and abortion. It cannot be said  with any certainty that conservatives will be there for Bush when his back is  to the wall -- as they were for Reagan during the 1982 recession and the  Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> Bush also risks losing his authority with Congress. The Tower affair proved  that Congress is not afraid of Bush. They defied him with impunity. The  President just turned the other cheek and nominated a defense secretary  Congress had no quarrel with.  </P> <P> To be sure, Bush has drawn the line on the minimum wage issue. He threatens to  veto any increase he finds unacceptable. But listen to the way Rep. Austin J.  Murphy (D-Pa.), chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee, answered  the President's veto threat. "We will send you this bill," Murphy said last  week, "and we will send you another bill and we will make you wish you did not  have the power to veto." No member of Congress ever talked that way to Reagan.  </P> <P> In short, Bush's approach to the presidency is determinedly unheroic, and he is  paying the price. But it hasn't been so bad for the country. The Administration  has made considerable progress on issues that seemed hopelessly stalemated  during the Reagan years -- Contra aid, the savings-and-loan crisis, the Middle  East and, not least important, the federal budget. Bush's "kinder, gentler"  approach has paid off in a new spirit of partnership. Issues are being resolved  and things are getting done without a lot of public fuss and name-calling.  </P> <P> With Bush, we seem to get more policy progress but less presidential authority.  You could see this in the two most important policy breakthroughs of the Bush  Administration -- the budget deal and the Contra agreement.  </P> <P> The "honeymoon ceremony" held on April 14 to announce a bipartisan budget  agreement was a little embarrassing. The agreement was essentially a short-term  fix. Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) described it as a "help me make it  through the night" approach to budgeting.  </P> <P> Congress and the President put together a package that reduces the 1990 deficit  by $27 billion -- just enough to avoid the automatic cuts mandated by the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. The deal includes a lot of accounting gimmicks,  one-time-only savings, temporary expedients and optimistic assumptions about  the economy. The tough choices were simply put off.  </P> <P> The important thing is that the agreement happened at all. "This is a first,  manageable step," Bush said, "and this budget agreement is the first such  agreement reached ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of crisis."  This year's agreement breaks the pattern of budget politics established during  the Reagan years. That was an annual shoot-out. Reagan would threaten to veto  taxing and spending bills he didn't like, and Congress would threaten to slash  his military budget.  </P> <P> Bush never went on TV to rally public support. Instead, he compromised. He gave  up his campaign pledge to reduce the capital gains tax. He swallowed $10  billion in defense cuts. And he agreed to $5.3 billion in new tax revenues from  unspecified changes in the tax law -- but "no new taxes." In other words, the  President weakened his position in order to avoid the gridlock of past budget  years. That's not a bad trade-off.  </P> <P> The Contra agreement approved by Congress this month represents a complete  reversal of Reagan's Central America policy. Bush has abandoned any military  solution. "We do not claim the right to order the politics of Nicaragua," Bush  said. According to one conservative critic, what Bush meant was: "We've sold  out the Contras."  </P> <P> The agreement provides $49.7 million in non-military aid to the Contras until  next February, when the Sandinista government is scheduled to hold free  elections. In its most controversial provision, the agreement gives Democratic  committee chairmen the power to veto any continued aid after November.  </P> <P> The Contra agreement removes a major issue of contention between the President  and Congress. To many conservatives, however, the agreement represents a  betrayal of principle. The Bush Administration has repudiated the goal of  overthrowing the Sandinista regime. Moreover, White House Counsel C. Boyden  Gray questioned the constitutionality of the deal because it gives Congress  veto power over the President.  </P> <P> The Contra agreement acknowledges political reality. Neither Congress nor the  U.S. public supports continued military aid. Five Central American governments  have signed a peace accord that calls for disbanding the Contras. Reagan never  accepted those realities, and so his Central American policies were  self-defeating. On the other hand, Reagan never allowed his foreign-policy  authority to be so deeply compromised.  </P> <P> Bush is often accused of having no agenda. That is not quite true. Bush's  agenda, in both domestic and foreign policy, is to de-ideologize U.S. politics.  He wants to heal the poisonous divisions that have beset America since the  1960s and return to a politics of compromise and consensus.  </P> <P> In his inaugural address, Bush complained that "a certain divisiveness" has  emerged in our political life "in which not each other's ideas are challenged  but each other's motives." Bush traced this divisiveness back to the 1960s: "It  has been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still."  </P> <P> The costs of that divisiveness were tragically apparent last week. Abbie  Hoffman, the prototypical '60s radical, committed suicide. And in his summation  to the jury, the prosecutor at Oliver L. North's trial said, "The tragedy of  Oliver North is that a man who said he cared so much about freedom and  democracy in Nicaragua forgot about the demands of freedom and democracy here  at home."  </P> <P> Reagan was a product of the 1960s. He was elected governor of California in  1966 because of backlash against the violence in Watts and Berkeley. And when  it suits him, Bush, too, can run to the right. In his inaugural address,  however, Bush changed his tune, saying, "I yearn for a greater tolerance, an  easy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life."  </P> <P> So Bush practices a politics of compromise. Compromise is the antithesis of  ideology. Ideologues like Reagan and North and Hoffman see politics as a  conflict of values, not a conflict of interests. Interests can be compromised.  Values cannot. How can you compromise on questions of right and wrong?  </P> <P> Bush sees the President as the great facilitator, not the great communicator.  His is an unheroic politics in which everything, or almost everything, is  negotiable. Reagan believed that minimum wage laws are wrong, that Americans  have an absolute right to bear arms and that the Sandinista government is an  intolerable threat to U.S. security. Bush has been willing to compromise on all  these points.  </P> <P> In Bush's case, government by compromise is a necessity. Unlike Franklin D.  Roosevelt in 1933 or Reagan in 1981, Bush does not assume the presidency at a  time of crisis. The voters are not demanding bold action. Nor does Bush take  office with a clear mandate for change. Unlike Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower,  John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Reagan, Bush was elected to  succeed a President from the same party.  </P> <P> Moreover, Bush presides over a divided government. Both houses of Congress are  controlled by the other party. As if to remind the President how vulnerable he  is, the Democrats have won two House seats in special elections so far this  year, and they may pick up a third next week in Wyoming. There is no way Bush  can govern without the cooperation of the Democrats.  </P> <P> Washington may be worried about a weak and ineffectual President, but the  public is not. Bush's job approval rating is running more than 60%.  Unemployment is at its lowest level in 15 years. Inflation seems to be under  control. There is no foreign-policy crisis, and the only scandal in Washington  involves the Democratic Speaker of the House. Maybe Bush isn't doing much. But  the American people aren't demanding he do much.  </P> <P> Bush's unheroic style seems fine -- for right now. But times keep changing.  Does Bush change? The evidence on this, up until now, is mixed.  </P> <P> During the last year alone, we have seen four different Bushes. During the  primaries, we had Bush the Wimp. Then he became Bush the Tough Guy in the  campaign against Michael S. Dukakis. Bush the Pro emerged during the transition  -- reassuring, self-confident and thoroughly professional. Now we have Bush the  Fixer, the man who can pull off a deal on the budget, a deal on the Contras, a  deal on everything. Sort of a Bush for all seasons. Underlying all of those  seasons, however, is a disturbing passivity.  </P> <P> Bush waits for something to go wrong. Then he makes a deal to fix it. But  sometimes you have to anticipate problems. And sometimes you have to take  decisive action without making a deal or building a consensus.  </P> <P> Twice during the honeymoon, the Bush Administration lost the initiative. The  President refused to assert any compelling public interest in the Eastern  Airlines strike. Now we are faced with the likely demise of a major air  carrier. And after the Alaskan oil spill, Bush delayed authorizing federal  participation in the cleanup. The results were catastrophic.  </P> <P> The President would do well to heed the message of the oil spill: If you don't  know where you're going, things can get sticky.  </P></p>

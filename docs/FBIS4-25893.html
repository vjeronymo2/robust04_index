			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 12 Jun (XINHUA) -- Bo Yibo, honorary  chairman for the "In-Depth Travel for Economic Efficiency in  China" activity, wrote a letter to the "In-Depth Travel for  Economic Efficiency in China" Activity Guidance Committee and  the "In-Depth Travel for Economic Efficiency in China" Activity  Publicizing Committee on 11 June, in which he called on them to  pay attention to investigations and studies, and publicize the  role of improved economic efficiency in promoting and ensuring  stability. The text of the letter reads:    To the Activity Guidance Committee and the Activity  Publicizing Committee of the "In-Depth Travel for Economic  Efficiency in China":    Recently, you have launched an all-out effort to publicize  the importance of raising economic efficiency, doing a great  deal of work in spreading awareness of efficiency, and in  fostering the efficiency concept. Your activities have elicited  a strong reaction from society. I would like to congratulate  and thank you!    Stability is a prerequisite for reform and development.  Raising efficiency is the foundation for maintaining stability.  Only by genuinely raising efficiency can we avoid serious  unevenness in our economic development and can we ensure a  stress-free environment for reform; only by genuinely raising  efficiency can we truly upgrade our national strength, truly  improve the people's living standards, and truly ensure social  stability. I hope the comrades responsible for "in-dept travel  for economic efficiency in China" activities will conduct  further investigations, studies, and propaganda to determine the  inherent relationship among deepening reform, raising  efficiency, and maintaining stability. In this way, you will be  able to render better service to reform, development, and  stability.    I hope you will achieve still greater achievements in your  activities!    [Signed] Bo Yibo    [Dated] 11 June 1994</p>

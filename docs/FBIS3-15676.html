			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The inner political crisis of parliament has  assumed such a scale that naturally a point of view is being  publicly shaped out on dissolving parliament and holding new  parliamentary elections. It could have been considered a  solution to the crisis if it were not for one most significant  circumstance: Holding such elections would confirm that the  Georgian jurisdiction does not apply to some regions. We  believe that dissolving parliament contradicts the interests of  Georgia because parliament is the only legitimate body  confirming Georgia's unity. Therefore, the parliamentary  majority goes out of its way for retaining the executive  legislative body of Georgia.    Unfortunately, the parliamentary opposition is behaving in  quite an opposite way. Some representatives of the opposition  systematically resort to threats, blackmail, and insults which  becomes unbearable.    Therefore, the population thinks that parliament must be  dissolved. Proceeding from the interests of the country, it is  crucial that we find ways for coexistence between the majority  and the opposition. Meanwhile, we declare that we shall react  lawfully to all instances of insult to personal honor.    [Signed] The council of the parliamentary majority.    [Dated] Tbilisi, 8 March, 1994.</p>

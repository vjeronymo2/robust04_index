			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Shops absorb devaluation costs: 1.7% inflation rate is lowest for 25 years; Fall in mortgage costs reduce figure; Most RPI elements drop THE RETAIL sector is taking sterling's devaluation on the chin. That was the main message from yesterday's announcement that headline inflation is at its lowest level for more than 25 years - in spite of the extra costs sparked by the declining pound. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is no doubt relieved that the UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism has yet to show through in the prices consumers pay. Many shopkeepers and others in the retail sector are less sanguine. The stagnant demand due to the lingering recession has forced much of the sector to absorb the costs of the devaluation through price cuts and reduced margins. Since Britain left the ERM on September 16, sterling has declined by 15 per cent, forcing retailers and wholesalers to pay more for foreign-made products. It has also pushed up costs of imported raw materials and energy purchased by British manufacturers, a factor which might lead eventually to higher prices for retail items. Under European Community rules, the devaluation has also pushed up the 'green pound', the artificial currency which sets how much UK farmers earn for their products. That has meant price rises for items such as milk and butter sold to food processors for turning into consumer products. No reliable figures exist for the extra costs on the retail sector resulting directly from the slide in sterling. But the Central Statistical Office reckons that - in the six months between August last year and January, and unadjusted for seasonal variations - prices paid by manufacturers for raw materials jumped by 10.6 per cent, much of this resulting from the devaluation. In retailing, the recorded increase in prices of goods and services has been many times less. The government's favoured level of underlying inflation - the retail prices index excluding mortgage costs - rose over the period by just 0.4 per cent. The increase has been from 136.9 to 137.4, counting January 1987 as 100. Including mortgage costs, the RPI has shown a 0.7 per cent fall over the same period, from 138.9 in August to 137.9 last month. This measure has been pushed down principally by reductions in mortgage payments, triggered by the fall in base rates from 10 per cent to 6 per cent. The year-on-year increase in the RPI in January - the so-called headline figure - was 1.7 per cent, the lowest since September 1967. While many retailers have suffered through absorbing higher costs of merchandise, their wage costs are under little pressure. Rapidly rising unemployment has depressed rises in earnings throughout industry. Between December and January, six out of the 14 main categories which comprise the RPI showed a fall in prices. The highlights were: Housing costs. These fell by 3 per cent on the month for a year-on-year decrease of 2.8 per cent - due mainly to the fall in average mortgage interest payments over the period from 9.4 per cent to 8.4 per cent. Household goods. Shops cut prices of items such as furniture, furnishings and cookers by 2.3 per cent in January compared with December, the largest monthly reduction since CSO records started in 1956. Clothing and footwear. Continued bargain sales mean these items have dropped in price by 4.6 per cent over the month for a year-on-year fall of 0.7 per cent. Leisure goods. There was a 0.2 per cent month-on-month fall in these items, including sporting equipment and hi-fi systems. Motoring expenses. The price of petrol fell between December and January with a gallon of 4-star going down by 7p to Pounds 2.31. Second-hand car prices fell in January by 4 per cent compared with the previous year. Fuel and light. In spite of higher prices for heating oil, this sector had a 0.2 per cent decrease in prices on the month. Food saw a small 0.3 per cent increase in prices on the month. Non-seasonal foods such as meat, sugar, sweets and chocolate saw a year-on-year rise in January of 2.1 per cent, the lowest increase since November 1987.  -------------------------------------------------------- UK INFLATION RATE (+1.7 per cent)   RPI 137.9 in January  --------------------------------------------------------                             Per cent  -------------------------------------------------------- Housing (172)                -2.8 Motoring (143)               +2.9 Food (non-seasonal) (130)    +2.1 Alcoholic drink (80)         +4.9 Household goods (77)         +1.5 Clothing &amp; footwear (59)     -0.7 Household services (48)      +3.3 Leisure goods (47)           +1.7 Catering (47)                +5.1 Fuel &amp; light (47)            -0.5 Personal goods, serv.

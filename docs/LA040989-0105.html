			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STARLING PONDERS CAREER WHILE SHOULDER HEALS  </P> <P> The phone at Marlon Starling's home rings and rings but there is no answer.  </P> <P> Ring!  </P> <P> "Do you want to fight Simon Brown?"  </P> <P> Ring!  </P> <P> "Do you want to fight Mark Breland in June?"  </P> <P> Ring!  </P> <P> "Do you want to move up in weight class, Ray Leonard's weight class?"  </P> <P> Ring!  </P> <P> "Do you want to fight in Japan? Europe? Anywhere?"  </P> <P> Starling has been laid low because of a shoulder injury that forced  cancellation of a third battle with Breland and resulted in termination of a  lucrative contract with Home Box Office.  </P> <P> Starling is in physical therapy and considering the next step of his career.  </P> <P> "The plan is he will fight sometime later this year, the earliest being late  July or August," Starling's adviser, Mort Sharnik, said Thursday.  </P> <P> Though the loss of the HBO deal, which could have been worth $1.6 million to  Starling, was a setback, it may be only a temporary one. Offers of other fights  are being fielded by Starling's representatives, including another with Breland  for June, which Starling has turned down.  </P> <P> Promoter Cedric Kushner said Starling was unable to accept a proposal to fight  Breland June 24 in a pay-per-view deal without medical clearance, which he  wouldn't receive for another couple weeks at the earliest.  </P> <P> Dan Duva, president of Main Events-Monitor Productions, said without 60-day  notice the pay-per-view deal could not be made and Breland probably would  schedule another fight in June or July.  </P> <P> The interest in reviving Starling-Breland, Sharnik said, is indicative of the  position Hartford's World Boxing Council welterweight champion is in now.  </P> <P> "Plenty of people are interested in putting him on," Sharnik said.  </P> <P> Sharnik and Starling huddled this week to discuss the available alternatives.  Sharnik said Starling could fight in Europe or Asia (possibly in a rematch with  Japan's Fujio Ozaki) and that he has had inquiries from the camp of IBF  welterweight champion Simon Brown about a match.  </P> <P> Sharnik said Starling has established a $1 million price tag for "exceptional  fights," including Breland, Brown and Julio Cesar Chavez. Other fights, such as  a WBC mandatory title defense against No. 1-ranked Yungkil Chung, Ozaki or  another top 10 contender is a possibility for a lesser purse.  </P> <P> Sharnik said a pay-per-view deal is a good possibility and that Starling  ultimately might make out as well or better than he would have with the HBO  agreement.  </P> <P> "He could fight for $600,000 or $1 million," Sharnik said. "Or, instead of  fighting once for $600,000, he could fight twice for $300,000. He's a hot  subject for pay-per-view. There's the (Tomas) Molinares knockout, he was  (burned) by the WBA and then he comes back and decimates the unquestioned king  of the welterweights."  </P> <P> Kushner said he is still going to try to honor his agreement with Starling for  a fight for $600,000 and then one for a million.  </P> <P> Sharnik and Kushner said one of the considerations is having a fight in  Hartford.  </P></p>

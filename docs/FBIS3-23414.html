He explained that the warrants were issued in absentia since  those accused have been abroad for a long time. Anyone can get  in contact with them and ask them. I have never heard of two of  the accused, who have been said to be members of the LF.    Dr. Ja'ja' maintained that the detention of Fu'ad Malik is  political. He hoped that he will be allowed to appoint a  defense lawyer, according to law and logic. Dr. Ja'ja' renewed  his call for open trials immediately. He affirmed that he is  ready for anything. He also affirmed that the truth will come  out and justice will take its course. He said: We are  reassured about our situation. We are very confident, and our  conscience is free.    The LF commander said: If they want to stop the LF from  exercising its political activity, let them try a much easier  way. Let them stop the LF without going to all this trouble and  misleading the public.    Dr. Ja'ja' affirmed that pressure, accusations, and such  measures will not change the convictions of the LF.</p>

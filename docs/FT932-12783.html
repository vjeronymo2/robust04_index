			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): 10 ways to speed payment The upturn, when it comes, can be no excuse for easing the tighter credit controls many businesses have introduced during the recession. Financing an upsurge in orders requires continuing tough cash management and customers must still be made to pay on time, according to Alex Lawrie, a factoring company. It has a 10-point plan of action: Evaluate the credit status of new customers and regularly review that of existing customers. New orders are good news, unless the customer cannot or will not pay. Define and agree credit limits with customers. Giving unlimited credit is dangerous. Some customers may take advantage by delaying payment on large orders, others may go bust. Agree payment terms with customers. State terms clearly on invoices. Make sure invoices are sent out promptly to the correct address. Ensure they are accurate, relate to the goods delivered and include details such as order numbers. Keep a record of amounts owing. The sales ledger should carry records of sales and credit notes issued. Follow up outstanding accounts. Check that customers have received invoices and that they have approved payment. Issue regular monthly statements on time. Do not hesitate to send reminder letters to overdue accounts. Get on the phone to confirm which invoices are being paid, how much is being paid, when and how payment will be made and who you are dealing with. Always ask to speak to the same person. Set objectives for the phone call. They should be to obtain payment, retain goodwill and 'make this the last call'. Confirm in writing what has been agreed on the phone. Do not be afraid to consider legal proceedings if payment is not forthcoming. Often the threat is enough - 75 per cent of slow payers settle on receipt of a solicitor's letter. Match payments against invoices and maintain a separate record of unpaid invoices. CBA card with a checklist of how to handle telephone calls to slow payers is available free. Tel. 0295 272272.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chinese President Jiang Zemin by NHK Chief </F> Commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima in Beijing's Zhongnanhai on 10  June; from the "World Station 22" program -- recorded; Jiang's  remarks in Chinese fading into Japanese translation]    [Excerpts] [Takashima] I have many things to ask you.  First, I would like to ask you about an issue that draws  international attention. The international community has  continued discussion on North Korea's (DPRK's) suspected nuclear  arms development, with China playing a leading role. I would  like to ask how China intends to resolve the issue.    [Jiang Zemin] We follow current events with great interest.  Patient efforts are necessary to solve complicated issues such  as the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The more  difficult the issue, the more we need to keep calm. We are  calling on all parties concerned to exercise restraint. In  solving the issue, the ultimate objectives are to secure  stability and peace on the peninsula and to achieve  denuclearization there. As long as we do not deviate from these  two basic objectives, it is possible to find a way of resolving  the issue properly, whatever temporary difficulties may arise.    What we should see is that the door to negotiations has not  been completely closed and that there is still room for  dialogue. All nations concerned need to take active measures to  prevent the crisis from intensifying, and they should not let  their efforts over the past year be wasted. China does not  approve of sanctions. Sanctions will not help us resolve the  issue. On the contrary, they will escalate the situation and  bring about a result which no one wants to see. The only way  for resolving the issue is to continue dialogue.    [Takashima] I would like to ask an additional question. Mr.  President, you said the door to negotiations has not yet been  closed. In concrete terms, what kind of talks do you think will  be held in the future?    [Jiang] We have consistently hoped that talks among the four  concerned parties, including North Korea, will be held.    [Takashima] The Japanese people have come to share a  stronger belief that relations with China have become more  important in view of various issues, including North Korea's  nuclear issue. Mr. President, what is your view on the current  situation of relations between Japan and China and on future  relations?    [Jiang] We saw several great changes in Japan's political  scene. However, the friendly cooperation between China and  Japan in various fields is steadily developing. The Japanese  ruling and opposition parties, as well as many Japanese people,  share the view that friendly cooperation between Japan and China  should be developed. Sino-Japanese friendship is full of great  vitality based on common interests, long historical and cultural  origins, and a solid foundation of the masses. As a politician,  I would like to fall in line with the historical trend of the  times and do some solid deeds to help build bilateral relations.  The 20th century is coming to an end soon. Between China and  Japan, there is a civilian organization called the 21st Century  Committee for China-Japan Friendship. This indicates that both  the Chinese and Japanese peoples wish to look forward to the  21st century by building Sino- Japanese relations based on  mutual understanding, mutual trust, equality, cooperation, and  common prosperity. I am fully confident about the future of  Sino-Japanese relations.    [Takashima] Next I would like to ask you about Sino-U.S.  relations, which must be very important in regards to China's  foreign affairs. While the United States has extended China's  most favored nation [MFN] status, it is also a fact that there  is some opposition to it in the United States. Mr. President,  how do you feel about the current state of bilateral relations  with the United States, and how do you feel about future  relations?    [Jiang Zemin] President Clinton recently announced his  decision to extend China's MFN status and pledged not to link  the human rights issue to the MFN status in the future. This  decision will help strengthen and expand cooperative ties in  economics and trade between China and the United States. It  will also conform to the basic interests of the two countries  and their peoples. As long as both sides look toward the  future, the global situation as a whole, and their basic  interests; adhere to the principles set in the three Sino-U.S.  joint communiques, enhance trust, develop cooperation, and avoid  confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly.    [Excerpts] [passage omitted on NHK commentators restating  what is about to be discussed in the actual interview]  [Takashima] Fifteen years have passed since the social market  economy and the reform and open-door policies were introduced.  The Chinese economy is now making remarkable progress. How do  you assess this situation?    [Jiang] Major changes have been made during the past decade  since we launched the reform and open-door policies. We have  formed a versatile economic framework centered around public  ownership systems, including the state ownership system. The  market has already started to play the fundamental role of  distributing [word indistinct]. The areas directly controlled  by the government are already shrinking. The 14th Communist  Party of China [CPC] National Congress in 1992 confirmed the  socialist market economy's goals. We adopted a resolution  regarding the establishment of the socialist market economy at  the 3d Plenary Session of the [13th] CPC Central Committee,  which was held in November last year. We are preponderantly  solving problems on the basis of these decisions.    The socialist market economy is linked to socialism's  fundamental systems. There is no precedence for making such a  system. It is creative work and, needless to say, we face  various problems. For example, we have to find solutions to how  we will maintain a balance between reform, development, and  stability; regulate the roles of macro control and market; bring  about the enterprising spirit in the urban and local areas; link  material culture with spiritual culture; realize overall social  progress centered around economic construction; and etc.    We already have some experiences in the field of recognizing  and treating these problems. Our tasks, or the framework of the  CPC's tasks, are moving toward a new direction on the basis of  the policies designed to find a chance, promote reform, expand  the open- door policies, promote progress, and maintain  stability. We can fulfill this historic responsibility through  the party's unified guidance and joint efforts by the people of  each nationality across the nation under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  ideology of socialism, which is peculiar to China, and the CPC's  fundamental line. We will establish the social market economic  system by the end of the 21st century and will complete the  building of an affluent and democratic socialist nation by  around the middle of the 21st century.    [Excerpts] [Takashima] In the remarks you have just made,  Mr. President, you mentioned that problems of various types have  surfaced in the Chinese economy. There are such problems as  disparity between urban and rural areas and corruption, which  has been reported in several localities. You said that positive  measures will be taken to deal with these problems. I would  like to hear what practical plans you have in mind to resolve  these domestic problems that China is now facing.    [Jiang] All those problems that I have just mentioned are  connected with each other. First, further efforts should be  made to build a clean government and to get rid of corruption.  These are the conditions required for establishing the  socialist market economic system, and at the same time, they  will affect the success or failure of our reform policy. Our  party and government maintain a very clear-cut position on this  issue. The economy will be developed and the government will  become a clean one.    Generally speaking, the large majority of our cadres are  good. Only a small number are corrupt, and severe disciplinary  actions will be taken against them in accordance with party  discipline and state laws. Various measures have already been  taken and some results have been gradually achieved through  educational, administrative, juridical, and other measures.  Efforts will be made to get rid of corruption and our  determination is supported by the general public.    With the economy's development, disparity has come to exist  and expand between urban and rural areas as well as among  various localities. There are various reasons for such a  phenomenon. The basic objective of socialism lies in  eliminating poverty and sharing prosperity. And therein also  lies the objective of efforts to promote reform and development.  It is also an important factor for maintaining stability of our  society and unity of our nation.    In the course of attaining this objective, there naturally  exists differences in the speed of achievement among various  localities, with some developing faster than others. We  encourage those localities with favorable conditions to promote  development at a faster speed. At the same time, we encourage  other localities that are developing at a slower pace to speed  up their development by making good use of their strong points.  We encourage those localities developing at a faster speed to  assist other localities developing at a slower pace with funds,  technology, and talented people. The government will also  provide sufficient assistance to those localities developing at  a slower pace in such areas as policy, finance, and materials.    At present, we are engaged in promoting a mid-term 7-year  program to eliminate poverty. We intend to resolve problems in  seven years for 80 million people who have not solved such basic  necessities as food and clothing. We are convinced that through  such measures, the disparity between urban and rural areas and  among various localities, will be gradually reduced.    Such disparity between urban and rural areas and among  various localities also exist in various countries of the world.  We are willing to learn from other countries' useful  experiences in resolving this problem. At the same time, we  will basically and eventually resolve this problem with the  strength of socialism and our own practice and experiences. The  superiority of the socialist system lies in the idea of all  people sharing prosperity and making progress.    When viewed from a long-term standpoint, the disparity  existing between urban and rural areas and among various  localities will gradually be reduced, but will never expand.  Otherwise, stability in our society and country cannot be  maintained. We have a very clear understanding of these  problems. Measures to deal with these issues are being  perfected day by day.    [Excerpts] [Takashima] Mr. President, it has been widely  reported that you visited Shanxi Province last January and  firmly stated your resolve to stamp out absolute poverty, as you  have just mentioned, within this century, and that you also said  the development of rural districts and their stability hold the  key to China's development and stability. Do you think there is  sufficient time to solve the problem by the end of the century?  It has been said that there are concerns in some quarters that  the gap between cities and rural districts may cause social  unrest in China. How do you feel about this?    [Jiang] Regarding this problem, we have already explained  our  policy. That is, while acknowledging the disparity that  actually exists among regions, our job is directed toward  reducing such gaps. These problems can be solved through our  efforts and through appropriate measures and policies.    [Takashima] One last question. Mr. President, you are also  the commander in chief of the Chinese military. Let me ask you  about the future of the People's Liberation Army [PLA]. What do  you have in mind regarding plans to reform the PLA? Also,  looking at China from the outside, it has been pointed out that  China has been building up its military. For example, it has  been noted that China increased its defense spending by 22  percent this year. Please let us hear about your views  regarding the PLA's future.    [Jiang] To protect our sovereignty and our territories,  preserve the nation's unity, ensure our people's safety, and  ensure socialism can be modernized and constructed in a safe and  stable environment, the PLA is burdened with heavy  responsibilities. The basic policy regarding military buildup  at a certain period in the future is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  idea on military buildup in a new age -- that is, China's unique  way of modernizing its military and improving its quality, in  particular, improving hi-tech defense capabilities. We will  gradually change the PLA into a modern regular revolutionary  army. The Chinese Government's investment in military  construction is very limited. This year's defense budget is 52  billion yuan, which is around 1.7 percent of the gross national  product. It is about 6 billion U.S. dollars and less than  one-fifth of Japan's [defense budget]. The amount of Japan's  [defense budget] exceeds $30 billion. Military expenses per  person is even less. The small increase in the military budget  is purely for defense purposes and will not pose a threat to  other countries. All knowledgeable people in the world admit  that stability in China will serve for stability in Asia and the  world. The Chinese people, who went through difficulties during  wartime, truly want peace and stability while promoting  socialism's modernization. China will not take part in an arms  race, form military alliances, nor engage in power disputes.

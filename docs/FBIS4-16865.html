			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Immediate release" from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F> Affairs in Tallinn on 19 April: "Statement in Connection With  the Situation in Bosnia" -- received via Internet E-LIST]    [Text] The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia  expresses its concern in connection with the increased military  activity in Bosnia. The Foreign Ministry condemns the actions  of the Serbian armed forces in Bosnia, which are aimed against  the United Nations peacekeeping forces and against the "safe  areas" declared by the UN Security Council. By ignoring  decisions of the UN Security Council and earlier cease-fire  agreements, the Serbs in Bosnia set themselves against the  international community.    The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Estonia greatly  respects the UN decision to create "safe areas" and expresses  its dissatisfaction over the fact that agreements achieved  during the peace process are not being lived up to. This is one  more indication that the world organization must take even more  decisive steps to prevent the spread of the conflict and to  achieve a general cease-fire in Bosnia.</p>

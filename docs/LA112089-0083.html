			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: 2 LASER FIRMS COULD LOSE LUSTER, SHORT-SELLERS SAY  </P> <P> Has the laser industry gotten ahead of itself? That's what some analysts  believe. While laser is still considered on the cutting edge of medical  technology, with a number of companies showing great promise, it hasn't been  proven effective or safe for all applications.  </P> <P> Yet the mere mention of the word laser is enough to get stocks rolling. Witness  the swift rise of Malvern, Pa.-based Surgical Laser Technologies, whose stock  has been selling at a fat premium to its initial offering price since going  public last month. But some short-sellers believe that the company could soon  face scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration and shareholders. That's  because at least one person has died from complications related to the use of  the company's laser, a fact that wasn't disclosed at the time of the offering.  Although the company doesn't deny the death, it says it was caused by doctor  error and was an isolated incident.  </P> <P> Also on the shorts circuit: Minneapolis-based GV Medical, whose laser catheter  is used to pierce plaque in coronary arteries. The shorts have raised questions  about the product's safety and effectiveness compared to other clot-busting  methods. President James Grabek downplays both issues but acknowledges that  sales have already started to slow. The company recently announced layoffs  because of high inventories. Its stock is now near its 52-week low of $6.  </P> <P> While on the subject of shorting: Another company that is attracting the bears  is Glenview, Ill.-based Zenith Electronics. Robert Holmes, president of Gilford  Securities in Chicago, believes that Zenith shares could fall by half in coming  months, "by eighths and quarters," if its strategy as a television manufacturer  fails.  </P> <P> Holmes thinks that it will. He cites possible cash problems and hurdles related  to capitalizing on high-definition TV. The Bush Administration has indicated  that it plans to cut funds earmarked for HDTV development. Holmes started  shorting the stock when it was $17.50 one month ago, after the company put its  profitable computer business up for sale. The stock closed Friday at $12.375.  </P> <P> Holmes' firm was one of the first to advocate shorting Baldwin-United in the  early '80s, long before the company filed for bankruptcy and its stock  collapsed. More recently, he was shorting Texas Air as it rose into the high  teens. It closed Friday at $12.25, and he's still short.  </P> <P> As for Zenith, the most bullish scenario, he says, would be for the company to  be acquired. But last year the company hired an investment banker to search for  possible buyers, he points out, and couldn't find any.  </P> <P> Gold diggers: Like most gold stocks, Newmont Mining has been rocketing higher  during the past month. But unlike the rest, it has also been the subject of  takeover speculation. Several analysts reject that possibility. "Unfeasible" is  the way one put it, in part because of a standstill agreement that prevents  Hanson Trust's Consolidated Gold Fields unit from selling its 49% stake in  Newmont to someone else. Not only that, says Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette  analyst John Tumazos, but Newmont is trading at 30 times its most recent  12-month earnings, and "no mining company in the world can afford to pay" what  it would take to buy the company.  </P> <P> His guess? He thinks that Hanson will skirt the standstill agreement by copying  what Carl C. Icahn did with his chunk of Texaco stock: He sold it as a block  trade through a dozen brokers at prices below Texaco's market price at the  time.  </P> <P> What are some of the Big Board's worst stocks right now? According to Joe  Barthel, a technical analyst at Hopper Soliday &amp; Co. in Great Neck, N.Y.,  potentially serious losers include Hexcel Corp., Fleetwood Enterprises, Rohr  Industries, TransTechnology Corp., Morgan Products, Hitachi Ltd. and Zenith.  Barthel bases his opinion on a variety of technical factors.  </P> <P> His "short-sale ideas," as he calls them, performed poorly during the market's  two-year rally, and his forecast is for stock prices in general to go lower.  "If they were weak in a strong environment, they'll be weaker in a weak  environment," he says.  </P></p>

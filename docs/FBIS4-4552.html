			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Urged Not To Open Market Only To Avoid </F> Facing Sanctions From U.S."]    [Text] The 1994 annual report on foreign trade barriers  released by the U.S. trade representative states that Japan has  set up trade barriers for 43 items in seven sectors; this is the  largest number of items so noted yet. Among them are the  automobile, insurance, and government procurement areas that  were discussed as priority sectors at the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks.    The annual report has been released every April, but the  1994  report will provide a basis for the Clinton administration to  compile a list of nations to be subject to the Super 301  provision it has recently revived. For this reason, the  Japanese Government is wary of the 1994 annual report. What is  important for now is that Japan should open up its market  thoroughly and widely with the ultimate aim of turning Japan  into an open-market nation in order to avoid facing criticism  from the rest of the industrialized nations, not sanctions from  the United States.    The Clinton administration's trade strategy to open the  markets of its trade partners by using the Super 301 provision  as a lever for imposing sanctions has been under much  international attack. Now that the Uruguay Round of GATT has  just directed that trade disputes should be settled through  multilateral, not bilateral, negotiations, the worldwide  consensus holds that the Clinton administration's trade strategy  runs counter to GATT's rules.    In the United States, however, even many self-proclaimed  advocates of free trade regard the Super 301 provision as a  "nuclear deterrent for the world trade system." Although the  Clinton administration believes that Super 301 should not be  used recklessly, it believes that the provision can be used as a  weapon to open the markets of its trade partners and can  contribute to the expansion of world trade.    It is remarkable that any nation would point out its  partners' trade barriers; even if a nation thinks its market is  fully open, its trade partners may believe that its market is  closed. If a nation issues warnings on the possibility of  imposing sanctions, this is even more remarkable.    If the U.S. trade representative finds what it believes are  trade barriers in its partners' markets, it should take the  issue to GATT for arbitration; this is the logical thing to do.  GATT is the only international trade forum that can determine  whether such trade barriers actually exist or if they are based  on a misunderstanding.    The number of Japanese trade barriers cited in the 1994  report is the largest ever. [Ira] Shapiro, adviser to the U.S.  trade representative, has stressed, "the amount of Japanese  trade barriers are exceptional among the G-7 industrialized  nations." The Japanese Government, for its part, has so far  worked to open markets in Japan and cannot take at face value  the claims by U.S. trade authorities on Japanese trade barriers;  however, it is true that ambiguous bureaucratic regulations and  exclusionary business practices in Japan still keep the Japanese  market closed. Japanese bureaucrats, who have refuted the U.S.  trade authorities, cannot confidently say the Japanese market is  open wider than the American and European markets.    Japan should work out its own way to open up its market  instead of opening up reluctantly under threats from the United  States. The government is set to map out another package of  external economic measures in June. The government should map  out a package of the most concrete external economic measures,  both in the macroeconomic and microeconomic areas, rather than  work out a collection of piecemeal measures to avoid facing U.S.  sanctions. To that end, the work of mapping out the package  should not be left to bureaucrats, and politicians should make  decisions on their own.    In any case, Japan's current account surplus is too large.  Japan can no longer be suspected by its trade partners of  keeping its market closed. The market of the world's top  surplus nation should be the most widely open one. Opening the  Japanese market is expected to benefit Japanese consumers and  serve to improve Japan's economic system.</p>

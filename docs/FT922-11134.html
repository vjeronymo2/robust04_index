			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Hilary Term cases THE GREGOS (FT, February 14) In the present appeal, an issue concerned the date on which the legitimacy of the voyage had to be established and the charterers contended it was the date when the order was given.  The owners contended, and the arbitrator awarded, that it was the date when the order became effective and the vessel was required to comply with it. In rejecting the charterers' appeal, Mr Justice Evans stated that the charterers' contention, if correct, would mean that a charterer, who chose a time well in advance of the last voyage and gave instructions which, even if reasonable at that time, would remain binding on the vessel regardless of subsequent events. The charterers' obligation to give voyage order was similar to their obligation to order the vessel only to safe ports. If a port - safe when the order was given - became unsafe, then a secondary obligation to change the order arose. There was no distinction in principle between that situation and one which concerned the date of the last voyage. THE BIJELA (FT, February 18) Under the York-Antwerp Rules 1974, Rule XIV provided that, where temporary repairs of accidental damage were effected 'to enable the adventure to be completed', the cost of such repairs should be admitted as general average 'but only up to the saving in expense which would have been incurred and allowed in general average if such repairs had not been effected there'. In the present case, the vessel and its cargo having arrived at port of refuge and being no longer in peril, it was the shipowners' duty to carry out, without unreasonable delay, such repairs as were necessary to carry the cargo to its contractual destination, and to bear the expense of those repairs. In giving judgment for the defendant, cargo-owners and their guaranteeing banks on a claim by the shipowners for general average in respect of temporary repairs to the Bijela, Mr Justice Hobhouse stated that the cost of performing the voyage and carrying the cargo to destination was an expense borne by shipowners alone; the risk of accident was one that the carrier accepted when he entered into the contract of carriage. LINDEN GARDEN TRUST LTD v LENESTA SLUDGE DISPOSALS LTD AND OTHERS ST MARTINS PROPERTY CORPORATION LTD AND ANOTHER v SIR ROBERT McALPINE &amp; SONS LTD (FT, February 19) In both these cases, building works were carried out under a contract with a person who had a proprietary interest in the building when the contract was made. The original employers transferred their interest in the building to others, and also purported to assign the building contracts. The contracts, on standard Join Contract Tribunal (JCT) forms, contained a term in clause 17 that the employers would not assign 'this contract' without the contractor's consent but consent was never obtained. Linden sued as assignees whereas, in the St Martins case, both the assignors (Corporation) and the assignees (Investments) sued. In the Linden case, the assignors had an accrued cause of action against the contractors for Pounds 22,205 by the date of assignment and that claim was validly assigned. Further breaches were later discovered, giving rise to a Pounds 236,000 loss for which the assignors acquired a cause of action in respect of those defects and, after assignment, Linden became entitled to enforce the claim. In the St Martins case, when Corporation executed an assignment in favour of Investments, there was no existing cause of action. Corporation, by the assignment, transferred to Investments the contractual right to have the building properly constructed and Investments could sue for breach, the Court of Appeal held. THE RUBI SEA (FT, February 21) In deciding that the caveators, Ince &amp; Co, should recover their costs of the arrest of a vessel in priority to all claims, other than the Admiralty Marshal's charges and expenses, Mr Justice Sheen stated that a warrant for arrest could not be executed until there had been lodged in the Marshal's office an undertaking to pay on demand the Marshal's fees and expenses in respect of the ship's arrest and its care and custody while under arrest. That undertaking was normally given by the plaintiff's solicitor personally. In such circumstances, the solicitor could not be expected to delay his instructions to arrest while he made inquiries as to whether a claimant with a higher priority intended to enforce his claim. The plaintiff, who first arrested the ship, preserved the property on behalf of all claimants within the jurisdiction, his Lordship held. THE GOLDEN MED (FT, February 25) In a transaction for the financing of the building of a ship, the plaintiffs deposited Dollars 600,000 with the bank. The negotiations broke down and the plaintiffs demanded the money but the bank refused to pay. In proceedings, the bank was ordered to return the money and the plaintiffs sought compound interest. It was common ground that the court had jurisdiction in an appropriate case to award compound interest in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction.  In awarding compound interest, Mr Justice Hirst stated that the bank was essentially engaged in investment business, and must be presumed to have used its money for normal banking purposes as part of its working capital, and thus to have been in a position to earn compound interest itself. It was wrong to argue that compound interest was only to be awarded in exceptional cases where the defendant had been guilty of serious misconduct. The authorities made it clear that such an award was in no way punitive but related to commercial circumstances. THE ANTCLIZO (NO 2) (FT, February 26) Discharge of a cargo was completed at Bombay but disputes arose between the parties as to despatch, demurrage and balance of freight. Clause 34 of the charterparty provided that at port of discharge, time was to count from 24 hours after notice of readiness, 'vessel also having been entered at Customs House and in free pratique'.  The arbitrators' decision that notice of readiness given at Bombay was valid was upheld at first instance, contrary to the charterers' argument that since prior entry did not carry with it an order permitting inwards entry, only final entry would satisfy clause 34. The argument had obvious difficulties, the Court of Appeal stated in dismissing the charterers' appeal. First, if notice of readiness could not be given until final entry and that did not take place until after inwards entry had been granted and discharge commenced, it was unlikely that clause 34 was intended to produce the result contended for. To provide for a 24 hours' notice of readiness to be given after discharge had already begun, made no sense at all. Second, the vessel was physically entered at Customs House when prior entry was completed. Third, prior entry was important for importers, who would know they could proceed and arrange for discharge. FITZWILLIAM (COUNTESS) AND OTHERS v INLAND REVENUE COMMISSIONERS (FT, February 28) After the death of Earl Fitzwilliam in 1979, Lady Fitzwilliam and her daughter, Lady Hastings, were left an estate valued at just over Pounds 12.4m net. After instructions were given to the solicitors, a series of transactions were entered into to mitigate liability that would subsequently be incurred on the death of Lady Fitzwilliam. Mr Justice Vinelott quashed a decision that capital transfer tax was payable on these transactions by virtue of the Ramsay principles (see (1982) AC 300) as a preordained series of transactions which, where they made up one single composite transaction, was held by the House of Lords as liable to producing an unacceptable fiscal result. Dismissing the Revenue's appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that the scheme was qualified by the suggestion, apparently acted upon, that Lady Hastings should receive separate legal advice. The steps taken were not only not preordained and not cut and dried, but there was recognition of a real possibility that the proposals would not go through at all. Such a qualification was fatal to application of the Ramsay principle.</p>

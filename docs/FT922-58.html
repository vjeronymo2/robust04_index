			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Government pledge on work schemes MEMBERS OF occupational pension schemes are to be given a new entitlement to an annual statement saying how much their savings are worth, the government said yesterday. It committed itself to the move in a formal response to the report on the Maxwell affair from the cross-party social security committee of the last parliament. The change in the law is, however, unlikely to be immediate. It will probably be carried out along with the conclusions of the pension law review committee set up earlier this month to look at pension law and regulation. The committee, to be chaired by Professor Roy Goode of Oxford University, is to publish a consultation paper within a few weeks as its first step. While the government has accepted the main recommendations of the social security committee, it continues to argue that it does not have any special responsibility for members of the BIHL pension scheme - the company that was sold to Robert Maxwell by British Airways in 1986, when BA was still publicly owned. Ministers say that BA's articles of association meant that the transport secretary had to be notified of the decision, but did not have any right of consent. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has also moved to tighten information provision for pension scheme members. Information that must now be provided, under regulations laid yesterday, includes details about the pensions ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service and the ombudsman.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Patients Quite Satisfied With Care"] </F>   [Text] If the patient survey of randomly selected consumers  of health care services undertaken by Finland's Consumer  Association and Finland's Patient Association in  October-November is to be believed, Finns are quite satisfied  with the health care they receive.    Fully 84 percent of the 1,043 individuals who answered the  questionnaire were either satisfied or very satisfied with their  care, and even slightly more felt that doctors, nurses, and  other personnel treated them well or very well. Patients in the  private health care sector believed they were better treated  than those in the public sector did.    Very few patients had much comment upon the professional  skills of the medical personnel. Even so, it appeared that they  placed greater confidence in doctors and other health care  workers in the private sector than in the public sector.    Nor did patients complain about the information they  received. Over 80 percent believed that they had received  adequate information from doctors and nurses. The general  opinion seemed to be that nurses were a little better than  doctors in giving out information expected of them. And once  again, the new survey showed a slightly better percentage for  the private sector than for the public sector.    And yet, the large majority felt that health care services  should be financed entirely (24 percent) or partially (72  percent) through taxes. Only 23 percent of those queried felt  that health care was expensive or very expensive. Should more  health care services be subject to fees, the consensus was that  families with children should receive special access to care.    The survey was undertaken in eight areas: Bjorneborg,  Helsinki, Jakobstad, Joensuu, Jyvaskyla, Rovaniemi, Salo, and  Tammerfors. Unfortunately, local results were not yet available  when the Consumer Association announced the results yesterday.    The survey left many unanswered questions. It will likely be  repeated next year in order to get a better idea of the  recession's effect on health care standards.    For example, in Jakobstad, the questionnaire was divided  between Jakobstad's hospital and Ostanlid's hospital.    "We do not know whether the patients were actually satisfied  at Ostanlid, which is threatened with closure, or whether they  gave the care there very high marks in order to show that they  wished to keep the hospital," said Karl-Gustav Sodergard,  chairman of Finland's Patient Association.    The patients' message to the policymakers overwhelmingly  concerned the standard of care. The unanimous opinion: Do not  cut costs to the extent that the quality of care will suffer.</p>

As is known, it did not quite  satisfy these countries. The reasons for this lie both in  foreign and internal politics: The United States has a large  Polish population. They constitute a powerful political and  electoral lobby which is closely watching the administration's  approach to Poland's admission to NATO. It was not accidental  that on the eve of Clinton's European tour, U.S. Vice President  Al Gore offered an explanation of U.S. policy in Milwaukee, of  all places, with its large Polish community.    Reading Clinton's speech (the president had to give the text  of his speech to Gore following the unexpected death of his  mother), Gore laid special emphasis on the fact that the  Partnership for Peace is a real step toward the admission of  Poland and other East European countries to full NATO  membership. This argument presumably became the main one in the  course of Clinton's meetings with the East European leaders in  Prague.    In Moscow, on the other hand, it would be most logical for  Clinton to present the "second face" of NATO's two-faceted  initiative and insist that the United States has fully taken  Russia's interests into account and has sought to avoid such  decisions that might be perceived as attempted geopolitical  isolation. Incidentally, there is a considerable grain of truth  in this: It was the U.S. Administration that initiated the idea  of partnership, having been confronted with an extremely  complicated problem of simultaneously taking into account the  interests of East Europe and Russia and also its own interests  and the interests of its bloc allies as well as NATO's real  capabilities. The authors of the idea are apparently General  John Shalikashvili, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and  Strobe Talbott, until recently in charge of the entire Russian  policy in the U.S. State Department, who was then appointed  first deputy to Secretary of State Christopher.    The Clinton administration should be given its due: In a  fairly complex and extremely conflicting situation it has chosen  apparently the sole correct option. It was also dictated by the  fact that politically Bill Clinton is almost inseparably linked  to Boris Yeltsin and his fate. Up to now Russia's relatively  successful advance down the path of democratic development has  been seen as one of the major success stories for the  administration -- which, incidentally, have been few and far  between on the foreign political scene. Clinton has invested  such political capital in Boris Yeltsin that should Yeltsin  collapse, Clinton will suffer a colossal defeat. Along with the  failures in Somalia and Bosnia, this could drastically undermine  the positions and authority of his administration not only in  international affairs but in America itself.    Already now Clinton's unqualified support for President  Yeltsin is drawing sharp criticism in the United States, which  is rising as the situation in Russia destabilizes. Therefore it  is not ruled out that as a result of the trip the  administration's line will be adjusted somewhat. Prior to the  visit the White House announced that the president intends to  meet with representatives of broad political forces, including  communists but excluding Zhirinovskiy. Strobe Talbott also made  it clear that the administration intends to expand contacts with  representatives of the democratic opposition and stop focusing  on Yeltsin alone.    Meanwhile the "Z factor," as Western journalists have dubbed  Zhirinovskiy, is turning for Clinton into a perennial headache  and a major element in political decisionmaking. Practically  the entire U.S. press is talking about the revival of imperial  nationalism in Russia, finding confirmation for this even in  deeds and statements by Yeltsin and Kozyrev. Clinton is being  called upon to do away with the legacy of Yalta, that is to say,  with consideration for Russian interests with respect to Eastern  Europe. The intensity of debate in the United States in fairly  high. Moreover, there is no unity within the administration  itself: According to some reports, even prior to Zhirinovskiy's  victory Secretary of State Christopher spoke in favor of the  NATO Council session in Brussels giving a clearer signal to the  East Europeans that they would soon be admitted to NATO.    Thus, Russian-American relations are again being subjected  to  a very serious test of durability, when the public background in  the West in clearly unfavorable for Russia. Will Clinton manage  to find that solely correct note that will allow him to avoid  the traps and dangers involved in supporting such a leader as  Boris Yeltsin and at the same time preserve the existing capital  of relations and links? For the U.S. side it will apparently be  especially important to avoid a fundamental and at the same time  fairly probable mistake -- to take Russia's aspiration to  maintain its legitimate national interests for the consequence  of a sharp strengthening in the positions of Zhirinovskiy and  hard-line forces. Such a temptation in the United States and  the West as a whole today is extremely great. Yet there can be  no better aid to Zhirinovskiy and company than to deny Russia's  right to its own policy and its own national priorities.</p>

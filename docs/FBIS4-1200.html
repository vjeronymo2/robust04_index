			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J. Rees] </F>   [Text] Bloemfontein April 24 SAPA -- SA Defence Force  [SADF] troops have been sent to Viljoenskroon in the [Orange]  Free State to ensure rightwingers do not disrupt elections this  week, the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Sunday  [24 April]. This follows the erection by the  rightwing-controlled town council of watchtowers and roadblocks  at entrances to the northern Free State town.    Work on the "security measures" had been completed, though  the rightwingers have assured police they do not plan to disrupt  the historic poll, SA Police spokesman Adj Rudi van Zyl said.    All three access roads to the town now have two booms in  place, and two watchtowers have been erected at the entrance to  the Rammulotsi black township, which was reported Sunday to be  very tense. None of the installations were staffed on Sunday  night.    The rightwingers have said the security measures were simply  precautions in case white Viljoenskroon needs protection from  violence during or after the election.    The council was reported last week to have said the SADF was  responsible for the roadblocks and watchtowers, though police  sources on Sunday said this was a transparent attempt to  transfer responsibility for their actions.    Military commando members had approached the town council in  their private capacity and the town clerk and council had gone  ahead with the security installations, the source said.    Police said members of the town council had made themselves  unavailable for consultations on Sunday.</p>

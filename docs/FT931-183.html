			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: Bejart's 'Opera' - Dance Maurice Bejart is the least timorous of choreographers. No theme, no personality, is too considerable or too daunting to frighten him off, and no score, it seems, can give him pause. From Wagner to Diaghilev, from the French Revolution to the Hindu pantheon, from Beethoven 9 to Boulez' Marteau sans maitre, Bejart will take on any comer, two falls or one submission deciding the contest - and 'Bejart wins' ever the outcome. (The score or the subject always loses is the moral of the event). Now, in his second programme in the current Wells' season, Bejart takes on not just an artist or a great score, but a nation. Opera, if I am to believe what I saw on Monday night - and I wish I did not have to - is a kaleidoscope of cliches about Verdi's music, Italian life, Francis of Assisi, the Church of Rome, Pier Paolo Pasolini, plus a dear old 'Mama' who sits at the side of the stage and knits, prays (as well she might, considering the situation in which she finds herself) and a good deal of chatter. At one moment the cast call out 'Gloria', and a chap who is, I suspect, impersonating Christ, looks rather affronted at the nickname. Gems from Verdi are played, in stormy Callas performances, and Stanislas de Nussac wanders about the stage playing the saxophone. We hear part of a speech by Hitler. A girl, having danced indifferently, demands the head of John the Baptist, and is rewarded with this delicacy. (It looked as if she had been given the head of the choreographer). Opera is compounded of such inconsequentialities. Bejart's style of composition suggests nothing so much as a grass-hopper mind leaping from one free association to another, playing merry little intellectual jokes, being 'clever' at the expense of logic, structure, and most seriously, of choreographic value. The text of Opera ranges from the flimsy to the invisible, with posturing, Bejartian cliche and vulgarity as a kind of danced fritto misto. It says nothing about Italian opera, but a great deal about sensationalism as a substitute for art. The company performances are suitably bombastic and tiresome. The second part of the programme brought us Bejart's version of The Miraculous Mandarin. It is a cussed score which encourages vulgarity - Gyula Harangozo's staging for the Hungarian Ballet the only successful one of the six I have seen. Bejart sticks to the narrative, though he cannot resist dragging in Fritz Lang, and treats us to a brief appearance by Lang's Siegfried in fur kilt and puttees as a client-victim for the whore. The interest of the staging revolves round two interpretations: Koen Onzia as the whore, and Juichi Kobayashi as the Mandarin. Both are very fine. Showing the whore as a transvestite is an astute theatrical trick, and serves to re-invent the tedious imagery of tarts on stage. Mr Onzia, white faced, in a brief glittering frock, is at no moment a drag queen. His reading is virile, ambiguous, vicious yet curiously innocent - as if the boy were playing at being a woman to bring a greater zest to crime - and given a sharp nervous edge of erotic provocation. Mr Kobayashi, a Maoist figure in blue denim suit and cap replete with red star, wonderfully conveys the invincible strength of the Mandarin. His dancing is clear - there is a bold, sure technique here - and tireless physical resource as well as commanding presence. The ending of the piece is par for the Bejartian course: the whore dons a blond wig, then drops it at the Mandarin's feet. He gratifies his lust with it, and the piece suddenly becomes L'Apres-midi d'un Phoney. But Mr Onzia and Mr Kobayashi also make it fascinating and powerful. The Rudra Bejart Lausanne season continues at Sadler's Wells until April 3</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> The Fullerton Fire Department will ask the City Council Tuesday to ban the sale  and use of the so-called "safe and sane" fireworks, although most council  members say they would like to keep them legal. The fire chief asked the  council to consider the ban after he collected information showing that Orange  County cities that have banned fireworks have far fewer fireworks-related fires  than cities where the fireworks are allowed.  </P></p>

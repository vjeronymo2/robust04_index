			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / US industrial output up 0.5% US industrial production rose 0.5 per cent in March, slightly less than expected, but figures for previous months were revised higher, indicating solid economic growth in the first quarter. The rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing rose to 82.8 per cent  - close to the level historically associated with upward pressure on inflation. The Federal Reserve said output in several industries had picked up sharply after weather-related weakness in January and February. But the overall increase in output was held back by a drop in production of motor vehicles following a surge in preceding months. Vehicle output fell to an annual rate of 13m units last month against 13.9m in February, the highest level of output in any month since the 1970s. Industrial output was also depressed in March by a decline in electricity production after an unusually cold winter. Excluding vehicles, factory output rose 1 per cent in March following a 0.3 per cent gain in February and unchanged production in January. Overall industrial production rose 5.1 per cent in the year to March.</p>

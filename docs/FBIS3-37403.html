The president said, the newspaper notes, that he "favours  stronger economic cooperation with Russia" but denies the  existence of a territorial issue and that "the international  community will not recognise" stronger political ties between  the Crimea and Russia.    Kravchuk referred to the tripartite agreement on the  withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, which was signed by  him as well as by the Russian and U.S. presidents in Moscow.  Under this agreement, Washington assumed the role of a  guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability  of its borders.    Among outstanding issues between Ukraine and Russia,  Kravchuk  singled out a package of questions connected with the future of  the Black Sea Fleet. For instance, he is worried over how and  at what price to sell the Ukrainian part of the divided fleet to  Russia.    The president also expressed hope for a success of his  coming  U.S. visit on March 4 and his meeting with U.S. President Bill  Clinton. According to Kravchuk, this visit will "help change  the position of the international community on Ukraine which  will become a nuclear-free state".    The Ukrainian president expressed his expectations that the  United States will fulfill its obligations to boost financial  aid to Ukraine. "Its total sum will possibly amount to 600 or  700 million dollars," he said.</p>

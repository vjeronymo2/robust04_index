			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Vessels are making a big  contribution to the development of foreign trade in the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    Among them is a 15,000 ton cargo ship Hyoksin.    Twenty years have elapsed since the cargo ship Hyoksin set  sail in 1974.    Since then it has come to anchor in ports of different  countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and other regions.    It has carried essential goods to ports in 12 countries and  regions including Vietnam, China, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, India  and Indonesia in the period from late July 1993 to late March  1994.    Thus, it has made more than 120 navigations across the ocean  over the past 20 years, transporting several million tons of  cargo to nearly 300 ports of more than 30 countries.    The ship has fulfilled its annual plan at more than 112  percent, thus contributing to the development of foreign trade  of the DPRK.    The captain of the ship became a labour hero.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il highly appreciated the  success made by the ship in the past and sent thanks to its crew  in October last year.</p>

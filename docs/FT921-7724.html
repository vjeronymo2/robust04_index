			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Ceasefire urged in Nagorno-Karabakh THE foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan called on Thursday for a ceasefire in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, where four years of fighting have claimed more than 1,000 lives, Reuter reports from Moscow. The ministers said they would recommend a ceasefire to their presidents and parliaments and urge steps to unblock roads, restore communications and allow the urgent dispatch of humanitarian aid. The move came as British officials said that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) was likely to make its first foray into international mediation by offering to host talks on the war in Nagorno-Karabakh. A CSCE team which returned yesterday from the disputed territory was expected to urge talks among all interested parties under the auspices of the CSCE's Czechoslovak presidency. If yesterday's accord in Moscow leads to a meaningful ceasefire CSCE intervention may prove unnecessary. Mr Raffi Hovannisyan, foreign minister of Armenia, and Mr Hussain Sadikhov, his Azeri counterpart, both called the accord a first small step towards ending what Russian television this week called the first war of the post-Soviet era. They were speaking after eight hours of talks chaired by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. 'All participants of today's meeting were unanimous that when there is war, when the guns are roaring, negotiations cannot succeed,' Mr Sadikhov said. 'Therefore this recommendation was worked out to implement a ceasefire in the zone of the Azeri-Armenian conflict. 'We do hope that in the near future we will see an end to the conflict, a ceasefire, a lifting of blockades and respect for human and civil rights,' Mr Hovannisyan said. The Armenian said he favoured the despatch of UN or Commonwealth peace-keepers. Itar-Tass news agency said Russian President Boris Yeltsin was holding separate talks with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan in the Kremlin. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, then Soviet president, sent Soviet interior ministry troops four years ago to restore order in Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave ruled by Azerbaijan since 1923 but populated mostly by ethnic Armenians. The fighting has raged on despite mediation attempts by both Mr Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin, worsening sharply after the Soviet troops pulled out late last year. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, military commander of the new Commonwealth of Independent States, this week proposed sending troops back in.</p>

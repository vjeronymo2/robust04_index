			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin hopes that the Syrians  will understand that if one seeks to promote the peace  negotiations, there is almost no recourse but to open direct  talks with Israeli leaders. However, as long as they continued  to refuse to do so, Israel must use the good services of the  United States.    The prime minister added he hoped that the secretary of  state  would visit the region in the middle of July. We must be  convinced that we have done absolutely all we could to make  progress and exhaust every opportunity to make peace with Syria,  Yitzhaq Rabin said, noting however that such efforts should not  be made under any conditions nor at any price. The prime  minister was speaking at a ceremony at the president's residence.    Reacting to the criticism that was leveled against the  statements he made yesterday regarding an Israeli withdrawal  from the Golan Heights, the prime minister asserted that those  who failed to keep even one thousandth of the Sinai Peninsula in  exchange for peace had no right to put on an angry face and  brazenly state that one could achieve peace in exchange for  peace. That was total nonsense, Rabin said.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 23 June in a  similar report adds that "Israel was to a large extent  responsible whether the Middle East would move in the direction  of peace and calm or toward violence and war. As for the  proposals delivered to the Syrians, Rabin said that they  pertained to the bilateral nature of the relations between the  two countries. In the meantime, however, the gap between the  parties' positions remained the same."]    Foreign Minister Peres said that if the Syrians open the  negotiations to meetings at higher levels and on additional  tracks, then significant progress could be made. The foreign  minister was speaking at a meeting with EU ambassadors in  Israel. As for the agreement with the Palestinians, Peres said  that its implementation was going smoothly and the Palestinians  were organizing themselves in the field from all aspects. The  foreign minister noted that Israel was preparing itself for the  implementation of the second stage of the agreements.</p>

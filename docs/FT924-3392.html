			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel deems concert party at Buckingham THE TAKEOVER Panel has deemed that members of the Jivraj family are acting in concert in shares of Buckingham International, hotels and nursing homes group. The concert party consists of Jemma Trust Company and Naaz Limited, a company owned by a trust of which Mr Nurdin Jivraj, Buckingham deputy chairman, and Mr Nick Jivraj, his son and chief executive, and their families are beneficiaries. A close relative of theirs is beneficiary of a trust run by Jemma. Naaz owns 29.96 per cent of Buckingham. The Panel said Jemma bought between September 15 and 24 at up to 2 3/4 p per share some 10.4m ordinary Buckingham shares, or about 8.6 per cent of its share capital. Together the two holdings exceed 30 per cent at which level a takeover offer becomes mandatory. Buckingham said that Naaz and Jemma were in discussions with the Panel. The party could appeal against the ruling; offer 2 3/4 p per share for the outstanding stock and bid for the secured convertible redeemable loan stock; or sell sufficient shares to reduce its combined holding below 30 per cent.</p>

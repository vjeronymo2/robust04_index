			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN OF ROCK BANDS AT BALLROOM  </P> <P> More than 30 neighbors of the Fenders International Grand Ballroom complained  to the Long Beach City Council this week of noisy bands and rowdy patrons,  prompting the council to raise the possibility of revoking the ballroom's  business licenses.  </P> <P> The club, which hosts rock groups, is next door to the Lafayette condominium  building, where residents say they are also plagued by clientele of catering  rooms and a bar under the same ownership as the ballroom.  </P> <P> "These people have no respect for the building, they have no respect for the  neighborhood," said Scott Hunt of Lafayette Concerned Residents.  </P> <P> In response, the council directed the city staff to investigate whether the  city should declare the club, at 521 E. 1st St., a public nuisance or place  some restrictions on its operation. The staff will report back to the council  in several weeks.  </P></p>

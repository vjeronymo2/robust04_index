			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vyacheslav Yelagin: "Metamorphoses in </F> European Policy"]    [Excerpts] After the Russian defense minister's visit to  Brussels it became absolutely clear that Russia is going to join  the Partnership for Peace program. In Pavel Grachev's words,  this position was confirmed to him by Boris Yeltsin on the eve  of the trip to NATO headquarters. NATO's leading circles  breathed a sigh of relief, not least because Russia does not  intend to put forward any prior conditions about the program.  What is left now is to wait for the signing of the framework  agreement, then, apparently, the presentation document will be  elaborated and after that, possibly, will come the adoption of  the Statement of Intent enshrining the desire of Russia and NATO  to conclude a large-scale agreement on strategic partnership  outside the framework of the program.    In that case the question of Russia's special role, as the  West is signaling, will apparently not meet with any objections.  I would like to hope that this viewpoint will be adhered to in  those countries which have been reacting extremely sensitively  to the problem of Russia's mutual relations with the North  Atlantic Alliance. After all, Russia has every justification  for such a role. In the first place it is a major European  country with a mighty economic potential. Second, Russia is a  nuclear power which moreover is not pursuing narrow, selfish  aims with regard to its neighbors near and far. Consequently,  Russia and the North Atlantic bloc simply cannot but cooperate  closely in the discussion of topical European problems. That  factor is increasingly beginning to be understood by  sober-minded Western politicians. Many of them realize that  Russia, despite the difficulties it is experiencing, remains a  most important factor of regional security on the continent.    That was confirmed by the speech by Czech Defense Minister  A.  Baudys at an international seminar in Prague entitled "Security  in Central Europe -- Public Opinion." The speech expressed the  idea of the need to take into account Russia's balancing role in  Europe. Well, such an understanding deserves attention.    Unfortunately, by no means all politicians obey commonsense  logic. At the same conference in Prague Czech Deputy Foreign  Minister P. Bratinka, apparently in pique at his defense  minister, spoke again about Russia's attempts to restore its  "sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe" which, in  his words, should be resisted by a firm NATO and EU policy  toward Russia. In short, what we see here are diametrically  opposed approaches by two leading figures in the Czech Republic,  and furthermore, members of the executive structures. [passage  omitted]    Varying assessments of Russia's policy are characteristic of  other international meetings recently. That was clearly shown  by the North Atlantic Assembly session in Oslo. For example,  the representatives of the West European states and the United  States finally expressed understanding for Russia's  participation in peacemaking operations on the territory of the  CIS countries. Meanwhile, their colleagues from Estonia and  Latvia, who even there distinguished themselves by their attacks  on Russia, still called such participation "neoimperialism."    New extremes have appeared in our as yet unbuilt common  European home. It is primarily in Central and Eastern Europe  that they are causing apprehension. This is the fear that the  small countries might again become a target in a "geopolitical  game" among the great and large powers. Is that not the reason  for the extremely nervous reaction to the activation of  Russo-German ties? The revived dialogue between Moscow and Bonn  was yet again the reason that some familiar expressions from the  times of bloc confrontation have begun to appear in the  vocabulary of certain politicians.    Only one piece of advice can be given to such "strategists":  Do not inflame unnecessary passions. Moscow is not weaving any  intrigues or hatching any treacherous schemes against other  countries. It would like to be integrated into Europe as an  equal partner. But such integration presupposes a consideration  of Russia's interests, too, for example, access for Russian  experts to work on the new "COCOM" and the renunciation of all  forms of pressure regarding Russia's export of arms to third  countries. Then, you see, that would also remove some of  Moscow's "imperial ambitions" which various foreign politicians  and the mass media are so fond of expatiating about today.</p>

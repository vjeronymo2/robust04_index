			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Samuel Blixen] </F>   [Text] The persistent and constant pressure exerted by the  U.S. Federal Reserve on banks to discourage money laundering  have resulted in the surfacing of substitute mechanisms to  bypass control measures.    In our country's case, the State Department's repeated  charges that our banking system has inherited the role played by  Panama changed the mind of the banking authorities who refused  to implement control mechanisms and lift bank secrecy. Thus,  money-laundering operations through bank branches dropped  noticeably (the latest cases made public involved the Santander  and Lloyd's banks, linked to the Yomagate scandal [involving  Argentine President Carlos Menem's sister-in-law]). The bank  branches were replaced by some money exchanges on which U.S.  organizations in charge of repressing illegal financial  transactions focused their attention.    Money exchanges also were forced to operate more "openly"  when the Central Bank of Uruguay extended some of the control  mechanisms to this field. Once in a while the money exchanges  appeared involved in money laundering, as in the recent case  involving the Indumex [expansion unknown] money exchange, used  to launder capital amassed in Brazil through a colossal  corruption and influence peddling scheme.    However, the operators of ill-gotten money have had to find  new discreet methods to launder their money in view of the risks  they run due to the control measures implemented by DEA agents,  the IRS (the office in charge of fighting tax evasion), and U.S.  Customs. The freedom to carry out financial transactions in our  country, in this sense, offers a new and flourishing mechanism:  the surfacing of corporations engaged in intermediary  activities.    Leaders of the banking union have just charged CADISA,  Investment Management Company, Inc., one of the most important  of these corporations in Uruguay, with money laundering.  CADISA's trade is better known as Citicorp's "Citicarteras"  [investments portfolio]. Citicorp, in turn, is the international  corporation of the Uruguayan government's main creditor bank:  Citibank.    If one believes banking sources, one could presume that  Citibank, through Citicorp, has managed to complete the circle.  CADISA's operations are considered a typical financial  intermediary. It attracts savings that, in turn, are invested  in banks operating in Uruguay with clauses in the contracts  noting that all risks are run exclusively by the client.    This allows CADISA to carry out risky operations, depositing  the money in saving accounts or buying "money baskets" in those  banks that offer the best interest rates for investments.  Citicarteras, preferably, operates with government-intervened  private banks and the public banking sector, especially the  Mortgage Bank.    It is estimated that Citicorp, during the 18 months it has  been operating through CADISA, has accumulated $100 million  worldwide. Many of its clients do not reside in Uruguay.    Citicarteras offers a high return in exchange for a  commission. In addition to the rates -- which are an incentive  despite the risk it represents -- there is another benefit: the  full concealment of the operation because CADISA, not the  client, deposits the money in the bank. In other words, the  client enjoys complete secrecy, something that not even the  banks enjoy. This is feasible because since CADISA is a  corporation, although it carries out typical intermediary  financial operations, it is not subject to Central Bank control  measures.    This abnormal situation reported by the AEBU [Association of  Uruguayan Bank Employees] still has not prompted a declaration  by the Central Bank management. The subject was discussed  recently but the Central Bank postponed any decision on the  subject. Central Bank President Enrique Braga, through his  public relations manager, declined to make any comments on the  issue.    Union sources told BRECHA that the facilities Citicorp  enjoys  allow money laundering. Citicorp carries out similar activities  in Argentina, where the National Securities Commission has  sanctioned the holding [preceding world in English] "due to its  dubious operations" and "irregularities in its activities."  Citicorp in Argentina during the past two years has focused on  the purchase of public enterprises earmarked for privatization  and owns 28 percent of Cointel [expansion unknown] shares and 33  percent of the Zapla Iron and Steel Industry in partnership with  the Spanish Telephone Company and Techint [expansion unknown].    The consulted sources asserted that CADISA's operations in  Uruguay favor the strategy of Citibank, which currently has a  dispute with the AEBU because it refuses to acknowledge the  enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement valid for the  entire industry. Citibank, on one hand, is trying to weaken the  union and, on the other, to become the leader of the banks that  belong to the Association of Banking Enterprises, which it left  a few months ago.    CADISA operations are regarded as "unfair competition" by  Citibank regarding the rest of the banking institutions.  Citibank channels its financial intermediary activities through  CADISA, which has significantly reduced costs. The case is  quite unique: Citicarteras has no employees; its agents appear  as a one-man enterprise. Nor do they collect salaries because  they earn commissions and percentages that eliminate, among  other things, the payment of contributions to the BPS [Social  Security Bank].    Labor union sources stated, however, that Citicarteras'  financial intermediary operations imply a risk not mentioned in  its advertisements: The corporation is not covered by bank  secrecy and any judge, as well as the General Directorate of  Taxation, can intervene the bank accounts. That is, as long as  there is a desire to control what seems a profitable and almost  perfect mechanism for money laundering.</p>

They will be the first Australians to participate  actively in the United Nations' Mozambique peacekeeping mission,  which is preparing the way for national elections later this  year.    Mozambique suffered a protracted and devastating civil war  which ended in 1992 when the government signed a peace agreement  with right-wing rebels.    The spokesman said some of the 16 policemen bound for  Mozambique had gained experience of peacekeeping police work  with the police contingent to Cambodia in 1992-93. He said the  Australians would be monitoring the ceasefire and supplementing  local police in the lead up to the election.</p>

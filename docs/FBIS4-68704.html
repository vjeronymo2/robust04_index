There are 30 registered joint ventures, which in  1994 may extract 9 million tonnes of oil (that is, increase  extraction by three times over the last 2 years).    [End boxed material 1]    [Begin boxed material 2]  <H8>  The most attractive sectors for foreign investments (based </H8> on appraisals of participants in the seminar, "German  Investments in Russia")    --The food industry. The volume of Russian import  of delicatessen food products shows that there is a solvent  demand, and Russian tariff policy makes the development of  domestic production effective.    --Oil and gas extraction. Needs no comment.    --Building materials industry. A boom in the  construction of cottages is being observed in Russia.    [End boxed material 2]    Representatives of firms which participated in the  seminar, "German Investments in Russia," held yesterday in the  FRG [Federative Republic of Germany] embassy, had the  opportunity to see with their own ideas the different  interpretations of Russian legislation on the part of  presidential and government structures. Yevgeniy Yasin (the head  of the analytical center under the president's administration)  and Igor Noskov (the chief of the Minfin [Ministry of Finance]  Department of International Tax Relations) have opposite  interpretations of the benefits presented in the presidential  edict, "On Improving Work With Foreign Investments."    The seminar which was held was interesting primarily because  of its organizers. From the German side this was the Moscow  Representation of German Economics--the first step on the road  to opening a German chamber of commerce and industry in Moscow  (an American chamber of commerce and industry already exists in  Moscow). From the Russian side it was the Expert Institute of  the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Its  director, Yevgeniy Yasin, was recently named to head up the  analytical center under the president's administration. So that  German businessmen had reason to expect from the organizers of  the seminar not only appraisals of the development of the  economic situation in Russia, but also support of their  interests.    Yevgeniy Yasin characterized Russia's economic position as  "naturally-critical, but not catastrophic." The decline in  production in 1994 comprised 23 percent in January, 24 percent  in February and 27 percent in March. According to Mr. Yasin's  evaluation, this is an overproduction crisis, the solution to  which is structural reorganization. A typical example is that of  the textile industry, which Yasin's institute studied. There is  a natural differentiation taking place in this industry: Leaders  are emerging (15-16 percent of the 170 enterprises studied) as  well as outsiders (24 percent), whose only prospects  are--bankruptcy. The tactics of the leaders in 1993 amounted to  sales priorities, including export, as well as the total absence  of capital investments. In 1994, Yasin believes, these tactics  must be supplemented by investment activity. The function of the  government is reduced to holding down inflation and supporting  private investments. Investment potential has been accumulated  in foreign and domestic trade and at the commercial banks. Hopes  are riding on the financial consortium of non-state banks and  investment companies which is being created, and which will emit  state-guaranteed securities and finance projects selected by the  consortium itself from among those prepared by Minekonomika.  This is not the only project. Thus, commercial banks are  prepared to finance an investment project in the sum of $200  million for production of the Il-96-m. Mr. Yasin's general  conclusion was that the situation on the money market (inflation  being held down and the positive value of bank interest) make  realistic a turn toward stepping up investment activity, without  which Russian industry "will not survive."    After such an announcement, the seminar participants turned  to the problems of specifically foreign investments. Their  attention, not surprisingly, was concentrated on taxes. The  application of the VAT [value-added tax] (20 percent) and the  special tax (3 percent) to import equipment was characterized as  a "tax on investments." The 38 percent tax on "surplus wages"  (including that of foreign citizens) was called a "fine."  Explanations were presented by Igor Noskov, head of the Minfin  Department of International Tax Relations. And it was he who  gave the seminar participants their main surprise. Mr. Noskov  said that, from the standpoint of Minfin, the 3-year immunity of  foreign investments from statutes of the Russian authorities  (except for federal laws and presidential edicts) which may  inflict material loss upon them, which was introduced by the 27  September 1993 presidential edict, "On Improving Work With  Foreign Investments," does not apply to taxes. The justification  for this is that all changes in taxes must be ratified by  parliament. The comment of the German entrepreneurs to the  effect that the 38 percent tax also did not get the approval of  the Federal Assembly clarified the Minfin position: "To let  everyone in and not to let anyone out." Igor Noskov's  announcement met with sharp reproach from Yevgeniy Yasin, who  announced to the satisfaction of the participants that Minfin  must carry out the presidential edicts. Moreover, the  stipulation of immunity must be secured and expanded (it is  presumed that the term of the moratorium will be increased from  3 to 5-7 years) in the changes which are being introduced into  the law on foreign investments.</p>

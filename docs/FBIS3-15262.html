			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS dipolomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey, </F> Nikolay Manvelov, and Dmitriy Chubarov]    [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar -- Russia is entitled to station as  many troops in Kaliningrad Oblast as it needs to maintain  security and stability, and, it goes without saying, as allowed  by international commitments. This was stated by Mikhail  Demurin, deputy director of the Information and Press Department  of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing he gave today.    During his visit to Latvia on 23 and 24 February this year,  the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said, President Lech  Walesa of Poland expressed concern at the allegedly excessive  concentration of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast. He also  called for: The removal of this tumor, which, in his view,  posed a potential threat to security in the region. Such  statements do not contribute to stability in the Baltic region  and are clearly not in keeping with the spirit of recent  Russian-Polish accords, including ones reached at summit level,  Demurin stressed.</p>

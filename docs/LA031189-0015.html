			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN L.A. SCHOOLS  </P> <P> As a bilingual classroom teacher I feel the need to address the issues raised  in this article. The workload alone involved in teaching in a bilingual  classroom merits higher pay; in addition, bilingual teachers must be proficient  in two languages and have an understanding of the different backgrounds of the  linguistic minority children they teach.  </P> <P> Too many teachers who embrace "English-only" don't know the first thing about  language acquisition or ESL teaching techniques. They are ill-equipped to teach  language minority children even if California adopted English immersion rather  than bilingual education.  </P> <P> It's time that we in California face the fact that changing demographics  require that teachers meet the needs of non-English-speaking children. Isn't  this, after all, the primary reason for being a teacher?  </P> <P> ANNA KAMMER  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

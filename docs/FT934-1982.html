			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Unionists split on response to accord The Major-Reynolds agree-ment left Northern Ireland's non-violent political parties deeply divided. It was dismissed as a 'betrayal' by the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party, which accused Mr Major of 'appeasing the fiendish republican scum'. The government will be encouraged by the more moderate response of Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party. The agreement was welcomed by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist SDLP, as 'the first step on a road that will remove the bullet and the bomb forever from our small island'. Mr Paisley told the Commons that it was 'offensive' that the IRA would be allowed to join talks on the province's future three months after ending its campaign of violence. Mr Paisley was vigorously supported by Mr Peter Robinson, his deputy, but there was little backing from other parties. Mr Major was cheered as he told Mr Paisley the government had a duty to promote talks to end the bloodshed. Mr Molyneaux, who was cheered by Conservative MPs as he rose to speak, demanded reassurance from the government about the impact of the 'tortuous document' on relations between Northern Ireland and the republic. While he made no direct criticism of the declaration in the Commons chamber, he said later that there were parts of it the UUP did not accept. 'We have not put our thumbprints or signatures to the document,' he said. 'There are parts of that document clearly written by Dublin hands and those are unacceptable to us. But we have managed to set aside those considerations for the time being to see what the effect of that bait dangled by Dublin will have on the IRA.' Mr Molyneaux said he shared hopes that it would lead to peace 'but knowing the track record of the IRA, I have my doubts about it'. He added: 'The IRA cannot pick and choose any more than we can . . . they have got to either take it or leave it.' Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, warned: 'If we are suspending judgment today on this statement it is in the hope that it will lead to a way out of the cul-de-sac that the people of Ulster have been condemned to for the last eight years.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaunius Pocius: "The Military Demands"] </F>   [Text] Captains J. Marcinkus and A. Arlauskas, commanders  of Lithuania's only two air bases situated in Meskuiciai,  Siauliai region, and Pajuoste, Panevezys region, voiced their  distrust in the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee  [NSK] and its chairman, V. Petkevicius.    A statement sent to the president, the Seimas, and the  government reads: "The NSK has changed from a controlling body  into a dictatorial one. It is obvious that Chairman V.  Petkevicius and the group which leads the committee have thus  far failed to realize the functions that the NSK must perform."    The commanders claim that "the NSK leadership is exerting  particularly powerful pressure on the Air Force. (...) The  statement that the few current training fighters are sufficient  to meet the needs of military aviation can be seen as inflicting  damage to the prestige of the Air Force. The need to control  our airspace and state borders is fully ignored. Regardless of  state security interests, the Zokniai (Siauliai) airport, which  lies in a perfect strategic location suitable for military  aviation, was transferred to commercial interests. Its  reinforced concrete hangars are used to store groceries, while  military aircraft are standing under the open sky."    Asked to comment on this statement, A. Arlauskas, commander  of the second air base, said that the NSK seems to be  deliberately destroying the national defense system. However,  everything is done to remove the guilt.    According to A. Arlauskas, V. Petkevicius, who recently  visited the airports in Panevezys and Siauliai along with the  president and the national defense minister, demonstrated his  complete ignorance when he asked in everyone's presence: "From  whom must we defend our airspace?"    Pilots were indignant over the behavior of the NSK chairman  during his visit to Siauliai -- the latter allowed himself to  degrade the commander of the first air base and the pilots by  calling them "blue suckers." Captain J. Marcinkus sent a report  to the president in connection with this.    Captain A. Arlauskas said that the majority of servicemen at  the second air base are skilled aeronautical engineers.  However, the latter are employed as guards, because the staff  has not yet been confirmed. He claimed that there will soon  come a time when there will be no one to manage the airport.</p>

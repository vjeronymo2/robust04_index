			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GANG SETUP SUSPECTED IN SHOOTINGS  </P> <P> One North Hollywood teen-ager was killed and a second critically wounded early  Sunday in a shooting police described as an apparent setup by rival gang  members, who tricked the victims into believing they belonged to a friendly  gang.  </P> <P> Daniel Joseph Solis, 19, was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting from  multiple bullet wounds to the chest, Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Vojtecky  said.  </P> <P> Sayeed Fayad, also 19, was taken to an area hospital, where he was listed in  critical but stable condition, Vojtecky said. He refused to identify the  medical facility out of concern that the attackers might try to hunt Fayad  down.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about 3:30 a.m. in an alley behind the 13100 block of  Victory Boulevard, where the victims and about six other members of their gang  were loitering, Vojtecky said. The alley is known as a gathering spot for gang  members, he said.  </P> <P> Three youths drove up and began exchanging words and phrases with the victims'  group in an apparent attempt to confuse them into thinking the newcomers were  members of an allied gang, Vojtecky said.  </P> <P> The exchange of friendly passwords "put them all at ease" and the victims  approached the car to talk, Vojtecky said. Suddenly, according to witnesses,  the driver produced a handgun and without provocation opened fire on the group,  he said.  </P> <P> As the three assailants drove away, one yelled out the name of a rival gang,  Vojtecky said.  </P> <P> "It sounds like a setup," he said.  </P> <P> Vojtecky said police have no suspects but are trying to talk to members of the  gang whose name was shouted from the car. He refused to identify the groups in  question, saying it was Police Department policy not to give gangs publicity.  </P></p>

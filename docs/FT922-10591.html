			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (4): The great London exodus is faltering - Plunging property costs are dazzling the most determined movers MORE than 35 companies left London last year, carrying off almost 14,000 jobs, but the trend appears to be slowing down. This indication will came as a welcome relief to the beleaguered property industry. Already swamped by empty offices, it can ill afford to see extra space vacated. But more pain is inevitable, as another 25 moves are scheduled this year and a further in 1993, according to the authoritative annual study on office decentralisation by Jones Lang Wootton Consulting &amp; Research. That will put almost 2m sq ft of space on the market - more than 1 per cent of the total stock. What central London loses on the swings, others hope to gain on the roundabouts. Markheath, the property developer, appeared cock-a-hoop after finding that another 145 of the capital's top companies aimed to move over the next three years. But then it has its 600,000 sq ft King's Park development in central Stevenage to promote, despite the fact that JLW says businesses are increasingly looking outside the South-east. One might wonder, however, why anyone is moving nowadays. Occupation costs have always been cited as the main reason why companies tear up roots. It remains the central force behind more than 60 per cent of current moves investigated by JLW. Yet property prices have collapsed in the last couple of years. Central area prime rents are around half the 70 peak touched during the boom and landlords are clamouring to unload second-hand space for much lower figures as 20 per cent of offices stand empty. Sedgwick Group, for instance, is offering its 165,000 sq ft headquarters in Aldgate High Street on the eastern City fringe for 15 a sq ft, fixed for 10 years. Others are asking a nominal rent just to escape the burden of uniform business rate and to keep out squatters. So why are companies still leaving? The main reason is that current moves were planned two or three years ago when vacancy rates averaged only five per cent and rents were increasing by as much as 30 per cent a year. In 1987, London was four times as expensive as Birmingham and five times more than Bristol, Birmingham and Manchester. 'It was not difficult for companies to decide the time was right to leave,' Mr Michael Strong of Richard Ellis told a recent Financial Times seminar. By the end of last year the picture was very different. Discounting wage variations, the cost of keeping a worker in London averaged Pounds 9,000 compared with Pounds 3,000 in Bristol and Pounds 4,000 in the other centres. On the face of it, that still justified relocation - but for one important fact: the housing slump. The CBI calculated in 1990 that relocation costs average at Pounds 12,000 per worker. That does not, however, take account of bridging finance required where a member of staff cannot sell their home - pretty much the norm nowadays. Borrowing Pounds 100,000 for up to a year can double moving costs, says Mr Strong. Compensation for any price shortfall in the worker's house adds even more to the bill. 'It is not uncommon for the cost of relocating an employee to be as much as Pounds 40,000 - or even more when moving to a higher cost area,' he said. That means a job moved to Bristol could cost between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 40,000 for the sake of saving no more than Pounds 6,000 a year. Some movers, of course, are happy to shed staff and pick up local people to fill their new office, so the economics vary widely. Most, however, aim to maintain a core of executives - who incidentally will be the most expensive to move because they live in more expensive homes. Personnel considerations are becoming more important than mere bricks and mortar, according to Rob Harris, research director of Stanhope Properties. Most long-distance movers are more concerned with saving staff than cutting rents. Only within the M25 do they seem to concentrate on cost-saving. Debenham Tewson Research points out that 'prime factors driving firms to relocate remain those of expansion and operational efficiency rather than the need to cut costs,' while Markheath's investigations found that close to a third of London's intended movers were spurred by inadequate premises. Another 15 per cent were escaping the impact of congestion on staff morale. This all serves to blur the seemingly clear-cut relationship between occupation costs and relocation. It also contradicts an equal amount of research showing that costs are the main spur to moves. The explanation may be that rising bills are only noticed when buildings and their surroundings pass a threshold of discomfort and inefficiency. Even when rents are falling and space is plentiful, companies might decide the old place is still poor value. Add to this the poor quality of life in central London and a new home appears enticing, no matter what the comparative figures say. This makes predictions of the impact on property markets difficult and dangerous. Mr Strong believes private sector moves will slow to a trickle and government moves slow over the next few years. This introduces a new and even more unpredictable factor - politics. Civil servants are front runners by a mile in the latest surge of decentralisation because of a government committed to shifting staff out of the south-east. This was planned to take advantage of lower provincial wages and boost the regions at far less expense than development grants. Big moves are still under way. The Inland Revenue, for instance, is decamping to the East Midlands and the Department of Health is off to Leeds. But that has not stopped the latter from snapping up Ake Larson's 200,000 sq ft development on London Road, SE1 - reputedly for well under 15 a sq ft. The Defence Ministry has also cancelled relocation of 1,600 jobs to Cleveland, deciding instead on a broad distribution across southern England. On the other hand, Michael Heseltine is ready to flex his muscular views on regional development at the Department of Trade, so costs may not enter the equation. Much of this hypothesising depends on companies acting logically, however - a rare commodity when most still refuse to take buildings seriously until a crisis looms. 'The head of property can be six layers or more down from the chief executive,' says Stanhope, drawing on research commissioned from Hillier Parker and PMA. When relocations do take place, most decisions are rushed - and often botched - because no-one has clearly thought out what they want. Only a minority even carry out proper investigations about whether to move. Then they give too much weight to initial rents, rather than considering factors such as fitting out and long-term operating costs of new premises. For this reason alone, the relocation tide may ebb over the next few years, as London's plunging costs dazzle the most determined movers. Whether they choose the right buildings is another matter - but at least some developers will look a little happier than of late.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 92: The polls are still worth watching - Ballot Box The opinion polls during the last weekend of the campaign seem broadly to be pointing in the same direction: a narrow Labour lead over the Tories, but not sufficient for an overall majority, and therefore the probability of a hung parliament. There are more polls to come, however, and the general lesson of the last few decades has been to poll often and to poll late if you want to get it right. Even then, there can be pitfalls. In the general election of 1945, which required the sort of swing needed today to give Labour outright victory, there was a spectacular polling success. The Gallup poll predicted that Labour would win 47 per cent of the vote and the Tories 41. But since polls were a new phenomenon in those days and Gallup was the sole practitioner, hardly anyone took any notice. If they had, the Tories might have campaigned differently. The actual result was Labour winning 48 per cent and the Tories 40 per cent. The next big milestone in British polling history was in 1970, when ORC achieved the dream result of being the only polling organisation to get the outcome almost right. It did so by re-interviewing some of its earlier respondents at the last minute and correcting the forecasts for differential turn-out. In a survey of 257 respondents, ORC found that only one had switched from Tory to Labour while 14 had gone from Labour to Tory. It thus discovered the 'late swing'. Even then, it underestimated Ted Heath's Tory victory by two percentage points. The ORC experience did not mean that all the polls were more accurate ever after. In the election of October 1974, all of them overstated the margin of Labour's victory, which in the end was an overall majority of only three. One other point to note: in the seven general elections between 1964 and 1983, the party that was ahead in the final polls did less well on the night than had been predicted in the polls. In 1987, in spite of some blips in the polls, the Tories sailed home. So keep watching the findings until the end. There is still room for changes - and surprises.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Allies set for air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia ALL THE military arrangements for allied air strikes against the Serbs in Bosnia, including air control, were now in place and being tested, the United Nations said yesterday. But as Nato military planners met in Belgium to finalise a list of possible targets, the allies were still divided about just what action by the Serbs would trigger air strikes - or what action would be needed to avert them. Under the terms of the military agreement approved by the Nato council on Monday air strikes can only begin if they have been specifically requested by Nato or the United Nations and been approved by both Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Nato's commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe, and General Jean Cot, commander of UN troops in Bosnia. In addition, the Serbs must be given a clear warning - a state of affairs that will rule out any 'surprise' attacks. Nato planners have outlined a series of several different military options for action. The type of operations that are understood to have been under consideration include: the bombing of artillery positions around Sarajevo and other areas; attacks on supply routes from Serbia to the Bosnian Serbs; attacks on Serb command and control positions and possibly on the Serbian stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo. Earlier US calls for broader action against targets outside Bosnia have been knocked off the agenda by fierce allied opposition. Nato aircraft in the Adriatic yesterday stepped up their training exercises across Bosnia, collecting photographic material for air strike planning. However, military experts say that, initially, strikes around Sarajevo are the most likely course of action. Dr Jonathan Eyal, of the Royal United Services Institute, said: 'If the Canadians and others have signed up, it is unlikely they have agreed to anything more than bombing around Sarajevo, given that their troops are in Srebrenica.' The Nato political council is now meeting almost daily to review the situation in Bosnia - the first step, officials say, in assessing whether air strikes would be necessary. But although Monday's statement set out conditions for air strikes - including attacks on troops under UN command, continued disruption of water and humanitarian supplies to Sarajevo, and rather more controversially, the 'strangulation' of other safe areas - so far Nato has not published any clear list of 'triggers' or 'ultimatums' for action. Nato officials claim this is because they do not want to play 'cat and mouse' with the Serbs. 'We have seen that the Serbs are very good at running around ultimatums. We don't want to play into their hands,' one said. However, amid widespread suspicions that the European allies lack the political will to press ahead with strikes, the lack of clarity about the triggers would also seem to be concealing divisions within Nato about the readiness to take military action and uncertainty about their longer term objectives for the area - a situation that left some officials in Brussels hopefully suggesting that the apparent deal made in Sarajevo yesterday between military commanders might stave off the need for a decision. French and British diplomatic sources yesterday indicated they considered attacks on UN troops the most likely reason for air strikes. They pointed out that in spite of the political significance Mount Igman had assumed, a Serb presence on the mountain would not in itself probably be reason for action, since the mountain did not have a specific humanitarian significance. However, the US State Department said last night that continued occupation of the mountain would be 'a very materially relevant' criterion for triggering air strikes. 'Occupation of those mountains (Igman and Bjelasnica) is a critical element of the Serbs' ability to strangle Sarajevo,' a spokesman said. The strangulation of the city was one of the criteria that would trigger a Nato response. He added that the US considered the formal warning, called for in the Nato document about air strikes, had already been issued to the Serbs. Nevertheless, according to Mr Marshall Harris, one of three former US officials who have resigned in Washington in the past week in protest at the US position on Bosnia, there are now deep divisions within the American military over the issue. Defence Department officials have estimated that they can take out 70 per cent of the Serbian artillery within a day by using air strikes, Mr Harris said.</p>

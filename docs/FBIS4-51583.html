			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ralhanah Abdullah] </F>   [Text] Melaka, 30 March--The Malaysian Army will establish  an elite force to be known as Gerak Cepat Khas 10 Briged Para  [10th Special Rapid Deployment Parachutist Brigade] to provide a  special defense force for use whenever the country faces a  critical situation.    Gen. Ismail Omar, commander of the Malaysian Army, said that  this force will consist of personnel from the 8th Royal Ranger  Regiment (Parachutist), the 9th Royal Malay Regiment, and the  17th Royal Malay Regiment. Gen. Ismail said that their training  program is now under way, and it is hoped that this force can be  formally established by next Army Day, 16 September 1994. He is  aware that many problems will be faced by members of this force,  such as the need to become accustomed to parachute jumping.  However, he hopes that they will be patient and zealous in  carrying out their training.    This force needs to be formed now because a number of other  countries have already established such a force in an effort to  improve their defensive resources even further. According to  Gen. Ismail, it is only proper for Malaysia to establish such a  force also to deal with crisis situations. He said this after  reviewing the equipment of this force and the activities of its  personnel at Terendak Camp, Masjid Tanah, in Melaka on 30 March.    According to Gen. Ismail, when this force is formally  organized, consideration will be given to sending its members to  serve with the United Nations.    Furthermore, he reminded Army personnel in this country  always to be alert when on the highways, particularly when they  are riding motorcycles. A total of 846 traffic accidents have  occurred throughout the country involving members of the armed  forces, 10 percent of which have involved fatalities. He said:  "I think accidents involving members of the Army are expensive  because training newly enlisted personnel takes a long time."    He also said that in 1994 2,000 housing units will be  provided to Army personnel. This total will be increased to  satisfy a need for 28,000 housing units. In the State of Melaka  alone 1,200 housing units will be built in 1994.</p>

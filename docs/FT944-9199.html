			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots in Pounds 500m buy-back The market spotlight fell on Boots after the consumer products retailer surprised the market, early in the day, with a Pounds 500m scheme to buy back its own shares. Turnover by the close had reached a hefty 214m shares, making it by far the day's most actively dealt stock, as it registered a rise of 12 at 525p. SG Warburg, the company's broker, bought a short 10 per cent of the Boots shares for cancellation, with the lowest price paid being 528p and the highest 535p. The market had expected the buy-back, although several researchers had indicated that they thought the company was only likely to make this move after the UK budget later this month. Warburg encountered little difficulty in acquiring the desired block of shares. Dealers suggested that there had been many willing sellers, with one retail specialist report-ing estimates that Warburg could have bought as much as 30 per cent of the group's issued share capital. Yesterday's move followed confirmation on Monday that Boots is selling its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group, for around Pounds 850m. One analyst said the combination of the two developments left the company 'flexible to make an acquisition'. Meanwhile, analysts expect the selling institutions to pump their newfound cash back into the retail sector.</p>

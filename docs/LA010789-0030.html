			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANS OF PREP SPORTS AREN'T GETTING ENOUGH  </P> <P> I think a disservice has been done to high school sports followers. The dip in  The Times' high school coverage began just a few years back, with the  elimination of league track and field scores. But this, the elimination of  consolation and other loser games in preseason high school basketball  tournaments is really a blow.  </P> <P> Those of us who follow high school sports religiously, and it is a mighty army,  want to follow not only our own teams, but those of nearby rivals. Of course,  most of these, by odds, do not make tournament finals. Therefore, we don't know  how those teams did and can't play that great game of "comparative scores"  before the opening of the league season.  </P> <P> PETE ARBOGAST, KNX radio  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK and Prague to strengthen ties BRITAIN and Czechoslovakia yesterday agreed to intensify political and military co-operation to draw the former communist state gradually into the west's security framework. A joint declaration signed by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and President Vaclav Havel also laid to rest the lingering ghost of the pre-war cession to Germany of the Czech Sudetenland. The declaration explicitly recognised that the Munich agreement which the Czechoslovak government was forced to sign with Adolf Hitler in 1938 was null. Previous British prime ministers have apologised for their country's signature of the Munich agreement. But the formal renunciation, requested by Mr Havel, reflects the continuing concern of central European countries that the west should underwrite their present borders. Mr Major, whose visit to Prague and Bratislava yesterday embraced talks with the Czech and Slovak leaders contesting next month's elections, again underlined his commitment to eventual EC membership for Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary. The declaration stated: 'We are determined to co-operate in helping to create the political and economic conditions necessary for the accession of the Czech and Slovak federal republic to the European Community.' Speaking at a joint news conference with Mr Havel, Mr Major indicated that Britain was not ready at present to give the same commitment to back Prague's aspirations to join Nato. The joint declaration said the two governments would intensify consultations on the security issues dealt with by Nato and the Western European Union. That would mean strengthened military relations on both a multilateral and a bilateral basis. Mr Major, who had a long discussion with Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister, on Czechoslovakia's extensive privatisation programme, was drawn into the country's intense general election campaign when he was asked to comment on the possible secession of Slovakia from the Czech lands. Without offering a direct judgment, on the implications of such a split for relations with the west, he made clear that a divided Czechoslovakia would find it harder to meet the conditions for EC entry.</p>

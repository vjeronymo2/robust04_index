Despite General  Constand Viljoen's last-minute registration of the Freedom  Front, the Volksfront today rejected participation in the  election. Johan Claasen was at today's Volks Representative  Council meeting.    [Begin recording] [Claasen] Today's decision comes as a blow  to followers of Gen. Viljoen who tried to keep the door open for  participation in the election. The council's president, Dr.  Ferdi Hartzenberg, retained enough support against such a move.    [Hartzenberg, in Afrikaans] Since they are insisting that  the  only way we can show our support for a volkstaat [homeland] is  through this election, and because that is not an acceptable  test to us, the council decided that it will stand by the  decision it adopted two week's ago -- that it will not  participate in the 27 April election.    [Claasen] Gen. Viljoen said he abided by the decision. The  registration of the Afrikaner Vryheids Front [Freedom Front]  would now be allowed to lapse.    [Viljoen] You cannot deregister, it will simply elapse when  you don't hand in your list of candidates.    [Claasen] The decision not to take part in the election was  taken behind closed doors in Pretoria's Synod Center. But talk  among volkstaters noted that the general was rapped on the  knuckles for his apparent single-handed decision to register.  Some right wingers were more outspoken.    [Unidentified right winger in Afrikaans] We say that this  country is our country, and that is why we are not prepared to  enter this election.    [Claasen] Many supporters waited patiently for hours outside  before they were allowed into the meeting. They also wanted to  know where the final borders of their volkstaat would be. Dr.  Hartzenberg told them that a final map had been drawn up, but  members of the council would have to study it before it could be  accepted. [end recording]    Today's decision by the Volksfront not to participate in the  election means that last night's registration by Gen. Viljoen of  the Freedom Front becomes null and void. A total of 29 parties  registered for the election -- eight of them just beat the  midnight deadline.</p>

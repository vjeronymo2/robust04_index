			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans </F> by unidentified correspondent in The Hague; date not given:  "Kooijmans Is Reckoning With Kok as Prime Minister"]    [Text] The Hague -- Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans of  the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] believes that his party  should deal with the idea that the PvdA [Labor Party] is  becoming the biggest party and Wim Kok will become prime  minister. "Kok is an exceptionally talented man. We must take  account of the fact that the election results could turn out to  be such that he becomes prime minister," Kooijmans said in an  interview with the VRIJ NEDERLAND magazine.    "The CDA should not boycott a cabinet led by Kok," Kooijmans  said. "It is reasonable that the Christian Democrats would then  provide ministers for his cabinet," he said. "We must respect  the views of the voters."    Kooijmans said "the cause of the CDA's big losses in the  polls was the `neglect of inspiration from the bible.' I think  that we did not emphasize the C in Christian enough," he said.  "You are seeing that voters who long felt comfortable with the  CDA are now running off. Everything has become too pragmatic.  We must put that right."    Kooijmans said that "it could not be denied" that the former  KVP [Catholic People's Party] supporters in particular no longer  identified with the CDA. The merger of the KVP, ARP  [Anti-Revolutionary Party], and CHU [Christian Historical Union]  had not produced the unity aimed for.</p>

The mayor was addressing a financial conference here. He  said that Shanghai's steady economic development in 1992 was  closely related with the rapid growth of the finance sector in  the city's economy. It would act as a strong backup to the  city's further reforms and development.    The mayor pointed out that a big modern market, with finance  as its core, is being framed in the city. Its stock market had  a total transaction of 520 billion yuan last year.    More than 10 national exchange markets are being  standardized  under legal system.    The city's financial sector will concentrate its  administration on bank loans, develop financial markets, promote  reforms in state-run commercial banks as well as in foreign  exchange administration systems, according to Mao Yingliang,  director of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China.</p>

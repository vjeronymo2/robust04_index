Ciller said the result was reached by diplomatic ways urging  that the same initiations should be taken on the other six  regions like Sarajevo. `Turkey will always support such  initiations,' she added.    Premier called the improvements `positive,' saying Serbia  has  removed 86 percent of their heavy weapons.    Ciller recalled that the U.S. President Bill Clinton called  her on the phone three days ago and told her of the U.S.  determination on the issue. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tamara Maksimenkova, chief specialist of the </F> Department of Weather Forecasting of Rosgidromettsentr: "Deep  Sleep Disturbed"]    [Text] This January was warm on the European territory of  the Russian Federation. The average air temperature over most of  the territory of Northwestern, Central, Central-Chernozem, and  North Caucasian regions and also in the south of the Volga  region was 5-7 degrees above the many-year averages, and on the  rest of the territory of Russia--1-3 degrees.    The total negative air temperature for November-January,  which characterizes the severity of the winter, over a large  part of the European territory of Russia was 80-90 percent of  the many-year average air temperatures.    But if one does not count the cold November over a large  part  of Northwestern, Central, and Central-Chernozem regions and  Lower Volga Area, the sum of negative air temperatures was only  25-45 percent of the norm, and in the Northern Caucasus--only  for the first 10 days of December.    In St. Petersburg on 16 January the absolute maximum air  temperature for that day was surpassed (4.3 degrees as against  4.1 degrees in 1983).    The largest amount of precipitation (180-220 percent of the  norm and more) fell in the central oblasts of the Non-Chernozem  zone of Russia. Almost everywhere with the exception of the  Northern Caucasus and Lower Volga Area the snow cover on fields  planted in winter grain crops was 20-40 cm and more.    The minimum soil temperature at the depth of the tillering  node of winter crops remained mainly within the range of minus  3-5.    Over the majority of the territory of the Northern region  and  the north of Volga-Vyatka and Ural regions, where a deep (30 cm  and more) snow cover was established during the second half of  December on slightly frozen soil, by the end of January it had  increased 1.5-2-fold. The minimum soil temperature at the depth  of the tillering node of grain crops remained close to zero.  There is a probability of damage to winter crops by rotting.    Beginning in the middle of January the same conditions for  the wintering of planted areas were created in the northern part  of the Central region as well. Here the depth of the snow cover  increased to 30 cm but as a result of the warm weather the depth  of freezing of the soil decreased and even in the middle of the  month it was less than 50 cm.    The deep winter rest of the winter crops was disturbed--and  intensive expenditure of nutritive substances for respiration  began. In regions with a deep (more than 30 cm) snow cover and  slight (less than 50 cm) freezing of the soil, measures for  compacting the snow on the fields are very effective.    The existence of a crust of ice mainly 15-20 mm thick ground  into the soil on the fields in the Northwestern, Central, and  Central-Chernozem regions is unfavorable for winter crops. But  it is basically under a deep (more than 15 cm) snow cover and  presents no great danger to the planted areas.    Over the majority of territory of the North Caucasus region  and Lower Volga Area warm weather remained for most of the  month. The maximum air temperature, especially during the first  half of the month in the south of Rostov Oblast, Krasnodar and  Stavropol Krays, and the south of Kalmykia rose to 8-16 degrees.    The winter crops began to grow during this period. Shoots  appeared on the fields with late planting times.    The areas with plants that have developed poorly since  autumn  increased. The reserves of productive moisture on the fields  with wintering crops increased and mainly amounted to 30-40 mm  in the plowed layer of soil, and 110-160 mm in the 1-meter  layer. At the end of the month it became cold in these regions  and the plants stopped growing. A snow cover was formed in  places. The temperature of the soil at the depth of the  tillering node dropped to slightly negative values.    In Western Siberia the wintering of winter grain crops  proceeded favorably.    The planted areas were under a snow cover whose depth was  mainly 25-35 cm and more. Only in the southwest of Altay Kray  was there somewhat less snow on the fields--8-12 cm. Therefore,  in spite of the fact that the air temperature dropped to minus  30-34 and lower on certain days, the minimum temperature of the  soil at the depth of the tillering node of winter grain crops  remained within the range of minus 7 to minus 12 degrees, and in  the southwest of Altay Kray--minus 15 to minus 17, which was not  dangerous to the planted areas.    According to the preliminary forecast of Rosgidromettsentr,  in February in the north of Volga-Vyatka and Ural regions the  air temperature is expected to be one degree below normal.  Therefore the processes of rotting of winter grain crops are  somewhat retarded. In Central Volga Area the air temperature is  also expected to be 1 degree below normal, but there the winter  grain crops are under a snow cover which reliably protects the  planted areas from the harmful effects of low temperatures, and  there will be no freezing on large areas. In the Northern  Caucasus and Lower Volga Area the quantity of precipitation in  February is expected to be close to the many-year average, and  the air temperature--1-2 degrees below normal. The winter grain  crops will not grow in February. It is not expected that winter  crops will freeze on large areas since the warm weather in  December and January led to melting, and in the north of Rostov  and Volgograd Oblast--to a reduction of the freezing of the soil.    In the Northwestern Region where the depth of the snow cover  on fields planted in winter grain crops is not great (mainly  less than 10 cm) in February the air temperature is expected to  be 1 degree above normal. Therefore there will be no freezing of  winter grain crops on large areas.    On the rest of the territory of the Russian Federation the  air temperature and the quantity of precipitation in February is  expected to be close to the many-year averages.</p>

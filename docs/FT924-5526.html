			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Book Review: King of the cat-fight THE LOUIS VUITTON AND MOET-HENNESSY AFFAIR By Hugh Sebag-Montefiore Chapmans Pounds 9.99 There are few things that the French consider to be as important as lunch. The staff of Christian Dior ought therefore to have guessed that something was awry when Bernard Arnault, their new boss, brushed aside a lunch invitation from one of them with a dismissive: 'What have we got to talk about?' Spurning lunch was only the start. In the seven years since he took over Christian Dior, the French fashion house, Arnault has presided over a string of hirings and firings. Marc Bohan learned about his 'resignation' as chief designer in a trade paper. He had worked at Christian Dior for almost three decades only to be 'thrown out as brutally as . . . an incompetent valet', or so he said at the time. Arnault haunts every page of Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's Kings On The Catwalk. The subject of the book is the fight for control of the Louis Vuitton Moet-Hennessy (LVMH) luxury goods group in the late 1980s. Its sub-plot is the apparently relentless rise of Arnault, the provincial property developer who, at 42, is now one of the most powerful players in the international luxury goods industry. The cast list appears in the opening chapter when the leading actors assemble in their front-row seats at the Paris haute couture collections in July 1990. There is Arnault himself, 'a handsome, youthful man with black hair tinged with grey and a pensive, owl-like face'. Then there is Henry Racamier, the steel magnate who married an heiress to the Louis Vuitton luggage fortune, 'a tall, erect man whose craggy, angular face, square jaw and greased-back hair give him the appearance of a rakish businessman from the 1930s'. Finally there is Alain Chevalier, with 'his deep tan, his bald head and his immaculate, dark blue suit . . . his long, thin artistic fingers and his slightly dreamy expression'. The plot is as follows. Racamier masterminds a merger between the Vuitton businesses and the Moet-Hennessy drinks empire run by Chevalier. They fight for power. Racamier ropes in Arnault, who has made his name in French finance by buying up businesses, including Christian Dior, hoping he will be an ally. That proved a big mistake. Far from being an ally, Arnault, aided and abetted by his banker, Antoine Bernheim of Lazard Freres, seizes control of LVMH in a series of share raids, boardroom battles and legal attacks. Chevalier resigns. Racamier battles on until April 26 1990, when he loses the final legal fight to Arnault and his wife, Odile, is led sobbing from the offices of the company her great-grandfather had founded. Kings On The Catwalk is strong on anecdotes. There is a wry account of Chevalier, the professional manager and arch-delegator, throwing up his hands in astonishment as the fastidious Racamier pores over the finer details of their merged company's new letter headings and office decor. Arnault's adventures and misadventures are faithfully recorded, culminating in an account of the LVMH shareholders' meeting where he sat impassively while his fellow directors reeled off their grievances against him. The book is also good at describing the details of the LVMH contest - from the wheeling and dealing of the bankers, to the public relations advisers pouring scorn on the opposition and the wooing of the founding families by the competing camps. Finally, the book offers an exhaustive account of who bought which blocks of shares when, and why. The book's weakness is that it fails to analyse the long-term consequences of the LVMH conflict, either for French business or for the international luxury goods industry. The LVMH affair formed part of a general process of consolidation in the luxury goods sector during the 1980s. This has raised the financial stakes in the industry by heralding a new era of expensive advertising campaigns, spiralling fees for super-models and ambitious product development programmes. As a result the Arnault companies and their competitors are now trapped in a vicious cycle of escalating overheads in an increasingly competitive sector. Nor does Sebag-Montefiore consider the implications of the LVMH battle for the French business establishment. The fight for LVMH was, after all, only one of a series of corporate skirmishes in which US-style takeover tactics triumphed over the nepotistic traditions of France's family-controlled companies. Kings On The Catwalk does not stint on reiterating the criticism of Arnault, but it also points out that all he has really done is to apply the modern management methods common in most other sectors to the cloistered world of French luxury goods. What it does not say is whether Arnault will be vindicated and whether bad blood in the LVMH boardroom, or the firings at Christian Dior, will turn out to have been worthwhile.</p>

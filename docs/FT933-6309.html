			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Clondalkin declines to IPounds 4.64m Low raw material input prices, weak demand and severe price competition continued to affect first half trading at Clondalkin Group, the Dublin-based printing and packaging group. In the half year ended June 30 profits fell from IPounds 6.17m to IPounds 4.64m pre-tax on turnover of IPounds 74.3m (IPounds 74.8m). Earnings slipped to 8.03p (11.01p) per share while the interim dividend is maintained at 1.834p. Mr Domhnall McCullough, chairman, said there were rationalisation costs of IPounds 400,000 in the period. Cost reduction programmes, investment in new equipment and renewed marketing strategies had been implemented to lower unit costs and increase sales. He added that with a strong balance sheet and net cash the company continued to pursue acquisition opportunities.</p>

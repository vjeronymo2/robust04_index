Three private  organisations and two departments of the Commerce Ministry are  to make the calculations, so that the ministry can ensure that  legitimate tapes and discs are not overpriced. The application  of anti-monopoly and price-fixing powers to tapes and discs was  introduced after the current crackdown on piracy was launched  last April.    The government has described their use as a means of  preventing the exploitation of copyright protection as well as  giving officials a greater ability to track down whether  products currently sold are legitimate or not. By making tapes  and discs controlled products, officials have more power to  monitor production and trade.    Speaking after a meeting on Monday on intellectual property  violations, Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said  the crackdown has been effective, with only a small amount of  piracy remaining.    He said the International Federation of Phonographic  Industries (IFPI), the Record Association of Thailand, the  Traders' Association of tapes and video tapes, the Internal  Trade Department and the Commercial Registration Department were  asked to jointly assess the production costs of music tapes,  compact discs and video tapes.    The outcome of the evaluation which would be reported to the  meeting body at the next session, would serve as a basis for  determining the fairest and most suitable prices of these  products for local sale, he said.    "After the Government has applied serious suppressive  measures against rights violations, it was reported that the  prices of music tapes, compact discs and video tapes in Bangkok  have not moved up much, according to a recent price survey  conducted by the Internal Trade Department in both Bangkok and  other provinces," the deputy minister said.    "At some places which were notorious sources for the  convenient purchase of pirated products, such as along Khao San  Road in Banglamphu, the rate of violations has been reported to  have dropped dramatically by half. The Record Association of  Thailand claimed the rate has fallen by as much as 70 percent in  these places," he said.    "Despite the discrepancy, these figures reveal the same  satisfactory trend -- a declining rate of violations."    In view of the prices of these products in the other 47  provinces nationwide, it was found that the prices of music  tapes had not changed much. However, video tapes sold in Chiang  Mai and Phitsanulok have moved up to 350 baht from 270 baht  apiece while rental rates of the products have risen by 12-15  baht each.    In Lamphun the prices of music tapes have increased from 80  to 85 baht each, while in Songkhla tape prices have risen from  60-80 baht to 85 baht apiece.    These prices, however, cannot serve as a median for the  fairest of prices. Therefore, the three private associations  are requested to report the actual production costs for further  consideration by the Commerce Ministry.    "Should it turn out that the margins are unreasonably high,  regulatory measures will be imposed. Such requirements may  include clear marking of prices, special authorisation in the  case of price-raising, or controlling retail prices altogether,"  Mr Churin added.    During the first half of this month the Intellectual  Property  Department, in cooperation with the Police Department, has  investigated 62 cases of piracy and sent them for trial with  14,233 pieces of products confiscated.    As for the suppressive measures targeted at mail order sales  of the products, the Communications Authority of Thailand has  cooperated very well. A special decoy unit to detect shops  selling pirated products has also been in operation.</p>

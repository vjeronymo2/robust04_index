Shlyakhtina: "Continuing To Rob the Press and </F> Subscribers, Moscow's Postal Authorities Have Increased the Cost  of Delivering Newspapers by More Than Threefold"]    [Text] During a recent regularly scheduled round table  discussion, journalists from our newspaper and other interested  parties were discussing the problem of newspaper distribution. A  certain very important person from a ministry, "who had the  scholarly look of someone who knows," summarized the views,  worries, and outright alarm of subscribers who have been  helpless in the face of the market environment that had intruded  into their lives: "A subscription is a blessing for everyone.  Subscribers are guaranteed each issue; the post office receives  money up front, which they can use; and the publisher has  permanent readers." It is wonderful that these words are so  idyllic, that "everything is so good, oh, beautiful marquise." A  subscription is a good thing. It exists now and will exist  forever. In actual fact, however, the picture that emerges is  not so radiant.    Excessive and openly larcenous tariffs, constantly  implemented by postal and telecommunications officials, are--as  they say--chopping down publications at their roots and even  without all this, choking to death the subscriber who can barely  make ends meet. As everyone knows, for a long time the cost of  delivery has been higher than the cost of the newspapers  themselves. Publishers have been forced to make an incredible  effort, at times engaging in commercial, rather than creative  activities, so that the subscriber would not suffer. Let us  remind you that in the subscription campaign that just ended,  MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA offered its readers a half year subscription  for only 600 rubles at a time when the post office announced a  nearly fourfold increase in the price of newspaper delivery. We  shall not even speak about the postal and telecommunications  workers around Moscow, who--as everyone knows--presented a  figure that was totally unthinkable, as a result of which the  publication office was again forced to place 3,000 rubles in an  account for postal and communications employees on behalf of  each suscriber around Moscow. This came at a time when newspaper  production cost the publisher several hundred million rubles per  month. Why, then, do some publishers look for and find sources  of revenue, while others just hope that those who are not yet  losing money will be "taken" the next time. Can ads be published  endlessly, using sponsors' money?    What is the solution? First of all, it probably would be  worth looking in detail at the calculations; that is, seeing  exactly what is included in postal expenses for this new  six-month period. In particular, are the wages justified for  postal carriers, who incidentally have stopped delivering mail  in afternoons and evenings and have only one morning delivery,  and even that one is not done the way it should be. As of  February 1st, a postman's pay will be somewhat higher than that  of a physician, a scientist, or an artist, whose work is no less  important, and whose work, of course, takes many hours more  than--for example-- a postman's job. It also would not hurt to  clarify whether, as a hedge against future increases, funds have  been allocated for new delivery prices. That move would be a  barrier to postal and communications workers' ability to carry  on at least some kind of commercial activity as soon as we start  living according to the laws of the market economy. Prices just  cannot be increased practically every three months for using the  same post office box, nor can postage prices be drastically  increased, especially since no additional effort has been  expended and delivery of mail has not been speeded up, but on  the contrary, slowed down.    The main point is, however, that as long as we pattern our  present lives exclusively on civilized states that we consider  models of capitalism, we should not forget that in those  developed and flourishing states the postal system is a  government service and is protected in every respect by the  governments of those states. In actuality, no matter what one  says, the postal service also fulfills a social function in our  country by helping people attain their constitutional right to  know about everything that is going on in the world.    It would be unjust to assert that no one in Moscow  understands this. Let us remind you only of the generous impulse  of the mayor's office, which clearly foresaw the threat of a  drastic decrease in the number of newspaper issues published in  Moscow and presented the Moscow Post Office with a subsidy of  100 million rubles. It is true, of course, that the postal and  communications workers had to "squeeze" this money out bit by  bit; nevertheless, the fact is that they received it. Also there  was the order given last March by B. Nikolskiy, first deputy  premier of the Moscow government, charging the Directorate of  Pricing Policy to look into price increases by the Moscow Post  Office of the State Postal Service for delivering periodicals.  In addition, he also asked the Finance Department to resolve the  issue of subsidized expenses for delivering newspapers during  the second half of last year by taking into consideration the  inflation factor.    Today it is still essential to subsidize our capital's  postal  service, which has been degraded to the same level as the trade  and banking business. If it is not subsidized, in the end all  the readers of Moscow's newspapers will suffer because of the  intolerably excessive financial burden that they will have to  bear.</p>

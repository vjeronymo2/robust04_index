			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Sinn Fein peace hints raise hopes of IRA ceasefire: Adams and Hume say 'significant progress' made towards accord Speculation that the IRA may be about to call a general ceasefire was mounting last night after Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, announced that the 'essential ingredients' for an approach to peace 'may now be available'. Mr Adams, in a joint communique issued in Northern Ireland with Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), said that 'significant progress' had been made towards the conditions necessary for a 'peace-ful and democratic accord'. The statement, in which they said they were hopeful that the peace process could be moved forward, came after a week of suggestions and hints that the IRA might be about to call an extended ceasefire in an attempt to put pressure on the British and Irish governments to make concessions over possible peace talks. They warned that: 'In any new situation there is a heavy onus on the British government to respond positively, both in terms of the demilitarisation of the situation and in assisting the search for an agreed Ireland by encouraging the process of national reconciliation.' There is growing expectation that an extended IRA ceasefire will be announced this week. Although most unlikely to be a declaration of a permanent end to the IRA's 25-year military campaign, there are hopes it could mark the first step in de-escalating the conflict. London and Dublin would almost certainly react to even an extended ceasefire by saying it did not amount to a permanent cessation of violence and so did not justify allowing republican leaders into political talks on Northern Ireland's future. Whitehall officials have been particularly heartened by the hard line recently taken on this issue by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. But an open-ended ceasefire would put the two governments under intense pressure to make some conciliatory gesture. Republican leaders would hope that this pressure would in turn put the governments' united front under fresh strain. A series of meetings between Mr Hume and Mr Adams from April last year was one factor which provided impetus for the peace process. It was followed by the signing of the Downing Street declaration in December last year by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds. Last night Mr Reynolds, in a detailed response to the joint statement, said there was an historic opportunity for a settlement of the Ulster conflict. 'It is clear that Sinn Fein and the IRA are in the final stage of their deliberations,' he said. Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist party disclosed last night that its leader, Mr James Molyneaux, will have discussions with Mr Major in Downing Street during the week about the search for peace. The Downing Street declaration offers Sinn Fein a seat at the negotiating table in the event of a permanent IRA ceasefire, and an eventual simultaneous referendum in both parts of Ireland on a future constitutional arrangement for the province.</p>

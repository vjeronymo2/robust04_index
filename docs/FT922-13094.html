			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo resumes its decline after Friday's brief rally SHARE prices erased their initial gains as arbitrage-related selling emerged, and the Nikkei average, which had rallied on bargain-hunting last Friday, closed down 3.4 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 614.01 to 17,236.65. The index firmed in the morning, hitting the day's high of 17,938.38 on buying by dealers and investment trusts, heartened by last Friday's 7.6 per cent jump. However, small-lot arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking depressed the average to the day's low of 17,153.25 in the afternoon. Volume fell to 280m shares from 380m. Declines narrowly led advances by 486 to 484 with 154 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 12.95 to 1,269.61. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index declined 8.6 to 1018.97. Traders said that last Friday's jump in the Nikkei was prompted by rumours that the ministry of finance had advised life insurers and trust banks to restrict lending of shares for short-selling purposes. Investors, who had sold bank shares short, rushed to buy back on fears of these lending restrictions. Financials, which were sought in early trading, closed mixed. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y50 to Y1,610, while Sumitomo Bank lost Y50 to Y1,290. Mr David Atkinson, financial analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said since the average price-to-book ratios of the 11 Japanese commercial banks were currently at 177 per cent against the 1974-83 average of 175 per cent, Japanese bank shares were fairly valued. 'They are are now internationally comparable,' he added. Construction stocks fell across the board as dealers, who were seen bargain-hunting earlier in the day, took their profits in the afternoon. Shimizu lost Y54 to Y996 and Nishimatsu Construction fell Y50 to Y1,010. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, fell by its daily limit of Y1,000 to Y8,950. Reports that the company has been ordered by a US federal district court to pay over Dollars 30m in damages for its alleged patent infringement on a colour display technology, discouraged investors. High-technology issues, higher last week, fell on profit-taking. NEC lost Y16 to Y984 and Sony fell Y150 to Y4,080. Despite the overall market weakness, most industrial blue chips have remained above the mid-March lows, and analysts believe the share prices of leading manufacturing companies are bottoming out. Some speculative stocks were sought by short-term players, and Nippon Carbon rose Y13 to Y551. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 144.41 to 19,105.36 in volume of 10.4m shares. Roundup TOKYO'S renewed decline wiped out any early gains in the Pacific Rim. HONG KONG finished lower on a lack of buying interest. The Hang Seng index closed down 31.97 at 4,889.14 after touching a day's high of 4,941.11 in the morning. Turnover fell to HKDollars 1.5bn from HKDollars 2.8bn. Most actively traded was HSBC Holdings which finished 25 cents higher at HKDollars 39.50. SEOUL ended slightly higher on rumours that the government and Hyundai Group were looking for some kind of compromise. The composite index rose 2.08 to 578.19 in turnover of Won200.5bn after Saturday's half-day Won164.8bn. AUSTRALIA was unable to hold on to early gains and headed downwards as soon as Tokyo resumed its decline. The All-Ordinaries index closed 12 lower at 1570.1, above the day's low of 1,567, in turnover of ADollars 212.2m. Government indications of an interest rate cut after the release of the March quarter consumer price data later this month failed to support the equity market, although credit markets rallied on the news. SINGAPORE closed mostly lower in thin trading. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 7.06 lower at 1,373.86 in volume of 26.4m shares, down from 38.6m. Interest centred on shares involved in a takeover bid for Malayan Credit. Cycle and Carriage and Hotel Properties, which are jointly trying to acquire Malayan Credit, rose 5 and 7 cents each to SDollars 5.75 and SDollars 1.81 respectively. Malayan Credit rose 8 cents to SDollars 2.17, still below SDollars 2.25 per share offered by Cycle and Carriage and Hotel Properties. TAIWAN extended its early declines to finish lower on weak financials. The weighted index finished 82.18 or 1.8 per cent lower at 4,405.44 as turnover rose to TDollars 18.96bn from TDollars 13.2bn. KUALA LUMPUR closed lower on a lack of follow-through support. The composite index fell 3.80 to 567.51, after an early high of 573.94. NEW ZEALAND failed to build on early gains, closing only slightly up. The NZSE 40 index closed at 1,392.29, up 5.03, in low turnover of NZDollars 12m. MANILA ended marginally higher in listless trading, due to a severe power shortage in the city. The composite index crept up 1.26 to 1,136.09. BOMBAY fell ahead of a local holiday. The BSE Index fell 143.41 or 3.3 per cent to 4,163.02.</p>

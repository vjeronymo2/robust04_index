			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: New MAS chief says shake-up is needed to raise profitability Mr Tajudin Ramli, the Malaysian entrepreneur who has recently taken control of Malaysian Airlines (MAS), says a thorough restructuring of the financially troubled national carrier will be carried out to boost profits. Mr Tajudin was made MAS chairman last month following a controversial, highly leveraged MDollars 1.79bn (USDollars 690m) deal which gave his listed Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS) company a controlling 32 per cent stake in the airline. 'The company has gone in various directions in the last couple of years but has lacked focus,' said Mr Ramli, after the MAS annual meeting. 'If we don't change, the same fate could happen to us as Pan Am.' (The US airline went bankrupt in 1991.) Mr Ramli said six or seven MAS divisions would be hived off to force them to become more profitable. An extensive cost-cutting programme would also be implemented with the aim of saving between MDollars 40m and MDollars 50m over the next six months. Mr Ramli said that aircraft purchase agreements and recently established routings would be included in a review of MAS operations now under way, but lay-offs would be avoided among the airline's 19,000 staff. In the year to March 31 1994 MAS had a pre-tax profit of MDollars 16m, a 90 per cent drop on the previous year. An ambitious expansion programme involving the purchase of 72 aircraft valued at MDollars 10.6bn in the 1991-96 period has severely strained financial resources. Analysts also point out that MAS is overstaffed in comparison with most other international carriers. Mr Ramli said that as part of the restructuring process, Mr Wan Malek Ibrahim, executive director at MHS, would be made managing director. Philippine Airlines (PAL), the national carrier, yesterday announced changes in senior management on the day that it revealed a slide into loss after two years of profit, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Mr Harry Tan and Mr Florencio Santos, both directors at Fortune Tobacco, the company owned by Mr Lucio Tan, lead investor in the PR Holdings group which acquired majority ownership of PAL in 1992, join the board, replacing Mr Antonio Cojuangco and Mr Roberto de Ocampo. Mr Mariano Tanenglian becomes treasurer. In the year to March, PAL made a net loss of 451m pesos (Dollars 17m) compared with net profits of 1.03bn pesos in fiscal 1992-93.</p>

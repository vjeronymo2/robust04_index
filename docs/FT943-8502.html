			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / More strike-breaking trains due: Railtrack hopes to run 40% of network during next week's 24-hour stoppage Railtrack hopes to run 40 per cent of the railway network during next week's 24-hour strike starting at noon on Monday, an official said yesterday. As this week's stoppage ended last night, when one-third of trains operated, Railtrack's east Anglia area said a quarter of the striking signal workers had returned to work. Mr Richard Middleton, the area's director, said: 'I do hope that this will make the RMT realise our signal workers' support for the strike is declining and that the only way to resolve the dispute is to return to the negotiating table.' The RMT said the company's claim of a drift back to work was exaggerated and insisted that there was still 'massive support' from the signal workers to continue the action. The transport union announced yesterday a further 48-hour strike by its signal workers for immediately after the August bank holiday weekend. It will last from noon on Tuesday August 30 to noon on Thursday September 1. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said that his executive announced the new strike dates to 'dispel public doubts' that the union might disrupt travel during the holiday period itself. The announcement came as the British Chambers of Commerce issued a warning that the strike, now in its 10th week, could inflict long-term damage on British industry. Mr Richard Brown, the chambers' deputy director general, said businesses had coped with the stoppages because of good weather, clear roads, school holidays and lower-than-normal business activity in the summer months. But he said: 'Once business gets back up to full speed in September, schools go back and the weather gets worse, road congestion will be severe and firms will no longer be able to duck and dive around the strikes. 'We will then see more money being lost in terms of lost business and higher costs in the short term, and long-term damage to those businesses still struggling to grow.' Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, denounced the RMT's latest decision as 'irresponsible' and 'callous'. He said: 'This action will cause massive disruption to passengers and freight users and it is a savage blow to the whole rail industry. It will also hit the tourist industry, which does much of its trade in that holiday week.'</p>

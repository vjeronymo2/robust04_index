			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / US bonds hit by interest rate fears Signs yesterday that US economic growth is surging prompted heavy selling of bonds and shares on Wall Street as analysts bet that the Federal Reserve would shortly signal another interest rate rise. In a turbulent market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped more than 2 points, pushing the yield above 7.5 per cent to its highest level since late 1992. Share prices also fell sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 26.47 at 3,669.50. The trigger for heavy selling was a Labour Department report showing employment had risen 267,000 in April and about 1m since the beginning of the year - a much faster pace than expected in financial markets. But for the distortions caused by a strike by the Teamsters' union, the April increase would have been about 337,000. Revised figures showed a 464,000 gain in March. The jobless rate was also down sharply - at 6.4 per cent last month against 6.7 per cent in January. The figures suggest the economy this quarter may be growing at an annualised rate of 4 to 5 per cent - faster than it can sustain in the long run. This follows a temporary slowing to 2.6 per cent in the first quarter, reflecting bad weather and other distortions. Many analysts now regard an early increase in short-term interest rates as all but inevitable. The betting is that the Fed will raise the federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money for banks - by half a point to 4.25 per cent. It may also raise the discount rate, the rate at which the Fed lends to banks, by half a point to 3.5 per cent. A half-point increase in rates after a series of quarter-point moves would signal the Fed's resolve to prevent the economy from overheating. It would also reinforce the Clinton administration's attempts to bolster the dollar on foreign exchange markets. In a notable shift of emphasis, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, said this week the administration saw 'no advantage in a devalued currency'. Previously he had spoken only of the need to calm disorderly markets. The Fed had been expected to delay a rate increase until May 17, the next scheduled meeting of its policy-making open market committee. But following the jobs report and other stron-ger than expected economic data, an announcement could come as early as next week. On Wall Street, many traders were disappointed that the Fed had not acted immediately in response to the April jobs figures. The selling of bonds intensified after midday when it became clear that the Fed would not be raising rates during that session. The dollar rose during the morning in expectation of an interest rate rise, but fell back later as the heavy losses on Wall Street stifled foreign demand for dollar assets such as US stocks and Treasury bonds. In late New York trading the dollar was down almost half a pfennig at DM1.6620 and virtually unchanged against the yen at Y102.43. Gains in employment in April were concentrated in construction, retail trade and services - sectors depressed by bad weather at the beginning of the year.

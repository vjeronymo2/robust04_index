			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] will appoint two executive directors in the  self-governing territory of Lebowa, it decided on Thursday [21  April]. African National Congress Secretary-General Cyril  Ramaphosa said the executive directors would oversee the  finances, services and rationalisation of the Lebowa  administration.    The executive council said tension and lawlessness were  mounting in Lebowa and there had been several deaths.    Mr Ramaphosa said the directors would interact with the  government of Lebowa Chief Minister Mr Nelson Ramodike. They  would take over financial control from the Department of  Regional and Land affairs, he said. The department has been  running Lebowa's finances since irregularities were uncovered in  October last year.    Mr Ramaphosa said the administrations of the self-governing  territories would lapse on April 27. The Executive Council's  action would assist the re-integration of Lebowa and its  administration with the Northern Transvaal region.    He rejected criticism that Mr Ramodike was receiving better  treatment than homeland leaders opposed to the ANC.    The Executive Council resolution was backed by the  government.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> WELCOME BACK: When the train pulls into Irvine's new transportation center  today, it will be the first time one has stopped in town for passengers since  1947. . . . Santa Fe built its depot at Sand Canyon Avenue in 1907, but 40  years later its trains were stopping for freight only. The station was razed in  the early '70s. . . . Planners hope for other new stops in Mission Viejo, north  Irvine and Buena Park by the mid-'90s. Chris Woodyard and Catherine Gewertz  </P></p>

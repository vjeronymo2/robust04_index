			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Technology: Beauty business fights flaws Beauty-conscious consumers have taken to skin moisturisers in a big way, as companies have widened their products' appeal by using an increasingly advanced range of ingredients. But as well as boosting sales, this has also led to sharper scrutiny from health regulators. The facial moisturiser industry produced Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of sales in the US in 1992 - up by 10 per cent on the previous year, according to Diana Temple, a cosmetics analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York, while new product introductions rose by 14 per cent. This month, Pond's by Unilever launches a new line of complex moisturising products, priced to sell at between Dollars 5 and Dollars 12, well below the high prices charged for other products in this market. Avon is introducing Anew, a low-priced moisturiser with collagen acid, while L'Oreal's Plenitude, the first mass-market product to contain sophisticated ingredients like liposomes, has been expanding its market share. The US Food and Drug Administration is far from pleased about the direction the cosmetics companies are taking. It will soon examine the new products for possible regulation. But its attention has been temporarily distracted by the controversy over Retin-A, which some physicians claim can completely offset damage caused by overexposure to the sun. In one case, the FDA chastised several physicians for allegedly recommending the use of Retin-A, approved only for use on acne, as a wrinkle eradicator. Ortho, the Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary making Retin-A, responded by repackaging the product under a new name, Renova, and filing an application with the FDA to use the cream as an anti-ageing skin drug. But many of the moisturisers on the market use a compound related to Retin-A in their own products. The active ingredient in both Retin-A and Renova is tretinoin, a synthetic analogue of vitamin A, developed so it can be absorbed through the skin. Many products use another vitamin A derivative called vitamin A palmitate. The cosmetics companies insist that consumers need the innovative new products for a long-lasting moisturising effect. 'Old-fashioned moisturisers simply bind water to the skin's surface,' said Daniel Maes, vice-president in charge of research and development for Estee Lauder. Still, because of concern over possible regulations, cosmetics companies are searching for alternatives to vitamin A derivatives. Estee Lauder has introduced cerebrozides into its products. 'The superficial layer of the skin loses its ability to retain water with age,' said Maes. 'The cerebrozides are a complex lipid found in plants in China and they restore this function.' Besides the side-effects of vitamin A derivatives, the FDA is concerned about products that penetrate deeply. These products often depend on liposomes and niosomes, which coat the moisturisers' active ingredients to carry them deeper into the skin. Many companies are struggling to find moisturisers that have an impact similar to the deep-penetrating products while affecting only the skin's most superficial layers. It will not be easy to find a substitute for the vitamin A derivatives. Lipids help restore the skin's capacity to create its own moisture, but vitamin A derivatives perform a different function. As skin ages, the cells in the skin start to experience abnormal activity, growing too fast or too slow. Vitamin A palmitate slows the activity of hyperactive cells and boosts the activity of under-active cells. Like the proponents of Retin-A, the makers of products using vitamin A palmitate claim the moisturisers can eradicate superficial lines. 'As the skin cells stabilise and retain moisture, they get thicker,' said Maes. 'And as the epidermis gets thicker, the superficial wrinkles disappear.' Yet because of what the industry claims are striking results, manufacturers are unlikely to relinquish the ingredient for some time. The market's growth prospects are simply too tempting.</p>

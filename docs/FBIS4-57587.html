			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with ANPP Vice President Jaime Crombet </F> by Carmen Gloria]    [Text] Today, the board of the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] assessed the energy program in Granma  Province. ANPP Vice President Jaime Crombet Hernandez-Baquero  was present.    [Begin recording] [Gloria] Mr. Crombet, please refer to the  results achieved so far here in Granma. It has been learned that  some 547.9 tons of fuel have been saved. How would you appraise  this?    [Crombet] The overall work of the province in the sphere of  energy is good, and I must stress the consistency in this area  because it involves many areas of work. This task cannot be  measured in figures. The work in the sugar industry is  outstanding. We can certainly stress the work of the Basic  Industry Ministry in electricity; the work of the Agriculture  Ministry in agriculture; and as for water resources, this  province, especially in the mountains, has great hydroelectric  potential in its rivers and dams. Several municipalities in the  mountainous region can become self-sufficient in energy,  especially if we manage to complete all the minihydroelectric  dam projects within a reasonable time, considering the available  water resources.    [Gloria] What can you tell us about initiatives to conserve  fuel in this province?    [Crombet] Saving is admirable. We have seen, however, that  although potentials are great, there are still some negative  points. Not everything is going well or efficiently. But,  generally, I can say that the work done in this province is good  and that workers here have been working in a continuous and  systematic manner. [end recording]</p>

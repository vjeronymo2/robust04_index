			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The attack on Heathrow The Irish Republican Army's attack on Heathrow airport was not its bloodiest since the Anglo-Irish Downing Street declaration in December, but it was certainly its boldest. Heathrow ranks alongside the City of London, itself devasted by an IRA bomb last year, as a prime and heavily defended target. The assault does not prove that the republican movement will never respond favourably to the carefully crafted words of the declaration, but it appears to confirm that it is unlikely to do so soon. For the IRA, the war goes on. The British government thus finds itself under increasing pressure to abandon the terms of a declaration seen by its opponents as an act of appeasement calculated only to encourage terrorists to increase the deadliness of their bargaining tactics. Mr John Major was wise to rule out any such course of action yesterday. The declaration may or may not be capable of ending Ulster's troubles one day, but it has already yielded benefits which should not be lightly set aside. It has accelerated the convergence of view between London and Dublin that coercion has no part to play in shaping Ireland's future. It has provided a basis upon which all but the most extreme of the north's constitutional parties have felt, at least briefly, able to imagine political progress. Against this background, it is encouraging that a series of recent opinion polls north and south of the border has shown a large majority in favour of a settlement based upon the Downing Street principles. The unpleasant truth facing Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, is that in spite of these advances, peace may not be in sight. The IRA's political position is weaker than it was in December, but it is by no means defeated. A future thus offers itself of yet more agonisingly slow progress, punctuated by atrocities which create a sense of reeling backwards. The agenda for progress should include further efforts, in consultation with the province's constitutional parties, to devolve government functions from Westminster to Belfast. A more harmonious political relationship between London and Dublin should also yield more effective security co-operation between north and south. The agenda also needs to involve deepening the political consensus about Ulster's future at Westminster. The only false political step made by the government this week has been its handling of an approach from the leadership of the Labour party to try to forge agreement upon the future of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The party political crowing of Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, during the debate on this act, which was itself interrupted by the news from Heathrow, lacked statesmanship. The political tide is moving, however slowly, against the IRA. This is not a time either for cheap shots, or for lurches in approach.</p>

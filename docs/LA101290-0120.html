			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCKET BLOWS UP ON LAUNCH PAD IN SETBACK FOR SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's most advanced booster rocket, carrying what an American  specialist believes was a spy satellite, exploded seconds after liftoff last  week, Tass news agency said Thursday.  </P> <P> The blast nearly destroyed the launch pad and may complicate Soviet efforts to  sell launch services to the West, analysts said.  </P> <P> Tass said the Zenit booster broke apart at the Baikonur spaceport in the  Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan on Oct. 4.  </P> <P> Tass said no one was hurt and that a commission is investigating the accident.  The brief dispatch did not identify the payload or give any other details.  </P> <P> American author-researcher James Oberg said, however, that he believes the  payload was a military spy satellite.  </P> <P> Nikolai Semyonov, head of the Soviet space agency's international department,  said further Zenit launches have been put on hold.  </P> <P> The Soviet space program has suffered several setbacks in the last year,  including the loss of two Mars probes and an exit hatch malfunction on the  orbiting Mir manned station.  </P> <P> The program also has faced spending cuts by legislators trying to trim a budget  deficit. Officials are trying to make up for the cuts by wooing foreign  customers.  </P></p>

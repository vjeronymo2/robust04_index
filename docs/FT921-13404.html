			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Japan's trade surplus up 50 per cent JAPAN'S trade surplus rose to Dollars 78.2bn in 1991, up 50 per cent on 1990. The increase ends four years of decline and highlights renewed international attempts to strengthen the yen. The Ministry of Finance said exports rose 9.6 per cent to Dollars 314.6bn, while imports increased only 0.7 per cent to Dollars 236.4bn. On a yen basis, exports rose 2.2 per cent to Y42,370bn and imports fell 5.9 per cent to Y31,850bn. Figures for December, in which the surplus was up 84 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 10bn, suggest that the 1992 surplus could surpass the previous record of Dollars 82.74bn in 1986. The seasonally adjusted surplus in December was Dollars 7.26bn, down from Dollars 7.43bn in November. Japan's 1991 exports to the EC rose 10.5 per cent and imports from the EC fell 9.3 per cent, resulting in a surplus of Dollars 27.37bn, a 48 per cent increase, though the rate of growth has slowed in recent months. The surplus with the US rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 38.45bn, the first increase since 1987. With Washington focusing on the bilateral surplus this year, the December figures indicated that trade friction could intensify in coming months. Japan's surplus for the month in trade with the US was Dollars 4.46bn, with exports to the US rising 1.8 per cent to Dollars 8.39bn and imports from the US falling 17.4 per cent to Dollars 3.93bn. The turnaround in the Japanese surplus last year reflected the slowing of domestic economic growth, a continued increase in demand from Asian trading partners, and a contraction in sales of luxury imports that had surged before the collapse of Japan's financial 'bubble'. The Bank of Japan estimates that about 75 per cent of the increase is due to 'special factors', including currency fluctuations and lower oil prices. The central bank argues that these will be less important this year and that the growth in the surplus will soon peak. Mr Russell Jones, chief economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, expects the surplus to continue to grow in the first quarter of this year before levelling off. However, he is surprised by the strength of Japanese exports to the US in recent months. 'When you look at the struggle for recovery in the US, five consecutive months of higher surpluses with the US is a bit surprising. Part of the problem is that US exports to Japan include a lot of commodity items, and lower commodity prices mean a higher bilateral surplus,' Mr Jones said. The December figures reflected the growing importance of Japan's trade with south-east Asian nations, with exports to the region 5.6 per cent higher at Dollars 10bn, and imports from the region down 4.7 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn. While Japan's trade volume with that region totalled Dollars 16.1bn, the volume with the US was Dollars 12.3bn, and that with the EC was Dollars 7.9bn. In December, Japan's exports of electrical machinery rose 11 per cent and precision instrument exports increased 11 per cent, while machinery imports fell 14.8 per cent on the same month in 1990 and materials imports were down 7.6 per cent, partly due to a sharp fall in new construction orders late last year.</p>

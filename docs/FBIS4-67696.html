			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "A Dream Frustrated"; first paragraph is editorial </F> introduction]    [Text] Motivated by poor economic prospects, many  Ecuadorans have traveled to foreign countries to make more  money. However, the AIDS epidemic caught them there.    Since 1984 30 persons have died from Acquired Immune  Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the Province of Azuay. The first  person in this series of deaths was an emigrant who returned  from the United States with this deadly disease.    About 20 persons having the HIV virus are being cared for at  home or in health centers in Cuenca. Statistics add an  additional 50 AIDS patients over the past decade in the Province  of Azuay.    Of this total 10 persons were infected with the virus in  foreign countries, while the remaining 40 caught the disease in  Ecuador. This reveals the growing danger of the epidemic.    Oswaldo Munoz, chief of the Department of Epidemiology in  the  Directorate of Health of the Province of Azuay and professor of  health at the University of Cuenca, considers that the Province  of Azuay is one of the areas where the incidence of AIDS is a  cause for concern, although the situation is less serious than  in the Provinces of Guayas, Pichincha, and Manabi.    Munoz said that about 90 percent of those who have died from  AIDS or suffer from the disease are men, which is explained by  the fact that sexual promiscuity is more frequent among men than  among women.    Although the Ministry of Health requires doctors to report  cases of AIDS in a special way, it is impossible to be sure that  the available, official information covers all of those  suffering from the disease. However, it probably covers the  majority of them.    The Department of Epidemiology of the Directorate of Health  of the Province of Azuay has personnel and an office exclusively  devoted to following the AIDS situation. It even holds workshops  and distributes reading material with instructions on how to  prevent this disease which has so far turned out to be incurable.    Munoz recalls that there is no vaccination or treatment for  AIDS and recommends taking the only two valid precautions for  preventing what is called the disease of the century: sexual  fidelity and the use of condoms in extramarital intercourse.    Professor Munoz is the author of a guide for family  self-instruction on AIDS, a book published by the Ministry of  Health under the auspices of the World Health Organization and  the Pan American Health Organization. The book contains basic  information on the epidemic, its symptoms, and the population  most at risk of contracting the disease, among other aspects.    The persons suffering from AIDS who have been identified in  the Province of Azuay belong to a number of social and economic  groups, which proves that AIDS is a disease which is not limited  to any special sector of society. Rather, it attacks all groups,  without distinction.    A high percentage of those infected are people who have  traveled abroad in search of a better personal situation,  particularly for economic reasons.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MICHAEL SHAWN DIES; CHOREOGRAPHER  </P> <P> Michael Shawn, a leading Broadway choreographer who sued the producers of "Legs  Diamond" claiming that they fired him because he had AIDS, has died at age 45  of complications from the disease, hospital officials said today.  </P> <P> Shawn learned that he was infected with the AIDS virus in late 1987 shortly  before he became the choreographer for "Legs Diamond." He was dismissed from  his job and sued the producers for $2.75 million in a case that many thought at  the time could provide a legal precedent for AIDS discrimination cases. But the  case was settled out of court.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Must Hurry and Resolve Mutual </F> Discontents"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to  Japan and met with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, and Defense Agency Director-General Kazuo  Aichi. For the prime minister, it was his first Japan-U.S.  meeting following the failure of the summit meeting in February.    The secretary of state complained strongly about the huge  trade surplus and current-account surplus of Japan, but the  meeting failed to bring out any clues on resolving the  situation. The Japanese Government is said to be set to  announce market liberalization measures, such as additional  deregulations, by the end of this month, but it remains unclear  whether Prime Minister Hosokawa can come up with market  liberalization measures or surplus reduction measures that are  bold enough.    The recent Japan-U.S. meetings once again confirmed that  Japan- U.S. relations are the "most important bilateral  relations in the world" and that the Japan-U.S. security system  is "indispensable for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific  region in the post-Cold War era."    In spite of this, the trend of mutual distrust and  discontent  between the governments and the peoples of the two nations is  only growing. This situation is undesirable for the future of  Japan-U.S. relations. Both Japan and the United States urgently  need to recognize that their relationship is such that each  nation is becoming more dependent on the other, and that active  efforts must be taken to prevent mistrust from growing and to  expand mutual relations.    Secretary Christopher compared Japan-U.S. relations to a  three- legged stool. He said that two legs of the stool --  security cooperation and global-scale cooperation -- are very  sturdy, but the remaining leg -- cooperation in economic and  trade areas -- is very unstable.    The irritation of the United States stems from the fact that  while Japan's trade and current-account surpluses are not  decreasing at all, the nation has not been able to produce any  concrete measures toward market liberalization. Apparently,  U.S. President Bill Clinton has settled on a policy of getting  tough with Japan, in order to deal with the protectionist moves  arising in Congress with by-elections coming in the fall.  Public opinion polls in the United States are also said to show  that there are growing numbers of people who think "Japan is  unfair."    On the other hand, Japan is irritated as well. This is a  reaction to the unilateral revival of the Super 301 provision  (which defines unfair trade practices and enables sanctions to  be taken against nations engaged in such practices) of the U.S.  Trade Act, as well as to a brutal policy which states that "only  results matter." People in Japan complain, "Japan may be called  an economic power, but we are not living a high-quality,  abundant life."    It is necessary that the leaders of Japan and the United  States do all they can to resolve the economic frictions to  prevent the disturbances among the two nations from developing  into emotional confrontations. In particular, Japan, which is  criticized by all of the industrialized nations as a country  with an overly large current-account surplus, should come up  with mid- and long-term endeavor targets for reduction of the  surplus on its own without delay.    In security and global-scale cooperation areas, there have  been visible achievements. In the meeting of the Japan-U.S.  Committee for Consultations on Security, which for the first  time was held at the cabinet ministerial-level, there were  agreements on cooperation with respect to the suspected nuclear  arms program of the DPRK, and on preventing the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.    In fact, as regards global-scale cooperation, Japan's  initiatives are highly appreciated. It is not so well known  that at the Japan- U.S. summit in February, Japan promised to  provide about $3 billion in funds for world population and AIDS  control programs which are being undertaken jointly by Japan and  the United States.    What is needed is for Japan and the United States to think  and act coolly. As for Japan, what is important for it to do is  to say things which need to be said to the United States, but at  the same time to go ahead on its own and do what it should do.  That will certainly lead to a deepening of trust between the  two countries.</p>

The  Helsinki report refutes the claims of the Macedonian authorities  that the government's policies have resulted in improving  relations between the different nationalities in the country.  The report declares that the policies of the present Government  of Macedonia to promote better relations among different  nationalities is essentially the same as those of the previous  governments of the country.    The present government, in fact, has done nothing to improve  the position of the Albanians, who make up 40 percent of the  population, according to a statement by the Democratic Popular  Party with headquarters in Tetove. Observers agree that the  future of Macedonia will depend on harmonious relations between  the Albanian and the Slav Macedonian populations. One of the  most important requests of the ethnic Albanians is for a census,  which has been the subject of a heated debate in the Macedonian  parliament.    The Albanian deputies have supported the request of the  European census commission experts, that all nationalities in  the republic be represented on the national and communal  commissions which will carry out the census.</p>

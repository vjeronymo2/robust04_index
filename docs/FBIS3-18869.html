Yesterday, Judge Thierry Jean-Pierre, who on 3  December was entrusted with the organized crime issue, submitted  his initial proposals to the Justice Ministry for carrying out  "operation criminal networks."    Thierry Jean-Pierre feels that "France is behind in the  fight  because there is no Mafia phenomenon proper, as is the case in  Italy. The problem here is that information does not circulate  well and is neither confirmed nor analyzed." In his "progress  report" submitted to the ministry late last week, the judge  advocates setting up 11 jurisdictions specializing in matters of  major financial criminality -- suspect dealings, corruption,  moneylaundering, misuse of company property -- organized into  networks, like the Mafia. The cities in question would be  Paris, Versailles, Lille, Rennes, Toulouse, Bordeaux,  Montpellier, Marseilles, Lyons, Strasbourg, and Orleans.    He also suggests creating a "Organized Crime Suppression  Squad" (BRREC) comprising policemen, gendarmes, and customs  officers which would carry out investigations on the basis of  "one team, one objective, one budget." In addition, he feels  that all intelligence could be centralized in a "Crime Research  and Investigation Department" (DEESC).    Lastly, the judge puts forward the idea of being able to  reverse the burden of proof, an audacious move in French law.  Someone with a dubious fortune would have to prove the legal  origin of the funds, whereas at present it is the justice system  that has to prove that they were illegally earned. "But this  idea is just a proposal," Thierry Jean-Pierre assured.    Thierry Jean-Pierre estimates that the whole system will  need  a budget of 20 million francs [Fr]. "That is not much," he  concludes, "in view of the Fr20 billion in sales made through  narcotics trafficking in France."    Several organizations are already in place for fighting  financial criminality. Yesterday, the judge refused to go into  the delicate matter of whether these would be kept in place.  Nevertheless, his report is particularly harsh on one of them,  the Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption (SCPC),  which was set up in January 1993 when Michel Vauzelle was  minister of justice. The SCPC's current secretary general,  Pierre-Antoine Lorenzi, was Mr. Vauzelle's head of staff. In  December, Mr. Lorenzi publicly questioned the appointment of the  "paradox" Thierry Jean-Pierre. Reliable sources say that the  judge concluded his report, in substance, by saying that the  SCPC "is operating in an illegal manner by carrying out  investigations without being entitled to do so and by keeping  the results for itself instead of forwarding them to the public  prosecutor's office."    On the other hand, the judge is said to feel that the  Central  Office for the Suppression of Major Financial Criminality  (OCRGDF) must be maintained, as well as the AntiMafia  Intelligence Unit (URCRAM), both of which are answerable to the  Interior Ministry. The Finance Ministry's TRACFIN [group  specializing in intelligence and operations against underground  financial networks], however, could be incorporated into the  DEESC.    Thierry Jean-Pierre plans to hand in a second interim report  in June, and the final report in September, so that any bill  that might arise from it could be put on the agenda of the fall  session of Parliament.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN: THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME;  </P> <P> HARD-EDGED MINIMALISM MAKES WAY FOR FURNITURE IN UNDULATING FORMS AND BAROQUE  FABRICS -- AN ART NOUVEAU FOR THE 1990S  </P> <P> TODAY'S NEWEST FURNITURE ripples and rolls with soft, undulating profiles: wavy  sofa backs, wiggly-legged tables and crescent-shaped chairs. It's a signal that  the hard-edged minimalism that has reigned over interior design for the past  three decades is tentatively giving way to curvilinear forms not seen since art  nouveau flourished at the last turn-of-the-century.  </P> <P> This new furniture is emerging worldwide, but Southern California designers are  in the vanguard of the movement. Jill Sharp-Miller's Sexy Bunny love seat, with  its shimmering fabric and rounded silhouette, epitomizes the free-form style  that looks to the future while borrowing heavily from the past. The recamier  base and horn-shaped legs are retro touches, but with a lighthearted, Space Age  twist. Says Sharp-Miller: "I want people to come home to a sofa that makes them  smile."  </P> <P> Larry Totah, whose small, visionary line has been on the market for three  years, believes that "furniture in the '90s is warming up. The form is more  sumptuous. People want something more romantic, more inviting to sit in." The  undulating contours of his Cake Sofa and Jack Chair recall the work of  Barcelona-based, art nouveau architect Antonio Gaudi. On the international  scene, French designers Andree Putman and Philippe Starck are introducing  baroque -- that is, curvaceous and decorative -- elements into their work.  "It's something we would both not have done five years ago," Putman says.  </P> <P>  Marie Christine Dorner, a French designer whose work is prominently displayed  at the Massini showroom in the Pacific Design Center, decries "the tough,  hard-shaped furniture" of the recent past and instead produces designs  reminiscent of art nouveau. In describing her lyrical furniture, she says:  "Nature is not geometric. When you see a tree or rock, the lines are not  straight. I create unusual asymmetrical forms that are not easily understood;  they are like the forms in a dream."  </P> <P> The Ballroom location courtesy of Peter Blazey; Sexy Bunny love seat courtesy  of People, Los Angeles.  </P></p>

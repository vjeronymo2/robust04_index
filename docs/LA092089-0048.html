			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLIST KILLED IN WRONG-WAY FREEWAY COLLISION  </P> <P> A motorcyclist was killed when he was struck by a car driven by a drunk driver  the wrong way on the Golden State Freeway in Santa Clarita, the California  Highway Patrol reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> The accident occurred at 10 p.m. Monday in the northbound lanes of the freeway,  just north of the Magic Mountain Parkway exit, the CHP said. The dead man had  not been identified by investigators. The driver of the car and another  motorcyclist were slightly injured.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Mark Fessia said a car driven by Scott T. Fedunak, 22, of Van Nuys,  spun out on the rain-slicked freeway and blocked two northbound lanes.  </P> <P> Fred Ferdon, 51, of Castaic, driving north on his motorcycle, put the cycle  into a slide to avoid hitting Fedunak's car. He was slightly injured.  </P> <P> Fessia said that Fedunak then backed his car up and started driving south on  the northbound lanes. A short distance from the first accident he struck  another motorcycle head-on.  </P> <P> "Witnesses said the motorcycle appeared to explode on impact," Fessia said.  "The rider was ejected" and killed.  </P> <P> The second accident left Fedunak with minor injuries. He and Ferdon were  treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. Fedunak was  arrested for felony drunk driving and was being held at Los Angeles County jail  in lieu of $2,500 bail.  </P> <P> Fessia said an investigation is continuing and Fedunak could face a  manslaughter charge.  </P></p>

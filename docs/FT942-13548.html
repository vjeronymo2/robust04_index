			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / South African Elections: Apartheid architects break the mould - National Party Tumultuous applause greeted President FW de Klerk, hand-in-hand with his wife, as he stepped out on the podium of Cape Town's Good Hope Centre for the last rally of the National party's remarkable campaign. It was the state president's final appearance in a campaign in which there has been a transformation in the NP's image. The party synonymous with apartheid is now selling itself to voters as the 'new National party,' acutely aware it has to break out of its ethnic mould and make inroads into the black, Indian and coloured (mixed race) constituencies if it is to shape and direct the affairs of South Africa in the years to come. A shrewd advertising campaign, running full page profiles of black teachers, clerks and other professionals who have openly declared their support for the party with the text playing on fears of violence and intimidation, has helped win over some black voters. Whether the impact will be anything more than marginal in an election in which there is probably only a small pool of 'floating voters' remains to be seen. But the country's millions of coloured voters, most of whom live in Cape Town and the surrounding region, are another matter. Conservative, fearful of an ANC hegemony, anxious about the impact on jobs and housing of the massive influx of black work seekers into the Cape since influx controls were dropped, the majority appear to have been won over to the NP cause. The genuine warmth of the reception from the 9,000-strong crowd packed into the auditorium this weekend was poignant. The audience was predominantly coloured, the creation of union between white and black over the last three centuries. But the leader of the once exlusively white party that disenfranchised them was taken back into the fold. 'I want to pay tribute to you who have been prepared to forgive what has happened in the past, who have been prepared to open your hearts and your arms for me and made me feel safe in those arms,' said Mr de Klerk, visibly moved. What the National party stands for, Mr de Klerk tells this and other rallies around the country, are family values, law and order, Christian ethics, sound, market-driven economic policies, and hard work. Hendrik Verwoerd, prime minister in the 1960s and high priest of apartheid, must be turning in his grave.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BRANDO'S DAUGHTER LEAVES U.S., WON'T TESTIFY AGAINST BROTHER  </P> <P> Marlon Brando's daughter Cheyenne has left the country and will refuse to  return to testify against her brother Christian, a prosecutor said today.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Steven Barshop told a judge he will attempt to use the recently enacted  Proposition 115 to introduce Cheyenne Brando's statements to police as evidence  in a preliminary hearing for the brother, who is charged with murdering  Cheyenne's boyfriend.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge Rosemary Shumsky set Brando's preliminary hearing for  July 23 but did not rule on the Proposition 115 issue because the matter is  being transferred to another judge.  </P> <P> Under the initiative, approved June 5, prosecutors may present hearsay evidence  at the hearing in which a judge determines whether there is sufficient evidence  to hold a defendant for trial.  </P> <P> Barshop said Cheyenne Brando, who is eight months pregnant with the child of  her dead boyfriend, Dag Drollet, has gone to Tahiti and refuses to return.  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Price-protest miners vote to stay out Australian coalminers, on strike since Sunday to protest at lower coal export prices, have voted to stay out until Friday, Reuter reports from Sydney. Those attending a rally in Canberra demanded an inquiry into negotiations between Australian coal companies and Japanese buyers. A deal covering Australian coking coal reached in January resulted in price cuts of 8-9.5 per cent for the year starting April 1. The miners, who say the cuts will lead to fewer jobs and mine closures, repeated their demand for a national coal-marketing authority to negotiate prices with Japanese buyers. Companies say that would be tantamount to nationalisation. The miners vowed to strike indefinitely if employers took disciplinary action. Mr John Maitland, miners' union president, will meet Prime Minister Paul Keating today to discuss the miners' case.</p>

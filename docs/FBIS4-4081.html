			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman from the provincial statistics bureau  briefed news units yesterday afternoon on Hubei's economic  situation in the first quarter of 1994 and made suggestions for  promoting the province's economic development. He said: On the  whole, our province's economy operated normally in the first  quarter of the year, and was characterized mainly by the  following facts: spring plowing got off to a good start;  production of grain and edible oil was stable; industrial  production maintained a momentum of comparatively rapid growth;  fueled by key construction projects, fixed-asset investment  increased quite rapidly; the consumer goods market grew  steadily; the financial situation was fairly stable; money  lending was put under strict control; and in foreign trade, the  volume of exports was higher than in the same period last year.    With regard to the problems cropping up in current economic  operation, the spokesman said: The chief reasons are that  commodity prices have climbed continuously; state-owned  enterprises have been beset with difficulties in production and  operation; and a relatively great number of enterprises has  partially or completely suspended production.    The provincial statistics bureau suggested that to promote  the development of the province's national economy and attain  the goals set by the provincial party committee for this year:    1. It is necessary to develop markets, maintain rapid and  effective economic growth, closely follow market changes and  developments, do a good job in readjusting the product mix by  gearing to market demand, organize production by centering on  the market, make greater efforts to promote sales, and ensure  that production is linked with sales and that the economy  develops rapidly and effectively.    2. It is necessary to strengthen price supervision and  inspection, and to curb excessively rapid price increases.  Apart from strengthening price supervision and inspection,  establishing a system under which goods are sold at the prices  marked, and maintaining a normal price order, the province  should focus on increasing residents' income, properly  developing production of agricultural means of production and  the Shopping Basket Project, and should ensure a stable supply  of basic daily-use consumer goods so as the boost residents'  capability to withstand the strains resulting from price reform.    3. It is necessary to revitalize state-owned enterprises and  energetically help them get out of the present depressing  situation. For this purpose: 1) We should focus our efforts on  alleviating the problem of fund strains among enterprises,  ensure the supply of enterprise production funds, and establish  a normal production and operation order; 2) In order to create  favorable conditions for state-owned enterprises to develop, we  should study and solve the problem of essentially increased tax  burdens resulting from the policy of regulating tax reductions  and exemptions which was implemented among enterprises following  the introduction of tax reform.    4. It is necessary to make great efforts to help loss-making  enterprises turn losses into profits, and help enterprises that  have partially or completely suspended production to increase  their ability to overcome adversity through greater production;  gradually to accumulate experience by conducting experiments in  selling and leasing small enterprises, and introducing the  reform of allowing state-owned enterprises to be run by the  non-governmental sector; and to improve operational regulations  so as to deepen enterprise reform.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chez Gerard completes Scotts buy Groupe Chez Gerard, the restaurant company, yesterday completed its first acquisition since flotation last March, paying Pounds 380,000 for Scotts Restaurant in Mayfair. Scotts, which specialises in shellfish and seafood, has just under 200 covers across 7,500 sq ft, making it the biggest restaurant in the group. Mr Neville Abraham, chairman, said the purchase was in line with the group's declared strategy of investing in restaurants in central London. It would be funded from the Pounds 3m raised by the flotation for acquisitions. Mr Abraham added that the group was looking for further expansion. The flotation at 112 1/2 p gave the group a market capitalisation of Pounds 21m. The shares closed down 3p yesterday at 98p.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Observer: The EMB's knees If a sense of being ill-treated in their former incarnations is a recipe for success, Pehr 'PG' Gyllenhammar and Hans-Jorg Rudloff should make a real go of their delightfully audacious ambitions to help build a new investment bank. Rudloff, an old friend of PG's, who sat with him on the advisory board of the EBRD, must be rather tempted to show up his former masters at Credit Suisse. Eighteen months ago they invited the Euromarkets supremo on to the board in Zurich to concentrate on 'strategy', a position which Rudloff quit in February. Meanwhile Gyllenhammar, undeterred by the raspberry with which his fellow Swedes greeted his scheme to merge Volvo with Renault, is confidently stressing the international credentials of the outfit which he is to chair. With the likes of Francois-Xavier Ortoli, a former French finance minister and EU commission president, and Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secretary, it will doubtless prove an interesting cross-cultural exercise. The European Merchant Bank, or however the London West End creature is eventually styled, is contemplating a market that is far from saturated. It will of course attract the envy of erstwhile colleagues strung up in the bureaucracy of established investment banks. So if Rudloff can be as tough with his cronies as he was with his CSFB staff, he and PG could just be back on the road.</p>

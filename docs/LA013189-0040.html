			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Pakistani government officials are said to be proposing a swap that would send  U.S.-made nuclear reactors to their country in exchange for safeguards to  assure that the country's nuclear program is used only for peaceful purposes.  Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asian  subcommittee, said such an agreement could head off a showdown later this year  on a cutoff of U.S. aid to Pakistan over its failure to comply with nuclear  non-proliferation requirements. "If the United States is willing to sell  nuclear reactors for peaceful nuclear energy, Pakistan would agree to establish  full-scope safeguards on all their nuclear facilities," said Solarz, who  recently visited Pakistan.  </P></p>

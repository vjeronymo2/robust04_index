			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Hostage to the dollar The agenda for this weekend's meeting of European finance ministers will doubtless include tactics for the run-up to the French referendum on Maastricht. On yesterday's evidence, a clear strategy for supporting the dollar should be high on the list of priorities. A 4 pfennig plunge in the dollar following the release of dreadful US employment data undid most of the good work done by European governments earlier this week. If it was not already glaringly obvious, the episode illustrates the clear linkage between the weak dollar and strains within the ERM. The UK government may feel cheated: sterling closed at DM2.80, more comfortable than before its scheme for foreign currency funding was announced on Thursday, but 2 pfennigs below a high point reached earlier in the day. The mood in Italy will be worse. The lira remains pinned to its floor within the ERM despite a 1 3/4 per cent rise in the discount rate. A deeper message from the sharp fall in US employment is that the dollar will get scant support from an early domestic economic recovery. A further widening of the differential between US and German interest rates yesterday hardly points to quick relief. If that were not enough to keep the pressure on, another set of German money supply data and another Bundesbank council meeting must be negotiated before France goes to the polls.</p>

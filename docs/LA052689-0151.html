			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION TRACK AND FIELD MASTERS MEET;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO'S FAGER WANTS TO SURPASS ANY BARRIERS STILL IN HER WAY  </P> <P> Lisa Fager of Mission Viejo High School stands 90 feet away from her launch  site, staring down a narrow tartan runway.  </P> <P> In her mind's eye she sees her run-up step for step. She sees her perfect  running form, hair blowing in the wind, as she picks up speed.  </P> <P> She reaches her first mark and hops off her right foot, trying to propel her  lean 5-foot-10 frame up and out, farther down the runway. She starts to head  back to earth. She hits perfectly on her right heel for the skip, trying to  keep her momentum going forward, always forward.  </P> <P> Now she bounds to her left foot, something she has done again and again in  practice. Finally, the sand pit, her target, is in sight. One last jump and she  flings herself into the pit.  </P> <P> In her mind's eye, she has triple jumped 40 feet. It's always the case. At  least until she actually clears that elusive 40-foot barrier.  </P> <P> Then it will be a new target. Maybe 40-6 or 41 feet. For now it's 40 feet. And  it has been that way ever since Fager broke her last elusive goal with a jump  of 39-11 1/2.  </P> <P> Fager, a junior, broke the Orange County girls' triple-jump record with that  leap at the county girls' track and field championship in April. It was a mark  that drove her -- sometimes to distraction -- ever since she jumped a personal  best 39-4 at the same meet a year earlier. She went on to place seventh in the  state meet.  </P> <P> She just had to better the record of 39-8 1/4, set by Debbie Orr of Ocean View  in 1986.  </P> <P> She'll try to again qualify for the state meet, and break the 40-foot barrier  in the process, at the Masters Meet at 6:30 tonight at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Fager also will be high jumping tonight. She won the 4-A title last week at the  Southern Section championship meet with a jump of 5-4. Fager also hopes to  qualify in the high jump, but it's the triple jump that has her full attention.  </P> <P> She tried a number of events when she first tried track and field as an eighth  grader competing for a Mission Viejo-based age-group club called Time Machine.  </P> <P> Fager played soccer and softball but neither held her interest. So she gave  track and field a shot.  </P> <P> She tried the long jump. Nah.  </P> <P> High jump? Too nerve wracking.  </P> <P> Sprints? Uh, not fast enough.  </P> <P> Triple jump? She tried it and fell for it in a big way.  </P> <P> "The first time I did it I was doing it on the grass, getting my steps down,"  Fager said. "And I tripped and fell on my face."  </P> <P> She got up, brushed herself off and mastered the event not long after. She went  32-6 "or something like that" as an eighth grader and began to improve by leaps  and bounds.  </P> <P> As a freshman at Mission Viejo, she qualified for the state meet, but did not  advance to the final. That showed her potential in the event, though.  </P> <P> So she and John Hattrup, Mission Viejo's jumps coach, worked diligently on  improving her speed and perfecting her technique during the off-season.  </P> <P> "You look at who she's jumping against and if it was just a race, she'd get  beat every time," Hattrup said.  </P> <P> But that hard work -- including endless sessions of jumping over milk crates to  improve her spring -- has helped compensate for her lack of blazing speed on  the runway.  </P> <P> Fager's best last week was 39-7 1/2, good for second place in the 4-A behind  Hesperia's Krystal Kirkland, who jumped 39-11. Kirkland, and Walnut's Juliana  Yendork, who has the best jump in the nation this year (41-9 1/2), will be  Fager's toughest competition tonight.  </P> <P> They aren't the only ones, however.  </P> <P> "She's her toughest critic," Hattrup said. "Sometimes she doesn't understand  that Bob Beamon (the world record holder in the long jump) didn't jump 29 feet  everyday. Forty feet, that's all we hear about. If she doesn't jump 40 feet  it's not a good jump."  </P> <P> Masters Meet Notes  </P> <P> Tonight's meet begins at 6:30. The top five finishers in each event qualify for  the state meet next Friday and Saturday at Cerritos College. Here's a look at  some of the 44 Orange County athletes, not including relay team members,  competing tonight.  </P> <P> Boys:  </P> <P> Sprints -- Tim Martin, a sophomore from San Clemente, ran 10.61 in the 100  meters at the 4-A prelims, the third-fastest time ever by a county runner.  Curtis Conway of Hawthorne, who won the 100 and 200 at the 4-A finals last  week, is favored.  </P> <P> Distances -- In the 800, Doug Nichols of Edison ran a personal best of 1:52.15  last week, the second-fastest qualifying mark. In the 1,600, Eddie Lavelle and  Greg Shryock of Corona del Mar, Mike Nielsen of Mater Dei and Neil Stevenson of  Capistrano Valley will compete. In the 3,200, Nielsen and Jimmy Rodriguez of  Santa Ana Valley will challenge Bryan Dameworth of Agoura and Mike Williamson  of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Field events -- Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia competes in the long and  triple jumps. Charles Cummings and Vince Chuck of Kennedy and Tony Robinson of  San Clemente also are entered in the triple jump. In the pole vault, Eric  Whitcomb of Valencia is the county's top entrant. In the shotput, Esperanza's  Chuck Underwood won the 3-A title and has the third longest put among the  qualifiers (56-9 1/4).  </P> <P> Girls:  </P> <P> Sprints -- In the 400, Shelly Tochluk of Westminster and Don'yelle Norris, a  freshman at Mission Viejo, qualified.  </P> <P> Distances -- Shelley Taylor, a freshman at Edison, won the 4-A 800 and 1,600  last week. She won the 800 in 2:15.33 and the 1,600 in 5:05.10. Kim Toney of  Atascadero has the fastest time going into the 800 (2:12.65). Karen Hecox of  South Hills is fastest in the 1,600 (4:53.90).  </P> <P> Field events -- In the high jump, Lori Svoboda of El Dorado went 5-10 to win  the 3-A title last week and will be the favorite tonight. Beth Byron of Villa  Park was second to Svoboda with a 5-5 jump. Lisa Fager of Mission Viejo won the  4-A in 5-4. Elizabeth Bauer of Foothill also cleared 5-4. In the long jump,  Allison Franke of Canyon, Brenda Robinson of Santa Ana Valley, Allison Axtell  of Mission Viejo and Melissa McDonald of Mater Dei are entered.

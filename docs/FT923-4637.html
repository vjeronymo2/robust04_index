			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Poll shows French swing back to European union THE French government's campaign for a vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty regained ground yesterday with an opinion poll showing a significant swing in favour of European union. The poll, conducted by the CSA institute, showed a 55 per cent majority would vote for the treaty in the referendum on September 20, the biggest margin for several weeks. This followed a marathon television appearance by President Francois Mitterrand on Thursday during which he faced questions from a panel of French citizens, journalists and Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist former government minister who has led the No campaign. Mr Mitterrand's performance was praised by his socialist supporters but also criticised as uninspiring by some pro-Maastricht campaigners in the opposition right wing. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, president of the National Assembly, said: 'The Yes won some points yesterday evening. I am quite confident that the French will vote yes. There will be a big percentage for the No vote but . . . all the big historic decisions for our country have always been taken by a small majority.' Among the political opposition, Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, deputy secretary of the Gaullist RPR, and a campaigner for European union, said Mr Mitterrand came over as 'sympathetic' but 'lacked inspiration'. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who has threatened to resign in the event of a French No, praised Mr Mitterrand's performance. He said he was confident the treaty would be approved and that Mr Mitterrand had been in 'top form' during the debate with Mr Seguin. Mr Delors said he would be satisfied with a narrow victory in the referendum. Dismissing fears that a close result in traditionally pro-European France would leave a question mark over the treaty, Mr Delors told French radio: 'Fifty-two per cent is OK.' In his television appearance, Mr Mitterrand sought to persuade an estimated 8.3m viewers that French sovereignty would remain intact if the treaty were ratified and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be under firmer control of member states' elected representatives. He stood up competently to questioning. The surprise emergence of a majority against the treaty in polls in the second half of August had already started to move back to a narrow majority in favour in more recent surveys, before last night's poll. Yesterday's swing leaves the pro-Maastricht majority a long way short of the nearly 70 per cent that prevailed when the referendum was called in early June. Twelve polls are due to be published next week, before polling is forbidden in the final week of campaigning. Treaty makes best-seller Page 2 High marks for Mitterrand show Page 6</p>

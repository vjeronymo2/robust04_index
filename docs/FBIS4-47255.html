			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Smirnov, IZVESTIYA correspondent: ``How Yu. </F> A. Izrael Was Elected an Academician''; the first paragraph is  an introduction]    [Text] At the last General Meeting of the Russian Academy  of Sciences, by 230 votes ``yea,'' 88 votes ``nay,'' with 14  ballot papers deemed to be invalid, Yuriy Antoniyevich Izrael  was elected a Russian academician. The election did not go off  smoothly. The stumbling block was the behavior of Yu. A. Izrael  during the Chernobyl catastrophe. He then headed the USSR State  Committee for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring  (Goskomgidromet; Gidromet]. Here are several fragments of the  stenographic record of the discussion (the shorthand record is  incorrect, but the essence of the accusations and the  counterarguments is conveyed rather precisely).  I know not about the number of new writings by Izrael, nor about  his expeditions; I can look that up for myself. I would like to  know the number of victims, the number of unfortunate there were  due to the Chernobyl catastrophe, and after that, how Izrael  concealed the true character of the radiation and the first days  when no one visualized what this involved. Approximately how  many of these victims were there, surely, at least what was the  order of magnitude, the scale of the criminality?"    Academician S. T. Belyayev: ``The basis for taking  the necessary measures after the Chernobyl accident should have  been the numerous data on radiation conditions from different  departments. Those data from the Goskomgidromet warrant the  highest evaluation. The reliability and trustworthiness of the  information collected by it were later checked by various  international organizations and intercalibrations were carried  out. The yearlong work of the enormous body of specialists of  the international project of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, which did not find any serious flaws in the data  presented by Gidromet, is known to everyone.    Now about the role of Yuriy Antoniyevich himself. He relied  only on scientifically dependable information, not giving in to  any pressure on the part of the administrative and political  agencies, which initially was especially strong.    With respect to the information which was suppressed, that  is, what was not published in the newspapers, that is not  Izrael's fault. That he insistently required the dissemination  of all information to the local agencies which were responsible  for all measures carried out on the spot, I myself was a witness  to that. You know that the Chernobyl problem was closely  intertwined in all political problems and ambitions, a situation  which also is continuing to this time.    Here it was necessary display firmness and persistence based  on scientific information and not yield to pressure from any  other groups which were whipped up into a frenzy. And from what  were there more victims later on: from the mass stress to which  an enormous number of people was subjected, or from the specific  radiation situation which actually prevailed?    "I think that I can speak of this because I observed Yuriy  Antoniyevich during the course of all these events. And after  1986 I was first a deputy of Anatoliy Petrovich [Academician A.  P. Aleksandrov -- editor's explanation], who headed the  Interdepartmental Coordination Council of the Academy of  Sciences, responsible for all the scientific problems related to  Chernobyl. An enormous number of nonprofessional organizations  were involved in all kinds of measurements. And in each case it  was necessary to analyze the methodological errors. All this  work also was organized by Gidromet; there was a scientific  council which examined all the measurements, all the data which  were collected by all organizations whatsoever. And such data  were never released until the reasons for discrepancies were  clarified.    That's all that I want to say: the merits of Yuriy  Antoniyevich as an administrator, as a scientist at the time of  the Chernobyl accident, were manifested very clearly, as was  noted, among others, by many international organizations.''    Academician V. L. Maslov: ``I asked a specific  question: what were the numbers, what was the scale? With  respect to whether Izrael was involved in the misinformation, I  did not ask that question. I know the answer to it. I also was  engaged in the liquidation of the Chernobyl accident.    But I think that everyone saw Izrael on television when he  gave the people incorrect radiation information. That the  Gidromet did a good job, I know very well; I also know that it  gave correct information. I say only that the people were given  (and everyone knows this) incorrect information. I saw a  videofilm, I saw how the children ran and looked at the fire  there, in Chernobyl. I saw a pregnant woman who pushed a small  child in a wheelbarrow, rather than in a carriage. But what was  of importance to me was: what was the scale?''    Next several of our respected academicians spoke out in  defense of Yu. A. Izrael. There was mention of the first press  conference on Chernobyl on 5 May 1986 where Shcherbina, citing  Izrael, gave low figures on radioactivity. These were precise  data, but applying to regions in a 30- km radius from the  accident site. However, Shcherbina was silent that the  Goskomgidromet also gave precise nuclear power plant figures for  Pripyat.    In the opinion of the academicians, Izrael could not then  publicly refute the accusations that he concealed information  because until May 1989 all precise data on Chernobyl were kept  under the strictest secrecy. But at the first opportunity he  published his charts, prepared in 1986-1987. The verification  commission of the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed  his data. One of the international scientific centers awarded  Izrael a gold medal with the inscription: ``For Chernobyl.''  Then he was awarded prizes by the UN and the International  Meteorological Organization.    Conclusion: the guilt of the designers, the guilt of the  government, three years concealing the true data about  Chernobyl, cannot be shifted to Yu. A. Izrael, who from the very  first day gave precise data on the scale of the catastrophe.    From the hall: ``A question, please, for Yuriy  Antoniyevich relative to the discussion which arose. I fully  trust those data which were presented here. But I have a  question: why then did Yuriy Antoniyevich, at that time knowing  that falsified data were being given in contradiction to the  information which he gave, not resign from his position?''    Yu. A. Izrael: ``No one forced me to present any  incorrect data or to falsify them. As proof I can say that  Mikhail Sergeyevich (M. S. Gorbachev -- editor's explanation)  and Gromyko at a Politburo session asked me questions like: what  is a `curie,' what is a `roentgen per hour'? Do you think that  people with such a scientific background can force any  particular figures to be given? Such people cannot give such and  such a figure, you understand?    All the solid information was given to the leadership --  higher and local. Unfortunately, really, the matter of  publication widely in the newspapers could not be solved by me,  but we supplied objective information. I flew directly through  the Belarus and Ukrainian countryside and in those regions which  had been subjected to the greatest pollution I personally  explained to the people why they had to leave their native  villages. Many of them did not want to depart, they even shot  back, can you imagine that?    I did not receive and we did not receive even a single  professional negative comment with respect to our data.    With respect to the question which was posed last, I must  once again assert that my task was to pass on all the data,  insofar as they were objective, to those people who had need for  them. These were the people who suffered from the pollution and  those who made decisions.    We do not have such a book, but in France a book has now  been  published under the name ``The Chernobyl Incident: A War of  Rumors.'' On this question there are so many different,  generally inadequately checked rumors which sometimes result in  a complete distortion of the physical truth.    I emphasize once again that I am answering and am ready to  answer to any commission for the correctness of the cited data,  for the fact that our team and I personally did everything for  this information to reach the people. And I give my word of  honor to all present that my conscience is clear.''    It is the business of scientists to argue about the accuracy  of scientific data. It is the business of politicians and  philosophers to argue about the degree of guilt of an individual  under conditions of absolute state authority. However, there are  questions which go beyond these limits. Chernobyl remains  painful and troublesome in the conscience of each of us, all the  people and the country. And therefore it is too early to  consider the doubts expressed at the general meeting to be the  last word.    In actuality, what can a specialist do who knows the truth  under conditions of total censorship? But today, when the letter  of P. L. Kapitsa has been made public, both in defense of the  arrested L. D. Landau and against the suffocation of Baykal and  against other antihuman deeds of the supreme authority, the  question about resigning does not seem rhetorical. Who is a  scientist -- he is only a supplier of new knowledge or data or a  person whose conscience cannot be at peace with respect to what  will become of this knowledge, especially if it affects  everyone, whether it will be made available to the public or  will be turned into a state secret?    We had two principal secrets -- military and ecological. And  Yuriy Antoniyevich, having available the totality of the precise  ecological truth, faced with the impossibility of passing it on  to the people, did not protest and did not resign. He  beautifully went along with the government in covering up this  truth. Moreover, he took upon himself the role of an ecological  czar. Without the permission of his department the press was  given access to not a single document relative to the alarming  state of our environment, facts and figures were mercilessly  stricken out so as ``not to sow panic among the population.''    It is true that in speaking and writing about Chernobyl it  is  necessary to separate clearly the scientific facts from the  phantasmagoria of rumors and wild tales. But indeed the primary  source of the wild tales themselves was precisely the  concealment of the truth. One of the arguments was: if the truth  was told the number of victims -- from panic -- would be still  greater. How clever. In any case until now there has been no  direct and honest answer to the question posed by V. P. Maslov:  what is the price of concealing the truth when reference is to  what is most important: the life and health of man?</p>

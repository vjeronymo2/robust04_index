Arima said he would continue Oda's policy of  internationalization and outside evaluation. ``I'd like to  create a Riken open wide to universities,'' said Arima.    Arima rated highly the internationalism of RIKEN which  includes 200 foreign researchers. ``While pursuing  internationalization, I'd also like to put energy into  continuing the tradition of Drs. Shin'ichiro Asanaga and Hantaro  Nagaoka through exchange with universities.''    After Arima left the presidency of the University of Tokyo  in  March 1993, he returned to teaching as a professor at Hosei  University. Even after becoming RIKEN's director general, during  the school year he'll return to campus on Mondays to teach.    A report instigated by outgoing director Oda on the outside  evaluation of RIKEN by Nobel prize winners and others was  recently completed. It will be ``homework'' for Arima. ``I've  been fortunate enough to have Professor Oda make a plan for  improving the University of Tokyo's science faculty. I will take  Professor Oda's `homework' very seriously,'' promised Arima.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Unitas pre-tax loss deepens to FM2.7bn UNITAS, Finland's second-largest banking group, yesterday disclosed a FM2.7bn (Dollars 499.3m) pre-tax loss for 1992 and warned that it would record a heavy deficit this year. A tripling of credit losses to FM3.3bn from FM1.1bn was the main reason for the deterioration on the FM128m loss in 1991. The group's net income from financing operations shrank 17 per cent to FM1.89bn due to an increase in non-performing loans. At the year end, the group's non-performing loan portfolio stood at FM8.3bn, or 6.14 per cent of total loans outstanding, compared with FM5.7bn in 1991. There will be no dividend. Unitas, which is the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, drew some comfort from the fact that its loss was slightly lower than predicted at the eight-month stage, as it benefited from a drop in interest rates and a rise in equity prices over the last four months. It cut operating expenses during the year by FM185m, or 7 per cent. In spite of the overall loss the group's capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.1 per cent at the year end, compared with 10.3 per cent a year earlier. This reflected the impact of the group's August convertible bond issue and a FM1.7bn government preference capital injection. Unitas said its position should be strong enough for it to be able to get through 1993 without support from the government guarantee fund. However, it was looking at the possibility of raising new capital, possibly by launching a US preference share issue, and said it may seek a government guarantee for this. The group said its 1993 result would be 'heavily negative' because of the continuing Finnish recession. But there were some optimistic signs and the group was hoping its result would not deteriorate any further. 'The drop in interest rates will improve operating conditions and the unwinding of risks and losses relating to certain equity holdings last year will have a similar impact,' said Mr Vesa Vainio, Unitas chief executive. He added that the group could expect to benefit from cost-cutting.</p>

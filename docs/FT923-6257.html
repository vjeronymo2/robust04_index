			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Sumit declines sharply to Pounds 33,000 Sumit, which provides development and venture capital to unquoted companies, announced a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 111,000 to Pounds 33,000 in the half year to June 30. Net asset value per share at June 30 amounted to 92p (115p) or 97p (114p) fully diluted. After-tax profits declined to Pounds 22,000 (Pounds 77,000) for earnings per share of 0.3p (1.1p) and again there is no interim dividend. Mr Simon Sharp, chairman, said shareholders were aware of the change in ownership of the manager, Sumit Equity Ventures, and he believed the affiliation with Schroder Venture Advisers would enhance the quality of the dealflow.</p>

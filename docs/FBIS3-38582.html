			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Wagrowska from Brussels: "Partnership: The </F> Only Road to NATO" -- final paragraph unattributed]    [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak signed the so-called  Framework Document on Partnership for Peace [PFP] at NATO  Headquarters in Brussels yesterday. This means that Poland has  accepted formally the criteria which NATO set to the partner  states (clarity of defense planning and defense budgets,  democratic control over the Armed Forces, readiness to take part  in peacekeeping missions), as well as the principles of military  cooperation (such as training and exercises) and political  cooperation (consultations in the event of security threats).  The expact program of cooperation must still be negotiated.    Pawlak tried to persuade his interlocutors from NATO and the  European Union [EU] that, despite the cabinet change,  integration with the West still remains Poland's strategic goal.  "The Polish nation will not swerve from the road to West Europe  which it has chosen," he stressed.    Journalists' attention, however, was attracted to the fact  that, while delivering his speech before the European  Parliament, the prime minister omitted a sentence which was  included in the text that had been circulated beforehand. The  omitted sentence was as follows: "...the results of elections,  held in September of last year, did not in the least affect the  change in the perspective in which the government of the Polish  Republic sees its relations with the Union. The highest  possible quality of these relations is still the priority of  Polish politics...." The Government's Press Office explained  that this omission, just like other omissions in the prime  minister's speech, was caused by lack of time.    The prime minister pointed out in Brussels that cooperation  with West Europe favorably influences the internal  transformations in Poland. He is trying to advertise  Partnership for Development -- an idea proposed at the meeting  between leaders of the United States and the Visegrad states in  Prague (on 12 January).    In his speech to representatives of the 16 NATO states,  Prime  Minister Pawlak evaluated PFP as an opportunity to strengthen  ties with NATO. This opportunity should draw us closer to  Western security structures. "Poland wants to take advantage of  the Partnership to maintain good cooperation also with its  neighbors to the east," he added.    Amadeo de Francis, deputy secretary general of NATO (who  received the prime minister at NATO Headquarters since Manfred  Woerner was sick) said at a press conference that PFP will  enhance Poland's security. He did not rule out the possibility  that NATO may provide financial aid for the partner states to  facilitate their participation in the program.    Waldemar Pawlak expressed his disappointment over the fact  that the NATO summit (10-11 January in Brussels) did not meet  the expectations related to Poland's future membership in this  organization; however, he also said he was satisfied with the  fact that NATO sees relations between the security of member  states and the security of Central and East Europe.    In his talk with European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch  and in his speech to the deputies, the prime minister emphasized  that the treaty of association with the EC, which has just come  into effect, is treated by Poland as preparation for future  membership in the EU.    Egon Klepsch recalled, however, that the necessary  conditions  for admitting Poland and other East and Central European states  to EU are, among others, observance of pluralist democracy and  the introduction of free-market economies.    The subject discussed during the meeting of Waldemar Pawlak  and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luk Dehaene was Poland's  integration with West Europe.    Thirty-three percent of respondents to a Public Opinion  Research Center poll believe that PFP offers real chances for  Poland to enter NATO; 27 percent are of the opposite opinion.  The remaining people surveyed either do not know anything about  this subject, or do not have an opinion either way.</p>

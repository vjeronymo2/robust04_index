			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing obscure about this saga Sir, Your relatively obscure reviewer, Malcolm Rutherford, is misguided in applying that description to the magazine which Brian Redhead graced for 10 years (Books: 'The badger in his sett', September 10/11). In fact, Saga magazine sells considerably more copies per issue than the Financial Times. Paul Bach, editor, Saga Magazine, The Saga Building, Middelburg Square, Folkestone, Kent CT20 1AZ</p>

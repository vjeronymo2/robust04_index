			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Subsidies deal averts US sanctions The agreement on eliminating shipbuilding subsidies reached on Sunday follows five years of negotiations, chiefly at the insistence of the US. Two main issues that nearly scuppered the discussions earlier this year were hammered out at last week's talks: European objections to the US Jones Act, under which a fixed proportion of cargo passing through US ports must be carried in vessels built in US yards; and concern about South Korean plans to increase shipbuilding capacity by 40 per cent over five years. Mr Staffan Sohlman, the Swedish chairman of the OECD committee overseeing the talks, made clear that last week's meeting was 'make or break'. Under the agreement, the Jones Act stays in place but its scope is limited. France is still objecting to this part of the deal, although it could be overruled in a European Union vote. There is still some concern about capacity increases in the absence of subsidies, but other concerns helped to concentrate minds in the final days of the OECD talks: the US threats of unilateral action over subsidies, and the prospect that a trade war could follow. The Clinton administration made clear earlier this year it was ready to back legislation enabling penalties against subsidised vessels. The Gibbons bill before Congress would have authorised sanctions on subsidied foreign vessels entering US ports. It was realised that failure to secure agreement could threaten a ruinous price and subsidy war and remove any chance of controlling dumping. In these circumstances, retaliation could have brought about a wider trade war. Details of the agreement are still confidential until discussed in the EU Council of Ministers. However, the main points are: All subsidies, direct and indirect, except for research and development, will be banned from January 1 1996, when the agreement takes effect. Subsidies already granted will be permitted after the ban comes into effect, but limited to ships for which contracts are signed before the end of 1995 and which are delivered by the end of 1998. Some experts fear that this allowance may produce a last-minute subsidy rush. Export credits for ships are brought under the 'Helsinki rules', the disciplines already agreed in the OECD for the application of general export credits. Disputes procedures have been agreed, so that suspected breaches can be challenged judicially. A mechanism has been established to prevent 'injurious pricing', such as in cases of dumping. This was an important concession, especially by the Koreans and the Japanese, who had long resisted the idea. It will be enforced by disputes panels, similar to those in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which will have the power to award damages. The US has agreed to a cap of 250,000 gross tonnes annually on the capacity built under Jones Act provisions. If the US exceeds this ceiling, disputes procedures may be opened against it. Countries may provide domestic credits on terms equivalent to export credits. Talks were conducted within the OECD, rather than Gatt because the normal Gatt principles do not apply to ships, which technically are never imported. The agreement, which will be monitored, covers 75 per cent of world shipbuilding. The rest is carried out mainly by Russia, Ukraine, Poland, China and Brazil. Efforts will be made to extend the agreement to these countries. In Poland's case, the issue may be raised during its talks on planned membership of the OECD. Prospects for Russia, Ukraine and China appear less hopeful. However, the OECD participants plan wider talks on the industry with these countries in the next 12 months.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Spain poised to establish leading bank THE SPANISH government is in advanced negotiations to create the country's largest bank, with assets worth some Dollars 85bn, by pooling all of the state's financial institutions under a new holding company, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. Government officials describe the process as 'a very advanced idea, although not yet concrete'. The pool of public banks, as Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, has described it, would probably be led by Banco Exterior, in which the state still has a 60 per cent holding, and include the Caja Postal, the postal savings bank, the official mortgage bank, the agricultural credit bank, the industrial credit bank and the Instituto Credito Local, which finances town halls.</p>

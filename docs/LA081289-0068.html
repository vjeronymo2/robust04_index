			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BAJA CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> A Coast Guard helicopter, on a rescue mission to pick up an American heart  attack victim in Mexico, crashed while landing early Friday on a remote  airfield in Baja California.  </P> <P> The three crew members aboard the H-65 helicopter, Lt. Cmdr. Pat Gregory, Lt.  (j.g.) Rod Lubasky and Petty Officer Anthony Juan, were unharmed, but damage to  the aircraft was fairly extensive, said Dan Dewell, a spokesman for the Coast  Guard in San Diego.  </P> <P> The 44-year-old heart-attack victim was evacuated by a second helicopter and  taken to Mercy Hospital, where she was in stable condition Friday.  </P> <P> The helicopter left San Diego on the medical mission about 11:30 p.m. Thursday  and arrived shortly before 1 a.m. at the dirt airfield in San Quintin, about  150 miles southeast of San Diego. During the landing, the helicopter toppled  over on its left side, Dewell said.  </P> <P> A Coast Guard Falcon jet accompanying the rescue helicopter radioed for help,  and a second H-65 helicopter was flown down. While it is not routine for the  Coast Guard to perform these medical evacuations, it has been done before, and  permission for this operation was granted by the Mexican government, Dewell  said.  </P> <P> Naval investigators flew to the site Friday to determine what caused the  accident and to bring back the original Coast Guard crew, Dewell said.  </P></p>

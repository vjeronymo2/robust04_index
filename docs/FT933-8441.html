			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Rain lifts bookings for planes to Spain MR RICHARD Carrick, marketing director of Airtours, the Lancashire-based package holiday group, has been delighted with the British weather this summer. 'We've had 32 consecutive days of rain in Manchester. That's marvellous for bookings,' he said. A combination of poor UK weather, rising consumer confidence and weak Mediterranean currencies has produced a good high season for companies selling overseas holidays. This week sees the start of an industry campaign to ensure that next summer is as successful. Ms Rosemary Astles, marketing director of Thomson, the market leader, said that Spain had increased its share of the UK market from 33 per cent last summer to 37 per cent this year, aided by a weak peseta and heavy investment in tourist facilities. She expected Spain to be as strong next year. Tomorrow Thomson launches its summer 1994 programme, and over the next few weeks rivals such as Owners Abroad and Airtours will follow suit. The launch of Thomson's summer brochure has traditionally been seen as the opening move in a price war. Thomson is confident, however, that the industry has entered a more settled period. Fierce price-cutting has not occurred this summer. Ms Astles said this was partly because operators were more realistic about initial prices. They offered reductions to those who booked 1993 trips during the Christmas period last year, and then set prices that were low enough to attract continued pre-booking. The result is that while the number of summer holiday bookings has been 5 per cent higher than last year, average prices have not risen. Thomas Cook, the chain of travel agents, said that the poor UK weather kept demand for foreign holidays high to the end of September and enabled companies to maintain prices. Mr Carrick said the industry was now also more skilled at ensuring that supply did not outstrip demand. Smaller companies have another explanation for stability in the industry. Independent operators say that large groups such as Thomson and Airtours, which own large chains of travel agents, have used these retail chains to boost sales of their own holidays at the expense of smaller companies. Airtours recently acquired the Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson retail outlets and made it clear that it would use them to promote its own products. Industry managers say Thomson - which has owned Lunn Poly for two decades and until recently ran the chain at arm's length - has responded by using Lunn Poly in the same way.</p>

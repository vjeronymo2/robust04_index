			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: New lease of life for G&amp;S THE LAST memory of the original D'Oyly Carte company is of a ramshackle Ruddigore during its final season at the Adelphi in the Strand, when the orchestra scratched and scraped its way through the score and the prompter was the person who usually got in with the best lines first. The next day it was announced that the company was closing for good. At the time that was a punishment that seemed to fit the crime. Now the 'New' D'Oyly Carte Opera Company has taken up the Gilbert and Sullivan inheritance. It has new headquarters in Birmingham and new productions to counter the charge that it is trying to revive an operatic corpse. Like its predecessor, it also goes on the road and this week arrived for a season in London at Sadler's Wells. The two shows it has to offer are The Mikado and The Yeomen of the Guard. Although they prove to be very different evenings, they have one quality in common, which is a decidedly better standard of musical preparation than was heard during the dying gasps of the old D'Oyly Carte, with a strong chorus and reasonably alert orchestral playing. No need for the Mikado to deal out any executions there. Unfortunately the productions are up and down - in the case of The Mikado thumbs down, right from the beginning. The place is Japan, as it should be, but with modern fixtures and fittings. Everything is slick with Japanese high-tech precision. The routines work to the split second. The smiles flick on and off at the touch of a switch and the characters are as heartfelt as comic automata. The controversial ENO production may have put the show in a wrongheaded setting, but at least it had people one could care about. Reaction is likely to be conditioned by the way one responds to Ko-Ko, who comes on enveloped in an imposing cloak which opens to reveal nothing more than a pathetic, pint-sized wimp in pink leggings. From then on Fenton Gray works overtime to get a laugh and by the end you are exhausted, even if he is not. John Rath's Mikado and Jill Pert's Katisha are nearer the mark. But there is something wrong with a Mikado when one does not care whether Yum-Yum and Nanki-Poo get it together or not. There are few affectionate smiles on the way in that production. But if The Yeomen of the Guard invites still fewer, it is because the work itself is less sharp in comic content and Andrew Wickes, the producer of both pieces, this time shows a more sympathetic understanding of his subject. In the text the Tower of London is described as 'the cruel giant in a fairy-tale' and the designs by James Hendy, atmospherically lit, catch just the right Victorian Gothic quality. The cast includes many of the same singers, with John Rath again resonantly imposing as the Lieutenant and Janine Roebuck a warm Phoebe. Terence Sharpe sings strongly as Sergeant Meryll and Gary Montaine makes Shadbolt a less odious creature than usual. In short, the relationships work and the comedy is natural. For those who look upon two G&amp;S shows in a week as too much of a good thing, this is the one to choose. Sadler's Wells (071 278-8916) Season runs until May 16</p>

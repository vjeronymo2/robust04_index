			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 'LIZ TAYLOR OF LOBSTERS' DIES  </P> <P> Mimi, the 17 1/2-pound lobster described as the Elizabeth Taylor of  crustaceans, died of natural causes days after being shipped to her new home --  at a restaurant. She was between 20 and 100 years old, officials said.  </P> <P> Mimi, captured last week off the Maine coast and flown to Detroit, died in the  tank at Carl's Chop House, which paid $320 for the huge lobster.  </P> <P> "She had quit moving. I picked her up. She still didn't move," said Barry  Hornecker, executive chef at Carl's.  </P> <P> So he chilled and poached Mimi and began making plans for a feast.  </P> <P> "Mimi was like Elizabeth Taylor. . . . She was always beautiful," said Jim  Richards, owner of the Long Wharf Lobster Co. in Portland, Me., which flew the  lobster to Detroit.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMALS AS ACTORS  </P> <P> The "Project X" scandal opened the door on cruelty to animals in entertainment.  It is only a matter of time before the next bomb, similar to "Project X,"  explodes in the faces of the trainers and the American Humane Assn. The  Coalition to Protect Animals in Entertainment is on the alert to set up a  boycott of the next movie in which animals are abused. We are going to convince  producers that it is box-office suicide to abuse animals in their productions.  </P> <P> NANCY BURNET  </P> <P> EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COALITION TO PROTECT ANIMALS IN ENTERTAINMENT  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

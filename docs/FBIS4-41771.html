			<p>BFN     [Text] Aleksandr Lukashenko, the front-runner in the first  round of the presidential elections in Belarus, believes that  his victory is tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in the  Cabinet. He told a press conference in Minsk that this could be  judged from the wide gap between the 45.1 percent of the votes  he garnered, and the 17.4 percent, going to Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich.    He stated, however, that he would not oust all of the  current  Cabinet members from their posts, if he were elected president.    According to unofficial sources, Lukashenko will offer the  post of prime minister to the current Vice Premier and Economics  Minister Sergey Ling.    In an exclusive interview with Interfax, Lukashenko's proxy,  Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission for Legislation Dmitriy  Bulakhov expressed doubt about the authenticity of the results  of the first round. However, he refused to comment on the  rumors about instances of ballot rigging.    According to these rumors, in the first round Lukashenko  actually garnered 56 percent, rather than 45.1 percent of the  votes, which would have meant his complete victory.    Bulakhov expressed hope that Lukashenko would become  president in the second round. "So, there is no need to cast  doubts on the official reports of the Central Electoral  Commission," he said.</p>

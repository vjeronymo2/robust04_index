			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku 11 May TASS--The parliament and government of  the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan issued an  ultimatum to the local section of the Popular Front on Wednesday  [11 May], demanding it to stop unlawful actions aimed at  destabilising the situation in the Ordubad District of the  Republic.    The Nakhichevan authorities also said that they will appeal  to Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev to impose a state of  emergency in the region if the situation is not normalised  within three days.    The situation in the district, home base of ex-President  Abulfaz Elchibey, worsened two days ago, following the  appointment of a new head of the administration. Several local  leaders and deputies refused to obey the new head and called on  their supporters to follow their suit.    A group of front activists tried to seize the building of  the  local executive council last night. As a result of a clash with  the police, several people were injured.</p>

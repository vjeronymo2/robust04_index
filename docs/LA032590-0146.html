			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SAN PEDRO GETS PROMISE BUT NO ACTION ON BID FOR BED TAXES  </P> <P> San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce officials, along with their friends in  the hotel business, were girded for battle last month, set to make an unusual  pitch to get back a share of hotel bed taxes collected by the city of Los  Angeles in the seaside community.  </P> <P> The proposal, drafted by the chamber and supported by City Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores, would send 9% of hotel transient occupancy taxes back to San  Pedro, for use by the chamber in advertising the community as a tourist  destination. But after lining up troops to argue for the long-shot plan at a  Feb. 14 meeting of the Community and Economic Development Committee, the bed  tax proposal was inadvertently omitted from the agenda, said chamber and  council representatives.  </P> <P> "So far, they haven't rescheduled it. We knew this was going to be a hot  potato, but we thought we would at least get a hearing on it," Leron Gubler,  executive director of the chamber, said Friday.  </P> <P> City Councilman Robert Farrell, who chairs the Community and Economic  Development Committee, said last week that he prefers to hold a committee  meeting in San Pedro to discuss the proposal, along with other Harbor area  economic issues, with residents.  </P> <P> "This idea is worthy for us to discuss. I intend to set the hearing for some  time in mid-April. There is nothing intrinsic in the issue causing the delay. .  . , " Farrell said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles annually collects about $70 million through a 12% hotel transient  occupancy tax -- the bed tax. Almost 60% of that money is used to improve  public safety, public works and recreation citywide. No money is earmarked for  local entities.  </P> <P> About $6 million is given to the Greater Los Angeles Visitors and Convention  Bureau, which spends it to promote tourism. However, the bureau does not divide  up taxes to highlight specific areas, such as San Pedro, and uses the money  instead to showcase the entire city.  </P> <P> Chamber officials say San Pedro, which dangles like a pendulum 23 miles from  downtown Los Angeles, gets short shrift when it comes to promotion.  </P> <P> "We get very little spinoff from the visitors's bureau, which is centered  downtown," Gubler said. "How are we going to create an identity for ourselves  when we are merely a footnote in a publication about all of Southern  California? It seems logical that people directly affected are best able to  promote the area."  </P> <P> In 1988, chamber officials say, $386,000 was collected by the city in hotel bed  taxes in San Pedro. But with new hotels opening soon, chamber officials  anticipate San Pedro could contribute nearly $1 million in bed taxes to city  coffers. What the chamber wants is to spend 9% of that just promoting the San  Pedro area.  </P> <P> Some city officials criticize the plan, fearing it could open a Pandora's box  if other Los Angeles communities seek a greater share of locally collected  taxes.  </P> <P> In a memo sent to Farrell before the scheduled February hearing of the bed tax  proposal, City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie wrote: "We cannot support  diverting a portion of any tax . . . to the communities which generate the  revenue."  </P> <P> San Pedro was annexed by Los Angeles in 1909 to give the city control over the  lucrative Port of Los Angeles. But in recent years, shipbuilding and canning,  once the mainstays of the port community, have had drastic declines. San Pedro  has turned to tourism to keep dollars flowing into the area.  </P> <P> Within the next year, San Pedro expects to open three new hotels, increasing by  150% the number of available rooms in the area.  </P> <P> "Our major priority last year was to get tourist facilities and hotels. We have  achieved that, but now we have to fill those rooms," Gubler said.  </P> <P> If the unusual plan is approved, San Pedro hotel officials say the chamber's  Tourism Council would use the money -- potentially $90,000 a year -- in a  number of ways.  </P> <P> "We could produce a directory with advertising, have a video made about  attractions in San Pedro, attend trade shows. . . . Right now, travelers  staying in the area before embarking on cruises stay at the airport," said Jane  Walton, director of sales and marketing for the Sheraton San Pedro hotel, which  is to open in May.  </P> <P> San Pedro tourism promoters have always said that the area is ideally located  for visitors to Los Angeles: far enough from crowded, smoggy downtown, but  still close to such attractions as Disneyland and Hollywood.  </P> <P> Everyone concedes it is an uphill political fight to get the money,  particularly with other areas of Los Angeles watching the San Pedro campaign in  hopes of imitating it if it is successful.  </P> <P> Flores, who is backing the plan, said: "I'm not so sure it is a bad idea to  help the community in trying to do some self-promotion."  </P></p>

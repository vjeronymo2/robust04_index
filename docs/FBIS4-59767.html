			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The Constitutional legitimacy's military is the  property of the immortal Republic of Yemen; it is the military  of unified Yemen; it is the military that has been immunized by  loyalty to God, the homeland, and the revolution. As such, the  Army is the party to which our Yemeni masses naturally turn when  they seek to hasten the inevitable end of the cheap separatists'  saga, led by the war criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his  renegade, perfidious gang.    That hope is reflected by the worthy citizens in our  southern  governorates rallying behind the army of legality, democracy,  and unity. That all-important moral support has enabled our  valiant Army to fulfill its patriotic duties with remarkable  success and efficiency and score successive victories over the  forces of apostasy and secession and pursue the sacred advance  on the remnants of apostasy, perfidy, and treachery.    The unsavory rumors spread by the gang of secession within  the Socialist Party about the army of legality, unity, and  democracy furnish eloquent proof of the panic with which it  reacted to the support the victorious Republic of Yemen's  military enjoys with the public. It is not surprising that our  great Yemeni people should stand shoulder to shoulder with the  courageous protectors of the homeland as they defend the  sanctities of the Yemeni homeland. Just as the Yemeni people  displayed exemplary sacrifice in defeating their enemy in  conjunction with the military, they are now striving to rout the  remnants of the enemies of legality, unity, and democracy.    This courageous pro-Army and pro-unity posture on the part  of  our determined people has dealt a stinging blow to the gang of  apostasy and secession. It was natural that the people should  take such a stand, given the gang's criminal bloody record.    Certain facts have now come to light and may be summed up as  follows:    The personnel of the Republic of Yemen's military, now  engaging the secessionist gang in battle for the cause of  legality and unity and democracy, hail from all the Republic's  governorates, without exception. Thus, every inch of Yemeni  territory is a trust held by all members of the Armed Forces. A  Yemeni views every Yemeni drop of blood that runs through the  veins of fellow Yemenis as if it were his own.    The Republic of Yemen's military has earned the support of  the entire population of the country by its loyalty to God, the  homeland, the revolution, and unity.    Our enlightened and vigilant people are now certain that the  leaders of secession in the Socialist Party stage-managed the  crisis to advance their goal of scuttling the union of the  country and then reinstating their terrible, totalitarian regime  in the south.    Monitoring the evolving crisis from the beginning, Yemenis  are now certain beyond a shadow of doubt that the secessionist  gang had been planning for secession for quite some time.  Toward that end, they had detached some military units from the  Army of the Yemeni Republic. With their rallying cries of power  or death, secession or war, they had also stacked weapons and  military hardware in homes and warehouses and even with some  street hawkers.    That was enough [word indistinct] all people with their  heroic Army that has proved its true affiliation to a united  Yemen, thus haunting the secessionists, who are now spreading  ludicrous rumors to undercut the cohesion between the people and  the Army as they push ahead with the firmness of believers to  uphold the cause of unity, democracy, and legality and hunt down  the adventurous killers -- the gang of apostasy and secession,  who are now having to endure the disgrace of defeat. Yemen's  unity shall remain a crown on the heads of our worthy citizens  and their victorious army, God willing.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OLD NUCLEAR DUMP OFF COAST IS A RELIC OF ERA OF NAIVETE IN TOXIC DISPOSAL  </P> <P> In the black depths of the ocean near the Channel Islands lies a largely  forgotten memento of the early nuclear age. It is low-level radioactive waste  generated at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory and Canoga  Park plants.  </P> <P> For about a decade starting in the early 1950s, Atomics International, later  part of Rockwell, dumped hundreds of drums of radioactive waste in 6,000 feet  of water south of Santa Cruz Island.  </P> <P> Today, precise information on the dump is hard to come by. Old U.S. government  reports estimate that the dump received about 3,100 drums of waste containing  108 curies of radioactivity -- apparently not a great concentration considering  the diluting power of the sea.  </P> <P> But it is not known if these numbers are accurate, or if all the dumping was  recorded. Neither is it certain whether other government contractors disposed  of waste at the site. Except for a limited survey in 1960, there has been no  environmental monitoring of the Santa Cruz site by Rockwell or government  agencies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Specific Studies  </P> <P> "As far as we know, there have been no specific studies directed at that  particular site to find out exactly what has been dumped there," said Diane  Green, a park naturalist with Channel Islands National Park.  </P> <P> "The Park Service . . . does have concerns for that site as well as any other  toxic dumping site," she said.  </P> <P> Larger radioactive dumps used during the same years have been studied,  specifically those near the Farallon Islands off San Francisco and in the  Atlantic Ocean. Although elevated radioactivity was found in bottom sediment  near these dumps, no significant levels were found in samples of fish. Most  researchers have concluded that too little radioactive material was dumped off  the U.S. coasts during the '40s, '50s and '60s to create a human health hazard.  </P> <P> The dumping was more of a dangerous precedent than a life-threatening event,  said W. Jackson Davis, professor of biology at UC Santa Cruz and a leading  critic of ocean disposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Waste  </P> <P> However, the dump may also be a special case because radioactive waste was not  the only thing disposed of near Santa Cruz, the largest island in Channel  Islands National Park. When Atomics International began the dumping, the Navy  was already using the site to dispose of military waste. In fact, official  nautical charts describe the site as a former "chemical munitions dumping area"  -- saying nothing about radioactive waste.  </P> <P> The radioactive waste dumping, authorized by the old U.S. Atomic Energy  Commission, was variously estimated by Rockwell officials to have stopped  between 1959 and 1962, when commercial land burial sites became available for  low-level wastes generated at the Canoga Park plants and the Santa Susana Field  Laboratory west of Chatsworth.  </P> <P> "The ocean is awfully big," and ocean dumping was considered "a perfectly  acceptable way to dispose of radioactive waste," said Marlin Remley, former  chief of nuclear safety and licensing at Rockwell's Rocketdyne division,  successor to Atomics International. "I don't know when it was decided that,  'Hey, this is no good.' "  </P> <P> Atomics International dumped low-level material, including liquids,  contaminated wipes, gloves, glassware and other equipment. But the refuse  included some highly dangerous plutonium, according to a paper delivered by  company officials at an AEC symposium in 1955.  </P> <P> Atomics International began the ocean dumping before moving to its plant at  6633 Canoga Ave. at the end of 1955. Previously it disposed of waste from  experiments at its plant in Downey, where the firm operated California's first  nuclear power reactor, a tiny test model, starting in 1952.  </P> <P> Although radioactive dumping by the United States virtually ended in 1962, it  surfaced as a major environmental issue years later, leading to congressional  hearings in 1976 and later.  </P> <P> According to information compiled at the time, at least 27 Pacific, Atlantic  and Gulf Coast sites were designated for low-level wastes, but the waste dumped  near the Farallons and at three Atlantic Coast sites far exceeded the volume at  all other sites combined. Virtually all environmental monitoring by the  Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations has been done at these  larger sites.  </P> <P> Studies have found measurable radioactivity at each of the sites, but "we  didn't find any significant uptake of radioactive materials in any of the fish  we sampled," said Bob Dyer, chief of environmental studies for the EPA office  of radiation programs in Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Food Chain  </P> <P> Similar conclusions have been reached by contract researchers for the  California Department of Health Services, who have gathered fish samples near  the Farallon Islands during the last few years.  </P> <P> "That's the key thing you want to know," Dyer said. "You want to know whether  it's going up the food chain and getting into man, and there's no evidence of  that."  </P> <P> Dyer said that in 1960, an AEC contract research firm did a limited survey of  the Santa Cruz dump and found no significant contamination.  </P> <P> According to the paper delivered by Atomics International at the AEC symposium,  wastes were put in cylindrical ice cream cartons, which were placed in  55-gallon drums and sealed with concrete to make sure that they would sink to  the bottom. About four times a year, the waste drums would be trucked to Long  Beach for loading on a Navy barge.  </P> <P> The price could not be beat. "No costs are involved since the dumping ground  trip by the U.S. Navy is regularly scheduled for other purposes and ample space  is available" on the Navy barge, the paper said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paid Overtime  </P> <P> But Atomics International paid overtime to its maintenance workers, several of  whom accompanied each voyage. They would ride in the tug until it arrived at  the dump, then take a small boat back to the barge to roll the drums over the  side. The trip to the dump and back could take more than 24 hours, and the men  were paid for every hour at sea.  </P> <P> James Youngblood of Santa Clarita, a retired Rockwell worker who went on two of  the dumping trips, said this was a plum assignment and the men took turns  because of the extra pay.  </P> <P> "I think they enticed the maintenance workers, the blue-collar workers, with  the overtime pay," said Eula Youngblood, his wife.  </P> <P> "We just took it for granted it was a safe thing to do," said Junius Wheeler of  Lake View Terrace, a former maintenance supervisor who helped prepare the drums  for disposal.  </P> <P> The volumes dumped may have increased after nuclear work shifted from Downey to  Canoga Park sites and the Santa Susana lab, which have done extensive work with  test reactors and nuclear fuel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm's Records  </P> <P> Company memos, provided by Rockwell in response to questions about the ocean  disposal, allude to at least 10 dumping trips in 1958-59, including the  disposal in September, 1958, of 225 55-gallon drums along with contaminated  boxes, tanks and conduits.  </P> <P> Sometimes the company hired commercial haulers, but a problem arose with the  private firms. Just as the operation involved old ideas of pollution control,  so did it run afoul of throwback racial attitudes.  </P> <P> During the overnight trips, private tug crews were reluctant to share their  bunks with the Atomics International maintenance men, some of whom were black,  according to George Borg, a former health physicist with the company. Borg said  a tugboat captain told him, "The guys on board don't want to give up their  bunks to anybody who's colored." As a result, he said, Atomics International  resumed trips with the Navy.  </P> <P> Another bad experience involved a private contractor hired to dispose of  contaminated dirt around Santa Susana's experimental sodium reactor following a  1959 accident that melted part of its nuclear fuel, Borg said.  </P> <P> The contractor, Coastwise Marine Disposal Co. of Long Beach, accumulated more  than 1,000 drums of radioactive waste from various generators without dumping  it. Eventually the firm, which was cited by the AEC for excessive radioactivity  at its Long Beach plant, dumped the wastes, including those from Atomics  International, at another Pacific dump site about 215 miles west of San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burbank Firm  </P> <P> This second dump site was used by another San Fernando Valley firm, Isotopes  Specialties Co. of Burbank, in 1961, according to a report by the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, successor to the AEC.  </P> <P> The lack of follow-up monitoring of the Santa Cruz dump is not necessarily a  problem, said Don Womeldorf, chief of environmental management for the state  Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> "I suppose the logical answer is that if we look in the areas where the  greatest amount of dumping took place and find nothing of potential public  health significance there, then one would conclude that the likelihood is much  less of having problems where less material was deposited," Womeldorf said.  </P> <P> Although Dyer also said he is not concerned about the Santa Cruz dump, he  added: "If it hasn't been monitored since 1960, it would probably be useful to  assure ourselves that there's no significant inventory of radioactive materials  present in the site. . . . If the public wanted assurances, then it would be a  good idea."  </P></p>

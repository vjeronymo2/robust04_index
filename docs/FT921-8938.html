			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UN troops set to march to different tunes: Conflicting Yugoslav views about the forces' role BARRING a complete breakdown of the ceasefire, more than 10,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops will soon be on their way to the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, has managed to secure agreement for their deployment from Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman, and the federal army. Mr Milan Babic, head of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in south-western Croatia, has yet to fully commit himself. Under terms proposed last December, it was suggested that the UN force would consist of about 10 infantry battalions, 100 military observers, 500 police monitors, and necessary civilian and military support. These would be deployed in three areas in Croatia to be designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). It is in these regions - eastern and western Slavonia, eastern and central Croatia, and the Serb enclave of Krajina - where Serbs form either a majority or a substantial minority, and where tensions between Serbs and Croats have led to local civil wars. As a means of stabilising the areas, the UN wants to demilitarise them rapidly; withdraw, disband, or demobilise all armed forces; and protect people living there from attack. The UN is insisting that Croatia's territorial defence units, and other units in the UNPAs, must hand over all weapons to the federal army, Croatia's National Guard, or to UN forces; that all units of the federal army be relocated outside Croatia; and that all Serbian territorial, paramilitary, irregular and volunteer units not from the region withdraw from Croatia. Finally, the maintenance of public order in the UNPAs will be the responsibility of local police forces who would reflect the national composition of the local population, and who lived in the region before the conflict broke out on June 25. Having learned from the 14 ceasefires brokered by the European Community, UN negotiators have ironed out all possible ambiguities in the text for deploying troops. Nevertheless, all sides in the conflict hold different views about the UN's goals. The Croatian government wants the troops in the republic for a minimum period to restore stability which would facilitate local, parliamentary and presidential elections. The UN has said its mandate will be reviewed every six months. Croat officials also believe that any extended UN presence would cement the gains of Serb militants and Serbia at the expense of regaining for Croatia that third of its territory held by the federal army. For this reason, Zagreb wants the UN mandate to include helping Croatia regain all its territory. The UN has repeatedly stated that any deployment of troops 'would not prejudge the outcome of political negotiations for a comprehensive settlement of the Yugoslav crisis'. That remains the EC's task. Serbia wants the UN troops deployed not only because maintaining the federal army has become too expensive, but also because Mr Milosevic believes the UN will consolidate some Serbian gains. However, the growing consensus among Croat and Serb liberals is that Serb militants in certain regions in Croatia will quit once the federal army, their supporter, withdraws. As for Mr Babic, he fears for the safety of Serbs in Krajina if local Serbs disarm. In a letter yesterday to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, he warned that the safety of UN troops could not be guaranteed. Western diplomats in Belgrade believe the longer the delay in deploying the troops the greater the chance of the ceasefire collapsing, and all sides hardening.</p>

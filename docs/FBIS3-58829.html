			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "C.G.": "Mounting Concern in Bonn and </F> Russia's Neighboring Countries About Developments in Moscow"]    [Excerpt] Bonn, 19 January -- On Wednesday [19 January],  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel extended an invitation to the  foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to come to  Bonn. Kinkel intends to hold "consultations" with Foreign  Ministers Luik (Estonia), Andrejevs (Latvia), and Gylys  (Lithuania) in early March. The invitation has to be seen in  connection with the increasing feeling in the Baltic countries  of being under threat from Russia. Kinkel intends to discuss  with the Baltic ministers how their countries can be brought  closer to the European Union. Germany is trying to extend the  mandate for negotiations, which the Brussels Commission adopted  in December. So far, the mandate provides for negotiations on a  free trade agreement. Kinkel wants to achieve that, comparable  to existing Europe treaties with other countries, the agreement  should at least contain "prospects" for later accession to the  European Union.    The Federal Government is worried about developments in  Russia. There is lack of clarity in Bonn about the shift of  balance in connection with the establishment of the new  government in Moscow. Statements by Foreign Minister Kozyrev  according to which Russia has "basic vital interests" in the  other successor states to the former Soviet Union, the "CIS,"  and the Baltics, were regarded in Bonn at least as requiring  clarification, even after Moscow sources said that the statement  was "quoted in a distorted way." Hungary and Washington have  also expressed concern. On Tuesday night, U.S. President  Clinton and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl held extensive  discussions on the telephone about Clinton's talks in Moscow and  and his talks with Syrian President Al-Asad in Geneva. Clinton  was obviously not yet aware of the situation after the  resignation from the government of the reformers around Deputy  Prime Minister Gaydar. In coordination with Clinton, Kohl is  currently trying to get Yeltsin on the telephone to ask him  about the determination of the course of the future government.  Sources in Bonn have stated that, like Clinton, Kohl continues  to bank on Yeltsin. Owing to the insecure situation in Russia,  the Federal Government is particularly interested in the  compliance with the agreements regulating the withdrawal of the  Russian Forces from eastern Germany.

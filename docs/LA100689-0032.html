			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD ATHLETIC INJURIES  </P> <P> Your report on the growing number of orthopedic problems in the United States  ("Big League Child Injuries" by Linda Roach Monroe, Sept. 26) states that some  of the causes of these diseases are overtraining and inappropriate training.  </P> <P> Who is responsible for this? The fingers point at coaches. Though this is not  true in all cases, in many cases the coaches are oblivious or choose to ignore  these excruciating injuries. It all boils down to this: Many coaches lack skill  and knowledge.  </P> <P> I have no forbearance with the unfit coaches coaching thousands of children.  They have the responsibility to look out for the welfare of their athletes.  They get paid for this and if they don't or can't do their jobs, they should be  superseded.  </P> <P> To prevent further increases in the number of children seriously injured in  sports, a national exam for coaches should be made to determine those who are  suitable for this important job.  </P> <P> MIHOKO KATO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eybaly Mehreliyev, Dr. Geo. Sci.: "There Is But </F> One Citizen In A Civilized Country"]    [Text] The geographical location of the Azerbaijan  Republic, which is located in what Academician Marr called the  "Caucasian Isthmus," lies at the crossroads of Christianity and  Islam, Christian-Gregorianism and Judaism. This occurred without  discrimination among the peoples. In the course of historical  processes the republic's population mixed and intermingled with  other peoples and ethnic groups in addition to those who were  Turkic-speaking.    The fact that the majority of the people living in the  republic are Muslim has led to broad relationships. This assures  the close unity of the population. But processes following the  fall of the Soviet empire caused a far-reaching national  awakening in Azerbaijan, as well as in other places. The  situation which was created led to the development of thoughts  about entire nations, as well as minority peoples in determining  their own fate.    As a result of poorly thought out propaganda about ethnic  relations, a number of minorities have begun to establish their  own self "defense." Thus, they have created their own  "societies."In the past, this commanded great sympathy. However,  this also awakened the self-preservation instinct of peoples,  and created Talysh, Lezgian, Avar, Udin and Kurdish factors.  Undoubtedly, had attention in government circles not been drawn  to this, the mature social stratum of national minorities could  have slowed this process down and preserved it.    It strikes many that the process of national awakening is  accidental and could be quickly eliminated. Such ideas are  mistaken, the disturbance created from national awakening will  survive a long time. Among the population of those who have not  yet become adults this process will continue even longer. This  process also creates social tension. Earlier, 35-40 thousand  youth having very strong self-preservation instincts left the  republic every year. This significantly weakened the social  tension. On one hand, the war, the lack of growth of jobs and  the horrendous refugee situation, on the other, the  non-objective propaganda by provocateurs, makes the situation  more complicated. There is, however, no national basis for this.  The present social and economic difficulties have created the  war. We have to emerge from this situation by working together  and striking back at the enemy.    In the time of the last regime a number of mistakes were  also  made in ethnic policy. By saying "Turks have no friends other  than Turks," the potential for ethnic discrimination was  created. The population living in the republic, regardless of  their size or number, took part jointly in the formation and  development of national culture in Azerbaijan. These peoples  were stabilized by one citizenship in our republic. Thus, there  was never national discrimination in Azerbaijan. But, within the  ongoing processes, the spirit of self-awareness began to grow.  Provocateurs, making use of this, are beginning to increase  dissatisfaction among the non-Turkic population.    The emergence of the wish to "live freely" in man's nature  creates the conditions for fragmentation. Narrow-minded men  understand the concept of "living freely" only in a limited  sense, and interpret it as the living freely of individual men.  Nevertheless, the wish to live "freely" must be understood to  mean the development of an ethnic group or people, its reaching  world culture, and its national flowering.    In recent years, the inflaming of ethnic feelings in the  republic has done serious damage to mutual understanding. But  social development led to the attainment of a civilized level  within the population and the dominance of individuals with  harmonious natures within the ethnos. Without them, no ethnos  could survive, and each of these persons is a reason for the  development of the ethnos. Because such people are at a mature  stage, they equate their passionate impulse with their instinct  for self-preservation. When the individual's self-preservation  reaches a harmful level, it leads to the growth of people to a  mentality of prodigality and an anti-social character. Mature  individuals know that peoples possessing a small population and  little territory can always gain an entree to world culture  through the language and cultural treasury of any large nation  because their intellectual development and local possibilities  do not correspond to a modern level of development. Thus,  socially mature persons from minority peoples have always worked  to create close ties with the larger people. When the Azerbaijan  Democratic Republic [ADP] was established the Avars living in  Balaken and Zagatala Rayons wanted the opening of schools in  their own language. Knowing this, Colonel Ahmedbey Dibirov  (commander of the ADP army in the Sheki-Zagatala zone) advised  them that if we want to reach out to world culture, we have to  study in Turkish or Russian. Since our people are similar to the  Turks as Muslims, it would be more appropriate for the children  to study in Turkish.    In every country the permanent residents of that country are  citizens of it. Often those who talk about civilization have to  be aware that in the United States of America, the world's most  progressive, civilized and democratic country, there are only  citizens, not nationalities.    Second, the thrusting forward of national discrimination is  ignorance. Such imprudence has done not less damage to the  republic than the war.    Ethnic relations in the Azerbaijan Republic are seen broadly  in the context of living together, unity of religion and family  relationships. The national question is an exceptionally broad  and sophisticated problem. Without knowing its scope, certain  peoples conducting a nationality policy who lack an instinct for  self-preservation have not drawn necessary conclusions. Dividing  a people according to the concept of large or small is in itself  defective. In every measure conducted in this sector, the entire  population must be evaluated as a whole because the destiny of  the republic is in their hands. In other words, the demands on  the one citizen and this same citizen's concerns must be  identical.</p>

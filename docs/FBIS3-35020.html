			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Coalition sources say that the possibility of  Tzomet's and the National Religious Party's [NRP] joining the  government is not on the agenda. Minister Yosi Sarid told our  correspondent Yo'el Nir that this is a standard ritual we go  through whenever there are problems in the opposition or one of  its factions.    Our correspondent notes that according to one of the clauses  in the coalition agreement, Meretz is entitled to veto the  admission of any faction into the government.    SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] leader Arye Der'i says he  will examine whether the possibility of Tzomet's and the NRP's  joining the government is serious in order to determine whether  it is time for SHAS to rejoin the coalition.</p>

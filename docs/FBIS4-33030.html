			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu </F> Bonilla by Hugo Ruiz Olazar; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ruiz] The newspapers are  always discussing Uruguay's and Paraguay's unfavorable position  compared with the giants Brazil and Argentina in this Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] process...    [Abreu] I believe it is the other way round. We have a  positive view of Mercosur...    [Ruiz] What are you basing...    [Abreu] In a world that requires a gradual opening, with  greater competitivity, it is significantly unfavorable for us to  remain enclosed or isolated. Mercosur is a potential market of  200-million inhabitants.    [Ruiz] Why then are we hearing so many warnings about the  risks involved in Mercosur?    [Abreu] There are two basic pillars we have to handle  together: democracy and integration. Uruguay's Mercosur  strategy is -- and I will stick to the words of Enrique  Iglesias, a former Uruguayan foreign minister and current IDB  [Inter-American Development Bank] president -- first, Mercosur;  second, Mercosur; and third, Mercosur.    [Ruiz] Do you believe Uruguay and Paraguay are unable to  influence the two giants, Argentina and Brazil, which are  apparently engulfing everything ...?    [Abreu] Quite the contrary! Quite the contrary! We have the  same possibilities as the smaller countries in the EU, despite  all the differences ...    [Ruiz] Not long ago, the newspapers seriously discussed the  possibility of Uruguay withdrawing from Mercosur ...    [Abreu] Uruguay is not linked to the possibility of  withdrawing from Mercosur ...    [Ruiz] This issue was discussed at length here in Asuncion  ...    [Abreu] Quite the contrary. Uruguay's stance involves  confirming and strengthening Mercosur ... You must know that it  is quite different to have four countries talking to other  economic blocs than to have countries talking separately,  especially if they involve Uruguay and Paraguay ... The  president of the Republic issued a public denial ...    [Ruiz] Why are importers against Mercosur?    [Abreu] Of course, there are economic circles that will not  be favored by a comprehensive strategy. Integration involves an  adjustment process. It is a process marked by growing pains.  It is very important here to handle conflicts and traumas ...    [Ruiz] It will not be possible to achieve a zero common  external tariff by 1 January 1995. What is your opinion?    [Abreu] We are not so pessimistic. Uruguay does not believe  the schedule should be moved back. The common external tariff  as it is must be negotiated, but must be implemented ...    [Ruiz] For Paraguay, a landlocked country, there is a key  point, namely freight, the waterway. Some people fear the River  Plate tolls to be collected by Argentina and Uruguay will  increase freight ...    [Abreu] As projected, the waterway links Puerto Caceres with  Nueva Palmira. It is necessary to seek a sea outlet from Nueva  Palmira. The channels will be dredged: the Martin Garcia  Channel in Uruguay and the Mitre Channel in Argentina. Private  companies will carry out the dredging and will charge a toll to  recover their investment, but only for large ships. This toll  will not apply to normal waterway transportation ...

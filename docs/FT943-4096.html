			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull widens US computer ventures Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer company, yesterday announced plans to form strategic alliances with two US groups, Motorola and Tandem Computers, to prepare for privatisation. Mr Thierry Breton, deputy chief executive, confirmed that Bull had concluded negotiations for a technological agreement with Motorola, the world leader in mobile communications technology, and was in advanced talks with Tandem, maker of fault-tolerant computers. He said Bull was considering forging similar alliances with other partners, some of whom might take minority stakes in the group and participate in its privatisation. It is not thought that either of the US companies would take an equity stake in Bull. The privatisation of Bull has been clouded by uncertainty due to its financial problems. However, Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman, forecast Bull could return to the black at an operating level this year after halving its interim net loss to FFr843m (Dollars 157.27m) for the first half of 1994 from FFr1.98bn in the same period of 1993. The French government has invited banks to tender to act as advisers on the sale of Bull and is expected in November to ask potential noyaux durs, or hard core shareholders, to step forward as the first stage towards selling its stake in a series of share sales. Last week, a Franch satirical magazine alleged that Bull lost FFr1bn of computer sales in 1989 and 1990 through illegal trafficking by employees. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, the state-controlled electronics group, yesterday called on the French government to recapitalise his company in preparation for the proposed merger of the Thomson-CSF defence electronics business with the Thomson holding company. Mr Gomez said at a conference that a recapitalisation was essential if Thomson was to be privatised.</p>

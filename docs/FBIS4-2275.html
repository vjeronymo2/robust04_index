			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Addressing a meeting held yesterday [29 March]  to promote the anticorruption operation for cadres at and above  the office level from organs directly under the provincial  authorities, Governor Tian Chengping, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee, said: Our province must stress  reform, development, and stability as major matters this year,  must continue to implement the central authorities' decision on  the struggle against corruption, and must carry out the  anticorruption operation in a sustained, deep-going, and more  effective manner, while preserving the present achievements.    The anticorruption promotion meeting was presided over by  Cai  Zhulin, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee.  Present were more than 1,000 people, including leading comrades  Doba, Wang Hanmin, Yao Xiangcheng, Huanjue Cenam, Han Yingxuan,  La Bingli, Bai Ma, Liu Guanghe, Bainma Dandzin, Han Shenggui,  (Ajia Luosang Tudan), (Ma Jinxiao), and (Hu Decai), as well as  cadres from organs directly under the provincial authorities.    During the meeting, the participants were briefed on the  spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission and on the important speech by Comrade  Jiang Zemin on the anticorruption operation.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and government,  Tian Chengping delivered a speech to mobilize the participants  to engage in the operation. He first reviewed the development  of the anticorruption operation in the province over the  previous period. He pointed out: The anticorruption operation  has been progressing in a wholesome manner and has basically met  the requirements and expectations of the central authorities and  the provincial party committee. Thanks to the concerted efforts  by all the people -- from the leadership to the grass-roots  level -- all the targets have been fulfilled with regard to the  three major tasks for the current stage, as assigned by the  central authorities. [passage omitted]    Tian Chengping noted: Although some results have been scored  in the anticorruption operation in our province, what we have  achieved already still falls short of the actual demand and the  public's expectations. Therefore, we must view the  anticorruption struggle from a strategic point of view and treat  it as a long-term, complicated, and arduous task. [passage  omitted]    Party committees and governments, as well as discipline  inspection and supervisory organs at all levels, must further  strengthen leadership over the anticorruption operation. While  studying and planning their working procedures to deepen the  reform, carry on economic construction, and safeguard stability,  they must set requirements on the anticorruption operation, map  out the plan, and devote great efforts to implementing the plan.  [passage omitted]    To conclude his speech, Tian Chengping stressed that  discipline inspection and supervisory organs, while focusing  their attention on specific tasks in the anticorruption  operation, must more strictly supervise the enforcement of laws,  with the stress on implementing major policy decisions and  measures adopted by the state, and thus make sure that  democratic centralism is implemented properly, political  discipline is enforced strictly, and government orders are  carried out smoothly. Whenever problems are discovered, they  should give timely guidance, thus ensuring that the  anticorruption operation will be developing in a more  deep-going, effective, and lasting manner.</p>

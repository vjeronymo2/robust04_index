			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: EU to ease cross-border listing rules European economic and finance ministers have agreed to simplify listing rules for the shares of European Union companies that wish to be listed on the stock exchanges of other member states. The directive will significantly lower the cost to companies of cross-border listing by allowing some of the information previously required for listing to be partially or fully waived by the relevant authorities in the host country. Certain companies will be able to be listed in other member states without publishing a new listing prospectus. The Commission said the directive was expected to bring about a more efficient simple market in securities.</p>

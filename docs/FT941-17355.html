			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Rifkind attacks Scottish gallery plan for Glasgow Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary and Edinburgh MP, yesterday joined objections to last month's decision by the National Galleries of Scotland to move much of its collection to a new gallery in Glasgow. He said that aspects of the plan were 'unacceptable and do not deserve public support'. The National Galleries of Scotland intends to create a gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow. It would display many of the paintings by Scottish artists now in the National Gallery and the National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. It would also feature all the paintings in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, as well as pictures not currently on display. When the new gallery was proposed in 1991 there was no suggestion of it being anywhere but Edinburgh. But Glasgow offered accommodation more cheaply and consultants said a Glasgow gallery would receive more visitors. The plan has been attacked by leading figures in Edinburgh. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has said the government will not contribute to its Pounds 20m cost. Mr Rifkind attacked the plan because it would entail removing the most important Scottish paintings from the National Gallery and closing the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.</p>

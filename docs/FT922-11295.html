			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Low turnout at Scotland United rally HEAVY rain yesterday caused a poor turnout at the second rally in Glasgow called by Scotland United, the movement formed after the election to campaign for a referendum on Scotland's constitutional future, James Buxton writes. Although organisers had expected 10,000 people, only about 2,500 braved the rain. The movement's first rally attracted 3,000 to 4,000 people. No party leaders attended, although a message of support was read out from Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP. Scotland United is a cross-party grouping set up by Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, and other Labour MPs.</p>

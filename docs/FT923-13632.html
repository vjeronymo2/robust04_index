			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Food: A gastronomic tour of Yorkshire - Nicholas Lander enjoys beautiful countryside and genuinely good food in the north of England NEITHER Yorkshire nor its inhabitants have ever taken kindly to outside influences but, in a world where regional differences are disappearing, this may prove an advantage. Certainly anyone, let alone a Lancastrian such as myself, could be forgiven for thinking that the gastronomic changes sweeping through England would be rebuffed at Yorkshire's borders. Far from it. Instead, committed individuals at various isolated outposts throughout Yorkshire - George Pagendham at the Black Bull, Moulton (0325-377289), Michael Gill at Pool Court ((0532-842288) and the Wynnes at Epworth Tap (0427-873333) - will revive the most discerning of travellers. The attractions of a Yorkshire gastronomic tour lie not just in the immediate pleasure but in the longer-lasting and, perhaps more incongruous, memories. We arrived at Winteringham Fields to find an hotel that could sit easily in France or Switzerland. This is not surprising since it is owned by Swiss chef Germain Schwab, and his Grimsby-born wife Annie. Romantic encounters in the restaurant business are never ordinary but theirs, at a mountain-top restaurant in Zermatt where he was the cook and she the manageress, must be one of the more unusual. Trained in Switzerland, Schwab worked in France, Italy, Germany and London before they started their first restaurant together on a small farm outside York. With Pounds 200,000 they turned a derelict building into a thriving business. Schwab stressed just how cooperative the village had been in helping him establish his restaurant and build extra rooms. And, of course, his hotel has brought considerable benefits to the village. Meat is bought from the local butcher and during the summer he obtains fruit and vegetables from villagers. The Schwabs have also put Winteringham on the map in a way that the absence of local signposts seems determined to prevent. The motorway brings loyal customers from Leeds and Harrogate, and there is a steady stream of tourists, German, Dutch and French, en route from London to Scotland. The cooking reflects Schwab's upbringing and travels. There were excellent breads at both dinner and breakfast and a variety of home-made jams. One amuse-gueule of thin slices of pork cheek and black pudding with an apple compote seemed designed to please equally the natives of Yorkshire and Bavaria. There is also an emphasis on sophisticated desserts, always appreciated in the north of England. Dinner included two exciting dishes: a surprisingly successful first course of Savoy cabbage stuffed with slices of monkfish and foie gras, followed by a casserole of goat with a roast pear. Amid the flat, charming, quiet countryside, he is perfecting what he has learnt and working uninterrupted on his own ideas. Isolation is not a feeling you will experience if you eat or stay with the McCoys at the Tontine in North Yorkshire. The house was built as a coaching inn. Today, the busy A19 supplies constant traffic along one side of the property and the talents of the three McCoy brothers, Tom, Peter and Eugene, bring human traffic through the front door. The brothers provide the complete management structure. Tom cooks for the restaurant, Peter looks after front of house, breakfast and desserts and Eugene takes care of the bistro and the wines. Now established as one of the most enjoyable and idiosyncratic places to eat in the North East, McCoy's also reflects the vast improvement in eating out in this country over the last 20 years. The bothers reckon that because the hotel is open every night of the week and the bistro for every lunch and dinner it has to be pleasurable for them as well as for their customers. Hence a most comfortable hotel lounge with the most successful collection of old armchairs and sofas; large parasols over some of the dining tables, a wittily written and well-chosen wine list and a loyal band of very friendly staff. The cooking in the restaurant is not cheap - first courses cost Pounds 9 to Pounds 10, main courses Pounds 15. Neither is it simple - try a Bresse pigeon with cream, leeks, truffle, foie gras and port glaze - but it is generous. It is the bistro downstairs, however, which would make most London restaurateurs envious. The bistro was originally the hotel bar and doing little business. The McCoys have changed that. There are no tablecloths, the napkins are paper, menus are written on blackboards, there is no air-conditioning and it is packed. There were 120 customers in and out on the night I visited eating anything from huge bowls of mussels, queen scallops and garlic butter, sausage, Yorkshire pudding and onion gravy and huge steaks and Dover soles. Desserts included sticky toffee pudding and banana McTophie. A blackboard, the same standard of enthusiastic, polite and helpful staff and the same county are all that links the Tontine with The Sportsman's Arms at Wath in Nidderdale. Head for Pateley Bridge near Harrogate and follow the signs for Wath. As the valley closes in the countryside becomes more inviting. After two miles there is a small car park signposted on the right. Use it and walk across the bridge over the River Nidd, which supplies trout for the pub's kitchen, and up to an imposing pub. The bar menu has almost everything you could ask for before or after a walk on the moors. Bowls of homemade soup and crusty bread, huge servings of ploughman's lunch, and rolls stuffed with smoked salmon and other fillings. For those who prefer to look at the moors rather than walk them there was dressed crab and a number of hot fish dishes on my visit. Lest you forget that it is a pub the draught beer is good too. After lunch we did go for a walk. On the way back we sat on the swings in a field opposite the pub, looked at the countryside around and wondered why we were rushing back.

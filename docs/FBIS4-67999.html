			<p>BFN     [Text] The Haifa District Court has lifted the ban on  reporting the detention of two Israeli Arabs, residents of West  Barta'ah, suspected of aiding the terrorist who perpetrated the  attack at Hadera's central bus station.    The two -- 'Atif Kabaha, 46, and Majid Kabaha, 48 -- are  suspected of driving the terrorist from East Barta'ah in the  territories to Hadera's central bus station under orders from  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in return for money. The  court extended their remand for another 15 days. They are not  cooperating with the police. Our correspondent Nati Silberman  notes that the police take a grave view of cooperation between  Israeli Arabs and terrorists.</p>

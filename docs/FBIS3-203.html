			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Mozambican Government has reiterated that it  intends and is willing to have general elections by not later  than October 1994 in line with the General Peace Accord  timetable. That is according to NOTICIAS which cites a  statement issued by the government. NOTICIAS says that is the  first government reaction to the recent UN Security Council  resolution on the Mozambican peace process. The statement says  the apparent delay in the confinement of government troops is  not in any way caused by political or logistical reasons. The  UN Security Council resolution vigorously urged the government  and the Mozambique National Resistance to speed up the  confinement of troops, and asked the sides to begin demobilizing  their forces.</p>

Interviewed today, Dr. Nxumalo said competition  between him and the prime minister is out of the question as the  two have been friends since school days. He said they are  pleased to work with each other in harmony. He said when this  country gained independence from the British in 1968, the then  prime minister, Prince Makhoseni, had a deputy who worked in  harmony with him. He said his office has been open to normalize  democracy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others]    [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry does not rule out that the  date for a second ministerial meeting on a settlement in Bosnia  can be agreed at a Contact Group's session in Paris on Tuesday  [28 June]. As a senior Russian diplomat reported to Interfax on  Monday, Russia will be represented at the gathering by the  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin.    He confirmed that the second ministerial conference would  most likely take place in Geneva, where the first gathering had  been held. "It is to put an end to three years of drama in  former Yugoslavia, a drama that has exasperated everyone in the  world community", Churkin remarked.    In his words, the Contact Group will look at alternative  world community responses to refusal by one or both belligerents  to a plan for territorial division in Bosnia, endorsed at the  previous Geneva meeting, and it is not ruled out that UN may  leave former Yugoslavia," Churkin said.    In keeping with the plan, the Serbs who now control 70  percent of Bosnia, are to get 49, and the Moslems and Crates [as  received] - 51 percent of the territory.</p>

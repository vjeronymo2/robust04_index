			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / US fears interest rate rise after big employment gains FEARS of higher interest rates rose on Wall Street yesterday after an unexpectedly sharp rise in payroll employment. The Labour Department said non-farm employment rose by more than 200,000 in both April and May, and revised up figures for job growth for the preceding 12 months. The unemployment rate fell to 6.9 per cent from 7 per cent, the lowest in 18 months. The figures indicate economic growth is accelerating after a depressed first quarter. If May figures for producer and consumer price inflation, due in the next 10 days, show a continuation of the inflationary pressures recorded in the first four months, the Federal Reserve is likely to tighten monetary policy. However, if the price figures are subdued, then the Fed is likely to postpone a tightening of policy until the underlying growth and inflation trends become clearer. If the Fed moves, it will probably raise short-term rates from 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent or 3.5 per cent. Last month, Fed governors and regional presidents are believed to have shifted from a neutral stance on interest rates to a bias towards tightening. This would allow Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to raise rates by up to half a point if needed. The benchmark long bond finished the day just under a full point down on fears of higher short-term rates. The dollar rose sharply against most currencies, closing at DM1.6264, a gain of more than 2 pfennigs. The stock market finished the week with a flat performance. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.27 up at 3,545.14. Employment rose 209,000 last month, a bigger gain than most analysts expected. The increase in April was revised up to 216,000 against the 119,000 reported last month. In the year to March the average monthly increase in employment was put at 83,000 rather than 46,000 as reported. The figures 'were very impressive and would dramatically change perceptions of the economy's strength,' said Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C J Lawrence, a New York broker. They followed reports this week of a 23 per cent rise in sales of new homes between April and May and a robust gain in domestic car sales last month. Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the figures pointed to an acceleration in the growth rate to 3 to 3.5 per cent or more in the second half of the year.

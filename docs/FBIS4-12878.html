			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hala Boncompagni] </F>   [Text] Beirut, April 14 (AFP)--Lebanon has recalled its  only diplomat in Baghdad and is considering lifting the immunity  of two Iraqi envoys suspected of killing an Iraqi dissident  here, a government official told AFP Thursday [14 April].    The official who declined to be named also said Iraq's  commercial attache Khalid Khalaf and cultural attache Muhammad  Kazim allegedly told police that they gunned down Talib  al-Suhayl [al-Tamimi] at his Beirut home on Baghdad's orders.    A third suspect in Tuesday's killing, an Iraqi embassy  guard,  was reported to be on the run.    Lebanon has summoned its acting charge d'affaires in Iraq,  Sa'd Zakhiyah, to return to Beirut for consultations and he was  expected to arrive later Thursday.    The official told AFP the cabinet approved on Wednesday a  proposal by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz to consider depriving  the diplomats of their immunity from prosecution.    Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf tried  telephoning Buwayz on Wednesday but could not speak to him  because his Lebanese counterpart was attending the weekly  cabinet meeting, the official added.    Iraqi opposition groups denounced al-Suhayl's killing in  statements to AFP.    Al-Suhayl, who was in his 70s, had lived in Beirut for  several years and held both Jordanian and Saudi passports.    The outlawed al-Da'awah al-Islamiyah urged the Lebanese  authorities to take all the necessary steps to punish the  killers "particularly because we have information that the Iraqi  intelligence services have plans to kill (other) dissidents in  Lebanon and in other countries in the region."    The al-Da'awah also urged the Lebanese authorities to  protect  Iraqi dissidents living in Lebanon.    The London-based Free Iraqi Council opposition group said  al-Suhayl was a distinguished opposition figure extremely active  in trying to bring about change in Iraq."    He was involved with a group of senior Iraqi officers and  officials from Tikrit and Mosul in a plot to topple Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn, the group said.    It also charged that the US intelligence service CIA was  implicated in al-Suhayl's assassination.    The CIA has turned down his request for help in plotting  Saddam's downfall and probably betrayed him, the Free Iraqi  Council said.    "The CIA must have passed on the information to Saddam  Husayn  who went on to assassinate hundreds of army officers and other  figures in July 1993," it said.    According to officials al-Suhayl was killed Tuesday night by  a man who knocked on his door pretending to be a delivery boy.  When al-Suhayl appeared the killer pulled out a gun with a  silencer and shot him dead.    Security forces staked out the Iraqi embassy in the northern  suburbs at dawn and arrested two diplomats as they arrived. The  Iraqis were carrying guns which may have been used in the  killing.    Iraqi charge d'affaires 'Awwad Fakhri was summoned Wednesday  to the Lebanese foreign ministry but he told reporters he was  not aware of the facts.</p>

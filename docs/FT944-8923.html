			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: EdF to invest up to FFr2bn a year in Asia Electricite de France (EdF), the French state-owned electric utility, plans to invest up to FFr2bn (Dollars 377m) a year in power projects in Asia and is looking for partners, Reuter reports from Singapore. 'Our aim in the next few years is to be spending around FFr2bn each year in acquiring equity in power projects in Asia,' said Mr Pierre Moriette, managing director at EdF's new representative office in Singapore. 'Our policy is to get a 20 to 40 per cent equity stake and a role in the operation of the power plant,' Mr Moriette said. 'We're not looking to make a fast buck. We want a reasonable return over the long term,' he said. EdF aims to build some 2,000MW a year of new power generation capability in Asia over the next 10 years, and already has projects in China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Laos. The group plans to open an office in Beijing by the end of the year, in addition to the Singapore office which will be formally opened next month. EdF already has offices in Jakarta and Hong Kong. In 1993, EdF earned FFr3.1bn in net income, up from FFr2.5bn in the previous year.</p>

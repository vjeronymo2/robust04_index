			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAMS SITS AND CLIPPERS LOSE TO SUNS, 120-113  </P> <P> Don Casey, who in his short tenure as a National Basketball Assn. head coach  has sometimes been critical of his own maneuvers, dismissed any second-guessing  this time.  </P> <P> In the closing minutes of the Clippers' eventual 120-113 loss to Phoenix  Thursday night before 11,089 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Reggie Williams had  as much chance of getting into the game as the Suns' gorilla mascot.  </P> <P> Forget that he is the best three-point shooter on the team -- and, with Quintin  Dailey on the suspended list, the biggest outside threat.  </P> <P> With the Clippers surprisingly in the game and looking for their second  straight win after losing 19 in a row, Williams wouldn't get a chance on  offense because of his defense.  </P> <P> "Every time he was guarding a man, the guy scored," Casey said after the  Clippers dropped to 11-37. "I think there's a trade-off."  </P> <P> So Williams will continue to get minimal playing time until his defense  improves?  </P> <P> "That would be a good supposition," the coach said.  </P> <P> Other assumptions could be made after the Clippers lost for the 31st time in 36  games: None of the Clipper guards had much success on defense, as Kevin  Johnson's 34 points and 18 assists will attest.  </P> <P> And Williams, who played only 12 minutes against the Suns, all in the first  half, after just 22 the night before in the victory over Houston, is becoming  despondent.  </P> <P> "That (the knock on his defense) is the same stuff Gene Shue talked about,"  said Williams, who is shooting 43.8% this season after just 35.6% as a rookie.  "I play good defense, I rebound, I pass. I guess they have to find some excuse  not to play me.  </P> <P> "I don't know why they benched me all of a sudden. Everyone else gets the  chance to get into a rhythm and feel good. I'm out there, and if I make a  mistake, I'm out. I need the minutes to look good just like everyone else.  </P> <P> "I'm being shortchanged. I work hard during the games and at practice and  should be able to get the playing time."  </P> <P> Johnson had 14 assists in the first two quarters, setting a franchise record  for the most in a half. He finished by scoring 13 points in the fourth quarter,  mostly on free throws, to help hold off the Clippers, who had rallied from 20  points down in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Benoit Benjamin scored a season-high 29 points for the Clippers, while Ken  Norman, after scoring 32 against Houston, had 27. . . . Danny Manning, three  weeks after his knee operation, said he wasn't able to follow the just-ended  Clipper losing streak very closely, although he is considering coming to a game  soon. "Right now, I'm kind of in my own world," Manning said, referring to his  concentrated efforts on rehabilitation.  </P></p>

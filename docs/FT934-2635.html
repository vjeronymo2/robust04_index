			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: A monster that may ruin St Petersburg - Architecture St Petersburg is the most perfectly planned and impressively classical city in Europe. I was overwhelmed by its beauty on my first visit in last week's heavy snows. I had expected the huge scale of everything, the sense of autocratic grandeur and the glorious use of colour, but I had not appreciated that St Petersburg is more than a city of wonderful individual buildings - it is itself a great architectural landscape. The other surprise for me was not that the city reaches aesthetic perfection as the apogee of the neo-Classical style, but that it is so romantic. Views in the city are on such a scale that columns become like trees and groves, with statues and trophies that catch the eye in arcadian scenes. Of course the snow helped - and the silence at night, the lack of cars and the absence of advertising. At night the city still has a romance that has been killed in most west European cities. It is properly lit so that parts are dark and there is no hideous overall sodium glow. A permanent sense of political potency lingers in St Petersburg like no other city on earth. It is not a part of the great semi-Asiatic continent to which it is the Baltic gateway. Instead St Petersburg has a sense of European 18th and 19th-century harmony that gives it an extraordinarily enlightened and civilised face. Peter the Great founded the city in 1703 as an act of will to demonstrate that Russia could be dragged out of the medieval darkness into the glow of the enlightenment. He never saw the scale of the city that we see now. But it is his dreams that have flourished upon the wooden and stone piles that he drove relentlessly into the impossible marshes. This strange and violent founder of the city had his own son killed in the Fortress of St Peter and Paul; Tsar Paul I was later strangled in the magnificent Mikhailov Palace. Crowds were shot at outside the Winter Palace; and no one in St Petersburg can forget the long Nazi siege and the longer tyranny of communism. It is impossible for visitors not to sense the depth and misery of the past while rejoicing at the visual riches of the city today. There is also the sense of bafflement for foreigners who have endured the recent years of cold war to find a formerly communist country where the Tsarist past has been both respected and rebuilt. The palaces of Tsars look as splendid today as they ever have - and the work continues with the rebuilding of Tsarkoye Selo and the accurate reinstatement of much of the work of that great Scottish architect, Charles Cameron, who was employed by Catherine the Great and her son. Evidence is everywhere of an incredibly high standard of craftsmanship and a continuity of architectural and decorative traditions. I was particularly honoured to visit the Russian Academy of Fine Arts Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in its huge, palatial premises on the bank of Vasilyevsky Ostrov, designed in the mid-18th century by Vallin de la Mothe, who was also its first professor of architecture. I have never felt such a sense of cultural continuity as I felt in the halls and corridors of this vulnerable palace. On its walls hang the diploma works of its artist students in unbroken ranks from the 1750s. Life drawings and paintings process in uninterrupted lines on the walls of the great rooms. Although for more than two centuries the subject matter and approach has hardly changed, it is possible to sense the precise dates when the work was executed by the very atmosphere that they exude. Like the steps of classical ballet the rigorous rules of the fine arts can be interpreted, once learned, with originality. This tangible tradition extends to the teaching of architecture, and the display of great wooden models of some of the major buildings of St Petersburg is a unique and inspirational three-dimensional archive. The architectural students of today are well trained in the traditions but uncertain which direction to follow. Their cultural isolation has, until now, saved them from the barmier aspects of Modernism and the cruder efforts of western commercialism. But terrible clouds lurk on the horizon. At a recent Prince of Wales's Business Leaders Forum in the city the full horror of one proposal for St Petersburg was unveiled. The proposal to build a giant and pointless tower block on the western part of Vasilyevsky Ostrov for offices, 'food-courts and a business centre', has been promoted by the Corporation of The Twentieth Trust, a group that has grown out of a state construction and contracting company and is now privatising itself. The most shaming aspect of the whole absurd and damaging proposal is that it is designed by a British firm of architects who should be hanging their heads in shame. Wilson Mason and Partners may well have been chosen because they have representative offices in Russia - as they have in the Middle East and (God help us) in Prague. This scheme looks like a pathetic copy of Canary Wharf and I am sure that Mr Oleg Kharchenko, the deputy mayor and chief city architect, will refuse permission for this monster to rise and be seen above the glories of the unsullied centre of St Petersburg. It would be a terrible error for St Petersburg to copy the ludicrous mistake of Canary Wharf and London's Docklands. Neither of these is an example of commercial or architectural intelligence. St Petersburg should advance slowly. An independent Anglo-Russian initiative has been launched by the architect Robert Adam and Professor Semion Mikhailovsky at the Russian Academy to hold a conference and exhibition at The Hermitage in September next year. Why should yet another city be ruined by inept commercialism and the adoption of bankrupt architectural ideas from the west? St Petersburg deserves great thought and care before anything is done that will make it exactly like everywhere else. The Peter the Great Tower, as this proposed excrescence is called, is an insult to the city and must not be built.</p>

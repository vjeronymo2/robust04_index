			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 14 March Mr. Filip Dimitrov received a delegation  of the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia led by Ivan  Grigorov, chairman of the Union.    During the meeting, which was attended by Asparukh Panov,  deputy chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] on  foreign policy issues, the guests imparted information related  to the crude violation of the rights of the Bulgarian minority  in the spheres of religion, education, use of their native  tongue, and preserving cultural and historical heritage. Alarm  was expressed over the attempts to ban the Democratic Union of  Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, officially forcing the Bulgarians to  adopt Serbian names and disseminating the thesis of the  existence of a Serbian-Shop [Bulgarian Sofia region peasant]  nation.    The possibilities of rendering practical help on the part of  the SDS in the sphere of training pupils, students, and graduate  students were discussed. The SDS committed itself to defending  the rights of the Bulgarians in Yugoslavia in accordance with  the international documents.    The Democratic Union of the Bulgarian in Yugoslavia invited  an official SDS delegation to visit the regions of Bosilegrad  and Tsaribrod in the near future.</p>

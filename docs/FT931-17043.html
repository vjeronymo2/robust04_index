			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A little chandlery still clinging to the rigging - A small shopkeeper's fight to stay afloat in a hostile climate CORNER shops are businesses. They are one of the simplest forms of enterprise allowing owners to be their 'own man.' They also account for a substantial chunk in the long litany of recent small company collapses. Sometimes, it is a case of too many newsagents in one neighbourhood, or a village where economic life has been deadened by weekenders. In others, it is a personal failure to grasp the basics of buying and selling and controlling costs. The short history of Yacht Parts, a marine chandlery actually housed in a larger-than-average corner shop in London, shows many of the serious difficulties afflicting small shop-based operations. The owner, Adrian Burks, remains confident about the company's future, but he can reflect on a series of crises since he started up in 1984. Opening another site in East Anglia nearly three years ago wrecked the company's cash flow and nearly broke it. Switches in customer demand have been awkward to deal with, and a computer system difficult to set up and run. Lower profit margins have dogged the business. In its first full year, Yacht Parts broke even on a turnover of Pounds 90,000. In 1991, it squeezed a profit of Pounds 6,000 on Pounds 345,000 turnover. In the year to September 1992, it rolled up a loss of Pounds 13,000 on Pounds 254,000. So, it is hardly surprising that 36-year-old Burks says: 'It has become clear, as a result of analysing both costs and sales, that a big marketing effort is needed to increase turnover to cover costs. In the past, we have been drowning in our own mess. We have cut costs and I feel we can increase turnover by a quarter over the next 12 months.' Now, Burks is accelerating the process of transforming Yacht Parts from a chandlery serving the recession-hit boating fraternity to a broader supplier of products, from outdoor clothing to rigging for the interior design industry. With his brother, Burks inherited a yacht-chartering business before joining one of the handful of chandleries in London. In 1984, the brothers set up their own business in the same premises Burks still uses in Fulham. 'We had Pounds 5,000 of our own money, Pounds 5,000 from an investor friend and a Pounds 10,000 overdraft from Lloyd's bank.' Rent was then Pounds 5,000 a year but, with rates, has risen to more than Pounds 18,000. The shop still caters for boat-owners living in London. But, two-and-a-half years ago, Burks made the mistake of opening another arm at Shotley, Norfolk. 'It's at the end of a peninsula served by a small marina road. The only captive market was the boats in the marina and the promise of a larger marina development never materialised. 'We were there for a year. We didn't take a direct loss but we bought in a lot of stock, some of which we had to sell at below cost. It gave us terrible cash flow problems from which we are only beginning to pull out.' Burks is most concerned now with is the need to move the business further away from its roots. The Fulham shop is still packed with stuff for messing about in boats, from dinghy splash suits and compasses to floating winch handles and miniature electronic navigation systems. But he is fleeing from some of the products on which the company was built. Chandlery, which accounted for 60 per cent of business four years ago, now makes up less than a third of sales and is likely to fall to 20 per cent or so. Burks explains: 'That is partly because margins are so low due to the recession and the difficulties of managing hardware. Holding chandlery stocks can be a nightmare.' He cites the 500 types of stainless steel screws used in boats, and the chandlery supplier with a 300-page catalogue covering thousands of products. Second-hand equipment, from navigation lights to portable toilets, has dropped from a quarter of Yacht Parts' business to just a few per cent. 'People are keeping hold of things much longer,' he says. Sales of electronic equipment are also much less important. 'There are specialist mail order companies doing this. What's the point of making Pounds 5 on a Pounds 200 item?' To compensate, he is counting on clothing and rigging. A much wider range of outdoor clothing and shoes now makes up more than a third of sales, and Yacht Parts has negotiated a couple of exclusive distribution arrangements with British clothing suppliers. Burks says rigging accounts for a quarter of sales and this is growing, particularly for building work and interior design. One of his contracts - which includes installation - is a design feature at a London suburban railway station. Yacht Parts has some heavy overheads. Burks' modest yearly salary is Pounds 14,000, wages are Pounds 21,000 a year; transport Pounds 7,000 and a stand at the London Boat Show, and preparations for it, Pounds 8,000. 'We tried to do without advertising, but that was a mistake and we are spending about Pounds 13,000 a year on that.' Burks still faces big problems with turnover and lack of profit. He plans to try to raise prices by 10-15 per cent and use much more direct marketing. That includes direct mail promotions for the firm's rigging service to theatres, exhibition halls and sports facilities, and direct mail to yacht charter operators and yacht clubs. Yacht Parts has started offering deals to businesses in west London, allowing their staff discount prices on its goods. To help control stocks, potential customers can now sit in an office and choose chandlery items from a battery of catalogues. Burks will order the goods as one-off items. The company also took 18 months to get its Pounds 1,200 computer system running properly. 'A friend eventually acted as consultant,' says Burks, who has never taken a business course. He admits: 'I would have benefited from one. A friend of mine has an MBA and he has lit up a lot of things, even with a simple question like: 'How much is that photo-copier really costing you?' I had no idea.' Burks says the business was in real trouble in the spring. 'I had cash flow and stock control problems. The pick-up in trade did not take place. I felt very low. I was looking at a black hole.' But two new investors have injected Pounds 20,000 between them. 'That picked me up and I now have more people to offer advice,' says Burks. He recognises, though, that a lot of work, carefully thought-out decisions and a bit of luck will be necessary to put the business on a more secure footing.

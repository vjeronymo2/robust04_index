			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / People: Herbert retires from Tussauds Michael Herbert, who joined the Madame Tussaud's waxworks when there were still Tussauds in the business, is retiring after 18 years as chief executive of Tussauds, which is part of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Herbert, who will retire on April 30 1994 at the age of 60, has overseen Tussauds' growth into the UK's leading commercial operator of leisure attractions visited by over 8m visitors a year. Apart from Madame Tussaud's, the group now includes Alton Towers and Warwick Castle which rank among the UK's top ten visitor attractions. When Herbert joined Tussauds in 1967, as its first accountant, it was an 'unfashionable little public company' chaired by Reuters' Sir Christopher Chancellor. It had poor financial controls, was visited by 1m people a year, and was suffering from fierce competition from rival attractions such as the London Zoo. Herbert took over as finance director in 1971 and the group was trying to buy Chessington Zoo from a subsidiary of Pearson when it found itself the subject of a contested bid battle from Lew Grade, the television impresario. Pearson won the day in 1978 and Herbert stayed on as chief executive. One of the keys to Tussauds' success is that it has never made any attempt to call itself a museum. 'We are in the entertainment business,' says Herbert, who believes that this approach has helped Madame Tussaud's, in particular, survive periodic threats from rival attractions ranging from the advent of cinema to the hologram. He will be succeeded by Michael Jolly, 41, Tussauds' chief operating officer, who joined the group in 1983 after working on the marketing side of Cadbury Schweppes.</p>

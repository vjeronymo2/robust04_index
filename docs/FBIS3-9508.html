			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by B. Geroski: "Symptomatic Exclusivity"] </F>   [Text] The interrupted session of the communal assembly is  expected to be resumed in Tetovo today, when the board members  will discuss the recent arrests of four citizens of Albanian  nationality who were caught with a considerable quantity of  firearms. The PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] and the NDP  [People's Democratic Party] link this case to the "paramilitary  army" affair and demand the release of those arrested, as well  as the liberation of the group accused of creating paramilitary  formations.    Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski's attempt to persuade  the Tetovo board members at the first (interrupted) session that  the latest arrests had nothing to do with the affair, and thus  had no political background, was obviously inadequate. Today,  the Justice and Administration Minister, Tuse Gosev, is expected  in Tetovo. However, it is still an open question whether the new  round of pressure will produce any results.    According to the latest information of the PDP and NDP, and  the Democratic Forum for Protection of Human Freedoms and Rights  in Macedonia, located in Gostivar, any serious discussion of the  case was undermined from the outset. That is, the leading  political formations of the Albanians in Macedonia saw the  latest arrests as factor in the affair, as an attempt to  discredit the PDP, as a manipulated political process, an  organized action against the Albanians, as a great provocation,  and so on. Since the event has been characterized in such  political terms, one can expect that today's discussion between  the Tetovo board members and the representatives of the  executive authority will develop into a discussion between the  deaf.    The case of those arrested in Tetovo (four) and Gostivar  (two) is clean, at least as far as concerns the police. They  are all accused under Article 218 of the Macedonian Criminal  Code -- the carrying of arms and explosives is prohibited. The  Tetovo group was, for instance, caught with 28 firearms  (automatic rifles) and 10 bombs. Nonetheless, the straight  description of the deed refers to data in which the authorities  do not link it with the "paramilitary soldiers." Therein lies  the dilemma -- why do the PDP and NDP do so?    We can to some extent understand the strength of feeling in  the political representative body of Albanians in Macedonia, and  the fact that all cases are seen through the prism of the PDP's  internal party conflicts. However, does this mean that arms  smugglers will no longer be affected by law if they are  Albanians because they might be connected with the "paramilitary  army" affair? Can anybody in this state be granted such an  exclusive position? Finally, is it permissible to ask for  Macedonian state bodies (administration) to be substituted with  an international commission, not to allow for the possible  monitoring of the events in the "paramilitary army" affair  (which could be accepted), but for "clarifying the case"?</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILLESPIE JUDGESHIP  </P> <P> Gillespie failed miserably in her appointed position as insurance commissioner.  The fact that she failed to uphold Prop. 103 places her in a position similar  to (former Chief Justice) Rose Bird who also failed to uphold another law that  was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of this state, the death penalty.  </P> <P> The fact that Deukmejian has indicated a desire to appoint Gillespie to a  Superior Court judgeship before leaving office clearly indicates that his  position was also very soft toward the insurance companies and their campaign  to ignore Prop. 103.  </P> <P> It's no wonder voters are so disgusted with the political system. It stinks!  </P> <P> CLARENCE W. HAYWARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nice, France, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii on Wednesday [4 May] proposed that the  1997 annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] be held  in Fukuoka, western Japan. The 1997 meeting will be the 30th  anniversary of the bank's founding.    Fujii made the invitation in a speech before the ADB's 27th  Annual General Meeting that opened in Nice on Tuesday for a  three-day run as the Manila-based financial institution faces  the task of raising its capital base.    If the proposal is accepted, it would be the first in 10  years and the third time for Japan to host an ADB annual meeting  following the 20th meeting held in Osaka in 1987. Fujii said  the Japanese city has played an historical role in promoting  ties with the Asia-Pacific region and its importance will be  greater in the region.    Turning to the issue of raising the bank's capital, Fujii  appealed for endorsing a bank proposal to double the capital to  smooth disbursement of bank loans to meet growing funding needs  in the Asia-Pacific region, whose economy is expected to grow  faster than any other region.    A vote on the capital increase is scheduled for May 22.    Fujii also pointed to the need for the bank to shift away  from development-oriented financial help to fighting poverty and  developing social infrastructures such as health and medical  facilities and protecting the environment.    He also pointed to difficult fiscal conditions in member  countries and called for the bank to provide funds in an  efficient manner.    Before giving the speech, Fujii met with U.S. Deputy  Treasury  Secretary Roger Altman to discuss pending bilateral economic  issues, according to Japanese officials.    Fujii told Altman that Japan has not changed its policy of  promoting economic reforms and deregulation despite a recent  cabinet reshuffle and is ready to pass the overdue fiscal 1994  national budget as early as possible while carrying out tax  reforms, they said. The issue of how to stabilize exchange  rates was also on the agenda, they said.</p>

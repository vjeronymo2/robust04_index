			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / It's official: Budget increases will not tax recovery It's now official. In the Treasury's view, the tax increases of last year's two Budgets will not stall Britain's economic recovery. The Treasury's summer economic forecast, published yesterday, revised up the prediction of economic growth this year to 2 3/4 per cent from 2 1/2 per cent at the November Budget. It also projects growth of 2 3/4 per cent next year in the government's first official forecast for next year. At the same time, underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments, is projected to be 2 1/2 per cent in the final quarter of this year, substantially lower than the 3 1/4 per cent forecast in the Budget. At the end of next year, the Treasury expects underlying inflation of 2 3/4 per cent, still within the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range but above the lower half of the band in which the government has pledged to have inflation by the end of this parliament. The prices charged by manufacturers at the factory gate are also likely to be moving up by the end of next year. Although the Treasury expects producer output price inflation to fall to 1 1/2 per cent by the end of this year from 2 per cent in May and 3 per cent in autumn last year, it expects a rise to a 'temporary peak' of 2 1/2 per cent by the end of next year, reflecting more expensive raw materials, higher unit wage costs and pressure by companies to increase margins. The Treasury has been able to build its more upbeat assessment of Britain's prospects on improvements in the world economic outlook. US growth in particular picked up more sharply than expected in the second half of last year and appears to have kept up momentum in the first half of this year. While a question mark still hangs over Japan, there are 'more convincing signs of recovery' on the European continent. Growth in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations as a whole is now forecast to be 2 1/2 per cent this year -  1/2 percentage point above the Budget forecast - rising to 2 3/4 per cent next year. Recent monthly indicators 'suggest that the economy continues to have plenty of upward momentum' with retail sales 'on a strong upward trend' and business surveys pointing to 'continued healthy expansion of manufacturing output in the months ahead'. Although the forecast says growth of consumer spending may slow a little in the short term as a result of tax increases, this is not expected to be reflected in gross domestic product. The forecast notes that car registrations have weakened in recent months while recovery in the housing market has stalled. But it does not seem too concerned by these developments. Instead, the Treasury expects the personal savings sector ratio, which fell last year to 11 1/2 per cent from 12 1/4 per cent in 1992, will fall further this year to less than 10 per cent. This, and a quickening of disposable income growth to 2 1/2 per cent next year from 1 per cent in 1994, should enable consumers' expenditure to increase by 3 per cent both in this year and next. The forecast expresses measured optimism about the corporate sector and investment. Profitability, which started to recover in 1992, is expected to strengthen further this year. Although business investment has yet to show signs of improving after last year's 1 1/2 per cent fall, the Treasury sees increases of 3 1/2 per cent this year and 7 per cent next year. Investment in private dwellings and land, which rose just  1/2 per cent last year, is forecast to increase 4 per cent this year and 4 1/2 per cent next year. The UK's current account balance of payments, which showed a Pounds 11bn deficit last year, is forecast to continue in the red but not to deteriorate. The Pounds 9 1/2 bn shortfall forecast for this year is unchanged from the projection in the November Budget. A further current account deficit of Pounds 9 1/2 bn has been forecast for next year. The Treasury expects the visible trade deficit, which was Pounds 13 1/2 bn last year, to be unchanged this year and to narrow to Pounds 12bn next year. Summer Economic Forecast, HM Treasury. HMSO. Pounds 6.</p>

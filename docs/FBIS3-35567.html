			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb. 27, IRNA -- Iranian morning dailies  Sunday condemned the Friday massacre of Muslim Palestinians by  the Zionists at Ibrahim mosque in al-Khalil [Hebron] and said it  would entail grave consequences.    The English daily KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL said that the  Palestinians were sure to make the Zionists pay heavily for  their crimes.    The fact that "such a despicable act should have occurred in  the holy month of Ramadhan and that too in a sacred place and at  a time when Muslims were in prayer speaks of volumes of the  peace proclamations that Zionist Premier Yitzhaq Rabin has been  making since he signed the fraudulent autonomy agreement with  PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat on September 13 in Washington."    Refuting Tel Aviv claims to distance from the massacre by  blaming the incident on a lone deranged gunman, the article said  such a destructive crime could not have been carried out single  handed and it's certain that the Zionist regime was involved in  the premeditated murderous attack.    "Sponsoring state terrorism is not a new game for the  Zionist  regime," said the daily adding, "it is a part of state policy,  backed by its Western allies, ever since Israel was created 45  years ago."    The editorial criticized Western governments for turning a  blind eye and remaining silent on the Zionist atrocities against  Palestinian Muslims.    Referring to Washington's approach, it said while it quickly  condemns "acts of terrorism" or calls for a halt to violence by  the Palestinians it has never asked the Zionist regime to disarm  the Jewish settlers or give up their provocative acts even after  initiating the peace process.    It reminded that the Jewish settlers in Hebron were armed  with the latest military equipment and that the Jewish  extremists wanted to turn the region into a Jewish town and  therefore had indulged in provocative acts to force out the  Palestinian residents.    Turning to the "sincere condolences" expressed by Rabin on  this occasion, the paper said, "Rabin has mastered the art of  speaking peace through one end and firing bullets through the  other."    On claims by peace brokers that Israel and the PLO are more  than half-way to launching Palestinian self-rule, it said, "in  reality the Zionists are more than half-way to wiping out the  Arab population in the land of the Palestinians."    Another English daily TEHRAN TIMES criticized the  indifference shown by the West to the Palestinian plight and  said that the world Muslims should take the initiative and begin  implementing independent measures to resolve this historical  injustice.    "The world Muslims, particularly the Palestinians, can use  their own potentials and capabilities derived from Islam and its  traditions to reject those leaders who still believe in making  peace with the butchers of Tel Aviv, and remove the Israeli  cancer from the body of Islamic Middle East."    It said that the illegal Jewish settlements populated by  recent Russian and East European immigrants are ripe for  physical violence because of social, religious and cultural  incompatibility of the Zionists with the indigenous Palestinian  population.    Turning to the Zionists' refusal to abide by U.N.  resolutions, it said that the Jews have believed that they can  not only steal Palestine but also massacre Palestinian Muslims.    "The selective and totally biased way in which the U.N.  implements its own resolutions regarding Palestine is weighing  heavily on the world's conscience, while the United States, as  Israel's military supplier and financial supporter, bears the  major share of guilt for Palestine's miseries as well as for  this latest Zionist savagery."    The daily refuted the U.S. attempts to introduce itself as  an  honest broker in the Arab-Israel conflict that has humanitarian  motives free from political and financial considerations.    "But the recent history of U.S. and Western European  mediation in this conflict has proven that the West only acts  when it is assured that the consequences of its actions are not  against Israel or Western interests.    Commenting on the same subject, the Persian daily JOMHURI-YE  ESLAMI said that all should enter the scene to take revenge for  the massacre of innocent Palestinian Muslims.    The incident, the daily noted, unveiled the true nature of  the Zionists at the international scene and to the world nations.    This showed that Palestinians are not secure even in their  mosques and at the time of prayer. However, said the article,  this is while the traitor 'Arafat and his compromising faction  are even ready to massacre Palestinians to guarantee further  safety for the Zionists.    The occupied Palestine is passing through sensitive and  determining moments, stressed the article, adding that the  crime, aimed at cementing 'Arafat-Israel compromise, reveals the  vicious alliance of Zionism and its supporters.    "However, there is evidence showing that the enemy has  repeated the same big blunder in this connection and the  Palestinian nation will tremble the earth under the feet of the  usurper Zionists," concluded the daily.</p>

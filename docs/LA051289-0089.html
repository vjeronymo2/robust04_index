			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Comedian Eddie Murphy has been sued for $75 million by actress Michael Michele  Williams, 22, who alleges that Murphy had her fired from his film "Harlem  Nights" because she spurned his advances. Williams, who performs under the name  Michael Michele, also sued Paramount Pictures over her dismissal. Williams  claims in her New York suit that she was removed from the proposed TV version  of Murphy's "Coming to America" so she could appear opposite him in "Harlem  Nights." Williams' lawsuit claims Murphy "made consistent, personal overtures"  that she "did not desire" and alleges that Murphy had her fired "when it became  clear" that she "would not accede to his sexual demands."

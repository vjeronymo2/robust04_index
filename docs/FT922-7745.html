			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: Daylight at last for capital shares - Serious Money REMEMBER those weather houses where one figure emerges if it is raining and the other if it is fine? The shares of split capital investment trusts are rather like that. Until recently, the dull conditions of the UK stock market have kept capital shares inside the house in the dark. They will be repaid only after all the other assets of a split capital trust have claimed their due. Thus, they depend on a healthy rate of asset growth to bring their investors a decent return (in some cases, any return at all). Without rising share prices, the average share capital fell 5.6 per cent in the three years to April 30, according to Micropal. Since the re-election of the Conservatives the sun has, metaphorically, been shining and the London stock market has surged ahead. And, sure enough, capital shares have emerged into the daylight. The best-performing investment trust shares in April were the capital shares of Scottish National, which rose by 88.2 per cent] A number of other capital shares, including those of M&amp;G Income, rose by more than 20 per cent. Until now, capital shares have tended to be neglected by the private investor because they offer neither income nor security. The class of shares that has really been tucked away is the zero coupon. These can also offer tax-free double-digit returns, at least to those who do not expect to use up their capital gains tax allowances (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93). And they can do so without much risk of capital loss, unlike some income shares. The double-digit yields available on income shares, particularly when placed in a personal equity plan, have obvious attractions. Until the election, though, income shares had appeared to be joining capital shares in the dingy confines of the weather house. The main worry was that, to produce the dividend stream, splits have to invest in high-yielding listed stocks. Not only have such companies been hit badly by the recession but it is probable that dividend growth will be much slower in the 1990s than the 1980s. All this meant that the income share sector fell 7.3 per cent over the six months to end-April (and that includes a post-election rally). David Thomas, the investment trust expert at stockbroker Greig Middleton, argues that income shares are now cheap and favours M&amp;G Dual and SPLIT, in particular. He says the market has now set prices which assume only very minimal future dividend growth. Lewis Aaron, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. agrees. He points out that some income shares have little risk; their repayment values are covered by assets. He cites the income shares of River &amp; Mercantile which, he says, will yield 10.88 per cent to maturity without any dividend growth. Investors should, however, always be aware of what they are buying in the income share field. In some cases, the shares have no repayment value at all; in others, the repayment value may be geared to the asset performance of the trust. In other words, the income could come at the expense of a capital loss. This is a field where you should be guided by your stockbroker. Indeed, there is a more fundamental question to deal with here. As recounted before, there are some who argue that the whole split capital sector could be riding for a fall. The investors who were sucked in during the new issue boom may not have realised what they were buying. Peter Walls of Laing &amp; Cruickshank argued recently that many split trusts are trading at a premium to their net assets. Eventually, that premium must be eliminated, which means that the shares of the trust must underperform the assets. Why buy such shares, therefore, when you can buy shares in a general trust which are trading at a discount? Thomas, in contrast, is a devoted enthusiast for the split sector. His argument is based on the fact that split trusts are 'dated'; in other words, there is a given day on which they will be repaid. The share price is a reflection of the 'present value' of that future repayment level. This present value is highly sensitive to interest rates. Asked if you would rather have Pounds 10 now, or Pounds 10 in 10 year's time, the logical person would opt for the money up front. If the money on offer increased to Pounds 20 after 10 years, the calculation might be more difficult. The rational way of making the decision would be to ask how much Pounds 10 would be worth if invested for the next 10 years - and that depends on interest rates. If interest rates are 10 per cent, then Pounds 10 now will be worth Pounds 11 in one year's time. If rates are 5 per cent, then it will be worth just Pounds 10.50. Turn the equation round and it is clear that a fall in interest rates will increase the present value of any given future sum. The general expectation is that interest rates are set to fall in the medium term. So, to return to Thomas's argument: 'The repayment figure (of splits) is going to rise. The level of dividends will rise as well'. Add-in falling interest rates and Thomas says the prices of dated shares will rise very sharply. Whether or not you accept his arguments, it seems clear that the split capital sector is going to offer some interesting opportunities for private investors over the next few years. But selecting the right opportunities - the 'sunny day' shares - will continue to be a difficult game, requiring good advice.</p>

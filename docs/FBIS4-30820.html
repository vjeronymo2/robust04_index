			<p>BFN     [Text] Goran Percevic, vice president of the Socialist  Party of Serbia [SPS], in a statement for Belgrade Radio  maintains that the sanctions against the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia [FRY] that were imposed two years ago had the goal of  destroying Serbia economically and thwarting its policy of aid  and solidarity with the struggle of the Serbian people in the  republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina. Two  years later, we can say that Serbia and the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia have managed to withstand this terrible pressure --  that is, that the sanctions have not accomplished their goal --  said Percevic, and added that Serbia had had a dignified  response to this attempt at economic destruction. I believe  that this latest economic program that is being implemented in  Serbia represents an economic response to the attempt at  economic genocide over our country and people, said SPS Vice  President Goran Percevic, in a statement for Radio Belgrade on  the second anniversary of the sanctions.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Buyers of property bonds look for firm foundations THE SLUMP in the UK property market continues to pose awkward questions for holders of bonds issued by property companies and developers. The downturn is still eating into the credit quality of issuers. Last week, IBCA, the UK credit rating agency, said it was reviewing the credit ratings of all the UK property companies it analyses. The review covers the long-term credit ratings of some the UK's largest property investment companies: Land Securities, MEPC, Hammerson, British Land, Slough Estates, Capital &amp; Counties and Brixton Estate. Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two biggest US rating agencies, have already downgraded a number of companies in the sector. Hammerson, for example, currently carries an A+ senior rating from IBCA, but is rated two notches below this level by Moody's and is already under review for a further downgrade. However, IBCA noted that the financial strength of property investment companies has shown an overall deterioration over the past two years. Of the companies rated by IBCA, debt interest cover averaged 1.7 times last year, down from 4.2 times in 1988. Average net gearing is now 60 per cent, up from 27 per cent in the same period. Even holders of secured bonds may not be immune from the downturn. Last week, the accounts of Regalian, the property developer, were qualified by its auditors on the grounds that its development sites and empty properties had no firm value. Against this background, bond market investors are demanding tighter covenants. Holders of debentures are particularly keen to keep track of the assets on which bonds are secured. Until recently, most secured bonds issued by UK property companies were not secured on particular assets. Instead, the issuer has the option of moving properties in and out of the pool of security at will - a feature known as substitutability. The issuer has an obligation to maintain a pool of security of a certain value - usually 150 per cent of the face value of the bonds. But properties can be swapped in and out of the security pool without informing bondholders. In contrast, most US property bonds are secured on a particular property or development. The assets are often 'ring-fenced' within a special purpose vehicle and revenue from the property goes towards servicing the debt. This does not insulate bondholders from falling property values. But the structure offers bondholders security of known quality. 'UK debenture holders assume they have proper security and look on their portfolio of mortgage bonds as insulated from concerns over corporate credit quality,' said Mr Hugh Corbett, head of corporate bond research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'Yet the weakness of covenants means that in some cases they are little better off than unsecured creditors.' Analysts point to London &amp; Provincial, a property subsidiary of Randsworth Acquisition, which went into administrative receivership in March. In the year prior to receivership, L&amp;P substituted properties out of the pool of assets which backed its Pounds 135m debentures, putting new assets in place. Under the terms of the issue there was no need to tell bondholders. The trustee, Law &amp; Debenture Trust, said a full valuation of the security now backing the bonds would take place before the end of June. But it is unlikely the valuation will be sufficient to meet the bond covenants. There are signs that holders of UK bonds are looking for similar safeguards. Last week, Allied London properties added Pounds 25m to an existing Pounds 50m long-dated bond issue, lead-managed by Schroder Securities. The bond covenants oblige the company to tell holders when it substitutes new properties into the pool of security. This type of covenant is now standard in sterling debenture issues. Amid the gloom there is an argument that debentures with strong covenants and ample security at current property prices now represent good value. For example, last week's Allied London issue is backed by security valued at 1.67 times the issue amount - slightly higher than the norm in the late 1980s. Moreover, since property valuations are now very low, the annual rental income from the bonds covers interest payments on the bonds 1.62 times, again higher than the usual ratio of interest cover in recent years. Together with tighter covenants, the position of bond holders should be more secure. The Allied London debenture issue even carries 'environmental protection' covenants, the first to do so: an environmental audit showed that none of the properties in the security pool were built on a contaminated site.</p>

			<p>921221 FT  21 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Israel bank share sale heavily oversubscribed A Shk150m (Dollars 58m) public share issue by the First International Bank of Israel was some 400 times oversubscribed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, testifying to pent-up demand for stock in the country's banks, most of which are majority-held by the government. Initial counts showed applications for the issue totalled about Shk60bn. Taken with a Shk100m offering placed with institutions, the issue amounts to a 20 per cent share in Fibi, Israel's fifth largest bank which is controlled by the Safra family of New York. The issue underlined the market's impatience for the government to sell its majority holdings in the four senior banks - Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Israel Discount Bank and Bank Mizrahi - on the stock exchange. Last month, the state's 42 per cent share in IDB Holding, the investment arm of Israeli Discount Bank, was successfully floated on the exchange, raising Dollars 350m in another heavily oversubscribed issue. However, the government's strategy of selling by private tender controlling shares in the core banks has come unstuck. Last week, the Bank of Israel refused to issue a banking permit to Mr Gad Ze'evi who had an agreement with the government to buy a controlling stake in Bank Mizrahi. First International Bank , traditionally the most profitable of the five main banks, aims to use the funds raised in the issue in its bid to buy Bank Igud, an offshoot of Bank Leumi being sold separately by the government.</p>

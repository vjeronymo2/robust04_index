			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Water watchdogs clash on clean-up THE TWO regulators of Britain's water industry, the National Rivers Authority and the Office of Water Services, clashed yesterday over the cost of cleaning up the country's water supplies. The authority accused Ofwat of exaggerating the cost of the clean-up, and providing misleading analyses of who should bear the costs. The authority is responsible for the quality of water while Ofwat regulates the performance of the water industry and controls prices.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Japan's jobless rate nears all-time high Further evidence of the weakness of the Japanese economy emerged yesterday with figures showing an increase in unemployment and a sharp fall in the inflation rate. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rose by 0.1 of a percentage point to 2.9 per cent in June, according to the government's Management and Co-ordination Agency. The jobless figure has been rising steadily since the recession began three years ago, and now stands just below its all-time high of 3.1 per cent recorded in May 1987. Separate figures released by the labour ministry revealed that the job offers-to-applicants ratio declined further last month to 0.63 per cent, the lowest level in more than seven years. The number of job offers fell in the year to June by 6.5 per cent while the number of applicants rose by 13.8 per cent. Employment fell sharply in all the main sectors of the economy, led by the wholesale, retail, and restaurant sector, with a drop of 170,000 workers from a year ago. Though most Japanese companies have maintained their commitment to lifetime employment, and have avoided compulsory redundancies, they have cut recruitment and encouraged earlier retirement. Mr Manso Hamamoto, the labour minister, said the figures showed the labour market was 'in a continuously precarious situation'. Most analysts agreed. Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Barings in Tokyo, said: 'Despite the reticence of companies to lay off en masse, the unemployment rate is likely to rise above 3 per cent in the next few months.' The inflation figures showed that consumer prices in Tokyo, the bellwether for the rest of the nation, fell in July by 0.3 per cent from a year ago, the first year-on-year drop since 1987. A sharp decline in fresh food prices was the principal cause of the fall, according to government officials. Poor weather last summer led to a sharp rise in prices a year ago, magnifying the year-on-year decline this month. But the core inflation rate, excluding food prices, also fell sharply to 0.6 per cent, the lowest level since September 1988. There was better news with the publication of figures showing an increase in housing starts and a rise in consumer confidence. The construction ministry reported that housing starts were up by 10.6 per cent on a year ago to 147,909 homes, and the Economic Planning Agency reported that its consumer sentiment index rose 7.8 per cent in the three months to the end of June. The index measures expectations in five categories: employment, income growth, prices, livelihood and durable goods purchases. But even here the good news was tempered by the fact that it was consumers' expectations of lower prices that contributed most to the increase in confidence. Economists were agreed that, overall, the figures were consistent with very sluggish growth this year. Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, said: 'Falling inflation and rising joblessness suggest that capacity continues to outstrip demand, pointing to a continuing weak performance by the Japanese economy for the foreseeable future.'</p>

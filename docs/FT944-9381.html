			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Yorkshire Bank courts mid-sized companies Growing competition among banks to lend to medium-sized companies was indicated yesterday when Yorkshire Bank, a subsidiary of National Australia Bank, unveiled plans to increase its share of the market.

Mr Peter Coleman, head of commercial banking, said it would concentrate on covenants relating to cashflow instead of being overdependent on securing loans.

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Cincinnati Milacron links with German metal group CINCINNATI MILACRON, the US machine tool-maker, is beefing up its sales effort in Germany through a tie-up with Stuttgart-based Hahn &amp; Kolb, one of the biggest sales and service companies for the German metalworking industry. The two companies have signed a sales representation agreement described by Milacron this week as one of the most significant in its history. Under the deal, Hahn &amp; Kolb will be responsible for the sales of Milacron's Sabre range of low-cost machining centres, which are designed and built at the US company's Birmingham plant in the UK. The Sabre range has been one of the most successful products of Milacron's Wolfpack programme for concentrating manufacturing, reducing product development times and increasing responsiveness to clients' needs to enable it to recapture markets for standard products lost to the Japanese. The German machine tool market is currently suffering from weak demand, along with the rest of Europe, but is generally reckoned to have a lot of long-term growth potential because of reunification. However, for foreign machine tool-builders a comprehensive sales network is essential to help overcome the German preference for buying domestic equipment. Mr Malcolm Scarlett, Milacron's UK sales director, said: 'We are excited and confident that this agreement will lead to a significant increase in Sabre sales in Germany.'</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Picketers from a dozen or so community groups who appeared on KVEA Channel 52's  doorstep Wednesday in Glendale, and then went inside to protest the alleged  under-representation of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the station's senior  management, appear to have had at least one of their demands met. Donald G.  Raider, vice president and chief operating officer of KVEA's parent Telemundo  network, contacted the demonstrators by telephone from New York and offered to  meet with their representatives June 28 in Los Angeles, protest organizers  said. Roxanna Brightwell, a network spokeswoman, confirmed the report. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

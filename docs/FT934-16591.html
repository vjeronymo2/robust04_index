			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / BR stations may be run by private sector under leasing plan DETAILED PLANS to lease out railway stations, transforming them from the 'Cinderellas' of British Rail by attracting private sector capital, were published yesterday by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. British Rail is to transfer the freehold of its 2,500 stations to Railtrack, the state-owned subsidiary, in April next year, Mr MacGregor told the Conservative party conference in Blackpool. Railtrack is expected to lease most stations to franchised train operators, but hive off the biggest mainline stations - which have extensive landholdings and development potential - to independent operators on leases of up to 125 years. 'These proposals are designed to bring in private sector finance and expertise to exploit their development and commercial trading potential,' Mr MacGregor said. Although income from station trading rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 41m out of the BR Property Board's Pounds 139m gross income from letting in 1992-93, Railtrack might find it difficult to persuade companies to buy leases for all 2,500. The government hopes that the 'vast majority' of stations will be taken on by the franchised passenger operators. But Sea Containers, which is keen to win the franchise for the Great Western main line, yesterday said it would not be interested in the lease, even for an important regional station such as Bristol Temple Meads. Railtrack is more likely to attract private sector interest for terminals in London and the largest UK cities. Ms Sarah Mansfield, general manager of L&amp;R Leisure group, which already owns the lease for one of two stations in Windsor, Berkshire, said the company would be interested in stations such as Oxford and York. The Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail users' watchdog, said it was important to maintain the balance between commercialisation and providing 'rail-based facilities', such as timetables and passenger announcements.

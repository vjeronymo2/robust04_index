			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: NM Smaller Australian seeks Pounds 25.8m NM Smaller Australian Companies Trust is raising Pounds 25.8m, before expenses, via a placing of ordinary shares at 100p each, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The new investment trust will invest in a portfolio of companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange which are not included in the ASX 50 Leaders Index. NM manages an Australian unit trust which is top of the Australasian sector over the three, five and 10 years to November 1, according to Micropal. NM Funds Management is owned by the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia. NM says the outlook for smaller Australasian companies is positive because they have cut costs and improved efficiency in recession. The trust will concentrate on capital appreciation and any dividends are likely to be modest. The initial life of the trust will be seven years. NatWest Wood Mackenzie is handling the placing and the minimum subscription is Pounds 20,000. Initial expenses of the issue will be about 2.7 per cent and the annual management fee will be 0.8 per cent.</p>

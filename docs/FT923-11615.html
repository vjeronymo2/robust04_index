			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Japanese car parts maker enters Europe PRESS Kogyo, a leading Japanese producer of pressed components for vehicles, has acquired a 43.9 per cent stake in Press and Platgruppen (PPG) of Sweden for just under Y600m (Dollars 4.8m). Following the acquisition, PPG is to set up a venture, Press and Plat, in Tongeren, Belgium, to supply pressings to Volvo's Belgian car production plant. Production is to start next year, with sales expected to reach SKr61m (Dollars 11.3m) in 1994 and SKr90m a year later. Isuzu Motors, Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors have minor shareholdings in Press Kogyo. Europe's components industry is likely to take a wary view of the announcement. Japanese car makers setting up 'transplant' manufacturing operations in Europe - notably Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK - have stressed they do not want to draw in large numbers of Japanese component suppliers in their wake as has happened in the US. However, there has been a slow increase in the number of Japanese suppliers establishing bases or joint ventures in Europe.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition drives car market Sir, Your editorial, 'Brussels' foot on the brake' (October 6) tacitly assumes that anything that looks good for producers has to be bad for consumers. Such an assumption would mean that manufacturers do not care about their customers, that they are not interested in competing with each other precisely in the area of customer service quality and that they need to be told by national and EU authorities how to be commercially successful. This assumption betrays a surprising ignorance of the competitive factors driving the automobile trade and a serious lack of commercial common sense. Despite all the imperfections of the yet to be completed Single Market, there is no sector that has become as truly pan-European and competitive as the motor vehicle industry, as any manufacturer which wishes to survive well knows. The 'perversity' referred to in your editorial is truly that of all too prevalent economic parochialism and an unnatural clinging to ideological catchwords, repeated ad nauseam. The single-minded objective of every car manufacturer has to be the highest possible level of every aspect of customer service. The present system of distribution is the best guarantee that competitive pressures will be sharpened. It is the customer who would pay for any upheaval in the system, through less service, quality, choice and competition, likely to result in higher prices. When will Europe's economic ayatollahs awaken to this fact? Rudolf Beger, executive secretary, European Automobile Manufacturers Association, Rue du Noyer 211, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium</p>

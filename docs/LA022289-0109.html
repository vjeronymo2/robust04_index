The boom of the forklift extended about 18  feet into the air, Lundquist said.  </P> <P> The truck passed under the Yorba Linda Boulevard overpass, but the boom struck  it, causing the forklift to overturn onto the freeway, Lundquist said.  </P> <P> The Orange County Fire Department was called to clean up spilled gasoline.

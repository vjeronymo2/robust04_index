			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Office of the president, in </F> Abidjan on 12 January; read by Communication Minister Danielle  Boni-Claverie]    [Text] For about 15 years now all Ivorians have been  experiencing the effects of the economic crisis, although the  effect was felt more by peasant farmers and the low-income  families of our country. This crisis was brought about mainly  by the fall in the prices of our main agricultural produce for  export, notably cocoa, coffee, cotton, palm oil, and rubber. As  you know, the economic crisis is not limited to Cote d'Ivoire  alone, it does not spare any country in Africa.    Since the beginning of the 1980's, most African countries  have been coping with this external constraints through the  implementation of structural adjustment programs and important  reforms, demanding increasing sacrifices from the people, were  effected. Of course, some considerable results were obtained,  but it is sad to note that the hope we expected from these  sacrifices has not as yet been sufficiently achieved. On the  contrary, we note that the daily difficulties of the  hard-working people have increased, which obviously calls for a  reform in the economic strategy.    It is within this context that the heads of state of African  countries, members of the franc zone, have just unanimously  decided, in consultation with France and all their development  partners, to use monetary adjustment as an instrument of  economic policy. In fact, in the face of persistent economic  and financial difficulties of each of their countries, and  having the improvement of the living conditions of their people  at heart, they feel that this measure will offer them new  chances to attain the objectives of lasting economic growth and  sustained development. To this end, with effect from 11  January, the exchange rate of the CFA franc has been modified as  follows: 100 CFA francs are equal to 1 French franc instead of  50 CFA francs to 1 French franc.    This adjustment in the exchange rate of the CFA franc will  considerably improve the competitiveness of our export  commodities, considerably increase the level of productive  investment, free our economic potentialities, and generate the  creation of new jobs. This historic decision of African heads of  state of the franc zone is the assertion of the solidarity,  which had, through intensified cooperation, enabled us to make  this zone a solid and dynamic monetary space for the benefit of  all its members. The modification in the exchange rate of the  CFA franc falls in line with the actions taken by our countires  to successfully carry out their common project concerning  particularly business laws, insurance settlements, social  security, and the specific knowledge of economic and social  realities.    Concerning our subregion, what must be stressed particularly  is the rich prospects now open by the important project of the  West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA, which has just  been created, because regional integration will multiply the  possibilities offered to each of our economies. The conditions  for a revival of the economic growth are not clear. It is up to  all -- businessmen, state functionaries, farmers, and private  sector workers, and so on -- to take advantage of all these new  opportunities created by the decision of the African heads of  state of the franc zone and act in such a way that our country  will, in unity, hard work, and peace, regain the exceptional  performance it accomplished in the past. A special appeal is  made to all private investors -- both nationals and foreigners  -- to play their role in the development of our country.    Concerning the immediate effects of the modification in the  exchange rate of our currency, it is worth stressing that the  normalization of our relations with the international financial  community will be translated into the regular payment of  salaries in the public sectors and parastatals. Concerning the  effects on prices, specific measures will be taken to mitigate  the effects of price hikes. But already a selective lowering of  taxes is envisaged with the intensification of financial  management of the state with an attendant radical improvement in  tax collection. The prime minister and minister of economy and  finance will address the nation on this subject in the next few  days to give all the details on all the necessary backup  measures concerning this decision.    Ivorians and friends of Cote d'Ivoire, who are not used to  devaluation so frequent in other countries, are called upon to  display a sense of calm and confidence in the future of our  country. They should receive the news of this devaluation as the  signal for a new departure for more effort, for more prosperity,  and profit.</p>

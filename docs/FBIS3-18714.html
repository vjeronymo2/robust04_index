			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Fritz Wirth: "Whitewater, High Water"] </F>   [Text] He who wants to be a president of change, as Bill  Clinton promised his voters, is automatically a president of  pain. Abandoning a certain routine and a past that has become  too easy usually involves a great deal of pain. Ironically  enough, so far no one has suffered more from Bill Clinton's  changes than the president himself and some of his closest  aides. The most noticeable change at the White House is a  strong touch of provincialism. The guard of advisers that he  brought from Arkansas threatens to fail because of the tough  climate in Washington. There has already been one suicide.    The provincial troop has plunged Clinton into his deepest  crisis to date. In fact, the Whitewater affair that stems from  his office as governor in Arkansas cannot be compared with the  scandals that became a legend, including Watergate and the  Iran-Contra affair. However, it is more than a harmless episode,  as Clinton is trying to pretend.    His protests of innocence are no longer effective because he  himself is to blame for the current crisis. Intensive efforts  were made to influence a legal process. Clinton's credibility  has suffered in this respect. If he really is innocent, then  there is no need for intensive manipulations by his advisers  aimed at influencing legal investigations.    With great certainty, we do not know yet the whole truth in  this affair, which is not only embarrassing for the president  himself but also for First Lady Hillary, who is apparently more  deeply involved in the affair than has been known so far. Her  contacts with legal adviser Nussbaum, who has now been  dismissed, date back to the Watergate days.    In any event, the nation is viewing this affair with  increasing confusion and concern. It senses for the first time  the price for the most evident change that has taken place after  the Clintons entered the White House: It is having two  presidents at the same time.</p>

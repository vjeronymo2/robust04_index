			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Royal Bank in pledge to businesses ROYAL BANK of Scotland, the fifth-largest UK banking group, yesterday promised its 100,000 small-business customers that it would remove their overdrafts only in exceptional circumstances and with advance notice wherever possible. The pledge featured in Royal Bank's charter for small businesses, which appeared yesterday amid warm praise from customers. Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum for Private Business, said the charter came very close to the contractual agreement the forum was seeking. He gave it 82 marks out of 100, placing it well ahead of the other banks in terms of approval from business people. The FPB and other small business groups were closely involved in drawing up the charter. Royal Bank is the last of the top seven UK banks to produce such a charter.</p>

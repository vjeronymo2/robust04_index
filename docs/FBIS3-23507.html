Makeyev General Designer Igor Ivanovich  Velichko under the rubric "Conversion of the Sector": "Swords  Into Plowshares"]    [Text] An enormous quantity of weapons has been  accumulated around the world. But detente has come, and a  considerable portion of them have become unnecessary and subject  to cutbacks; this includes ballistic missiles of various  classes. Many types of them use highly toxic fuel components  that we are not able to turn into harmless substances in large  quantities. They could destroyed through burning in rocket  engines attached to special installations, for example. But the  harmful emissions and impurities would remain in the lower Earth  atmosphere thereby. They could also be launched without  warheads. It is difficult to monitor this process, it is true,  and the problem of the falling stages also arises--consequently,  with the same harmfulness. But one could also use these terrible  weapons for peaceful purposes. Igor Ivanovich Velichko, general  designer of the Machine Building KB [Design Bureau] imeni  Academician V.P. Makeyev, talks about that.    Our KB is the lead developer of ballistic missiles for  submarines. The collective has created all of the SLBMs  [submarine-launched ballistic missiles] that are in service with  the Navy today. But the times are changing, and we have begun  the creation of research and commercial rocket and space systems  for the conversion of our activity. The wealth of scientific,  technological and production potential of the developers and  manufacturers of the SLBMs, as well as the program of utilizing  the missiles after their retrofitting into research and  commercial launch vehicles for spacecraft, serves as the basis  for that.    We are proceeding in several directions in cooperation with  Russian enterprises and organizations, first and foremost on the  path of the immediate utilization of all existing missiles for  peaceful purposes--launches of the retrofitted missiles from the  silos of operational submarines in conjunction with the Russian  Navy. This is entirely realistic, because in accordance with the  Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Weapons and the  agreement to develop it that was signed in 1992 by the  presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States in  Washington, a considerable quantity of missiles will be freed  up. The modified RSM-25 (SS-N-6) in particular, which has  received the name Zyb, launches recoverable craft on close to a  vertical ballistic trajectory with a microgravitation level of  10[.sup]-4[/] g and a duration of weightlessness of 17  minutes. Zyb missiles are launched from submarines on the  battlefields of the Northern (area of the city of Arkhangelsk)  and Eastern (area of Kamchatka) test ranges, equipped with  measuring instruments, search systems and for the prompt  delivery of the descent craft that have landed.    It is namely the microgravitation that makes it possible to  realize new technologies. Our KB, in conjunction with the  Kompozit NPO [Scientific-Production Association] and the Center  for Space Biotechnology, has developed two types of craft:    --a technological module weighing 450 kg, with an  installation accommodated in it for trying out processes to  obtain semiconductor materials with improved crystalline  structures, superconducting alloys and other materials;    --a biotechnological module weighing 650 kg, to try out  technologies for cleaning biological compounds and the  commercial manufacture of especially pure biological and  medicinal compounds using the method of electrophoresis.    We conducted the first experimental launch of the Zyb  missile  at the end of 1991 at the Northern Test Range of the Navy, with  a technological module fitted with 15 ovens containing quartz  ampules with various sets of initial materials. The chain of  preparation, launch and recovery of the module was checked out,  with the necessary functional conditions for the special  technological equipment ensured. We now have the first materials  that were manufactured under the conditions of the flight of a  submarine-launched ballistic missile.    One of the samples is a silicon crystal with a high level of  germanium doping, grown at a speed of 10 mm/minute--that is, an  order of magnitude greater than under Earth conditions. Quick  analysis showed that these are defect-free monocrystals, 10--30  mm in length and on the order of 12 mm in diameter, with a  homogeneous distribution of impurities. Samples of metals and  alloys with new properties were also obtained.    The regular operations of the Zyb missiles in the interests  of space technologies should begin in the middle of this year.  Retrofitted RSM-40 Vysota (SS-N-8) and RSM-50 Volna (SS-N-18)  missiles could be used for their launch from submarines, where  necessary, to increase the time the modules are under weightless  conditions to 30 minutes and the amount of technological  equipment. The Bumerang and Chizh orbital recoverable craft  created at our KB will be used in the future. They will be  placed into orbit by more powerful missile systems, and will  have a period of active existence of up to several dozen days.  The Russian Space Agency (RKA) is financing and supporting the  work on the space technologies.    The thrust of the work is the creation of the refitted  Shtil-1 missile based on the RSM-54 (SS-N-23) series-produced  missile, a commercial system for the launch of "small"  satellites from our ground launch complex near the city of  Arkhangelsk, which used to be used for testing combat missiles.  The mass of a payload placed into orbit by this missile, with an  inclination of 70 and an altitude of 500--700 km, is  250--300 kg, with a volume of 1.5 m[.sup]3[/]. The deployment  of a system of personal satellite communications, intended for  the transmission of text, digital and facsimile messages using  the principle of "subscriber--spacecraft--subscriber" or the  method of "electronic mail," is being placed using the Shtil  launch vehicle in 1994-95. The Uralkosmos joint-stock company,  formed by a group of industrial enterprises in the defense  complex, banks and organizations of potential customers, is  engaged in the realization of this project. Launches of the  Shtil-3N launch vehicle, which is a variation of a more profound  modification of the series-produced RSM-54 (the warhead  compartment and engine for the separation of the warheads have  been replaced with a more spacious payload compartment and new  orbital-insertion engines), could be made from the ground launch  complex starting in 1995.    <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-004C-19A>           Figure </FIG>       We consider the key element to be the development of a  rocket  system--the Aerokosmos project--that is accommodated on the  An-124 and Il-76 aircraft. This system will make possible the  efficient launch of satellites from any point in the airspace.  The RSM-54 submarine-launched ballistic missile has been  refitted as a commercial launch vehicle for air launching. A  great deal of scientific research and experimental work has been  done so far, and this project is moving into the stage of  development of the working documentation. We feel that our KB is  very ready for the implementation of this plan. The Aerokosmos  joint-stock company has been formed for its realization (in 1995  and the start of commercial operation in 1996), and agreement  has been reached for its support on the part of the RKA.    The technical essence of the project is as follows. The  missile is accommodated inside a transport aircraft on a launch  platform in a horizontal position, and is ejected using a  parachute system, after which it separates from the platform  with the simultaneous ignition of the engines. The missile can  hold a satellite up to 1,000 kg in mass in a volume of 3.5  m[.sup]3[/] (dimensions of 1.6 meters in diameter and 2.3  meters in length). The mass of a satellite is 500 kg when placed  in a polar orbit of 700 km in altitude.    The retrofitting of the RSM-52 (SS-N-20) missiles will be  completed in 1997, and will make it possible to put payloads of  1,000 kg into polar orbits 800 km in altitude in a compartment  volume of 4 m[.sup]3[/] with launch from an An-124 aircraft.    All of the modified SLBMs described are in the class of  light  launch vehicles, and serve for the launch of light payloads (up  to one tonne) into space or the upper layers of the atmosphere.  Research into the market for payloads has indeed shown  substantial growth in the need for small spacecraft, including  low-orbit communications satellites and spacecraft for the  system of global ecological safety, among others. There could be  a need for about 300 such satellites before the year 2000. It  would hardly be expedient for them to be launched several at a  time by one heavier rocket or shuttle craft, due to their lower  efficiency, higher cost and lesser accessibility to many  countries that do not have their own missile and space  technology.    Our program, which envisages the attraction of funds from  domestic commercial structures and foreign investors, has been  approved by the government of the Russian Federation. A decree  on this question was signed by President B. Yeltsin in June of  1992. It must be said that we have a vested interest in  attracting foreign partners, on a mutually advantageous basis,  due to the difficulties in financing large-scale elements of the  program using Russian domestic sources. The restrictions on the  launch of foreign satellites in which American high technology  is used by Russian launch vehicles must be removed as soon as  possible for successful international collaboration in the realm  of space research. Moreover, even though the fundamental  opportunities for the use of strategic launch vehicles are  inherent in the START Treaty, they must be expanded. Third  countries in particular must be granted the right to conclude  agreements for the use of such retrofitted Russian or American  missiles. The Russian Federation and United States must be  permitted to launch satellites for civilian purposes from  mothballed military launch positions--submarines, ships,  aircraft and from land. The restrictions on the quantity of  retrofitted missiles and their launches would best be removed.    Things should be done to see that the strategic defensive  potential being freed up begins to work in the interests of the  world community.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

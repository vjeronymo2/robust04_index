			<p>BFN     [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 9 (AFP) -- King Norodom Sihanouk  has expressed support for the government's recent offensive to  capture the Khmer Rouge's rear headquarters in the northwestern  town of Pailin, a report said Saturday.    "The offensive ... is legitimate, unavoidable and most  laudable," the king said in an interview in the bi-weekly PHNOM  PENH POST.    The government's recent seizure of Pailin was justified as a  blow against the "de facto partitioning of the country and to  prevent further destruction of the country's natural resources  by the Khmer Rouge for their own profit and the gain of foriegn  interests," said the ailing King Sihanouk, who returned here  Friday after an absence of more than six months.    The Khmer Rouge occupied the gem-and timber-rich area of  Pailin in 1989. It has since served as their "capital" while it  financed its guerrilla operations by selling mining and logging  concessions to primarily Thai business consortiums.    King Sihanouk said that if the government could hold Pailin,  "with its wealth of minerals and timber, it would be a benefit  of historic proportions for Cambodia."    But he warned of a "double-edged sword" and pointed to the  recent debacle at Anlong Veng, where government forces seized  the strategic Khmer Rouge base only to be routed several weeks  later when the guerrillas launched a surpise counter-attack.    The consequences of a similar setback in Pailin would be  "extremely grave and hypothetically could threaten the very  future of our new regime," the king said.    The 71-year-old monarch, who returned totally bald after  months of cancer treatment in China, allayed widespread fears  about the state of his health when he nimbly stepped down onto  the tarmac of the capital's airport looking spruce and smiling.    But later a scheduled meeting with Khmer Rouge nominal  leader  Khieu Samphan to discuss peace negotiations was cancelled.    The Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio reported that the king  told Khieu Samphan "it would be best" to postpone the meeting  until June.    The king said in the interview that it was difficult for him  to arrange or broker peace negotiations as the government was  continuing to gain ground and co-premiers Prince Norodom  Ranariddh or Hun Sen were not willing to talk with the Khmer  Rouge.</p>

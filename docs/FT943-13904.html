			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Microsoft deal settles antitrust investigation Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has avoided potentially costly legal actions on both sides of the Atlantic by settling charges that it used anti-competitive practices to maintain a mono-poly in the personal computer market. The deal between Microsoft, the US Justice Department and the European Commission settles one of the biggest antitrust investigations since the break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telephone group, in 1984. The settlement, which requires Microsoft to drop some alleged monopolistic practices, marks the end of a four-year investigation which involved unprecedented co-operation between competition authorities in the US and Europe. In a telling judgment upon the methods Microsoft used to maintain its predominance in the software industry, the US Justice Department said: 'While the company fairly and legally climbed to the top of the industry ladder, it used unfair and illegal practices to maintain its dominant position.' Microsoft, with annual revenues of Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3bn), dominates the personal computer software industry with its operating systems installed in more than 120m machines. Operating systems act as the 'central nervous system' of a computer, controlling its basic functions. The company founded by Mr Bill Gates, a young entrepreneur who has become one of the richest people in the world, has faced increasing criticism for commercial practices which its competitors allege limit their ability to break into the market. Microsoft provided the operating system for the original International Business Machines PC in 1981. This became a world standard and allowed Microsoft to become the leader in its field. The US authorities, announcing the settlement on Saturday, said Microsoft had 'built a barricade of exclusionary and unreasonably restrictive licensing agreements to deny others an opportunity to develop and market competing products'. Ms Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division of the US Justice Department, said: 'Microsoft is an American success story, but there is no excuse for any company to try to cement its success through unlawful means, as Microsoft has done.' She added: 'This case sends a powerful message that the antitrust authorities of the US and the EC are prepared to move decisively and promptly to pool resources to attack conduct by multinational firms that violate the antitrust laws of the two jurisdictions.' The Justice Department antitrust suit cites in particular Microsoft's 'per processor' licensing contracts, which require personal computer manufacturers to pay royalties to Microsoft based on the number of computers they sell, regardless of whether Microsoft programs are installed.

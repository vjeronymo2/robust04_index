			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEFLECTED PASS BEATS SOCKERS IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> Greg Ion wasn't shooting, he was passing. But Ion's pass deflected off the foot  of Socker defender George Fernandez and into the goal with 2 minutes 26 seconds  left in overtime Friday night, giving the Kansas City Comets a 3-2 victory at  Kemper Arena.  </P> <P> The loss ended the Sockers' two-game winning streak and dropped them to 18-15,  four games behind the league-leading Baltimore Blast, whom they will play  tonight. The Comets (14-18) won their third in a row and moved into a tie for  fifth place with Tacoma in the Major Indoor Soccer League.  </P> <P> Eight of the Sockers' losses this year have been in overtime.  </P> <P> The Comets had lost three consecutive overtime games, but that streak ended  largely because of Ion's end-to-end rush with the ball.  </P> <P> "It was a pass for (Dale) Mitchell," Ion said of his 18th goal of the season  and second overtime game-winner.  </P> <P> "I got the ball from David (Brcic), pushed it past (Waad) Hirmez and I was  surprised to see I was at the end of (the play). I cut the ball behind a  defender, trying to get it back in the middle for Dale. It hit Fernandez and  went in the net."  </P> <P> As the ball rested behind San Diego's Victor Nogueria, the MISL's leading  goalkeeper, Fernandez stood in the goal mouth, hands on his knees, staring at  the ground.  </P> <P> "It went off my toe . . . just hard luck," Fernandez said. "They worked harder.  . . . I beat the No. 1 goalkeeper. Not too many people can do that."  </P> <P> The Comets outshot the Sockers, 10-2, in the overtime and only Nogueria's  goalkeeping kept San Diego in the game.  </P> <P> "From the halfway point on, we dominated and took control," said Comets Coach  Dave Clements, whose team has beaten San Diego two games in a row. "They had  some chances but we had many more. Nogueria (25 saves) made some fantastic  saves, and I was frightened that we had so much pressure that they would  counter with a breakaway-type goal."  </P> <P> Not the way the Sockers have played in overtime.  </P> <P> "Ion must be fitter than our lads," Sockers Coach Ron Newman said. "He ran by  every one of our guys.  </P> <P> "They seemed to have more stamina than we did. In overtime, we can't drive  ourselves when the going gets tough. In the overtime, we didn't have a chance  of winning the game. There's not doubt Kansas City deserved it in the  (overtime), but it was a fluke goal."  </P> <P> Fernandez attributed the Sockers' 2-8 overtime record to "lack of drive . . .  no commitment. It's like we're happy to make it into the overtime and after  that, it's downhill."  </P> <P> Dave Boncek appeared to have given the Comets the victory with 1:32 left in  regulation when he scored off a pass from Iain Fraser.  </P> <P> At that point, the Sockers lifted Nogueria in favor of a sixth attacker --  Kevin Crow -- and just 38 seconds later, Hirmez, on a pass from Crow, tied it.  It was Hirmez's seventh goal in four games since he rejoined the Sockers in a  trade with Los Angeles at the All-Star break.  </P> <P> The score was tied, 1-1, after three quarters as each team scored an unassisted  goal. San Diego's Alan Willey scored 2:34 into the first quarter, and David  Doyle scored 7:07 into the third quarter for Kansas City.  </P> <P> The Sockers missed an opportunity to take the lead late in the third quarter  when they were awarded a penalty kick because the Comets' Gino Schiraldi was  called for tripping Willey in the penalty area.  </P> <P> But Brcic stopped Branko Segota's penalty kick with a kick save, and Kansas  City killed the 2-minute penalty.  </P> <P> The Sockers claimed Brcic was in violation of moving before the shot.  </P> <P> "David was miles off the goal line," Newman said.  </P> <P> Aware that only 13 of 39 penalty kicks have been successful since the MISL  moved the penalty spot from 24 to 34 feet this season, Newman said, "Either we  make it right . . . these are the rules. There's never a save in these. He  should have had it over again."  </P> <P> Segota, now one of four in penalty kicks this season, said, "The guy was out  there a yard before I even took the shot."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The special representative of the UN secretary  general, Mr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh, is at a loss to explain  the last minute obstacles to the setting up of transitional  institutions, because UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR]  did everything possible for the easy progress of the process.  For him, the commitments made by Rwandan officials have not  been respected. Here is his declaration:    [Begin Booh-Booh recording] This meeting gives us an  opportunity to make clarifications on the mandate and the  responsibilities of UNAMIR in the context of the difficulties  faced by Rwandan political officials in the setting up of  transitional institutions as stipulated in the Arusha peace  agreement. [passage omitted]    The setting up of the transitional institutions had been  planned for 37 days after the signing of the Arusha agreement.  No one can say that time was short nor that, unfortunately,  transitional institutions have been established. One can only  note that commitments made by Rwandan officials to the  international community have not been respected. Once again, I  say that UNAMIR did everything which had to be done. We held  many meetings with the country's main political leaders. The  delay in the setting up of the transitional institutions cannot  be understood nor is it acceptable. The credibility of Rwandan  officials in the eyes of the Rwandan people and the  international community is now in question. How can one explain  the reasons for the last minute obstacles when everything seemed  ready on 29 December?    How can one convince the United Nations, especially the  Security Council, of the seriousness of the solemn commitments  made by Rwandan officials? How can one explain to the Rwandan  people about the delay which constitutes a grave threat to the  future of the country? How can one explain to the international  financial institutions and donor countries the absence of a  responsible government in Rwanda that will work with them for  the recovery of the country's economy? Finally, how can one  explain to the thousands of Rwandans, who are impatient to  return without fear to their homes, the meaning of the squabbles  of some political leaders?    UNAMIR remains, more than ever, ready to carry out its  mandate. It is up to the signatories of the Arusha agreement of  4 August 1993, in conformity with Article 5, to meet  expeditiously and do everything possible to implement one of the  most important tenets of the agreement, that is the setting up  of the transitional institutions. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

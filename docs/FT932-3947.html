			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / BAe wins Pounds 500m order from Indonesia BRITISH AEROSPACE has won a contract estimated to be worth Pounds 500m to supply Hawk combat trainer jets to Indonesia. The deal, signed secretly last week and announced yesterday, is the biggest military export the company has made outside Saudi Arabia. The sale involves 24 aircraft with weapons, spares and training. It is likely to be controversial because of Indonesia's human rights record in the former Portuguese territory of East Timor. Although the Hawk is designed as a trainer, BAe literature makes clear it is also well suited to ground attack. BAe refused to comment on the specifications of the aircraft being sold, or whether they included the dedicated single-seat fighter version, the Hawk 200, as well as the twin-seat Hawk 100. BAe said that they could all be regarded as being for training purposes. The contract, which follows protracted negotiations, was delayed by a recent reshuffle of Indonesia's top military commanders by President Suharto. Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, who announced the sale at the Paris air show, said it had been 'a very long struggle'. The deal will bring extra work to BAe's northern England plants at Brough, Warton and Samlesbury. It includes Rolls-Royce engines worth Pounds 50m. It also leaves open the possibility of a further Indonesian order. BAe and IPTN, Indonesia's state aircraft construction company, signed a collaboration agreement two years ago. Mr Bacharrudin Habibie, IPTN chairman, has indicated Indonesia could require up to 96 Hawks. Jetstream, the BAe regional aircraft subsidiary, yesterday announced plans for a new generation of turbo-prop airliners. Mr Allan MacDonald, Jet-stream's managing director, said up to 50 per cent of the Pounds 450m development costs would need to be provided by the government. Plans for the Jetstream 71 and 51 would secure 2,500 jobs at the company's Prestwick base in Strathclyde. Super jumbo plan, Page 3</p>

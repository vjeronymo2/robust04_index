			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Health reform reaches US Senate for debate Debate at last got under way yesterday afternoon in the US Senate on a bill that would accomplish some of the goals set 10 months when President Bill Clinton presented his massive plan to overhaul the US healthcare system. Discussion started after a delay caused by last-minute parliamentary wrangling. The debate, based on a compromise bill drafted by Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, could eat into the Senate's planned August recess and last several weeks. Some senators are threatening a filibuster, seeking to block the passage of a bill by extending debate. Senator Mitchell told the Senate that the debate should not be 'political' but, instead, 'about the best way to deal with the real-life problems of real-life Americans when they fall ill'. Early votes on amendments to the bill are expected to provide an indication of the tide for or against healthcare reform. One vote, on a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, the extreme right-wing Republican from North Carolina, would propose putting off debate altogether until next year. That vote, expected this morning, will offer a measure of how senators assess the political damage they could suffer in elections in November, when a third of the Senate will face the voters, if they have simply done nothing about healthcare. Before debate began, Senator Mitchell warned the Republican opposition that it would be 'a huge political risk for them to be seen as sheer obstructionists.' He acknowledged that several Democratic senators remained 'undecided' about his bill, but said he was ready to make changes so as to win over not only the Democratic waverers but also some opposition senators. Much of the hostility to the Mitchell bill has focused on measures that could, in the year 2002, compel employers to pay for half of their workers' health insurance - a delayed and diluted version of the 'employer mandate' proposed in Mr Clinton's original plan and retained in the bill to be debated next week by the House of Representatives. Mr Mitchell sought yesterday to minimise the significance of this component, which would only come into effect if the voluntary incentives which form the bulk of his plan were to fail on their own to bring 95 per cent of the population under some form of health coverage.</p>

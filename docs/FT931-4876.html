			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British Vita ahead to Pounds 55.2m BRITISH VITA, the polymer, fibre and foam company, yesterday disappointed the market with pre-tax profits up 9.5 per cent at Pounds 55.2m as continental Europe slowed sharply. The shares fell from 253p to 235p. In the year to December 31, operating profits fell 8.7 per cent to Pounds 48.7m on sales up 14 per cent at Pounds 788.5m. The profits were flattered by Pounds 2m of currency translation gains and also benefited from a sharp increase in associated company profits after losses in Spartech were reduced. As the proceeds of last year's rights issue were not fully utilised, the group benefited from Pounds 842,000 interest, compared with a charge of Pounds 4.6m. Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive, said the results were 'creditable' given the market circumstances. He was particularly pleased with cash generation, given the deterioration in trading conditions. Sales in the UK rose to Pounds 253m, but operating profit fell from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 14.7m. The fall in continental Europe was greater - operating profits fell from Pounds 35.7m to Pounds 33.3m on sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 499.4m. Sales to the industrial and auto sector in Germany were particularly hard hit by wage rate inflation. Consumer demand for products like mattresses held up relatively well. The results were after Pounds 4m losses, including the cost of redundancies in the Spanish operation which had been hit by a slowing economy and where losses were continuing this year. Earnings per share were unchanged at 16.3p, adjusted for the rights issue last year; a recommended final distribution of 3.65p lifts the total for the year to 7.15p (7.05p). COMMENT With the exception of Reuters, there are few other UK quoted companies more dependent than British Vita on the weakening European economy. Given the strength of management and tight working capital control in recession, this slow down is something investors would be prepared to stomach. What is really hurting Vita is Spain. The company could easily lose another Pounds 4m this year, redundancy payments for only 57 Spanish workers last year cost Pounds 2.5m. Until this is sorted out and the scale of the European slowdown in established, there is little for investors to be chasing. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 53m this year are likely to give earnings per share of 15.2p and a prospective multiple of about 15.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TO INVESTIGATE POWER LINES  </P> <P> School board members said Thursday night they plan to investigate possible  health hazards presented by electromagnetic fields at school sites.  </P> <P> "We do need to be prudent; we do need to be cautious; but I think all of us are  in agreement: We do need to proceed on this," said Fountain Valley School  District board member Stephen J. Einstein.  </P> <P> But board members did not respond publicly to a request by parents for  independent testing at each school site. They said that information presented  by Supt. Ruben L. Ingram was a good start, but that they needed more data.  </P> <P> Ingram said that board members, in closed session before the meeting, took a  position on an offer presented two weeks ago by Allen Brandt, attorney for the  parents. Ingram declined to elaborate on the decision.  </P> <P> Brandt said at the last board meeting that he would pursue an existing lawsuit  against the district and file additional suits unless the district conducted  independent testing at all schools before the end of the month.  </P> <P> Brandt said the parents would drop the lawsuit if the district agreed to  independent testing. Measurements of electromagnetic fields taken by the  parents have differed from those offered by officials of Southern California  Edison Corp.  </P> <P> The subject of electromagnetic fields has aroused the interest of many parents,  who worry that power lines at local schools present a health risk to their  children.  </P> <P> While the parent group points to studies suggesting a link between prolonged  exposure to electromagnetic fields and some cancers, Edison officials say no  proof exists that the exposure causes health problems.  </P> <P> Edison has offered to test the intensity of electromagnetic fields at all 12  schools in the district, but parents have pushed for independent readings.  </P> <P> Edison official Brian Bennett said Thursday night that he would accept an offer  by Brandt to tour several school sites and test the electromagnetic fields  there, each with his own equipment.  </P></p>

He noted that there had  been massacres such as those of Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Sabra,  and Shatila in the past, but there was no peace process then  like the process that began in Madrid in October 1990, nor were  there peace negotiations.    In an interview with the Egyptian weekly UKTUBAR to be  published Sunday [13 March], he said that UN resolutions  stipulate frankly that the settlements are illegal and that they  form an obstacle to peace. He added that the settlements are  not only an impediment to peace but they now pose a problem for  Israel itself and that Israel now does not know what to do with  the settlers.    He pointed out that protection of the Palestinians has  become  the issue of the hour and that a solution must be found to this  before the peace process resumes.    He expressed hopes that the Arabs will get a permanent seat  at the Security Council, but he remarked that there must be some  contacts for this.    He said that the issue of voting on the Arab League  resolutions will be discussed at the League Council's meeting  due to be held at the foreign minister level at the end of this  month. The (?charter) needs (?to be amended) so that  resolutions can be passed by a majority of two-thirds instead of  the current system which depends on [words indistinct].    He added that he will ask the Arab countries at the next  meeting to set up an Arab court of justice as stipulated in  Article [word indistinct] of the Arab League Charter of 1945.</p>

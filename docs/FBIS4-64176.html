			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ulmanis said today that the principle of  preventive diplomacy is a characteristic feature of the process  of concluding Latvian-Russian agreements on army withdrawal.  His remarks came at a news conference covering Ulmanis's recent  trip to the United States. He emphasized that the principle of  preventive diplomacy has now been put forward at the UN as the  corner stone of activity, because with its help it is possible  to tackle many issues in the world.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Ghali, meeting with Ulmanis,  promised to render UN assistance in the process of setting up  the Baltic peacekeeping battalion by providing specialist  training.    Ulmanis noted that protection of individual rights rather  than states rights is currently being given more emphasis at the  UN at this time.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Observer: Insoluble Does the government know more than it is letting on about economic recovery? In its targets for 1992-93 for the Insolvency Service, it is estimating that there will be 36,000 new insolvencies. Strange, considering the service handled 35,097 last year and the rates have continued to rise sharply since. There again, perhaps it is too reliant on rosy Treasury forecasts. Last year, it predicted 20,500 insolvencies. Embarrassed officials had to hire another 150 staff to cope with the extra workload. If the same underestimates prove true this year, at least a few more civil servants will have jobs.</p>

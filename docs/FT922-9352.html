			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / People: A regional view of entrepreneurs Despite its long-term interest in small business, the Confederation of British Industry is probably regarded by most outsiders as the mouthpiece for Britain's large companies. But this perception may be about to change with the appointment of Liz Amos, currently in charge of membership promotion, to head up the CBI's membership directorate with responsibility for small firms and the regions. The combination of these three areas in one job should mean Amos is well placed to give a boost to the CBI's recruitment of small business owner-managers in the regions. Despite the 'downsizing' of British industry over the past decade, only 60 per cent of the CBI's members are small firms (employing fewer than 200 people) compared with their 97 per cent share of all UK businesses by number. Amos, 40, who joined the CBI in 1979 as speechwriter to the then director general Sir John Methven, may also adopt a slightly higher profile than her predecessor, Sonia Elkin. Elkin headed the smaller firms and regions directorate for nine years but without responsibility for the membership portfolio. Prime responsibility for putting the confederation's views on small firms to the outside world will still rest with Richard Brucciani, the recently appointed chairman of its Smaller Firms Council. But if it serves members' interests, Amos says she is prepared to speak up. A history graduate from Bristol University, Amos is particularly keen to press the interests of British business in the European Community; to promote the CBI's new-found enthusiasm for family businesses; and to strengthen the enterprise activities of the Training and Enterprise Councils.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Letter From The Midlands: History turns on its tail History is playing tricks with Birmingham and the Black Country, the sprawling conurbation at the heart of the West Midlands, at the heart, indeed, of British industry itself. According to the old aphorism, history ought to be repeating itself. More likely, it has stopped repeating and gone back on itself. Put another way, the recession gives rise to the thought that the economic foundations of the conurbation are gently crumbling. If history is simple repetition then there is nothing exciting in the present recession or its predecessor of the early 1980s. Recessions are regrettable. They cause hardship. But eventually they go away. They are just part of the normal order of things and have been for a couple of centuries. Asa Briggs, the historian, writing* of Birmingham in the Victorian era, termed it 'a city of marked industrial fluctuations'. The difficulty is that the gap between the fluctuations seems to become shorter. There were about three good years between the recession of the 1980s and that of the 1990s. So the emphasis in the plethora of engineering companies is on survival rather than expansion, on cost-cutting rather than investment. All industrialists are busy reading the runes, looking over their orderbooks and finding that instead of them getting fatter they are remaining dangerously thin. The surveys of business performance and expectation - from the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Chambers of Commerce - scrutinise the ground for the chancellor's green shoots and find the soil waterlogged. The best they can say is that things are not getting much worse. Looking for solace, Mr Edward Roberts, the CBI's regional chairman, found it encouraging that 'whilst there may be less spending on buildings in the year ahead, investments in plant and machinery may stabilise - for the first time in three years'. If the investments are not being made, it is difficult to see how West Midlands industrial companies can remain competitive later in the decade. Rather, they will be in the position of trying to keep up the speed of a Mercedes in a Morris Minor. And here the problem is not with the big players  -the likes of GKN, Glynwed, IMI and Lucas or even car makers such as Rover or Peugeot - but with the host of small companies. The industrial base was built up on small companies. Briggs quotes the factory inspector who, in 1843, remarked that 'there are no large and crowded factories such as abound in other districts'. Nearly 150 years on, there are, of course, large factories but the importance of the small companies remains: Birmingham still likes to see itself as the city of a thousand trades. The small companies are vainly looking for help. Mr Andrew Millward, chairman of the regional Chambers of Commerce and thus spokesman for 13,000 companies, turned recently to the old refrain. 'Companies still need to be given right messages by the government. They need to see a lowering of interest rates. It is important also that a correct balance is struck between controlling public expenditure and ensuring that important long-term investment programmes, particularly those for training and infrastructure improvement, continue,' he said. Leaving aside the gripes about the cost of money and the litany of complaints about roads, rail and the rest, the underlying importance of what Mr Millward was saying concerns skills. Lack of them caused bottlenecks in the heady days of the 1980s. Shortage will doubtless return when companies start taking on labour instead of laying it off. Recession is causing the skills base, slender at best, to atrophy further. Last week's unemployment figures put the proportion of West Midlands jobless at 10.6 per cent, or 267,500 people. That number will increase. The latest CBI-BSL regional trends survey put the loss of manufacturing jobs at 23,000 this year alone. But then the number of manufacturing jobs has been in decline since the 1970s. At one level, this fall in manufacturing employment can be construed as a healthy development. Companies, it is argued, get leaner; their costs come down; their productivity goes up. Last week's sharp rise in profits from Glynwed, one of the most diversified of West Midlands engineering groups, adds support to that argument. It has been cutting its manned capacity to meet lower demand. It has not cut its machinery capacity. There is another factor to support the argument. It is that the West Midlands, with 33.2 per cent of its gross domestic output coming from manufacturing, needs to diversify its economy into services. Then it would be less vulnerable to Briggs's 'industrial fluctuations'. The problem is that the service industries tend not to offer such high wages as manufacturing. So relatively well-paid jobs are being exchanged often for low-paid jobs. This exacerbates a growing social problem. The West Midlands Low Paid Unit calculated that 45.4 per cent of adult workers in the region received wages under the low-pay threshold of Pounds 185 for a 38-hour week. Briggs noted that in the 19th century 'a large proportion of the Birmingham labour force was skilled and therefore relatively well-off economically'. This was a source of strength in developing the industry which gave the city and its region prosperity. The proportion of the unskilled - those, by definition, who are low paid - is too high to secure regional prosperity in the late 20th century. Which is one reason why history has turned back on itself. * Victorian Cities by Asa Briggs; Odhams Press, 1963; Penguin Books 1990</p>

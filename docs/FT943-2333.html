			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Party's tax strategy thrown into confusion The Liberal Democrats' attempts to formulate a distinctive tax policy were thrown into confusion yesterday as the newly-appointed Treasury spokesman appeared to overturn key planks in the party's latest tax and benefit proposals. In a conference presentation designed to cast the Liberal Democrats as a party of low rather than high taxation, Mr Malcolm Bruce rejected a plan from its policymaking committee to back an increase in the top rate of income tax to 60 per cent. Instead he proposed that no one should pay a marginal rate of above 50 per cent. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, favours a 50 per cent rate, but senior party figures are not sure whether the conference will insist on the higher level in a debate today. Mr Bruce produced an eye-catching proposal to introduce a 10 per cent income-tax band for the lower paid, compensated for in part by the introduction of a range of environmental taxes. He said the party would seek to take many people out of taxation by raising thresholds. He cast doubt on a range of specific commitments in last month's policy document - Opportunity and Independence for All - to raise child benefit by up to Pounds 5 per week, increase in-work benefits, and provide higher payments to the the young unemployed. Mr Bruce said all spending pledges would be subject to a rigorous costing programme before the next general election. But amid confusion among delegates and some MPs about the party's tax strategy, Mr Bruce backed plans to raise the earnings ceiling on National Insurance contributions, a move which would raise by 10 per cent the marginal tax rate of those on middle incomes. Mr Bruce first suggested that those affected would be compensated by cuts in income tax as the two systems were integrated. But he then raised the possibility that the NIC ceiling might be kept in place. Admitting that the party's present stance might lack 'clarity', he said that by the time of the next general election it would produce a fully costed, itemised tax and spending programme. Among the new environmental taxes proposed by the party are a carbon tax along the lines of that proposed by the European Commission, the introduction of road pricing, a greenfield development tax, a levy on agricultural fertilisers and pesticides and on packaging. Mr Bruce said the money raised would be used to cut taxes elsewhere, but the party committed itself earlier this month to using some of the income to increase public spending.</p>

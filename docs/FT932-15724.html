			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Welpac warns of second half loss Shares of Welpac, the hardware and electrical goods wholesaler and distributor, fell 8p to 30p on Thursday following a warning from the company that it expected to incur a second half loss similar to the Pounds 684,000 reported for the first half. And 'in the light of a changed pattern of business,' the profit and loss account would be 'adversely affected by non-recurring write-offs of not more than Pounds 1.1m' in respect of customer supply arrangements. Management figures showed that the company had returned to profitability in the current year. It was experiencing 'healthy orders, better margins and a lower cost base.' For the year to January 1992 Welpac swung from profits of Pounds 13,000 to losses of Pounds 305,000.</p>

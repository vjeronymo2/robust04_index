			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Dr. Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli, governor </F> of the Central Bank of Iran, by unidentified correspondent; date  not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] ['Adeli] [passage omitted]  The setting up of non-banking establishments will truly change  the state monetary system. The government approved the policy  today. I should explain that according to that policy from now  on our private sector will also be able to set up non-banking  credit establishments.    As you know, at the moment in our country only banks deal  with money matters. [passage omitted] In a developing country,  which needs more investments; more savings, there is a need for  more instruments to attract people's savings. That is why in  many developing and developed countries non-banking  establishments exist. We also decided to create such non-banking  establishments in order to offer, on the one hand, a more  diverse variety for people's investments and, on the other hand,  to be able to offer loans. The only difference between those  institutions and banks is that they cannot issue written credit  documents. That is they cannot offer check books to the public.  They can offer all types of saving accounts and offer all type  of loans, but they cannot offer any current accounts. In our  announcement next week we shall set out all their conditions so  that those seeking to set up such establishments can apply  accordingly. God willing, such establishments will begin  operation in our country and a better efficiency is brought  about in the country in the allocation of resources.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Dr. 'Adeli, for your  explanations.</p>

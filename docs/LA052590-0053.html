			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION GOALS NEED TO BE RE-EXAMINED  </P> <P> You ran a story on declining college enrollments among qualified minority  students.  </P> <P> Your "experts" cited rising costs and admissions standards as the causes (" 'A'  Students Resorting to Plan 'B'," May 20).  </P> <P> Never once did the writer mention the existence of California's community  colleges, which provide good, affordable education within easy commuting  distance.  </P> <P> Perhaps high schools should spend more time working with students on what is  possible and available and less on talking and thinking only about UC.  </P> <P> BARBARA S. STONE, trustee, Rio Hondo Community College District  </P></p>

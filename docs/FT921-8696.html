			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Four men arrested in Pounds 2.3bn Sagawa Kyubin loans scandal PROSECUTORS yesterday arrested four leading figures in the Sagawa Kyubin scandal in which Y528bn (Pounds 2.38bn) in allegedly improper loans were taken from the coffers of Japan's second largest parcel delivery company. The arrests mark an important step in a widening investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor into improprieties at the company. The scandal is expected to involve gangsters and could net politicians as well. The police arrested Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, former president of Tokyo Sagawa and Mr Jun Saotome, former managing director of the company on charges of breach of trust. Also arrested were Mr Micho Ouchi, former chief accountant at Ichihara Kanko Kaihatsu, a golf course development company, and Mr Yasuo Matsuzawa, president of Heiwado, a medical equipment sales company. Improper loans and loan guarantees from Sagawa were allegedly funneled through the two companies with most of the funds eventually used for speculation in the stock market. This turned sour when the market turned down two years ago. Much of the money, however, is also alleged to have found its way into the hands of gangster-controlled companies associated with the Inagawakai, a large crime syndicate. It was alleged last night that Y5bn was funneled back to both ruling party and opposition politicians through the purchase of tickets for fund-raising events. It is unclear whether this type of political contribution would amount to impropriety on the part of the politicians, or whether Sagawa obtained any political favours as a result. Specific charges against the four men yesterday involved misappropriation of Y12.6bn in loans and loan guarantees. Prosecutors yesterday raided 15 more locations in an effort to assemble more evidence to support the charges. The raids have been well planned and publicised in advance and news of the unfolding scandal now occupies up to half of the 30-minute evening news on NHK, the state broadcasting system. The arrests were shown on television, although public prosectors refused to confirm news of the arrests to foreign journalists on the grounds that to do so would violate the civil rights of the accused. Public interest in the scandal has been heightened by the expectation that it may eventually bring down leading politicians.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Promotion For Mexican THE race to succeed Mr Carlos Salinas as Mexico's president, in late-1994, has changed with the appointment of the head of the ruling party, Senator Luis Donaldo Colosio (pictured above), as secretary of urban development and ecology, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. He is the only current presidential contender in elective office and succeeds Mr Patricio Chirinos, who has been nominated as the ruling party's candidate for governor of Veracruz state. As head of the ruling PRI, Mr Colosio was deemed ineligible for the presidency. He will take over a ministry whose name will be changed, and whose responsibilities will soon be enlarged to include the management of the Solidarity campaign, a Dollars 2bn-a-year anti-poverty programme close to the president's heart. Mr Colosio, 42, has a master's degree in urban economics from the University of Pennsylvania, and worked for six years in the budget ministry, three of them while Mr Salinas was in charge.</p>

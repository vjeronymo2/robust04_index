Nicole Theisen, whose husband works at a German company's  liaison office in Beijing, is fond of sitting in an  old-fashioned tea house beside the Temple of Heaven in south  Beijing, chatting with ordinary people and enjoying local songs.    "I hope that Beijing will have more places like this, where  foreigners can talk freely with Chinese people," she said,  noting that her hotel is pleasant enough as long as it does not  turn into a cage.    However, many foreigners have found their own ways to get  close to local people. Harald W. Villages, chief representative  of the Walter Bau ag Company of Germany in Beijing, often  strolls in the streets at weekends and has random chats with  passers-by.    "Beijing people are willing to talk about the issues of  their  lives, such as prices and incomes," he said, "and they are also  eager to learn about our lives."    While China opens wider and wider to the outside world, the  number of foreigners living in Beijing is increasing. Most of  them are diplomats, business persons, students, journalists and  experts employed by Chinese units. The total number of foreign  residents in the city is estimated at over 10,000, but there is  no exact official figure.    Local companies and authorities provide chances for  foreigners to mix with Chinese people. The Beijing Foreign  Enterprises Services Company, a commercial company providing  personnel and administrative services for foreign companies,  frequently introduces foreigners to villages in the suburbs of  the city, where they may go into any house to visit farmers.  Many people bring their children to the farmers' houses, where  the kids see goats, roosters and oxen for the first time.    But many people prefer to seek fun in the city. Joshua  Ureneck from the United States said that young people tend to go  to bars and discos which open late into the night.    Alex Vander Pol, a student from the U.S., said that the  entertainment in Beijing is catching up with that in the coastal  city of Shanghai in east China.    "But there are still not many places to go in the city,"  said  Joshua who works with "CHINA PICTORIAL". He added that some  hotels and parks charge foreigners higher prices than local  people. And in some universities, tennis courts are separated  for Chinese and foreign students, respectively.    "I don't want to be called a foreigner; I want to merge with  Chinese people," Joshua said, adding that he hoped these  ridiculous things left over from a closed China will disappear  soon.    Joshua has made his own efforts to break down the barriers  by  setting up the Beijing Foreign Basketball League last August.  The basketball league is exclusive. All its six teams are  composed of students and businessmen from abroad. They play  each other every week and form an "all-star" team to play  Chinese amateurs from other parts of the country.    He said that both foreign and Chinese people are  enthusiastic  about the game. He explained that foreign people in Beijing may  be sucked into limited circles at hotels and never get a chance  to become involved with Chinese people. "But on a basketball  court, you are as close to each other as you can get," he said.</p>

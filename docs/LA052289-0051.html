			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAULTY BALLISTICS IN DEPUTY'S ARREST;  </P> <P> EAGERNESS TO 'MAKE' GUN CITED IN LAPD LAB ERROR  </P> <P> Little more than 12 hours after Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross  was picked up by Los Angeles police in the company of a prostitute on Feb. 23,  Detective Jimmy Trahin, an examiner in the Police Department's firearms  laboratory, wrote a half-page report concluding that Ross' revolver had fired  the bullets that killed three prostitutes last year.  </P> <P> Trahin, an LAPD veteran of 19 years who has trained numerous police officers in  the tedious specialty of weapons and ammunition analysis, left no room for  doubt.  </P> <P> When he wrote that test bullets fired from Ross' gun were "positive" matches to  the bullets that killed the prostitutes, he underlined positive. The fatal  shots, he added, could have been fired only by Ross' 9-millimeter Smith &amp;  Wesson "and no other weapon."  </P> <P> Eleven weeks later, in the same lab building, Trahin sat silently as  prosecutors and defense lawyers listened to two of the nation's most respected  firearms inspectors explain why he had been wrong, why there were obvious  differences between the tiny scratches and chips found on ammunition fragments  he had matched.  </P> <P> Three days after that -- last Monday -- Rickey Ross was out of jail. By Friday  the Los Angeles County district attorney's office had announced that it would  begin using private firearms examiners to double-check results of the LAPD lab  and in some cases bypass the lab entirely.  </P> <P> A reconstruction of the investigation offers two key lessons.  </P> <P> One, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, who remains philosophical  in the wake of defeat, is that firearms examination is at times more art than  science.  </P> <P> The other lesson, according to some critics, is that the cockiness of some  examiners in the LAPD firearms investigation unit periodically leads to gross  mistakes.  </P> <P> Department spokesmen and Trahin have declined to comment, citing the  department's review of firearms lab practices.  </P> <P> The Ross case was the third high-profile murder case since 1984 in which LAPD  firearms experts were forced to admit that they had made an incorrect analysis.  </P> <P> "The reputation of the LAPD lab has always suffered" because of such incidents,  said Robert Joling, a Wisconsin lawyer and past president of the American  Academy of Forensic Sciences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Asking Right Question  </P> <P> Even before the Ross affair, LAPD was in the process of trying to replace sworn  officers with civilians in its firearms lab, officials said. Charles Morton, an  outside forensics expert who conducted the tests that would begin unraveling  the Ross case, said the distinction is important because different qualities  are required of scientists than of police officers, who are trained to make  extremely quick decisions.  </P> <P> "Too often they get caught up in doing the work of the prosecution," Morton  said of the police experts. "They don't ask, 'Is there anything that excludes  this guy?' "  </P> <P> Police were under intense public scrutiny when they arrested Ross. They had  investigated the killings of 69 prostitutes and the "street murders" of 30  other women in the previous four years with only one conviction. At a Police  Commission meeting the night before Ross' arrest, members of the Black  Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders protested what they claimed was a lack  of police concern.  </P> <P> In South-Central Los Angeles at 1:30 a.m. on Feb. 23, two officers stopped a  car that was moving erratically. Inside they found Ross, who they thought was  drunk, and a prostitute. A Pepsi can that had been used as a "crack" cocaine  pipe was tossed out of one of the car's windows, police said.  </P> <P> The confluence of facts was intriguing: Ross was in the area where the killings  had occurred. Officers were on the alert for a 9-millimeter pistol because  previous tests on the bullets that killed three of the prostitutes -- Judith  Simpson, Cynthia Walker and Latanya Johnson -- determined that the same kind of  weapon had been used in each case. When they searched Ross' trunk, police found  that type of gun.  </P> <P> Within a few hours -- as little as 90 minutes according to one account --  Trahin concluded that Ross' handgun had fired the three shots that killed the  prostitutes. That was the clincher.  </P> <P> In bringing the circumstantial murder case against the 40-year-old sheriff's  narcotics investigator, prosecutors, as they often do, put their faith in  police expertise. In this case, they were trusting tests conducted under  pressure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fast Work Demanded  </P> <P> One senior police officer said homicide investigators were telling the firearms  experts, ' "Get in there and do a comparison. . . . We need it now, we need it  now.' "  </P> <P> Hours later Ross was booked as a murder suspect.  </P> <P> As they prepared for his arraignment, Ross' court-appointed attorneys seemed  ready to accept Trahin's findings. Even if the murder weapon was in their  client's car, they noted in what appeared to be a rather desperate posture,  prosecutors would still have to prove he pulled the trigger.  </P> <P> "I suppose I was like the average citizen," said co-counsel Guy O'Brien. "They  said it was a match, I thought it was like a fingerprint."  </P> <P> At the hearing where the defense sought an arraignment delay, a deputy district  attorney named Harvey Giss appeared as a fill-in representative of the  prosecution. Three years ago Giss had been burned by a faulty LAPD gun match at  the trial of James Hawkins Jr., accused of killing two alleged drug dealers.  Hawkins had been convicted despite the mistake, but the uproar caused the LAPD  to add a backup inspector to each case.  </P> <P> Giss assumed it couldn't happen again. He stressed to reporters how certain  police were of their evidence.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, prosecutor Hodgman and LAPD homicide investigators were trying to  find witnesses to finger Ross and back up their firearms evidence. But the best  they could find was a man who thought he had seen a car and heard a man's voice  at the scene of one of the prostitute killings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gun Was the Key  </P> <P> The gun evidence clearly was the linchpin of the case. One day, Hodgman drove  over to the LAPD firearms investigation unit in northeast Los Angeles to check  it out. Looking through a special two-sample microscope that puts murder  bullets and test bullets next to each other was a journey into foreign  territory. He saw gross similarities, but the subtleties that supposedly "made"  Ross' gun had to be pointed out to him.  </P> <P> Although the written report reflected absolute certainty, Hodgman said, Trahin  told him early on that there were some analytical gray areas. Nevertheless,  "there was a sense of confidence that the LAPD firearm investigation unit had,"  the prosecutor said.  </P> <P> Besides, Trahin was a pro. "Within that unit, he is the lead man, he's been an  instructor throughout the nation," said Capt. Joe De Ladurantey, commander of  the Harbor Division, who until two months ago was in charge of the department's  Scientific Investigations Division, which oversees the nine-member firearms  unit.  </P> <P> But one veteran private firearms investigator who once worked for a Los Angeles  County law enforcement agency said he was sometimes put off by Trahin's  flippancy, a quality that other private investigators -- who spoke only on the  condition of anonymity because they still do consulting work for LAPD -- said  is too common in the unit.  </P> <P> "There is a nickname in our profession," one specialist said, for mistakes in  which an investigator is too quick to "make" a gun. It is "Wolferism," a  reference to DeWayne Wolfer, a one-time LAPD criminalist who misread evidence  in the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles in 1968, even  though the guilt of Sirhan Sirhan was never in doubt.  </P> <P> When Ross' defense went searching for a firearms expert, they settled on one of  seven specialists who were asked years later to reevaluate Wolfer's findings.  He was Charles Morton, a private criminalist from Oakland who had subsequently  worked on some of the country's most prominent murder trials, including those  of Ted Bundy, Dr. Jeffrey McDonald and Atlanta's convicted child killer, Wayne  Williams.  </P> <P> Hodgman wasn't worried. Usually you never saw these defense examiners in court  because they merely confirmed, to their clients' dismay, the police expert's  "make."  </P> <P> After 26 years as an expert in the laboratory testing of bullets, blood and  other crime-scene remnants, Charles Morton had a healthy respect for the power  -- and pitfalls -- of physical evidence.  </P> <P> An old Orange County case frequently reminded him of what was at stake.  </P> <P> A catering truck driver named William DePalma had been convicted of holding up  a Buena Park savings and loan in 1968, even though the defense produced a dozen  witnesses who swore that at the time of the robbery he was serving them lunch  15 miles away.  </P> <P> One small piece of evidence -- a fingerprint -- outweighed all the alibi  testimony and sent DePalma to prison. A Buena Park police sergeant testified  that he lifted the print, which clearly matched DePalma's, from the counter of  the savings and loan.  </P> <P> "This type of evidence has so much weight," said Morton, who runs his own crime  lab. "And in most cases it should be that persuasive."  </P> <P> But there was one problem, which was discovered by a forensics student only  after DePalma had spent 2 1/2 years behind bars. The Buena Park sergeant had  fabricated the fingerprint, using a photocopy of a real print taken off the  defendant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conviction Upset  </P> <P> DePalma's conviction was overturned and the sergeant wound up in jail for  preparing false fingerprint displays in yet another case.  </P> <P> Fifteen years later, while Morton was analyzing the twisted and mushroomed  bullet fragments that prompted authorities to charge Rickey Ross with murder,  he thought again of the Buena Park scandal. There was no suggestion of fraud  this time, but one factor seemed similar.  </P> <P> "It's rare that a case is so dependent on one bit of evidence," Morton said.  </P> <P> But when Morton walked into LAPD's firearms lab on April 17, he had no reason  to suspect that the Ross evidence might be discredited. Although he sometimes  found himself challenging police experts in court, "I have had a lot more cases  where I agreed with them," he noted.  </P> <P> Trahin's report documented two types of evidence, the three bullets found in  the prostitutes and a single shell casing, found near Cynthia Walker's body and  presumed to come from the murder weapon.  </P> <P> Trahin and his co-examiner, Officer Jim Fountain, had begun by firing nine test  bullets from Ross' guns into a water tank.  </P> <P> Morton, a 52-year-old professorial-looking man with a neat graying beard, came  prepared to look at the evidence for himself. He greeted Trahin, who had been  one of his students in the Department of Criminal Justice at Cal State Los  Angeles. Trahin handed him packets of bullet fragments and stacks of  photographs showing greatly magnified details.  </P> <P> The first thing Morton examined was LAPD's analysis of the single shell casing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discrepancies Found  </P> <P> One of the clearest marks made on a shell casing is from the gun's "ejector," a  tiny piece of metal that spits the spent shell out of the firing chamber. In  all of the test firings of Ross' gun, Morton found, the ejector left an  oval-shaped mark near the outside of the shell.  </P> <P> On the cartridge recovered near Walker, however, the mark was narrower and near  the inside of the shell.  </P> <P> "There's something wrong," Morton said to himself. "The ejector mark is clearly  different."  </P> <P> Then he looked at the tiny impression left by the firing pin as it strikes the  back of the shell, setting off the explosion that sends the bullet speeding  down the barrel of the gun.  </P> <P> The nine test shots police had fired from Ross' Smith &amp; Wesson left a  telltale squiggle, made by a minute defect on the tip of the gun's firing pin.  On the Walker shell, however, there was no such mark.  </P> <P> Morton's suspicion was hardening into a conclusion.  </P> <P> The LAPD report did not mention either of the discrepancies that Morton had  noticed. Instead it linked the Smith &amp; Wesson to the Walker shell by  matching "breechface stria," a jumble of dozens of microscopic scratches left  on the shell.  </P> <P> Morton compared the crime-scene and test shells under the microscope and  confirmed that a few of the scratches seemed to go in the same direction. But  many others were going in different directions, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Couldn't Be the Gun  </P> <P> Morton's dispute with LAPD was more than the typical experts' quarrel over the  degree of certainty -- over how well police had proven their case.  </P> <P> As he saw it, "we were looking at an exclusion." In other words, Ross' gun  couldn't have produced the Walker cartridge.  </P> <P> The analysis of the murder-scene bullets was not so clear. By broad "class  characteristics," Ross' gun could have been the murder weapon. The number and  slant of the grooves inside of the gun's barrel, which cause a bullet to spiral  toward its target, were the same as those found on the slugs taken from the  prostitutes -- "six right," in the experts' parlance.  </P> <P> "But there is nothing unique about these dimensions," Morton said. "There are  tens of thousands of these weapons made with the same characteristic."  </P> <P> Beyond that, LAPD examiners apparently thought they had a distinct detail to  prove the match. It was a defect line that appeared to be similar in both sets  of bullets.  </P> <P> Morton concluded that this was an illusion.  </P> <P> When Trahin examined the bullets, he aligned them incorrectly under a poorly  focused microscope, Morton said. There was not enough evidence to make a "100%  exclusion," he said, but clearly you could not make a positive match between  bullets and gun.  </P> <P> On his second day in the LAPD lab, after confirming his findings by firing and  examining five more test shots, Morton told the defense team that LAPD had  blown the case.  </P> <P> Eager to obtain Ross' release from jail, the lawyers asked Hodgman to come to  the lab on April 24 and meet with Morton.  </P> <P> "They didn't seem really worried," Morton said. "They took the position that  there was room for differences of opinion. But I said, 'I don't think this is  merely a matter of differences of opinion.' "  </P> <P> Hodgman told the defense he could not respond to Morton's results without  talking to Trahin, and Trahin was in Virginia at a convention of the Assn. of  Firearms and Toolmark Examiners, delivering a paper on the conversion of  semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones.  </P> <P> Before Trahin returned, the defense and the prosecution agreed to what was in  effect a tie-breaker. Al Biasotti of the state Department of Justice and John  Murdock of the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department would come to the LAPD  lab for several days.  </P> <P> On the third day of their testing, Murdock and Biasotti told both sides they  should meet. On May 12, the prosecution, defense and LAPD representatives  gathered in a conference room. Before they sat down, Biasotti, carrying  photographs and 18 pages of notes, sought out Trahin to let him know they would  disagree with his findings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Have Been Chance  </P> <P> Murdock, according to one person in attendance, "made a statement in which he  said the main reason he wanted to call the meeting was to make sure this didn't  happen again."  </P> <P> For more than a half-hour Murdock and Biasotti explained why, in the words of  another person in attendance, "the points of identity (between the murder  bullets and the test bullets) that were noted by the LAPD were attributable to  chance or random correspondence."  </P> <P> The quality of equipment at LAPD also came in for criticism. Biasotti suggested  that the evidence be re-tested at the state Department of Justice's lab in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> The meeting broke up. Several people "ran for the phone," said one observer.  </P> <P> Ross' attorneys asked Hodgman and Sterling E. Norris, the head of the district  attorney's special trials section, to drop charges immediately. The prosecutors  said they couldn't make that decision without conferring with superiors. This  was too hot a case. One police agency had put another's officer in jail. He'd  sat there nearly three months.  </P> <P> It was a Friday. A decision would have to wait until Monday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the prosecutors suggested to the police that they might want to look  at the evidence again in light of Murdock's and Biasotti's criticisms.  </P> <P> The Police Department did. The next day it ran more tests on Ross' gun. This  time, said Hodgman, the relationship between the test bullets and the murder  bullets was found to be "inconclusive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still a Suspect  </P> <P> The charges would have to be dropped, even though authorities said that Ross --  dismissed for his conduct on the night of his arrest and for allegedly  tampering with drug evidence -- remains a murder suspect. Ross has declined to  be interviewed by The Times since his release.  </P> <P> A couple of days later, prosecutor Harvey Giss wondered once again how to  regard police experts. What was he supposed to do, he asked, begin hiring  outside examiners himself?  </P> <P> "The thing that upsets me and everybody else so much is that by and large LAPD  is a first-rate organization in our minds. But a problem like this makes  everybody sick because it tarnishes the image of the people who ID blood, hair,  semen, saliva, fabric. They're all stigmatized."  </P> <P> On Friday representatives from LAPD and the district attorney's office agreed  on a formal request from prosecutors that they be able to selectively employ  outside firearms examiners.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Ronald L. Soble, Hector Tobar and Tracy Wood contributed to  this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EVIDENCE THAT MISFIRED  </P> <P>  Microscopic details in a shell casing and bullet fragments led independent  firearms experts to conclude that Los  </P> <P> Angeles police had incorrectly linked a gun found in Rickey Ross' car to the  slaying of three prostitutes.  </P> <P> </P></p>

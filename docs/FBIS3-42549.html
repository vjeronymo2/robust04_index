Nymmik; UDC 543.42:522.124] </F>   [Abstract] The high-energy charged-particle fluxes that  accompany solar flares are a focus of study because of their  effect on biological objects and hardware during spaceflight.  The danger associated with such events depends on the frequency  of the events, the magnitude of the flux, and particle energy  spectrum. Based on acquired experimental data, solar cosmic ray  events are classified here by magnitude of total proton fluence.  At proton energies of more than 30 MeV, power-law functions of  particle rigidity serve well to describe the averaged energy  spectra of peak proton fluxes and proton fluences that  characterize solar cosmic ray events of varying magnitude.  Average energy events become steadily more rigid as event  fluence magnitude grows, and average magnitudes of peak flux  remain proportional to fluence across the entire range of  fluence variation. The averaged energy spectra of anomalously  large and very large events do not contain anomalies in terms of  probability of occurrence or type of energy spectrum. The  average energy spectra of solar cosmic ray events differ from  those of CREME in that they establish the presence of rather  large, high-energy particle fluxes in the solar cosmic events.  Such particle penetrate spacecraft shields, or, after passing  through the Earth's magnetic field, they penetrate to lower  geomagnetic latitudes in the Earth's atmosphere and to the  near-Earth orbits of satellites with small inclinations.

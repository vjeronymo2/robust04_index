			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEARCH ENDS FOR 9 ON CAPSIZED BOAT  </P> <P> Coast Guard on Friday suspended its search for the bodies of nine men presumed  drowned after their fishing trawler capsized and sank in the frigid Bering Sea.  </P> <P> Fishing vessels rescued 22 crew members who had abandoned the sinking ship on  lifeboats.  </P> <P> They were reported in good condition aboard a trawler that was taking them to  Dutch Harbor, about 250 miles southeast of the accident site.  </P> <P> The nine were lost Thursday when the 162-foot Aleutian Enterprise sank,  according to the Coast Guard, which said there was little chance that their  bodies would be found.  </P> <P> "We had a very good search yesterday," Lt. Brian Flory said Friday. "We think  we would have found anyone who was afloat."  </P> <P> The cause of the sinking was unknown, said Christopher Haley, a Coast Guard  spokesman. Weather was reported to be fair when the early afternoon accident  occurred.  </P> <P> None of the crew was wearing survival suits, Haley said. Coast Guard officials  said a person could not survive the frigid 32- to 34-degree water more than 30  minutes without insulated survival gear.  </P></p>

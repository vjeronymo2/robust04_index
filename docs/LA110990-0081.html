			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MAN WHO DUMPED BRAKE FLUID GETS JAIL  </P> <P> A former employee of a Ventura auto repair shop was sentenced to 90 days in  jail and fined $5,000 Thursday after pleading no contest to a charge of dumping  more than 100 gallons of used brake fluid alongside the Ventura Freeway in the  Seacliff area.  </P> <P> Michael Wayne Glaze, 24, now a resident of Utah, also was placed on 36 months  probation by Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III.  </P> <P> Glaze pleaded no contest to a charge of unlawful disposal of hazardous waste. A  second charge against him was dropped.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda S. Groberg said 21 five-gallon cans of the fluid were  found near the freeway Jan. 22.  </P> <P> Some of the material had seeped out, but most was still in the cans, officials  said.  </P> <P> Brake fluid has a high lead content and could pose a public-health danger if it  contaminates the drinking water supply, said Nicholas Guzik, a hazardous waste  investigator for the California Highway Patrol.

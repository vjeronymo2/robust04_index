			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> END VIOLENCE, POPE URGES IN MADAGASCAR  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II on Saturday warned this nation's youth, who within the last  two weeks have been participating in a wave of lethal political riots, to  "reject violence, lies and scorn" and to overcome their uneasiness over their  future in a land of rising unemployment and poverty.  </P> <P> The Pope's remarks came as he addressed a rally of about 20,000 young people  from all over Madagascar on his first full day on the island nation off the  east coast of Africa. The Pope also held a Mass in the old Portuguese port of  Antsiranana at the island's northern tip.  </P> <P> John Paul will continue his fifth African tour with stops in the French island  colony of La Reunion, Zambia and Malawi before returning to Rome on May 6.  </P> <P> His address to the Malagasy youth at a soccer stadium here in the capital  largely took the form of responses to questions prepared by church youth  leaders. He took the opportunity to admonish the youth to "respect your bodies,  not risking thoughtlessly disease or accident . . . by turning to alcohol or  drugs, which will reduce you to slavery."  </P> <P> The pontiff did not specifically refer to AIDS as a disease, but then  Madagascar may be the only African country where such a warning is unnecessary.  Presumably because of the country's isolated geography and insular culture, at  last count there were only three Malagasy people who have tested positive for  the AIDS virus. All were said to be sailors with ports of call on the African  mainland.  </P> <P> Turning to the nation's deteriorating economy, the Pope seemed to acknowledge  only in passing the concrete obstacles standing in the way of a higher standard  of living in Madagascar. The country's crop of rice, a staple of which these  people consume more per capita than any other nationality on earth, was  decimated by cyclones in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1987. The storms ruined  Madagascar's goal of self-sufficiency in the crop and necessitated costly  imports of rice instead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Austerity Program  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a fiscal austerity program imposed by the International Monetary  Fund as the price of millions of dollars in development grants and loans has  forced up the cost of living in the cities more than threefold over the last  two years. The IMF program included a devaluation of the Malagasy franc by more  than half.  </P> <P> The Pope did suggest Saturday that the developed nations must shoulder more  responsibility toward the Third World. The problem of development, he said,  "Stands at the level of the planet: It engages the most favored nations toward  the poorest." But for the most part he laid the responsibility for development  at the feet of the Malagasy people themselves.  </P> <P> And in an apparent reference to the recent riots, which were sparked by  allegations that vote fraud contributed to President Didier Ratsiraka's  election to a third seven-year term, he urged the audience to begin "the  defense of right and justice" by "your own personal comportment."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIELD OF DREAMS AND LAND OF GOLD;  </P> <P> HISTORY: BY THE MID-1850S THERE WERE 6,000 PROSPECTORS -- MORE THAN THE  POPULATION OF THE PUEBLO OF LOS ANGELES AT THE TIME -- SCOURING PLACERITA  CANYON FOR GOLD.  </P> <P> Sometimes it can be good fortune to take a nap after lunch. After Francisco  Lopez took one in the Santa Clarita Valley's Placerita Canyon one day in 1842,  he awoke to find gold.  </P> <P> The discovery, on March 9, 1842, is considered by historians to be the first  major gold strike in California, predating by six years John Marshall's  Sutter's Mill bonanza on the American River just east of Sacramento.  </P> <P> Most people today know nothing about Placerita Canyon gold.  </P> <P> At the time of the strike, "The area was still Spanish land grant property and  it never really became big with gringos. Sutter's Mill helped make California a  state," said Valerie Vartanian, supervisor at Placerita State and County Park.  But Placerita Canyon never received a lot of publicity "and many people back  east didn't even know about it."  </P> <P> Lopez wasn't prospecting for gold on that March afternoon. He and some friends  actually had gone to the San Francisquito Rancho -- which encompassed much of  the Santa Clarita Valley -- to inspect cattle when they stopped to take a break  in a rolling field under a large oak tree, just east of the present-day  Antelope Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> The most popular version of the story, according to historical journals of the  time, is that Lopez settled down for a siesta and dreamed of finding gold. When  he awoke, it was lunchtime, and he decided to spice his food by digging up a  few wild onions. Clinging to them were flecks of gold.  </P> <P> "How much of it is true, I don't know," Vartanian said. Fact or fable, the gold  was real and plentiful enough to have the state declare the tree a California  Historical Landmark on March 6, 1935, and name it "The Oak of the Golden  Dream."  </P> <P> Another, less romantic version of the Lopez discovery is offered by Curator  Elva Meline of the San Fernando Valley Historical Society.  </P> <P> She said that according to "Pre-Marshall Gold in California," Vol. II, by Emil  Bunje and James C. Kean, Lopez's wife asked him to bring back some wild onions  for dinner.  </P> <P> After inspecting cattle in Los Placeritos Canyon on the San Francisquito Rancho  with companions Domingo Bermudez and Manuel Cota, Lopez had lunch under a large  oak tree and took a traditional siesta. Upon awakening, he remembered his  wife's request and went down a nearby slope to dig for onions.  </P> <P> Elated by his gold find, Lopez and his companions dug up more onions and found  additional evidence that his first harvest was not just a fluke. The next day,  they went to the San Fernando Mission to report their find.  </P> <P> According to a journal of the Historical Society of Southern California, Lopez  and his friends sent samples to the governor in Santa Barbara and immediately  petitioned him for the mining title. No record has ever been found that the  title was granted, according to historians, but one chronicle of the time noted  that the original gold was made into earrings for the governor's wife.  </P> <P> The lack of title didn't stop Lopez from mining the territory. In 1843 he  imported 30 experienced prospectors from the Mexican state of Sonora to help  him work the area for "placer gold," so-named because it normally is found in  quiet or placid areas of running streams. Placerita Canyon, which takes its  name from the same word, has many such placid streams.  </P> <P> "When mountains erode," said Vartanian, "all of the bits and pieces of rock go  into the stream and are deposited as sediment. Some of the pieces are gold  flakes. Gold is fairly heavy and will settle down."  </P> <P> By the mid-1850s there were about 6,000 prospectors -- more than the population  of the pueblo of Los Angeles at the time -- scouring the Santa Clarita Valley  for gold. A chronicle of the time noted that the canyon became the first  tourist attraction in Southern California, with out-of-towners regularly making  the 40-mile trip from the city to the gold fields to watch men recovering an  average of $2 worth of the precious metal a day.  </P> <P> By the time Lopez was last mentioned in historical documents in 1854, he and  others had retrieved more than $2 million in gold from the area's streams.  </P> <P> From a historical perspective, Meline said, researchers consider the Placerita  Canyon gold discovery a "medium-sized" find that was far overshadowed by the  mammoth Mother Lode at Sutter's Mill. But, she added, Lopez should be given  proper credit in state history.  </P> <P> "It was not a big find and it is not a large area, so it didn't take very long  to mine the canyon," she said, "but the Lopez discovery had a direct bearing on  the economic development of the future state. It brought people into the area."  </P> <P> Placerita Canyon gold was the first native American gold ever coined in the  United States. A bit more than 18 ounces of Placerita  </P> <P> gold, shipped via the Cape Horn route, arrived at the Philadelphia Mint on July  8, 1843. The gold was valued at $344.75, or more than $19 per ounce, at the  time.  </P> <P> A family by the name of Walker eventually bought the Placerita Canyon property  and later deeded it to the state in 1956. Now operated by the county, the  350-acre park with its Oak of the Golden Dream are off-limits for gold  prospecting, and violators may be fined.  </P> <P> "You can't go into a park and take the trees and plant them in your back yard,  and you can't pan for gold," said Frank Hovore, administrator of the park that  encompasses the original gold discovery site. "Under the mining rules of 1872,  ownership of the land constitutes a legal claim. That means the state is the  legal owner. If you come in and take gold off of another's claim, it's called  claim jumping. You used to get shot for that."  </P> <P> While no one gets shot for gold mining in Placerita Canyon these days, park  officials say, they still find people occasionally trying to pay off their  mortgages by illegal panning.  </P> <P> "This is a wildlife sanctuary, which protects everything, including rocks,  acorns, leaves and gold. It's all considered the same," Vartanian said.  </P> <P> "Hiking is allowed, as is picnicking in restricted areas, but no consumptive or  abusive types of recreation. No off-road vehicles, bikes or hunting."  </P> <P> Park officials say there is still some gold in the area, but the amount is  small since the area was so heavily mined for so long.  </P> <P> "In the eight years I've been here," Vartanian said, "I've pulled a lot of  people out of the canyon, but they've had no gold to show for it."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> POLICE TO TARGET DRUNK DRIVERS  </P> <P> For New Year's Eve, city police plan to do more of what they do often -- arrest  drunk drivers.  </P> <P> Sixteen officers and the police helicopter will be devoted entirely to pulling  over holiday drunks. The city's Driving Under the Influence Task Force will  operate from 7:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. with two-man teams of officers patrolling  the streets and the copter watching from above for suspiciously weaving  motorists.  </P> <P> Normally, the city has a single two-man team of officers patrolling for drunk  drivers. Over the past two years, the teams have logged more than 1,400 drunk  driving arrests and won recognition from Mothers Against Drunk Driving,  according to Sgt. Tom Winter.  </P> <P> For revelers who have had one drink too many on New Year's Eve, Yellow Cab of  North Orange County and Orange Coast Yellow Cab will be offering free rides  home under a program sponsored by local beer and wine wholesalers, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Greencore The Irish government's shareholding in Greencore may now have been placed, but the episode highlights the sadly familiar episode of an aggressive stockbroker's excessive ambition. The Irish government wanted the job to go to a national broker for political reasons. Astonishingly, no one stopped to consider Greencore's 15 per cent ownership limit which would automatically be exceeded if Davy failed to get the issue away and was stuck with shares. But Greencore is little known outside Ireland and Davy has limited experience dealing with international investors. While telling the market the 25m shares were placed, it was forced to take 4.45m of them on to the books of associated investors. The Irish stock exchange is understandably concerned about a possible false market in Greencore's shares and has rightly launched an investigation. If the affair reflects badly on Davy, it is more surprising that a house with the skills and reputation of Warburg should have allowed itself to be dragged into the controversy. Warburg agreed to take on 2.54m of the unplaced Greencore shares in its capacity as underwriter but seems to have been uncharacteristically lax in not keeping abreast of how the placing was going. Thus it was caught by surprise when the trouble blew up. That is not what one would expect of the super-smooth mastermind behind BT3.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm problem taxes Pakistani politicians - Farhan Bokhari on the opposing claims of the economy and the agricultural sector PAKISTANI FARMERS are quietly confident that they will retain their freedom from direct taxation when the country's annual budget is announced next month. But with economic problems deepening and recession-hit aid donors looking more critically at the recipients of their largesse, the agricultural sector's privileged position is far from secure. Agriculturure is one of the biggest earners in the Pakistani economy but the feudal landlords, who have a strong representation among the country's elite and ruling politicians, have so far successfully resisted attempts to encircle them in the tax net. According to government statistics, agriculture accounts for 26 per cent of Pakistan's gross domestic product. In human terms it is even more important. At least half of the country's work-force is employed in farming while almost three-quarters of its 110m people live in villages, relying directly or indirectly on this sector. On the issue of introducing agricultural income tax, Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, was recently quoted as saying that 'income tax is impossible to impose on agricultural incomes because of difficulties in measurements, and no other feasible proposal for some alternate tax has yet come up for taxing agricultural sector'. Only four years ago, Mr Aziz was the chairman of a high-powered government commission, that recommended a fixed tax on ownership of agricultural land, as part of a more effective system. But recently, he said that it was up to local councils to introduce such a tax as part of a more practical system. Officials concede privately, however, that the issue continues to be a difficult one to deal with. The country needs to widen its tax base, to raise more revenue for narrowing its budgetary deficit. Pakistan is expected to seek USDollars 2.4bn at the aid consortium meeting that begins in Paris today and western economists in Islamabad say that the worldwide recession and the resultant pressure on aid budgets, has forced many donors to look closely at recipient countries' own performances in raising revenues and restricting waste domestically. In Pakistan's case, says one expert, 'the issue of agricultural tax is one such concern'. He also says, however, that despite these concerns development planners recognise that the agricultural sector has suffered this year, mainly in the cotton sector, which suffered from a drop in prices on the world market. As a result, 'new aid pledges may not be affected, though we'd want to see if the government has any plans to deal with this in future'. One senior official says that even if such a tax is introduced, concerns will remain about how it will be collected and what effect it will have on the poorest among the poor. The country's taxation system is ridden with corruption, which leads to large-scale evasion. As a result, there are no clear estimates of the extent of new revenues that could be generated through agriculture. Among the social consequences, one concern is that the poorest farmers may suffer from wage cuts or reduced crop shares if their employers are made to pay taxes.</p>

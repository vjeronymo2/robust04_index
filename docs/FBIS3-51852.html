			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Part two of two-part article by Danilo Aguirre Solis] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]  <H5>  Confrontation, Violence, War </H5>   In the preceding article we said that the message the voters  sent to Sandinism in April 1990 had two parts: their fatigue  with war, and the siren song of economic abundance.    We have already discussed the latter; now let us look at the  first point.    War of the magnitude it had reached at the end of the 1980's  has disappeared, but the government can take more credit for  this than the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. In  fact, it was when the new government took office that the  imperialist sponsorship of armed counterrevolution ceased, and  it is the new government that is spearheading the dismantling of  the army of resistance.    In this phase, Sandinism bears the responsibility for  reducing the Army and its ensuing disputes, and it must stand  firm in professionalizing the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] and  the police.    However, it has not been possible to dispel fully the idea  of  some underground sponsorship of new episodes of violence,  particularly as a good part of those outbreaks are to some  extent legitimized by the justice of the demands.    So we must still go further in converting the Army and the  police, in the eyes of the citizens--both Sandinists and  non-Sandinists--into models of professionalism, thus erasing any  doubt about dual loyalties and, through this process, firmly  preventing this government from converting them into pretorian  guards that will back arbitrary actions and revanchism,  particularly in the case of the Ministry of Government and the  police.    Finally, there is the behavior of popular organizations and  their methods, an area where we sincerely believe we have not  managed to eliminate some of the stigmas attached to us, stigmas  that contributed to the 1990 defeat.    We have not yet learned to distinguish between the use of  violence to stop revanchist violence and the socio-economic  crushing of the people. Taking these methods to extremes will  culminate in destruction or unnecessary troubles that are  frowned upon by those whom we wish to attract to our cause, and  even worse, will lead the government to wash its hands and claim  to be victims of Sandinism, which does not allow it to govern.  Despite the falsity of that charge, it cannot be denied that we  are still viewed as combative and violent by the ordinary  citizen, who subconsciously expects even worse clashes if we get  back in the government.    We need to remember the resources that we control so that in  any conflict, without renouncing our principles and our demands,  we can make use of these resources, and so make our claims  stronger and bring together the majority of the Nicaraguan  population.    We know that improving our methods of struggle is a serious  challenge in today's grave situation, but facing such challenges  is part of the integral vision that a good politician needs to  have.    Let us leave for a third part the FSLN's political work and  its repercussions on the Sandinist grass roots and the people in  general. That is perhaps where we have made the most progress,  even though we continue to read articles about the so-called  co-government, articles which contain the same amount of  disinformation as in the beginning, and the same line that  unconsciously blocks the harmony that must exist between  political action and popular struggle.    In summary, perhaps we may also include in this next part  other elements that affect this entire situation: the lack of an  alternative, essentially Sandinist program; the issue of  personalities in the leadership; and electoral expectations of  combining those personalities with future presidential  candidacies.</p>

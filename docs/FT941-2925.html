			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Management: When less could mean more - Christopher Lorenz on a shake-up in the funding of UK design The maxim that 'less is more' has always provoked controversy among designers. It was coined early this century by the fathers of the modern movement to convey the principle - often challenged since - that the best design is always lean. As from this week, designers in Britain, and their corporate clients, are being asked to accept the maxim in a different sense: that annual government design grants totalling Pounds 6m will actually be more effective than the Pounds 7.5m given for the last few years. The cut is being accompanied by a shake-up in the way the government promotes design in industry. The workforce of the government-funded Design Council, which provides design services direct to industry, is being cut to about 50 people, less than a quarter of its present size. Its provision of consultancy and other services is being transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry's nascent network of multipurpose business service centres, known as Business Link. The Design Council will become a research, education and campaigning organisation. When the government first outlined these moves six months ago, it seemed that less would mean less. At that stage, the DTI wanted to cut the Design Council's annual grant to about Pounds 3m from Pounds 7.5m. It also planned to give no extra funds to Business Link, in spite of the expansion of its remit to include the council's previous services to industry. Then Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary - who was ill at the time of last autumn's announcement - decided that if Business Link were to take on the extra services, it needed more resources. Hence this week's decision to commit an extra Pounds 2m a year to Business Link over the next three years, taking its 1994-95 budget from Pounds 17m to Pounds 19m. Together with the provision of an extra annual Pounds 1m to the 'new' Design Council, this mitigates the cut in the government's overall spending on design support to 20 per cent. Within the new total, the 'less is more' principle will apply: only about Pounds 1.5m a year will be spent on Design Council fixed costs and overheads, compared with more than Pounds 6m in the current year, leaving more funding for design research and promotion. Behind Heseltine's intervention, it is understood, lies his recognition that in increasingly tough international markets, high quality and good service are becoming mere qualifications for competing; they differentiate one product from another far less than they did as recently as the late 1980s. As a result, design is becoming a much more important 'differentiator' in all sorts of industries. One example of this is the remarkable success of the Rover 600 series of cars in Britain, and, increasingly, other parts of Europe. The model is identical to its sister car, the Honda Accord, except in its interior and exterior design cosmetics, yet these give it a very different character. This has helped it to outsell the Accord in the UK. The Rover 600 is one of six products to win the Design Council's annual transport awards, announced yesterday. A string of examples where industrial design has had a far-reaching impact on successful products went on show last week at London's Design Museum*. All the products - except for the Rover - are made by Japanese companies, but with considerable input by British designers. Exhibits include NEC's UltraLite Versa Notebook Computer which has more than quadrupled the Japanese company's share of the booming US notebook market from 2.5 per cent since its launch a year ago. NEC attributes much of the product's success to its modular design, on which the company has received considerable assistance from IDEO, an Anglo-American design consultancy. *Designed in one - made in the other: new products of collaboration between Britain and Japan.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: BBV raises dividend despite fall in profits BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest private bank, yesterday reported a 19.9 per cent drop in net profits for 1992 but will increase its dividend because of an improvement in its core banking business. BBV blamed the lowered profits of Pta81.1bn (Dollars 71m), against Pta101.2bn in 1991, on a 42 per cent drop in extraordinary income. The bank earned Pta70.4bn through non-banking business in 1991, chiefly through the disposal of two subsidiaries. However, this fell to Pta40.2bn last year. Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, justified a Pta6 increase in the dividend to Pt169 per share on account of an improvement in the bank's operating profit, which rose 11.1 per cent to Pta136bn, and its ordinary profit, up 8.6 per cent to Pta74.2bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani,  president of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, has replied to a  message sent by Levon Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic  of Armenia, in the following terms:    Mr. Levon Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic of  Armenia: I have received Your Excellency's message in which you  mentioned the participation of a number of irresponsible Afghans  in the war between your country and the republic of Azerbaijan  over the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Afghan side  understands the feelings and concerns of the leadership and the  people of Armenia.    Your Excellency, president of the Republic of Armenia: The  Islamic Government of Afghanistan has experienced the bitter  taste of occupation and interference by the old Soviet Union.  For two years this country has been dealing with the negative  impact of foreign occupation and various interference. Afghans  are peace-loving people and do not have any interest in  interfering in other countries' affairs. The presence of a  number of Afghans participating in the war between your country  and Azerbiajan has no connection with the Islamic State of  Afghanistan and the war-torn Afghan nation; and those who have  taken part as mercenary soldiers do not have any jehadi  background and have not been in the ranks of Afghanistan's  mojahedin.    Mr. President, it is with regret that I have to inform you  and through you the Armenian nation that a number of  warmongering groups have, on the instructions of foreigners,  acted to promote political and social instability in Afghanistan  and have employed a number of Afghan workers for financial  purposes to seek financial sources to support the militias  associated with the old Soviet Union, and have dragged them to  take part in the war between your country and Azerbaijan.  [sentence as heard] [passage omitted]    Your Excellency, the presence of a number of mercenaries and  dealers in the name of Afghanistan's mojahedin in the war that  you have mentioned cannot spoil the relations between  Afghanistan and Armenia. The Afghan side is striving to halt as  soon as possible these inhuman dealings of a number of rebels,  whose profits have been and will be used for activities against  national security and political stability in Afghanistan.  Taking this opportunity, I wish health, long life, and success  to your excellency, and the welfare of Armenian people.    [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the  Islamic State of Afghanistan</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Revolt cements Mexican parties' electoral accord The peasant uprising in the Mexican state of Chiapas has achieved what years of negotiating between the country's main political parties could not. It has made the government and the main opposition forces agree the electoral rules for a presidential election. The electoral pact between the main parties for the poll in August could be the most important political reform of the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas. It marks the first time the left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) has accepted the electoral system as legitimate and the pact should pave the way for a credible and peaceful ballot. The governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has made, on paper, substantial concessions. It has agreed to pick electoral authorities acceptable to all parties, to guarantee equal access to the media and to appoint a prosecutor for electoral fraud. Also, although this is not part of the agreement, the limit on each party's campaign spending has been cut from the equivalent of Dollars 210m to Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.6m). 'This is the beginning of a democratic transition in Mexico,' says Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the government's commissioner for peace in Chiapas and former mayor of Mexico City. With President Salinas, he helped forge the agreement. Much can still go wrong, and many details of the pact need to be negotiated. The PRI rank and file, unlikely to be happy about the concessions its leaders have made, may not comply with the pact's provisions. The PRD would then quit the agreement, accusing the government of duplicity. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD presidential candidate, said on Thursday that the pact was 'an important and positive step.' He admitted to taking a serious risk in accepting the government proposals. Mr Camacho is clear about the motivation behind the electoral pact: 'I could not have resolved Chiapas without this political reform.' One of the principal demands of the Zapatista guerrilla rebels in the southern state has been greater democratic participation by all Mexicans. The pact also has the potential advantage of bringing the PRD into the political mainstream. Mr Salinas has spent much of his administration trying to stamp out the PRD - one reason, critics claim, that leftist Zapatista rebels had to seek extra-political solutions to their conflicts. The PRD may have seen its popularity climb after the revolt in Chiapas but Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate, remains the strong favourite to win in August. The threat of post-electoral violence, however, probably convinced him to support the inter-party pact and settle differences with Mr Cardenas. Mr Salinas, before leaving yesterday for the Davos conference in Switzerland, reiterated at a private breakfast with PRI legislators and governors that Mr Colosio would be the party candidate. The president was seeking to dispel rumours that Mr Colosio would be replaced by Mr Camacho. Mr Salinas said: 'The PRI has a candidate who will bring it a democratic victory,' according to Mexican press and television. The latter, who was being pessimistic last weekend about peace in Chiapas, is now more hopeful. He has reported new communication with the guerrillas. The government, through offering money and political change in Chiapas, is moving to address the other main rebel demand - improved living conditions for the indigenous peoples in the state. This may still not be enough. Rebel leaders have dropped early demands for the overthrow of the Salinas government but no-one can be sure that their followers will be satisfied with what the government is offering. 'The rebels are fighting the same battle we are,' says a government official familiar with the negotiations. 'They're divided between violent extremists and those who hope to achieve their goals through the reform of the political and judicial process.'</p>

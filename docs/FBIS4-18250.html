			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julio Riquelme: "Pujol Will Not Change His </F> Strategy of Ad Hoc Agreements With Government"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Convergence and Union [CiU] will not  change its strategy of ad hoc agreements with the government,  because it believes that the 33d PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers  Party] Congress did not serve to end the Socialist Party's  internal conflicts and that therefore "nothing has changed as  far as we are concerned," according to CiU leadership sources.    The latest proposal by Raimon Obiols, Socialist Party of  Catalonia secretary general, for CiU to agree to form a  coalition government with the PSOE was rejected yesterday both  by Pujol and other leaders of both Convergence and Union  consulted by this newspaper. In this case, there is agreement  between Democratic Convergence of Catalonia and the Democratic  Union of Catalonia in stating that "the solution that the PSOE  has given to its crisis was just a mere exercise in internal  balancing in order to make this legislative term last as long as  possible -- in short, in order to stay in power."    For CiU it is therefore inconceivable for it to involve  itself more in government activity with a party -- the PSOE --  that remains "in a precarious political situation." In fact,  the CiU leadership will follow closely the course of the  Socialist regional congresses because it believes that "although  the Catalan Socialists have already held theirs, the struggle  between renewalists and Guerraists could be repeated --  especially in Andalusia and Madrid -- and then we will know  Gonzalez' real control and Guerra's real intentions."    Jordi Pujol himself told this newspaper following his first  postelection meeting with Gonzalez: "With which PSOE would I  reach agreement? With Felipe's, with Alfonso's, or with  Felipe's and Alfonso's?" Those close to Pujol believe that the  33d congress did not resolve that uncertainty.    Hence the CiU leadership, after analyzing the Socialist  congress results, has decided to maintain its strategy of ad hoc  parliamentary agreements with the PSOE, based on two parameters  -- continuing to contribute to the legislature's stability and  securing the greatest possible quids pro quo for this support.

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Big battalions improve finances MOST of the largest trade unions improved their financial position last year, according to a survey by the Labour Research Department, a union research organisation. The survey found many unions had taken steps to reverse financial declines, but the LRD warned the situation was still precarious. A number of new pressures faced unions, including the government's forthcoming legislation on the 'check-off' system of members paying union contributions. The proposed law will require members regularly to re-authorise their payments. LRD said this could increase the likelihood of 'disaffected or disorganised members dropping out'. Finances of most of the unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress worsened in the late 1980s for several reasons, including falling membership. The TUC warned last year that 'the maintenance of effective control of expenditure must remain a major priority'. The LRD found membership generally fell again last year, but most unions increased their dues. Six of the biggest 10 unions performed better last year than in 1990. These were Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse, the public service unions; the GMB general union; MSF, the manufacturing, science and finance union; and Usdaw, the shopworkers union. All produced a surplus on income and expenditure. Only Nupe and Usdaw produced a surplus in 1990. The biggest deficit of Pounds 12.4m was incurred by the TGWU general union. The union said yesterday that it believed it had turned the corner by cutting staff and raising dues. Ninety large companies have paid 227 departing directors a total of nearly Pounds 33m over the past 18 months, according to the LRD. The LRD survey of companies paying out 'golden handshakes' worth more than Pounds 100,000 showed an average pay-out of Pounds 144,720. At least nine directors received more than Pounds 400,000 each. A similar survey last year found 85 companies paid 186 directors a total of Pounds 25.1m, an average pay-off of Pounds 135,079. Sometimes golden handshakes had riders on them, said the LRD, with agreements by the recipients not to work for main competitors for a period of time. The LRD is proposing that the rules governing disclosure of company financial information on such payouts needed tightening as the majority of company accounts did not detail payments to individual directors.

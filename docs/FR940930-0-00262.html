			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For proposed pre-foreclosure sales that ``fall through,'' or are sought without positive result, the mortgagee should file its claim under existing procedures for conveyance claims, and in compliance with any additional provisions which may be applicable to conveyance claims that follow a mortgagor's unsuccessful participation in the PFS procedure. Section 203.355 has been amended to include definitions of the ``end of participation'' in the Pre-foreclosure Sale procedure, so mortgagees can calculate the appropriate timeframe within which they must initiate foreclosure or accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure where no actual pre-foreclosure sale has resulted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A conforming amendment is also being made to &sect;200.155(a). That section provides for the various methods by which a mortgagee may perfect a claim for the payment of mortgage insurance benefits. The case of a pre-foreclosure sale is being added to this list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 203.501 is being added to set forth the Department's policy that mortgagees must consider the financial consequences of their elective servicing action and that HUD expects mortgagees to take those appropriate actions which will generate the smallest financial loss to the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Justification for Interim Rule and for the 45-day Comment Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to have notice and public procedure before making the provisions of this interim rule effective, and that expeditious promulgation of this interim rule provides a benefit to all the parties involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A successfully completed pre-foreclosure sale benefits the mortgagor, who avoids the stigma of foreclosure on his or her credit record, and also benefits HUD, which can expect to save by not paying foreclosure-related costs. HUD also saves on maintenance costs and marketing expenses for properties which would otherwise be conveyed to the Department following foreclosure. Mortgagees also benefit through incorporating this loss-mitigation technique into their overall loan servicing, by earning an additional administrative fee and by frequently being able to file claims for insurance benefits sooner, following a successful pre-foreclosure sale, than they would following a post-foreclosure conveyance claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the requirements and procedures contained in this interim rule are based on the Pre-Foreclosure Sale Demonstration Program established by a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 29, 1991, at 56 FR 24324, and because this interim rule takes into consideration the public comments received on that notice, the Department believes there is adequate justification for shortening the public comment period to 45 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sunset Provision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has adopted a policy of setting a date for expiration of an interim rule unless a final rule is published before that date. Therefore, this interim rule will expire on a date 18 months from the date of publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Finding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Information Collection Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The collection of information requirements contained in this interim rule have been submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The public reporting burden for the collection of information requirements contained in this interim rule is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Information on these requirements is provided as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

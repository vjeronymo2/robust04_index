			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, June 2 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs shelled a  British UN base in central Bosnia-Herzegovina Wednesday [1 June]  but stopped their attack after NATO planes swooped down, a UN  military spokesman said Thursday [2 June]. The "close air  support" was called in by the local UN commander, said Major Rob  Annink for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). He said the  Serbs fired seven rounds within five minutes Wednesday afternoon  near the UN British base in the central town of Bugojno. One of  the shells came down inside the base but caused only material  damage.    The Serbs fired six more shells and two rockets into the  town  Wednesday evening after the UNPROFOR command had sent a protest  letter to the Bosnian Serb headquarters and evacuated all  non-essential UN personnel -- 220 people -- to the town of  Gornji Vakuf, 15 kilometers (nine miles) away.    The UN commander in Bugojno requested close air support from  the UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia General Bertrand de  Lapresle and special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi, Annink said. He  said De Lapresle and Akashi authorized the flights at 8:50 P.M.  (1850 GMT), while the Serb attacks were still under way.  Shortly before that, UNPROFOR Chief-of-Staff in Bosnia General  Adrian Van Baal called his Serb counterpart, General Manojlo  Milovanovic, "discussing with him the possibility of close air  support," Annink said. The UN planes were in the air over  Bugojno and saw the tanks but did not use force because "they  were not sure these were the tanks that were firing into the  town," the spokesman said. But the attacks stopped a short time  later, with Milovanovic confirming the shelling was over in a  second telehphone call to Van Baal.    It was the second time in a week that the threat of close  air  support prompted an end to a Serb attack on UNPROFOR facilities.  The other incident happened Tuesday [31 May] in the northern  town of Tuzla, a UN safe area, when the local UN commander asked  for close air support after Serbs shelled the Tuzla air base.  The flights were not authorized in that case because the Serb  shelling stopped after a phone conversation between Van Baal and  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Annink said the two  incidents showed "that close air support is a good means of  deterrence of attacks."</p>

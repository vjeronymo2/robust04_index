			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIN OF MURDER VICTIM SPOT SUSPECT; MAN JAILED  </P> <P> A man suspected of raping and shooting two women and a teen-age girl in their  Inglewood home nine days ago was arrested after relatives of one victim, who  was killed in the attack, spotted him as they drove to a funeral home to view  the woman's body.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police officers arrested J.C. Metoyer, 19, in the Crenshaw District  about 6 p.m. Saturday. He was being held without bail at the Inglewood Police  Department jail on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and rape.  </P> <P> Inglewood police said they received calls throughout the day Saturday from  Crenshaw-area residents who said they had spotted Metoyer after a photo of the  reputed gang member was displayed by the news media.  </P> <P> The final sighting was made by the family of a 19-year-old woman, who was  killed in the June 3 attack that also sent a 33-year-old woman and her  14-year-old daughter to the hospital.  </P> <P> The relatives flagged down a Los Angeles police car shortly after spotting  Metoyer on Crenshaw Boulevard, Inglewood Police Sgt. Bill Snyder said.  </P> <P> Metoyer was unarmed and offered no resistance when officers approached him  moments later in the 4700 block of Crenshaw, Snyder said.  </P> <P> Police said that early on the morning of June 3, a gunman forced his way into a  home on Doty Avenue where the two women and the 14-year-old lived with two  younger children.  </P> <P> The intruder ordered the two women and the teen-ager to undress, then bound  them and sexually assaulted them. He then ransacked the home, throwing  valuables in a pillowcase, before herding the victims together and shooting  each several times, police said.  </P> <P> Police said the mother and daughter, who are recovering, were able to identify  Metoyer.  </P></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Indonesia's forest fires fan fury in Malaysia: An ecological disaster In mid-summer, Malaysia and Singapore noticed something strange happening to the weather. On most days a thick haze, caused mainly by forest fires in neighbouring Indonesia, blanketed much of the Malay Peninsula. The authorities warned of the dangers to health. There were also air traffic control problems. Indonesia has now admitted the extent of the damage, describing the fires as one of the worst ecological disasters in the country's history. 'Based on the latest reports, the current fires have covered up to 5.1m hectares,' said Mr Djamaluddin Suryohadikusumo, Indonesian forestry minister. In recent days, rains have doused many of the fires, but underground peat deposits continue to burn over an area larger than the Netherlands. Within Indonesia, arguments over the cause of the fires continue, while Malaysia and Singapore worry about the effects of the haze. There have been worries about health; there are concerns that recent events could do serious damage to the multi-billion-dollar tourist industries of both countries, and in Malaysia there have been warnings of a dip in agricultural production. The fires are believed to have initially broken out in early August, during a prolonged drought. At first, the Jakarta authorities did not seem over-concerned: the smoke did not affect the main Indonesian island of Java but blew north-west towards Singapore and Malaysia. Mr Djamaluddin is adamant that about 90 per cent of the fires were started by local communities who practise a slash-and-burn form of farming to clear land for agricultural uses. But environmental groups in Indonesia blame the fires on plantation companies who took advantage of a prolonged dry season to burn land and plant palm oil. They also point the finger at logging companies who, they say, are recklessly degrading forests and leaving large amounts of combustible debris behind. Critics say the Indonesian government not only lacks the necessary equipment to try to control such fires; they contend it has shown little willingness to intervene and settle land disputes between settlers and logging companies, thought to be one of the other causes of the fires. A fire on Kalimantan in 1982 destroyed a similar area of rain forest. 'This present fire ranks as the worst,' said Ms Emmy Hafild of the Indonesian forum for the environment, a leading non-governmental organisation. 'This will happen every time we have a long drought, because most of our forests have been degraded.' Environmentalists are concerned about the increasing frequency of large forest fires in Indonesia. Apart from the big fire in 1982, serious blazes also occurred in 1987 and 1991. Neither Malaysia or Singapore have publicly criticised Indonesia over the fires. Malaysia has its own pollution problems, the result of eight years of more than 8 per cent economic growth, and is reluctant to lay all the blame on Indonesia. But there is also a wider issue. Indonesia is seen much as the 'big brother' of the Association of South-East Asian nations (Asean). Asean prides itself on solving its problems through consensus. This can mean potentially tough issues are often ignored. So far, the only outside help accepted by Jakarta has been an offer from Singapore to give more weather information.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC'S SMITH FINDS THE BOTTOM LINE ON OFFENSE;  </P> <P> HE HOPES TO BLOCK OUT BAD TIMES BY STAYING ON GROUND AGAINST UTAH STATE  </P> <P> So you think the USC offense just had an off night against Illinois?  </P> <P> That's one theory.  </P> <P> Another is that the offense is having an off year.  </P> <P> Pretty harsh? That theory was floated Tuesday by no less an authority than  Coach Larry Smith.  </P> <P> "It could be a long time before our offense gets back to where we were a year  ago," Smith said. "It may not be this year. It could be a year or two from  now."  </P> <P> The big difference, of course, is at quarterback, where the Trojans have gone  from Rodney Peete, runner-up for the Heisman Trophy last season, to Todd  Marinovich, a redshirt freshman.  </P> <P> Smith said: "You just don't take an experienced quarterback out of your offense  and say, 'I've got a new guy that's going to do the job.' You're just not going  to have the same sync so you've got to find it somewhere else."  </P> <P> Smith is certainly looking elsewhere. Particularly at the running game.  </P> <P> Since USC stumbled through the 14-13 season-opening loss to Illinois Sept. 4,  generating just two field goals and 199 yards in total offense, Smith has  shaken things up for Saturday night's game against Utah State at the Coliseum,  moving Ricky Ervins in for Aaron Emanuel at tailback, Brent Parkinson for Dan  Barnes at guard and Bill Schultz for Michael Moody at tackle.  </P> <P> In addition, Marcus Hopkins takes over for All-American Cleveland Colter at  safety.  </P> <P> Smith reserved his harshest criticism for the line Tuesday. Even in the worst  of times, USC has relied on its vaunted running game to keep the offense  moving.  </P> <P> Whatever else the Trojans had, there was always, it seemed, Student Body Right  and Student Body Left. Against the Fighting Illini, it was Student Body Lost.  </P> <P> "Illinois beat us at the line of scrimmage," Smith said. "They beat us one on  one. To run the football, you've got to block people. We didn't block well  enough. We didn't sustain blocks. We didn't drive people out of there. There  are a few times we did and the backs missed the holes. Other than (center Brad)  Leggett, I don't think our line played well at all."  </P> <P> Enter Ervins, Parkinson and Schultz.  </P> <P> "You find out who wants to play and who doesn't," Smith said. "And who is going  to actually play. Now these guys (the ones who lost their starting spots)  played hard. They just didn't play well. Our tackle got stuffed. Our guard got  stuffed. You can't let that happen."  </P> <P> Parkinson, a 6-foot-6, 260-pound senior, certainly didn't expect it to happen.  </P> <P> "It surprised us," he said. "We really wanted to have a good game so we could  take a lot of the pressure off (the quarterback). We just never really came  together. One guy would mess up. Then another guy would mess up. Consistently,  someone would be messed up."  </P> <P> The line not only didn't open holes, but didn't close them when the blitz was  on.  </P> <P> "We have to expect that they're going to want to blitz a lot, especially since  we have a young quarterback," Parkinson said. "They want to put pressure on him  so that he'll be flustered a little bit and won't be as consistent. As an  offensive line, we have to pick up that extra pressure and make him look good."  </P> <P> Both Emanuel and Colter were expected to look good this season, Emanuel to  finally reach the potential promised but never delivered, Colter to deliver  again as he did a year ago when he was an All-American.  </P> <P> But both made glaring errors against Illinois. Emanuel fumbled, ending a  third-quarter drive. Colter missed a tackle on Shawn Wax on the Fighting  Illini's first scoring play, a 53-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jeff  George.  </P> <P> "Last year's All-Americans don't count this year," Smith said. "I think Hoppie  (Hopkins, who scored USC's only touchdown on a blocked punt) played better than  Cleveland.  </P> <P> "Cleveland will play. We're not benching Cleveland. We're giving him every  chance in the book to be back where he wants to be. But he had four missed  tackles. You can't have four missed tackles at one position and play on the  defense. If we did that, we'd have 44 missed tackles and that would be about 70  points."  </P> <P> Colter has been slow to recover from a serious knee injury that cost him the  last four games of the 1988 season and reduced his playing time in preseason  camp.  </P> <P> "Maybe his timing is off and he's not quite there," Smith said. "He's worked  hard. He's been at every practice. So his attitude is fine."  </P> <P> As for Emanuel, Smith said, "He didn't play terrible. He just didn't make  anything happen."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> Tailback Scott Lockwood, originally ruled out for three weeks because of a  dislocated thumb suffered in the Illinois game, could be out for the season.  Lockwood is wearing a cast but if his condition doesn't improve over the next  few weeks, he faces season-ending surgery. . . . Flanker Calvin Holmes will  take Lockwood's spot on both punt returns and as a reserve tailback.  </P> <P> Linebacker Scott Ross, forced into a reserve role against Illinois because of a  pulled hamstring, will be back in the starting lineup Saturday. . . . Reserve  linebacker Al Aliipule is out for the season after having had shoulder surgery.  . . . Quarterback Pat O'Hara, who was hospitalized with a season-ending knee  injury suffered in a preseason scrimmage, and then went back to the hospital  for additional surgery, is finally home and hopes to be on the sideline  Saturday.  </P></p>

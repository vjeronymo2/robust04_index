			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sead Turkovic report from the Information Service of the </F> 1st Army Corps]    [Excerpt] The Sarajevo region has been relatively quiet  today. The aggressor is sporadically targeting the lines of  defense with small arms. A mortar shell fired from the chetnik  position exploded in Zagorska Ulica. The same happened in  Dobrinja and Vrbanja Most.    The situation on the Ilijas front is again flaring up. After  a brief lull, the chetnik artillery at Krnjaca, [word  indistinct], Medojevici, and [words indistinct] became active  with full force. From these positions, the regions of Mosevicko  Brdo, (?Poret), and Milovac were hit with several hundred  artillery projectiles of various caliber from different  artillery pieces. At the same time, the aggressor also fired  over 500 projectiles on Vrhove, Visicko Brdo, and Borovo Brdo  from Nobozice, Kamenicke Stjene, and Dubine. The latest reports  from this front indicate that the chetniks are continuing  deploying new artillery pieces and bringing fresh forces,  because in their four attempts to penetrate our defense  positions at Taracin Dol they suffered considerable losses and  were pushed back to their initial positions [passage omitted]</p>

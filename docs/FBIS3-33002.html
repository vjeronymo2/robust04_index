			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 14 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The OAS asserted  today that development models must result from the decisions and  efforts of each state within a favorable foreign context and  with the support of renewed international cooperation. "They  must not be imposed from abroad or based on a sole paradigm,"  the OAS asserted in a preliminary document for the  "Inter-American Cooperation for Development" meeting that will  be inaugurated here next Thursday. The OAS stated that, for this  reason, it is necessary to generate a new concept and form of  cooperation solidarity for development within the organization;  one that will allow it to overcome problems and respond to  current situations more effectively.    Two documents were prepared for the meeting, which will be  attended by foreign ministers and representatives of the 34 OAS  member states and will end on Saturday. The documents will be  the center of the Special OAS General Assembly deliberations.    The first document is an attempt to reach "agreements on  strategies and systems that will further the achievement of  integrated development, the struggle against extreme poverty,  and the improvement of the basic levels of social and economic  well-being in the hemisphere." The document emphasizes that "it  is first necessary to strengthen the role of the OAS as a forum  for inter-American dialogue as this will enable it to promote  the development of the member states." It observes that  activities should be geared to those areas in which the  organization has comparative advantages, meaning where it can  complement the actions of other organizations to boost the  development of its member states. To further this end, -- the  document asserts -- special attention will be given to efforts  to coordinate development financing; to foster the creation of  productive jobs; and to propitiate economic integration,  commercial opening, and access to markets. Attention will also  be given to the fight against the use, production, and  trafficking of illegal drugs, as well as related crimes. The  preservation, enrichment, and transmission of the countries'  cultural identities and languages will also be furthered, as  well as public administration strengthened.    The second document, which is called "Commitment To Promote  Cooperation Solidarity and To Overcome Poverty," notes the  effects of the economic crisis that jeopardized most of the  countries in the region during the past decade. In this sense,  the second document highlights the reforms made by the OAS to  eliminate extreme poverty and foster integrated development in  its member states. For example, the OAS created the  Inter-American Council for Integrated Development that is aimed  at promoting cooperation solidarity for development.    An OAS report indicates that democracy "has been  revitalized"  on the American continent as, perhaps, nowhere else in the  world. The report on OAS activities, which was published in the  OAS TODAY magazine, observes that representative democracy is  the rule in the countries of the region. It highlights that  many of the democratic changes experienced on the continent  occurred prior to those that took place in Central and Eastern  Europe. The report estimates that governments elected by the  people have substituted de facto leaders in several countries  and that other nations have gradually strengthened their  democratic structures and institutions. It highlights the OAS  commitment to the modernization of economic structures and to  the achievement of social justice and adds that making democracy  a sustainable system is "an essential task" at the OAS.</p>

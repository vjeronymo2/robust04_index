			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (5): Not a lot of cover to run for - Insurance is causing persistent management headaches Pollution is giving Mr Alan Fleming, the executive director of the the UK's Association of Risk and Insurance Managers, a headache. Mr Fleming views the shortage of cover for environmental liabilities as one of the biggest problems facing the 300 or so industrial and commercial insurance buyers represented by the association. Faced by legal uncertainties and fears that they could be landed with the costs of cleaning up more than 500,000 acres of polluted land, insurers are increasing their prices and reining back the scope of protection offered to customers. 'There is no question that it is an important issue,' says Mr Fleming. 'The big concern is retrospective liabilities. Unless the legislation becomes absolutely clear, I am afraid we will find another area where the insurance industry is not responding,' he adds. Insurers are concerned by several trends. The establishment of a more rigorous regime of pollution control and remediation in the UK. The 1990 Environmental Protection Act provides powers for local authorities to force site occupiers to clean up contamination irrespective of proof of fault. Similarly, the 1991 Water Resources Act makes provision for cleaning up polluted rivers. Under the legislation, bankers foreclosing on a loan to a property company could become liable for the cost of cleaning up contamination. Europe: Insurers are also worried about potential developments in European law, following indications that some EU officials favour an extension of strict liability in relation to clean-up costs. Recent common law cases: The ruling of an appeal court last year, in a case involving Eastern Counties Leather and Cambridge Water, caused particular consternation before it was overturned by the House of Lords on December 9. The appeal court awarded well in excess of Pounds 1m in damages and costs against Eastern Counties Leather even though it found that the company had not been negligent when it regularly spilled chemical into ground water. Although the pollution was 'unforeseen', the court found Eastern Counties liable in 'nuisance' - an older legal concept in which it is not necessary to show fault. Another recent case involving allegations of land contamination by Coalite, a chemicals company, has also caused some controversy. Coalite was allegedly responsible for polluting land and a river near three farms at Bolsover in Derbyshire, thereby restricting the farmers from selling dioxin-contaminated produce for more than a year. The company eventually agreed to pay 'substantial damages' (thought to be at least Pounds 200,000) to the farmers in an out of court settlement. Coalite is still negotiating with Royal Insurance, its insurers. Reinsurance: Finally, companies are also under some pressure from their own reinsurers to reduce the coverage they give for pollution. It is understood that a decision taken by French insurers, to exclude pollution cover from their liability policies sold from the beginning of 1994, followed decisions by large European reinsurance companies. UK insurers withdrew cover for 'gradual' pollution - typically caused by leakages or seepage of contaminants such as in the Cambridge Water case - in April 1990. Even so, many observers believe they could be vulnerable to claims for 'historic' pollution against policies underwritten before then (in the same way as US insurers have received claims on comprehensive general liability policies before pollution exclusions were introduced in the 1970s). Like their US counterparts, UK insurers underwrote liability policies on a so-called 'occurrence' basis, in which the relevant policy for a claim is the one which covers the year when the 'insurable' event occurred, rather than the year in which the claim was made (the so-called 'claims made' basis). In a number of cases US courts have ruled that site owners and operators who were ordered to clean up can claim on insurance policies stretching back to the original point at which pollution is deemed to have begun. Some observers believe that British insurers could ultimately be exposed to a heavy clean up bill. Mr Randolph Fields, a lawyer who has developed a thriving business in researching insurance coverages in the US, is confident that he can locate the historic coverages in the UK and warns that the UK industry faces liabilities of 'catastrophic proportions'. Mr Tony Baker, head of public affairs at the association, plays down the danger, suggesting that, at most, UK insurers will face a maximum of a tenth of an estimated clean up bill of Pounds 30bn. He points out that much of the UK's worst pollution has been caused by nationalised industries - such as coal and gas - which have no insurance cover. He suggests that, even then, in the worse possible circumstances the resulting bill of Pounds 3bn would be paid over decades, diluting its impact. Even so, Mr Baker concedes that insurers are considering the introduction of further restrictions to public liability policies and could withdraw coverage even for 'sudden and accidental' pollution, which occurs, for example, when chemicals are spilled. 'People could withdraw cover from public liability policies, making protection available on a 'stand alone' basis which would have to be separately underwritten,' he says. Already buyers have suffered sharp increases in prices over the last 18 months. Companies whose operations are deemed to be high risk' - such as waste management companies - can now pay as much as 1 per cent of the annual turnover for insurance. One composite insurer has already made even limited pollution cover dependent on proof that the buyer of the policy has taken measures to control environmental risks, and brokers fear that the market could introduce new risk management criteria - for example, adhesion to new British environmental standards. Already a number of companies including Swiss Re, AIG Europe, ECS Underwriting and Zurich offer a policy covering against the risk of gradual pollution, which is linked to measures such as site surveys, environmental audits and the remediation of pre-existing contamination. The policies are expensive and so far take-up has been limited. Brokers believe that the scope of these new types of policy could become broader, wider, and their take-up common, as the availability of traditional insurance cover is reduced.</p>

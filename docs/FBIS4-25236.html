			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Acting Governor Wen Shizhen: "Develop High and </F> New Technological Industries, Use High and New Technologies To  Transform Traditional Industries, and Carry Out Intensive  Processing Industry To Revitalize the Old Industrial Base"]    [Text] Accelerating the development of high and new  technological industries, using high and new technologies to  transform traditional industries, and carrying out intensive  processing of natural resources and raw materials constitute a  strategic issue affecting Liaoning's overall situation. It is  not only a task of the 1990's, but also a transcentury project.    1. Developing high and new technologies, using high and new  technologies to transform traditional industries, and carrying  out raw materials intensive processing industry is a very  essential and urgent task.    Liaoning has chiefly developed basic and raw materials  industries and its traditional industries have accounted for  more than 90 percent of the GNP. This industrial structure has  advantages under the planned economic system and contributed  greatly to the state. However, after the unfoldment of reform  and opening up, all localities across the country have competed  with one another to readjust their industrial structure. In  order to make up for the shortage of raw materials, some  provinces in south China have developed a number of basic  industries. During the late 1980's, the situation that south  China had to rely on north China in basic industries began to  change and Liaoning's raw materials industry has new  competitors. On the other hand, south China has also developed a  number of high and new technology industries. Some high and new  technology industries in Shanghai and Guangdong have reached a  fair scale. However, Liaoning's high and new technology  industries are still in an initiative stage. This has made our  province suffered attacks front and rear during competitions in  the domestic markets.    Judging from the foreign situation, since the 1980's, some  developed countries, while developing high and new technology  industries, have also competed with one another to use high and  new technologies to transform traditional industries and  enhanced the competitive ability on the international markets,  thus imposing a severe challenge on some developing countries  and regions. They have also exerted their utmost to develop  high and new technology industries of their own and used high  and new technologies to transform traditional industries. I  have conducted inspection tours to the ROK twice and found that  it has no natural resources. Before the mid 1960's, nearly all  the industries of Liaoning were better than those of the ROK.  However, through development, the value of imports and exports  of the ROK is now commensurate with our country. The  technological levels of some industries, such as ship building,  machinery, petrochemical, electronics, textile, iron and steel  industries, are far in advance of our country by 10 to 15 years.  The key experience of the ROK is that it has paid attention to  science and technology, developed industries with a high  starting point and high level, followed the path of extensively  pooling the strong points of all, and absorbed the advanced  science and technology of all countries.    In face of the acute competitions on the domestic and  foreign  markets, if we fail to accelerate the pace of using high and new  technologies to transform traditional industries, we will lag  far behind at home and abroad. A strong sense of crisis and  responsibility has urged us to race against time to grasp this  issue. Only by using domestic and foreign advanced high and new  technologies to transform the traditional industries can we make  the level of our technologies and equipments leap over some  development stages and reach the international or domestic  advanced level, upgrade and update the product quality, variety,  and grades by leaps and bounds, and enhance their  competitiveness in the domestic and foreign markets. Only thus,  can we leap over backwardness caused by our lagging behind the  time, catch up with the developing trends at home and abroad,  and rejuvenate the old base.    2. Developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and  new technologies to transform traditional industries, and  conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and raw  materials, represent a fundamental task for making the old  industrial base prosperous.    It is very important for us to straighten out our thinking  in  the issue of how to change the old outlook of the old base into  a new one. The thinking defined for readjusting the industrial  structure of the old base in Liaoning by persistently regarding  markets as a guiding orientation and on the basis of summarizing  the practice, experience, and lesson; analyzing the development  trend of markets at home and abroad; and of studying or  understanding again the province's situation; is to develop  high-and-new tech industries, to use high and new technologies  to transform traditional industries, and to conduct the  intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials.    Developing high-and-new tech industries should be accurately  aimed at markets at home and abroad. Efforts should be made to  develop a large number of high-and-new tech industries that have  large strength in bringing along the national economy, can exert  strong influence, and possess the characteristics of Liaoning.  These high-and-new technologies include robots, computers, bar  codes, thin coating and coating products, super fine fiber and  fabrics, super fine phenolic material, electric and electronic  technologies and products, active talcum powder and by-products,  neodyimium-iron-boron permanent-magnet material, radiation  engineering, biological engineering, and astronautics.    In transforming the traditional industries, we should  closely  follow the principles of developing natural resources and  conducting the intensive processing of raw materials and  accelerate the technical renovations. Major efforts should be  made to successfully encourage the industries of raw materials  to conduct intensive processing; to upgrade the rate of final  products; and to extend the technical linking among the  industries of metallurgy, petroleum, chemicals, and building  materials. It is necessary to conduct the second and third  processing in the raw material production. At the same time, we  should renovate the technologies and equipment to upgrade the  quality of products, to lower the cost, to upgrade the labor  productivity, and to score best economic results.    Equipment industries should enforce the unified project  between machinery and electronic production and apply the micro  electronic technologies to transforming the machinery industry.  Meanwhile, efforts should be made to upgrade the coordinated  service between machinery and electronic industries and to  develop an integrated project system between them in the fields  of research, design, manufacture, installation, readjustment,  and experiment. As being the equipment sector in the national  economy, the machinery and electronic industries should  successfully render a unified service.    Industries in charge of general processing should chiefly  increase the variety of new products suitable to the demands of  markets at home and abroad and uphold high starting point, high  level, large scale, and high effect in the development of new  products.    It is also necessary to conduct the intensive processing of  agricultural resources. We should also develop the resources of  planting, raising, and maritime undertakings to the operation of  intensive processing and bring about a change to the situation  in which a truck of potable water (mineral water in the south)  has been exchanged with seven trucks of grains. Developing  high-and-new tech industries, using high and new technologies to  transform traditional industries, and conducting the intensive  processing of natural resources and raw materials actually  represent the endeavor to bring the strong points into play and  to exploit these strong points to avoid shortcomings under the  conditions of socialist market economy. Exploiting the strong  points means to bring into play the superiority possessed by the  basic industries. In the view of far-reaching development,  these strong points may be eliminated. However, they are still  the superiority of the province in the near future, therefore,  we should bring the superiority into play and use the high and  new technologies to reform it. For example, the iron and steel  industry is still the basic industry of Liaoning and we should  still bring it into play. The province's shortcomings include  electronic industry and biological engineering as well as the  technologies of distribution and automation. We should no  longer avoid these shortcomings, but try to make them up. Only  by making up these shortcomings in the coming few years can we  achieve a better products' mix and economic results.    3. Countermeasures and Measures    We should combine long-term and short-term countermeasures  and measures, make them realistic and feasible, work out overall  plans for them, and carry them out step by step.    A. The issue on sources of technology. We should persist in  learning from others' strong points extensively, both at home  and abroad. We should take advantage of the conditions provided  by opening to the outside world and adopt various measures to  bring in advanced technology from abroad through various  channels, such as direct foreign investment, licensed trade,  compensation trade, cooperation in designing and development,  establishment of scientific research institutes abroad, and  purchases of foreign scientific research institutes. Meanwhile,  Liaoning should fully develop its scientific and technological  advantages to establish its own scientific research network  consisting of scientific research, technological development,  and intermediate experiment engineering centers. It should  accelerate the transformation of the achievements of scientific  research institutes into productive forces.    In developing high and new technology, Liaoning should  develop the main body and the two wings. Enterprises constitute  the main body in the endeavor of high- and new-tech industry  development, transformation of traditional industries with high  and new technology, and intensive processing of resources and  raw materials. This is because enterprises, especially large and  medium-sized ones, have fairly complete development, research,  and designing systems. Enterprises are also the main body to use  productive forces and ultimately to produce new ones. We should  also develop the role of the "two wings," one being scientific  research institutes and colleges and universities and the other  being foreign advanced technology. The main body is the  foundation, and the two wings are the important sources  providing high and new technology to the main body. Integrating  these three parts together, Liaoning will be like a tiger that  has grown wings.    B. The issue on mechanisms. We should apply the market  mechanism to cultivating new growing points of the economy and  never return to the old systems. In developing high- and  new-tech industries, transforming traditional industries with  high and new technology, and expanding intensive processing of  resources and raw materials, the system whereby major investors  hold the responsibility for risks should be applied to the  adjustment of the industrial structure, and a mechanism of  competition should take shape. This should be combined with the  efforts to deepen reform and establish a modern enterprise  system. We should establish a modern enterprise system,  transform enterprises into companies, implement the shareholding  system, transplant enterprises with foreign capital, develop  contracts for scientific and technological tasks, and  commercialize technological achievements so that enterprises  will become a genuine main body of interests, investment, and  market.    C. Open up wide sources of funds. As great amounts of funds  are needed in transforming the old base, it is impossible to  rely entirely on the state. We should pool the idle funds in  society through reform, opening up, and the reform of the  banking system. We should borrow funds from both the domestic  and the world markets, carry out the shareholding system, allow  scientific research units to buy shares with their technology,  allow enterprise legal persons to invest, and list enterprises  on the market. When raising funds from abroad, we may  transplant enterprises with foreign capital; sell property right  to foreign countries in exchange for ownership of some stocks  and sell the stock ownership to raise funds for investment; or  use commercial loans. In short, we should broaden our fields of  thinking and the sources of funds through reform and opening up.  Adopting new ideas, new concepts, and new methods to address  problems, we will find our road becoming broader and broader.    D. The issue on professionals. In developing high-and-new  tech industries, using high and new technologies to transform  traditional industries, and conducting the intensive processing  of natural resources and raw materials, we must first of all  train and bring up scientific and technological professionals,  who should be regarded as the foundation. A fine environment  and good conditions should be created to train outstanding  professionals for Liaoning. This is a major matter that must be  solved by the provincial government. Therefore, we should truly  distribute income for professionals according to their work in  order to manifest the value of science and technology. Wages of  scientists and technicians should be linked with their  performances. We should let scientists and technicians,  high-tech professionals in particular, become rich first.  Second, we should relax restrictions imposed on professionals  and allow scientists and technicians to flow from one place to  another. Third, we should not determine the positions and  social status of scientists and technicians according to their  seniority. A good condition should be created for young  scientists and technicians. Only with the rapid growth of young  scientists and technicians, can Liaoning invigorate its  scientific, technological, and economic development. Fourth, we  should draw professionals from abroad and make foreign  professionals serve China.    E. We should do a solid job and pay attention to  implementation. Developing high-and-new tech industries, using  high and new technologies to transform traditional industries,  and conducting the intensive processing of natural resources and  raw materials represent a huge systems engineering as well as  the key content of the "second pioneering program." Therefore,  they must be incorporated to the development strategy of the  province and various cities. This project should be considered  the key point of Liaoning's plan for 2010. The items without  using high and new technologies and the items that do not  conduct intensive processing should never be initiated. At  present, our problem lies in the failure in offering even more  and better high-and-new tech items for the reason of lacking a  wide field of vision on science and technology. Without the  mastery of current economic and technological information and  development trends by economic policymakers and senior managers,  we cannot define the orientation of scientific and technological  development. Only when scientists and technicians master high  and new technologies, can we use high and new scientific and  technological achievements to transform old technologies, old  equipment, and old products. The problems in this aspect must  be resolved. The policy of reducing the staff of the organs  directly under the provincial authorities by 300 persons should  be remained unchanged for the time being. After the transfer of  the personnel eliminated by the organizational reform, we should  employ a number of young and middle-aged senior scientists and  technicians and managers from society to intensify the strength  of some important departments. In developing high-and-new tech  industries and using new and high technologies to transform  traditional industries, we must conscientiously organize  implementation, and specific arrangements should be made for  each trade and each year.    In developing high-and-new tech industries, using high and  new technologies to transform traditional industries, conducting  the intensive processing of natural resources and raw materials,  and conducting structural readjustment, it is hard for Liaoning  to achieve remarkable results within 10 years. We should have  our eyes on the present, have our feet firmly planted at the  next century, do a solid job step by step from now on, and work  hard for 10 years. If we do so, it is completely possible for us  to replace the old outlook of Liaoning with a new outlook and to  fulfill the magnificent goal of the "second pioneering program."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear listeners: The National Coalition Government  of the Union of Burma [NCGUB] issued a statement today saying it  has received news that U Myint Maung, a NCGUB minister who has  been reported missing since 25 March, is in the hands of the  SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council].    The statement says U Myint Maung, NCGUB minister of  agriculture and forests, disappeared on 25 March while en route  from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. When the NCGUB began investigating  the disappearance, it received news he had fallen into SLORC  hands. U Myint Maung was elected as a representative from Einme  Township constituency 2, Irrawaddy Division in the 1990  elections.    Similarly, two NCGUB ministers -- Minister U Win Ko and  Minister U Hla Pe -- were assassinated while traveling in 1993.  The NCGUB is highly suspicious of the SLORC's role in the two  murders and the recent disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung.</p>

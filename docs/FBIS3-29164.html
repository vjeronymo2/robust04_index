During the meeting, the prime minister said he  intends to set up a consultative body of the ruling coalition  parties as soon as possible to discuss the issue of securing  financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall arising  from tax cuts. He also indicated that he hopes the consultative  body will draw a conclusion on the issue before an extraordinary  Diet session is convened in autumn.    As for the future realignment of political parties, the  prime  minister said: I think that the realignment of political parties  will progress in parallel with progress in the demarcation of  the single-seat constituency. I think that there will be some  moves toward the realignment of political parties before the  current ordinary Diet session ends. My frank feeling is that if  the ruling coalition parties fail to hold themselves together,  they would be unable to fight in elections.    With regard to the timing for the dissolution of the House  of  Representative and general elections, the prime minister said: I  am not thinking of holding the general elections. Asked by one  of the reporters about the relationship between the enactment of  a bill on the demarcation of single-seat constituency and the  dissolution of the House of Representatives, the prime minister  said: There will be three months of notice. I will have to think  of dissolving the lower house based on that. It will be a  question of political timing for the dissolution of the House of  Representative after the passage of three months.    On the cabinet reshuffle, the prime minister said he is not  considering it.</p>

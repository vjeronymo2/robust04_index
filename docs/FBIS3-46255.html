			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 26 (AFP)--Hong Kong pressed China  yet again Wednesday to stop arguing in public and return to the  bargaining table to resolve the vexed issue of financing  arrangements for the colony's mammoth new airport.    Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said he was  "disappointed" by Beijing's threat the day before not to honor  debts or contracts linked with Chek Lap Kok airport which  straddle 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to China. "We are quite  sure that the best way to make progress on the airport financing  issue is to talk about it in the airport committee," Macleod  told reporters. "That's the best way of finding a solution."    Government sources, requesting anonymity, spoke more  forcefully. "The statement doesn't change anything at all," one  of them said. "We're single-minded about talking with them  before the next crisis occurs... The longer the delay, the  greater the cost for all concerned -- especially for Hong Kong."    China has failed to respond to a formal British request on  January 17 to reconvene the airport committee of the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, charged with overseeing the  20.3 billion U.S. dollar project. Instead it put out a  statement Tuesday damning Governor Chris Patten's administration  for securing 1.67 billion Hong Kong dollars (216 million U.S.)  in stop-gap financing from legislators to keep the vast project  going.    China, it warned, "will not be liable for any expenditure  and  debt incurred by building the new airport," nor would it honor  airport-related contracts or laws straddling 1997 -- which is  also the year Chek Lap Kok is due to open. Britain agreed in a  September 1991 pact to consult China on airport financing, but  talks soon fell victim to Patten's effort to make Hong Kong's  political insitutions more democratic ahead of the 1997 return  to Beijing.    Macleod said he drew "some encouragement" from the  statement's final paragraph, which stressed that Beijing "has  always supported the construction of a new airport in Hong  Kong." But he and other government officials were bewildered by  its allegation that the project so far would leave the post-1997  Hong Kong Chinese administration with debts in excess of 45  billion dollars (5.82 billion U.S.). In fact, no money has been  borrowed for Chek Lap Kok, one of the world's biggest public  works projects, comprising not only the airport, but also a  high-speed railway and new highways and bridges. "They haven't  borrowed a single cent yet," the government source said.  Besides, the 1991 Sino-British understanding on which the  allegation was based referred to debt raised by the Hong Kong  government -- not by government-owned corporations that will run  the airport and railway.    While the war of words rages on, work continues 24 hours a  day -- and, officials say, well on schedule -- at Chek Lap Kok,  an outlying island one hour by boat from central Hong Kong that  is shrouded by a fog of dust whipped up by giant yellow  bulldozers and dump trucks.    Site reclamation director Frans Uiterwijk told foreign  reporters that nearly 40 percent of the site preparation work  has so far been completed by a multinational consortium of six  companies -- including one owned by China.    "For the bulk (of the site work), I don't see any problem,"  he said, confident that the task will be completed in February  1996 -- clearing the way for the first of two runways to be laid.    A deep hole the size of several football fields marks where  the futuristic terminal building will be, pending foundation  work to begin after contracts are awarded in March.</p>

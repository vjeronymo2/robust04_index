			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: The Pilgrim's Progress - RNCM, Manchester The theme of personal discovery has led composers to some of their most challenging statements. From Die Zauberflote to Parsifal and beyond there are operas which have strained to break the accepted notions of what constitutes a stage work so that they can express all that they want to say about man and his spiritual journey through life. It would seem that Vaughan Williams felt that kind of deep commitment to The Pilgrim's Progress. The score only reached its final form after a lengthy creative period in which it was assembled in various stages, at one point being raided to supply material for the Fifth Symphony. The 1951 Covent Garden premiere was not a success and in its wake the opera was largely written off as not theatrical enough, more 'a sort of oratorio'. Performances of the score since then have been few and far between, staged productions non-existent. In reviving pieces of this kind the national music colleges have hit upon some well-chosen ventures in recent years, but it is unlikely that anybody could have foreseen the truly remarkable success scored by the Royal Northern College of Music with its production of The Pilgrim's Progress last Thursday. As one watched the drama unfold, the main arguments against the opera seemed to fall away. How could it be thought long-winded, when the scenes are so concise? Or lacking in theatrical variety, when Vaughan Williams so clearly contrasts passages of private communing with vivid crowd scenes, like the Valley of Humiliation and Vanity Fair, peopled by creatures of the underworld, human and otherwise (even if the music in both is admittedly rather weak). If there is an un-operatic element, it is probably the central character, for this is the story of Everyman, not a princely Tamino or a naive Parsifal. It takes a while for any personal sense of involvement with the Pilgrim to catch the heart, but it does with his prison soliloquy in the second half, and there the baritone Richard Whitehouse rose splendidly to the occasion, fresh of voice, full of visionary fervour. There are no other individual roles that can make a decisive impact, although John Neale was a resonant Evangelist and Darron Moore firm and true as Watchful. (His Nocturne is a particularly effective passage, made from musical shadows and nagging night-time doubts.) It is the company spirit that makes or breaks a performance and the RNCM had fielded a well-rehearsed cast in a first-rate production by Joseph Ward, designed by Michael Holt, and for the most part notably well played by the student orchestra under Igor Kennaway. In the final scenes one felt powerfully that sense of communal beneficence which is so much the strength and inspiration of Vaughan Williams's music. Now that we are ready to accept other unusual religious or mystic works such as Messiaen's Saint Francois or Birtwistle's Gawain on their own terms, it is perhaps timely to reconsider The Pilgrim's Progress. With this inspired production the reputations of the RNCM and of the opera itself have been equally enhanced.</p>

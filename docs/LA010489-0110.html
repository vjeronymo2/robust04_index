			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO-BASED S&amp;L'S ACQUIRER PLANS EXPANSION  </P> <P> The chairman of Michigan National Corp. said Tuesday that the bank holding  company plans to use newly acquired Beverly Hills Savings &amp; Loan of Mission  Viejo as a vehicle for expanding operations throughout deposit-rich California.  </P> <P> To Robert J. Mylod's way of thinking, the S&amp;L will soon be growing into one  of California's larger savings institutions, and the prestige often associated  with anything that has the Beverly Hills name attached to it will return.  </P> <P> Mylod, the company's chairman, said he was "just delighted" over the purchase  of insolvent, six-branch Beverly Hills Savings from federal regulators Saturday  with $52 million of Michigan National's cash and $983 million in federal  regulatory assistance.  </P> <P> The purchase was among a flurry of S&amp;L acquisitions approved last week as  regulators rushed to clinch deals so that buyers could take advantage of tax  credits available only to the end of the year.  </P> <P> "There's no question we plan to build up the (S&amp;L's) business," Mylod said  Tuesday in a telephone interview from Michigan National's new headquarters in  the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills.  </P> <P> Federal laws and regulatory rules prohibit bank holding companies from  acquiring healthy S&amp;Ls but allow them to buy failing ones. Once a banking  firm buys a sick S&amp;L, it can use the S&amp;L to buy healthy savings  institutions.  </P> <P> And Michigan National, which owns the highly profitable Michigan National Bank  of Detroit, will use Beverly Hills Savings to "look for further acquisitions,"  Mylod said.  </P> <P> The strategy has already worked for the nation's largest banking firm,  Citicorp. In 1982, the New York firm bought the failed Fidelity Savings &amp;  Loan in San Francisco and has since nearly tripled its size to $7.3 billion in  assets.  </P> <P> Mylod said it was too early to say if the company will turn Beverly Hills  Savings into a banking operation once nationwide interstate banking is allowed  in California in 1991.  </P> <P> "But we like the name Beverly Hills," he said. "We think over a time -- a very  short time -- we can re-establish the image of that name."  </P> <P> Michigan National also gets to use $793.7 million in tax credits amassed at  Beverly Hills Savings to reduce the amount of taxes it has to pay.  </P> <P> Those tax credits should come in handy for Michigan National, which had $9.1  million in assets and earnings of $69.7 million in the first 9 months of 1988.  </P> <P> "If I were a bank holding company, I'd look for entree into California,  particularly when I could buy with somebody else's money," said Gerry Findley,  a financial industry consultant in Brea.  </P> <P> Findley believes taxpayers are paying now and will pay more later for the deals  arranged by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its deposit insurance arm, the  Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taxpayer Bailout  </P> <P> By giving buyers tax credits, he said, the U.S. Treasury must obtain from other  taxpayers the revenue that those healthy firms would have paid. And the FSLIC,  which has committed about $39 billion to salvage failed S&amp;Ls, eventually  will need a taxpayer bailout.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, it's a good deal for Michigan National -- practically  all positive," Findley said. "The negatives fall on the people, the taxpayers."  </P> <P> But the tax relief wasn't the only reason the company wanted to buy an S&amp;L  that even managers of Beverly Hills Savings thought was headed for the scrap  heap.  </P> <P> "We liked Beverly Hills because, from our analysis, it sits in a tremendous  market, albeit a competitive market," Mylod said. "I think it's the strongest  market in the nation."  </P> <P> He also believes that the S&amp;L's name, taken from the affluent city where it  was based before its headquarters were moved to Orange County, conjures up  images of affluence, respect and solidity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loyal Depositors  </P> <P> Beverly Hills Savings has a core of depositors who have been loyal ever since  regulators seized the institution in April, 1985, Mylod said.  </P> <P> Michigan National plans to use the S&amp;L to provide many of the same services  in California that the company offers elsewhere in the country through an  $8-billion mortgage operation, an investment advisory firm and a credit card  operation with $1.2 billion in receivables.  </P> <P> "We plan to build up the S&amp;L, but we're not going to do it on Day One  because we have to get in there and become familiar with the operation and the  people," Mylod said.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills Savings has been run by a management team hired by regulators  from First Nationwide Savings in San Francisco. The team will remain for a  short time to help with the transition, Mylod said, before they return to First  Nationwide.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment of interview with Father Georgi </F> Gelemenov, leader of the extreme right-wing "Rebirth"  Organization, by Svetlana Krusteva; place and date not given:  "I Advocate a New National Rebirth Process Which Should Restore  the Turks' Bulgarian Names"]    [Text] We continue the interview with Father Georgi  Gelemenov, leader of the extreme right "Rebirth" [Vuzrazhdane]  Organization and of the Bulgarian Christian Democratic Party  (center) who declared himself as the restorer of Nazism in  Bulgaria. "Gypsies and Turks are not my brothers, they are  killing, raping, robbing, and trying to split our fatherland,"  Gelemenov said in the previous installment of his TRUD  interview. Our editorial board is in possession of a recorded  transcript and would like to hear the opinion of the  Prosecutor's Office on the matter.    [Krusteva] Mr. Gelemenov, do you admit that some ethnic  Bulgarians are also guilty of rape, robberies, and murders?    [Gelemenov] Bulgarians who are stealing, robbing, and raping  automatically belong to the category of criminals who are  violating the law, public order, and discipline; hence I do not  distinguish between them and other criminals.    [Krusteva] Why did you choose Plovdiv for your headquarters?    [Gelemenov] Because the ethnic spectrum of that city is the  most colorful. Plovdiv has the largest number of Gypsies,  Turks, but also Armenians and Jews, whom I have nothing against,  of course. However, the triple agglomeration, namely of  Bulgarians, Turks, and Gypsies, prompted me to select that city.  The United Bulgarian Soldiery is expected to establish armed  militant units with the cooperation of the police and the Armed  Forces. Naturally my "Rebirth" Organization is aimed at  establishing its own, unarmed units. I do not approve of the  use of weapons, because I do not wish to get involved with the  law. I rely on the mass character of the units which I am  planning to establish. I would like my people to assist the  police in coping with the Gypsies, so that the crime rate may be  reduced to 2 or 3 percent. I expect them to cooperate in  protecting law, order, and discipline.    [Krusteva] It is strange that you do not comply with the  Bulgarian Constitution, but are ready to cooperate with the  police forces.    [Gelemenov] It is because the police force is a law  enforcement institution in charge of introducing public order.  The constitution is a document of a certain value, but is not as  effective as the penal code. The constitution is not without  flaws. It contains some pompous postulates, which, we Nazis of  Bulgaria, do not wish to comply with, because it bans all  organizations based on ethnic principles, and so forth. The  constitution does not serve our purposes, on the contrary it  restricts our freedom of action.    [Krusteva] Are you not afraid of conflicts involving  bloodshed? How would the ethnic minorities react to a new  national rebirth process?    [Gelemenov] Precisely as they reacted in the 1984-85 period.  They rose against the forces of law and order in Bulgaria, and  were immediately crushed, of course. I do not understand why  monuments should be erected in their memory today, why prayers  and speeches in the Turkish language should be recited for them  -- which is in contradiction with the constitution, as a matter  of fact. As long as they are violating the constitution, we  should be also entitled to do so. Violence is called for in the  purpose of introducing law and order in the country. What they  are trying to present to us as democracy is nothing but anarchy  and disorder. As long as the state is unwilling to apply even  methods of force against the violators of public order, I am  willing to organize a bunch of decent boys who shall introduce  law and order all over the country, and to become their leader.    [Krusteva] Do you think that anyone would support you?    [Gelemenov] What do you mean support me?! Young people are  already following me everywhere, people are calling me from all  parts of the country announcing their eagerness to work with me.  I am expecting the 30 boys, who are currently trying to  introduce law and order in the Burgas area, to call on me. I  could be useful to them with funds for gasoline.    [Krusteva] Do you have any political ambitions?    [Gelemenov] The whole thing is actually the rudiments of a  party which we intend to register after the New Year and which  will be called the Nationalist Socialist Vuzrazhdane Party. I  am convinced that National Socialism is the only idea capable of  guaranteeing Bulgaria's progress.    [Krusteva] It is a theory which was rejected and condemned  by the whole world, Mr. Gelemenov.    [Gelemenov] This does not frighten me. If we should accept  that history is developing in the form of a spiral, I am  convinced that the idea of national socialism is being revived.  I am not the first one to adopt it for the sake of helping my  country. The idea is not dead, it is acquiring new roots. This  is precisely the right moment for its development in Bulgaria.    [Krusteva] I understood that you felt insulted by being  called the "Bulgarian Zhirinovskiy." Why?    [Gelemenov] Prior to Zhirinovskiy's arrival in our country,  I was willing to meet him, in a way. However, as soon as he  stepped onto Bulgarian soil, he started talking such nonsense,  that I immediately unmasked him as the great Russian clown who  came here to spread unrest and provoke internal conflicts.  Speaking about the annexation of Mizia, Thracia, and Macedonia  to Bulgaria, he forgot to mention Dobrudzha. The idea of  annexation is good, but it should be promoted through diplomatic  channels. I am convinced that Zhirinovskiy is a paid "agent  provocateur" who was sent on a performing tour. He is a CIA  agent [as published] and his purpose is to provoke bloodshed and  armed clashes in the Balkan peninsula. I insist that Mr.  Tatarchev, the chief prosecutor, should immediately expel  Zhirinovskiy from Bulgaria, that he should be fined at the  border, and should no longer be permitted to step on our  territory.    [Krusteva] Like yourself, Zhirinovskiy does not like the  president. Why did you declare Dr. Zhelev as an accomplice of  crimes committed in our country?    [Gelemenov] With the moratorium on capital punishment which  he issued, he acted as an accomplice of bloody murders, chiefly  committed against Bulgarians, because the criminals are no  longer afraid. I approve Zhirinovskiy's idea that the president  should be replaced, but this is none of his business. It is an  internal Bulgarian affair.    [Krusteva] However, you are expecting some financial support  from Russia for your "United Bulgarian Soldiery." Whom exactly,  are you relying upon?    [Gelemenov] I am expecting financial aid from the  organization called "Russian National Unity" and from the  Slavonic Assembly. Being the cofounder of a bank in Russia with  capital investments amounting to 10 million rubles, this is  where I am expecting the resources to come from, but it will not  be today or tomorrow. It is an organization headed by Aleksandr  Barkashov, whose whereabouts are unknown today, and who was  actually backed by Rutskoy. Considering that Rutskoy was  prevented from running for the elections, the roving mountebank  Zhirinovskiy exploited his votes. According to my own  information, seven of my boys, I mean our boys, were killed in  the attack against Ostankino. This was actually Yeltsin's fault.    [Krusteva] Has anybody told you that you are mad?    [Gelemenov] Everyone is more or less mad, because no  criteria exist for a normal state of mind. I do not consider  myself mad, because I would not have obtained a certificate of  mental sanity when I got married. I now intend to purchase a  license to carry firearms, hence I can hardly be considered mad.  I think that I am a normal Bulgarian citizen who is planning to  lead the country into the open space. Bulgaria's situation  could be improved on the basis of a simple political scheme --  without a parliament and without a government. A council of  ministers, subordinate to a strong personality, would be  competent enough to rule the country.    [Krusteva] You are talking about a strong hand, one-man  power, and so forth, is that so?    [Gelemenov] A very strong hand, an iron-strong hand, is  required, as a matter of fact. The Bulgarian people, just like  the Russian people, are used to it.    [Krusteva] What do you think about Adolf Hitler?    [Gelemenov] He was the man who helped the Germans to regain  their self-confidence, who showed the common German citizen that  he is the master of this earth. He fully eradicated crime, he  did away with unemployment. His mistake was to wage a war  against Poland and Russia. He was a brilliant politician, but  an evil man. Nevertheless, his economic methods and those of his  supporters could be successfully applied in contemporary  Bulgaria. We could also work hard if someone would guide us and  show us how to do it.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Renown remains in red for six months RENOWN, Japan's largest clothing maker which owns Aquascutum, the UK retailer, posted continuing losses for the six months to the end of January due mainly to sluggish sales of women's wear. Renown changed its accounting year-end to January 31 from December 31. It reported non-consolidated pre-tax losses of Y6.41bn (Dollars 55.7m) for the six months. This compares with losses of Y14.88bn for the seven months to the end of July 1992. Sales came to Y113.5bn, compared with Y109.2bn for the earlier seven months, having been hit by falling consumer demand in Japan. Net losses emerged at Y5.99bn against Y14.88bn and losses per share at Y21.61 against Y68.92. The directors recommended a dividend of Y3.75 a share for the six months, against the previous seven months' Y4.4. For the 12 months to January 1994, the company hopes to return into the black, expecting pre-tax profits of Y1bn on sales of Y102bn. The company based its improved forecast on an increase in the number of shops, expected strong demand for the Aquascutum and J. Crew brand clothes and the introduction of the group's own brand, Next Eye. Renown introduced Aquascutum brand clothes in Japan last autumn, and J. Crew in spring 1992.</p>

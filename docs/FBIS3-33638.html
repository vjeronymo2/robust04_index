			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israeli and Palestinian spokesmen in Switzerland  are now saying that progress has been made in the discussions  towards reaching a compromise between the parties. PLO official  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh told our correspondent in Davos, Gid'on Kouts,  that the representatives of both parties in the formulations  committee had accepted the compromise after making difficult  concessions. According to the Palestinian sources, the  formulated proposals were sent to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  who will decide whether or not to accept them. Our  correspondent notes that Foreign Minister Peres telephoned Mr.  Rabin several times today from Switzerland. Apparently, an  agreement has been reached on the issue of the border crossings  and on the size of the Jericho area; however, the parties still  disagree over the matter of the security zones and roads in the  Gaza Strip. Israeli sources confirmed that significant progress  had indeed been made in the talks. The sources nevertheless  stressed that there had already been instances in the past when  everything fell apart at the last moment. Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa, who is mediating between the Palestinians  and the Israelis, expressed great optimism. Minister Musa met  with Yasir 'Arafat several times over the past 24 hours.  Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will meet later today at a  luncheon on behalf of the international economic forum meeting  at Davos.</p>

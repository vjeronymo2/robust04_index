			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON  </P> <P> Beefed-up security and more police officers may be responsible for the  relatively tame crowd at Sunday's Chargers-Raiders National Football League  game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, officials said.  </P> <P> Of the 59,100 fans who attended Sunday night's game, only five people were  jailed on drunk and disorderly charges, said Lt. Bill Hoover of the San Diego  Police Department. Officers also issued 44 citations for other infractions, he  said.  </P> <P> Another 18 people were ejected from the game, 16 were taken to a detoxification  center and 17 were questioned by police, Hoover said.  </P> <P> Willie O'Ree, director of Strategic Security, the private firm hired by the  Chargers to handle security for Charger home games, said: "It went a lot  smoother than expected. We were afraid fights would break out after the Raiders  took the lead, but then the Chargers took the lead, and everything mellowed  out."  </P> <P> O'Ree said he had about 100 security officers working the game. He said a crew  of 50 is normal for a Chargers game.  </P> <P> When the Chargers played the Philadelphia Eagles Nov. 5 at the stadium, police  and stadium security broke up more than 50 fights, made nine arrests and  ejected 15 disorderly fans from the game.  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Top pay deals exceed inflation BRITAIN'S top businessmen are still awarding themselves pay rises well in excess of inflation and the growth in company profits. This is in spite of calls for pay restraint in the light of the recession and the need to control costs following the UK's full membership of the European Monetary System. A survey of top pay deals by Hay Management Consultants for the Confederation of British Industry showed an average rise in base salaries of 14 per cent from August 1990 to January this year, compared with the same period a year earlier. Bonus payments showed an average rise of 10.6 per cent. The continued rise in top executive pay compares unfavourably with inflation and the growth in company profits. Over the same six month period, the retail prices index rose by an average rate of 10 per cent. Company profits, by contrast, fell by more than 6 per cent, according to government figures. The growth in executive pay, following the economic boom of the late 1980s, has become a boardroom issue. ICI directors' pay was cut last year and this week Lloyds Bank froze the pay of executive directors and general managers. Publication of the survey has threatened the relationship be-tween Hay and the CBI, which yesterday 'disassociated' itself from the survey, saying it had not seen the results or the press announcement.

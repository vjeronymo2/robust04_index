			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No plan for lottery tax Sir, I am writing to put the record straight. Your story, 'Labour looks at 'windfall' tax on lottery group' (December 22), alleging that Labour wants to tax Camelot's proceeds from the lottery, is incorrect. At present, Camelot is spending large sums of money establishing the complex infrastructure for the lottery, advertising it, and preparing further games to come into play next year. The income stream from ticket purchase has its ups and downs, and it will be impossible to determine the balance of income, cost and profit with certainty for months to come. Any discussion of Camelot's share of the proceeds is therefore wildly premature. Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

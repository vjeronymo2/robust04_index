			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Arts: A likeable mishmash - Max Loppert on ENO's latest production of Don Carlos THE BEST thing about the English National Opera Don Carlos is its chosen version. That may seem a flat compliment to pay an important new production; but in the case of this opera - one of the supreme masterpieces of the medium, but also one of the most textually complicated - the matter is in fact of the highest importance. The care with which ENO has made its editorial decisions indicates its approach to mounting the opera as a whole. Don Carlos was written for Paris in 1867, then re - worked in stages over the next two decades. The basic choices for modern performance are the five-act 1867 original and the four-act 1883 four-act revision - but, since Andrew Porter's early-1970s discovery in the Paris Opera archives of much magnificent material cut before the 1867 first night, those choices have become considerably less clearcut. ENO has gone for an expanded 1867 text (but with several passages in their 1883 revised form), including therein several key Porter discoveries. Notable among them are the full Fontainebleau choral opening, the exchange of masks between Elisabeth and Eboli, and, best of all, the Philip - Carlos prison duet (on a theme that Verdi re - used in his Requiem) followed by the original Paris form of the insurrection scene. I admire the spirit of seriousness in which conductor, Mark Elder, and producer, David Pountney, have embarked on their presentation. No part of the opera has, one feels, escaped hard scrutiny, no editorial decision agreed without reasoned insight into character, situation and the opera's larger themes. It makes for a long evening ' four-and-a-half hours with two intervals ' but a gripping one. The same spirit can be felt in the production choices. Pountney and the designer, David Fielding, have devised a modern theatrical environment in which Verdi's Grand Opera forms can seek out new resonances and 'relevances'. A clear distinction is drawn between decor (abstract neo-surrealist) and costume (handsome period) styles. The stage-floor is set aslant with coffins piling up beneath; bare walls catch fierce beams of 'psychological' lighting; props and hangings are shaped and placed in the eye-teasing, sometimes strikingly beautiful ways familiar from more than one Fielding-designed opera staging. Similarly, a clear contrast has been calculated between visual and acting styles. Behaviour, though not exactly observant of Spanish court etiquette (in Act 4 the queen appears before the king dressed in only a white nightdress), is not re-invented in parallel with the design. Indeed, touches of surprisingly old-fashioned melodrama can be felt in the treatment of Carlos (lots of head-holding and dropping to the floor) and Eboli (peals of menacing laughter in the Act 3 trio). Old-fashioned opera-acting of the better kind, sensitively felt, vigorously paced, marks the Fontainebleau opening, Philip's study, Carlos's prison cell and the whole of the finale. It is, in sum, an arresting, intelligent, committed production ' and, for my taste, a fearful mishmash. It will surely be pounced on by foes of the ENO's 'interventionist' stagings of the past decade as the latest vehicle for a heavy load of Coliseum cliches; the auto-da-feis certainly a Pountney Special - an over-the-top riot of (historically accurate) carnival colours and torture-and-burning details more appropriate to Bernstein's Candide ('What a day, what a day, For an auto-da-fe]') than Verdi's Don Carlos. Thursday's performance found none of the participants at his or her best. Mr Elder, a Don Carlos conductor of proven excellence, will no doubt regain equilibrium and free himself from the tics of hustling the voices (choral as well as solo) that so marred the first half of the evening. There were many admirable features - expressive orchestral colours, rhythmic and dramatically patterned - along the way to the sublime finale, but the reading badly wanted the 'long line' of musical direction of which this conductor has shown himself a master. The cast is composed of prized ENO regulars - Edmund Barham (Carlos), Gwynne Howell (Philip), Jonathan Summers (Posa), Linda Finnie (Eboli), Richard Van Allan (Inquisitor) - and, as Elisabeth, Rosalind Plowright in her first ENO appearance for eight years. Mr Summers, a bit rough - voiced at first, grew to noble stature; he alone took continual care over line dynamics, a 'French' clarity of utterance consistent both with the work's origins and with the tone of Porter's superb translation. Mr Howell, a dourly imposing king, and Miss Finnie, a princess disappointingly coarsened since her 1985 ENO Eboli, too often substituted force for focus. Mr Barham rings out some bravely heroic phrases - his top has developed a fine freedom - but aristocratic style is not in his line. Miss Plowright, tall, handsome, eloquent with eyes and long hands, offers a contrastingly regal heroine. At first there was pleasure in hearing her back in healthy vocal form, with velvety colour throughout the range; but high - register strain crept in during through the long evening. Even so, on a stage too often cluttered by sincere but unrealised production ambitions, her Elisabeth and Mr Summers's Posa proved the figures who most regularly engaged audience emotions.

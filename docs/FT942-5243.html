			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: Tips for a moving experience If you lose your job tomorrow, at least there is a network to help you pick up the pieces. Break off your career to follow your husband or wife to an overseas posting, though, and things are very different. Not only do you lose your job, income, colleagues, perks and pension; you lose an important framework to your life and part of your identity. Living in Moscow for four years, from 1987, taught me a lot about myself and my inner resources. At the time I saw my attempts to find work in terms of filling the gaps in my cv. Now, I realise that I was training myself for life back in the UK to which my husband and I both returned in the middle of a recession without a job. Moscow was a hostile city at the time: no map, no telephone directories, no public libraries, no information on offer and 'no entry' signs everywhere. A previous posting in Madrid had already taught me some important guidelines: set yourself goals before you go. Network all the time, even back home on leave. Tell everyone what you are doing and what your plans are. I never cease to be amazed at people's generosity with contacts. Keep working on your image. Always dress in a business-like fashion and you will be taken seriously. Have visiting cards printed on day one and call yourself what you are planning to be. It helps to put you in the right frame of mind. Channel your anger, frustration and feelings of powerlessness into positive actions. Start on a project of your own as soon as you can - anything, as long as it really interests you. I researched Soviet publishing houses and because I marketed myself hard on leave in the UK, Publishing News soon asked me to be its Moscow correspondent. I built up work as a publishing agent, freelanced as a journalist and enjoyed doing photography to back up my articles.</p>

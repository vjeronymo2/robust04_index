In the meantime, Shim'on Peres, his foreign  minister, has threatned that unless the Palestinians accede to  Israel's terms regarding the crossings and control of strategic  points Israel will give priority to the Syrian track.    Thus, instead of responding to the clarion call for peace  issued by the Geneva summit between al-Asad and Clinton, Israel  once again embarks on prevarication, procrastination, and  blackmail, and continues to deal with the Arabs from the  standpoint of a brute force of occupation that turns up its nose  to justice and international law and UN resolutions, conducting  itself as if the Arabs are dying to pick up whatever crumbs of  their occupied territory it will be prepared to cede. Such an  attitude once more underscores Israel's determination to swallow  up Arab territory and conclude separate deals that do not  approximate the kind of true and dignified peace that the world  wants and Bill Clinton endorsed at the historic Geneva summit.    The referendum in the Golan proposed by Rabin has amazed the  world and the media, which interpreted it as an open maneuver to  dodge the goals of a fair and comprehensive peace endorsed by  the Geneva summit and full implementation of UN Security  resolutions and the land-for-peace formula without prevarication  or trickery. The Golan is occupied Syrian territory and the  proposed referendum is an open transgression of international  law and the Geneva Conventions and UN resolutions. An occupying  power has no business holding a referendum on the fate of  territory it cannot rightly claim. There are 100,000 displaced  Syrian nationals waiting for peace to come so they can return to  their homes. Rabin's proposal has surprised a world convinced  that short of the entire Golan being handed back to Syria,  Middle East peace remains an impossibility. The entire world  community has acknowledged that without Syria, which holds the  key to peace, peace in the region stands no chance. It is now  obvious that the idea of Rabin's maneuver is to disrupt the  peace process. By instructing his chief delegate to the  Washington talks to raise Israel's security concerns, Rabin  sends the ominous message that his government is working to  derail the upcoming talks and take things back to the point  where they stood before the Geneva summit. Israel is known to  resort to security pretexts every time the prospect that the  peace process may move forward appears on the horizon. This,  when it goes without saying that no security guarantees should  have precedence over peace itself. Syria has stated, through  President al-Asad, that it is willing to conclude peace and set  up normal relations in the region. Indeed, Syria, also through  President al-Asad, has made a strong appeal for peace and urged  the Israeli leaders to display courage and cast off the practice  of prevarication and procrastination. All of which raises  legitimate questions about Israel's peace credentials and  strengthens a conviction that Israel's claims are nothing more  than a temporary tactic to absorb the ire of an international  community annoyed by a ceaseless Jewish settlement activity in  the occupied land. The Oslo agreement example only goes to  prove our point. Israel is still blackmailing the Palestinians  and out to play the Arab parties off one against another.    Syria wants the kind of just, comprehensive, and dignifying  peace on all the fronts that removes occupation and restores  Arab rights. For Syria, there is nothing to choose between the  Golan Heights and the West Bank, or any other occupied Arab  territory, for that matter. Syria is not about to play Israel's  games, nor will it give in to its blackmail. Against the  background of the Geneva summit, Syria believes that the need  has never been more pressing for the United Sates and the world  community to get Israel to climb on the bandwagon of a fair and  comprehensive peace.</p>

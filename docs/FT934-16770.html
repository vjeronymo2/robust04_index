			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / MoD rejects call for more orders to save BAe jobs THE MINISTRY of Defence has told Ayrshire MPs that it will not order aircraft specially to avert redundancies at British Aerospace's Jetstream subsidiary at Prestwick. The plant, which employs 2,500 people making Jetstream turbo-prop regional airliners, is expected to announce a package of redundancies in the next few weeks because of a shortage of orders. It has already told its workforce that it will have to realign production programmes with market demand. Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, together with four other Ayrshire Labour MPs, had urged the MoD to bring forward replacement of 26 Jetstream aircraft used by the RAF and the navy, and also to replace the RAF's Andover aircraft with Jetstreams. But Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, has told Mr Foulkes that the Jetstream fleet will not be replaced in the short or medium-term. The Andovers are being replaced with existing aircraft and commercial charters. Mr Allan MacDonald, Jetstream's managing director, told the workforce in August that all manufacturers of aircraft in Jetstream's regional category were facing severe shortages of orders and were making heavy discounts on prices. Yesterday Mr MacDonald told employees that the main board of British Aerospace and the Prestwick management would be meeting on October 13 and an announcement would be made soon after. He added that a final decision on the cost-cutting package had been delayed because of the need to investigate more options. In August he had promised a decision by the end of the month. The company makes the 19-seat Jetstream 31 and the 29-seat Jetstream 41. It is also building the first Jetstream ATP (advance turbo-prop) aircraft after production of this model was transferred from Woodford near Manchester.</p>

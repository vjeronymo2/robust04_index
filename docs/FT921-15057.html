			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Bush trip to Japan under renewed attack PRESIDENT Bush's trip to Japan came under renewed attack yesterday, with Democrats dismissing claims that the bilateral trade talks would create jobs to revive the sluggish US economy. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate finance committee, said he would summon business leaders and administration officials who took part in the trip to appear at hearings later this month. This could prove embarrassing for Mr Bush, since the chief executives of Ford, General Motors and Chrysler all expressed dissatisfaction with the results of the trip - undermining White House efforts to brand it a success. Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, put a brave face on the talks yesterday, but conceded that the emphasis on the motor industry had distracted public attention from broader goals such as US-Japan co-operation in the post-Cold War era. On balance, he said, it had been a good idea to invite US business leaders because of the need to establish a dialogue. Mr Scowcroft made light of Mr Bush's collapse at the state banquet in Tokyo which overshadowed the 10-day Far East tour. 'The president was trying to be too nice. He did not feel well. But he did not want to spoil the prime minister's party.' On Wednesday, Mr Bush will visit New Hampshire, the state which holds the first primary election of the 1992 election campaign. Political observers are watching closely to see whether the president defies public scepticism and continues to insist the Japan trip was a success.</p>

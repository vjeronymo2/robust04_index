			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has completed its plans to deregulate the liquefied  petroleum gas (LPG) industry and related LPG-handling  procedures. The "Committee To Study LPG Handling Procedures," a  private advisory organ of the Environmental Protection and  Industrial Location Bureau, will be established soon and will be  charged with the mission of formulating detailed deregulating  plans by this fall. If all goes well, the "Law Regulating the  Maintenance and Marketing of LPG" will be revised in fiscal year  1995.    The study committee will revise standards for establishing  LPG replenishment stations that will become wholesalers of LPG  and retail outlets and will provide for tanks which are larger  than those allowed in the past. It will also study relaxation of  the approval standards for domestic gas appliances.    In its International Economic Reform Outline completed at  the  end of March, the government announced that it would partially  relax the maintenance regulations concerning dispensing  equipment used by LPG sales firms. The government has decided to  expand the scope of deregulation in that the number of  LPG-related accidents has trended downward to 115 cases per year  in the past three years.    As many as 35,000 retail outlets handle sales to households  and they consist primarily of small and midsized firms,  reflecting slow progress in the consolidation of sales and  distribution outlets. Thus, it appears the study will be  designed to relax pertinent regulations, promote lower prices,  and encourage the reorganization of the LPG industry.    Domestic LPG demand for fiscal year 1995 will be about 19.42  million tons, about 5 percent of primary energy consumption. The  view is expanding that LPG companies and city gas companies will  be engaging in a fierce price war because the Gas Business Law  revision pending in the Diet will relax regulations which  control entry into large-scale gas businesses.</p>

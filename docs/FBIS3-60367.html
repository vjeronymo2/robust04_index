This initiative meets the call made by EC leaders,  at their EC Summit last December in Edinburgh, to make EC law  consistent with the subsidiarity principle, which sets out the  limits of the Community's area of business and leaves the Member  States responsibility for matters better dealt with on a  national basis. Amongst the list of Directives targeted for  simplification feature the EC's Directives on water. The  Commission plan will be worked up into a report to be presented  to the institution's weekly executive board meeting on November  10. This will then be forwarded for the imprimatur of EC leaders  when they meet in Brussels, on December 10/11, for their  end-of-year Summit meeting.    Proceeding in a highly practical manner, the EC's executive  arm has undertaken to re-examine more than 30 years of EC  legislation, leaving aside Regulations, Directives or Decisions  less than two years old. As a result of this examination, the  Commission has been able to arrange the pieces of legislation  into three different categories:  <H5>  1. Rules and Regulations To Be Recast </H5>   The aim is to upgrade and tidy up EC legislation in certain  policy areas. The category includes notably pharmaceuticals,  competition rules and trade provisions for the sale or purchase  of farm produce.  <H5>  2. Rules and Regulations To Be Simplified </H5>   This, the most important category, is designed to both  streamline EC legislation and repeal excessive technical details  that could be covered by national or regional measures or by  international agreements which the EC has signed. The sectors  pinpointed by the Commission comprise a set of existing rules  and regulations referred to by EC leaders at their Summit in the  Scottish capital, notably legislation on farm produce, the  so-called "new approach" technical harmonisation Directives,  legislation on water, air and animal welfare.    The Commission also intends to simplify and streamline  existing legislation on water, as announced in its 1993  legislative programme. The general idea is to set essential  quality and health parameters at the EC level, leaving the  Member States free to add secondary parameters if they see fit.  The Commission has divided the future Directives on water into  two groups:    Framework Directives (which will replace the current  Directives)    -- a framework Directive on drinking water quality which  would define general parameters (some technical parameters will  be set at Community level, others at national level). "One of  the thorniest problems here will be the question of pesticide  residues," says the Commission's document. This framework  Directive will ultimately replace the existing EC drinking water  Directive and perhaps part of the Directive on surface water  intended for the abstraction of drinking water.    -- a framework Directive on the ecological quality of  surface  water which will set geneal objectives to be fleshed out by  national or regional authorities if need be (if this general  approach is accepted, the existing Directives on fish and  shellfish waters and on surface water for the abstraction of  drinking water can be repealed).    -- a framework Directive on the quality of bathing water  (here parameters need to be simplified and adapted to new  scientific knowledge, and provision also needs to be made for  subsequent revision).    -- a framework Directive on freshwater management and  groundwater protection which would replace the existing  Directive on the protection of groundwater from pollution by  certain dangerous substances. This Directive would define  guiding principles for the qualitative and quantitative  protection of groundwater, integrating it into a geneal  freshwater management policy.    Directives Designed To Control Pollution at Source (Which  the  Commission Insists Will Respect the Principle of Subsidiarity)    -- the Directive on the treatment of urban waste water    -- the Directive on the prevention of water pollution by  nitrates from agricultural sources.  <H5>  3. Rules and Regulations To Be Repealed </H5>   In most cases, the sprucing up of EC legislation because of  recasting or streamlining will result in a number of EC  Regulations and Directives being repealed altogether (nearly 77  solely because of the recasting of the customs code). In other  cases, (these repeals will be the result of a ruling by the EC  Court of Justice (particularly with regard to texts related to  the freedom of establishment and freedom of movement for people  providing services).</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Dirty dogfighting THE ROUT of British Airways in its legal battle with Virgin Atlantic raises some curious questions of business morality. By its own tacit admission, BA employed some very dubious tactics in trying to overwhelm a smaller competitor. Are we to suppose that such behaviour is general in the corporate world? Again, BA technically came to grief not over dirty tricks, but because it had libelled Mr Branson. Suppose the rest of its behaviour were within the law. Does that make it acceptable? The answer to the first question is not wholly simple. The principal charge against BA boils down to the fact that it sought to divert business from a competitor. In itself, that is commonplace. If an engineering company hears a competitor is about to land an order, it will call the customer and try to change his mind. It is less usual in consumer markets: we might be surprised, on buying a tin of beans in a supermarket, to find another bean-maker pressing his own wares upon us at a discount. But that would not be illegal, simply uncommercial in the context of the price of a tin of beans. A first-class air ticket might be another matter. BA's position, in fact, was in many ways exceptional. Despite its apparent market dominance, it found Mr Branson able to make surprisingly rapid inroads into some of its most lucrative routes. The airline market is also unusual in that competitors routinely take on each other's customers and that their order books are relatively transparent. BA may have been guilty of arrogance or stupidity in allowing itself to be needled by Mr Branson, who comes out of the affair as much the better tactician. But perhaps not every company in BA's position, possessing both the motive and the means, would have behaved much better. The second charge against BA is that it sought to blacken Virgin's name through the press. As any journalist who has covered a contested takeover can attest, this is not unprecedented behaviour either. In both cases, the question is not so much what is done as what means are employed to do it. If a company can be shown to have broken the Data Protection Act, or abused its market dominance in suppressing competition, or made slanderous allegations, it can be prosecuted accordingly. But that brings us back to our second question. Suppose none of these things happened. Does that make it all right? The answer, obviously, is no. It is not even necessary here to appeal to business ethics. The point can be made on practical grounds. If BA has offended the sense of natural justice in the world at large, its business will suffer. Its customers may, at the margin, take their business elsewhere. If it has compromised its reputation for straight dealing in the eyes of governments, it may find its global ambitions harder to pursue. The message of the affair, in short, is that dirty tricks have a price of their own.</p>

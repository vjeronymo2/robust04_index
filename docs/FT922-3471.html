			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ivory Coast to propose cocoa marketing system THE IVORY Coast, the world's biggest cocoa exporter, is to present its aid donors this week with a proposal for a cocoa crop marketing system, said Mr Michel Manceau, managing director of EC-sponsored association Aproma, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Manceau was talking after a visit to see how the country was implementing a reform of its cocoa marketing prompted by aid donors. 'The liberalisation of its domestic network worked well,' he said. 'What has to be done now is to define how it will put forward its anticipated sales and ensure a permanent presence on the market. The amounts will not be discussed, only the method.' The country's donors consider that the Ivory Coast's withdrawal from the world market, as well as its return, have had a negative impact on world cocoa prices, he said. 'Cocoa prices tumbled this year, even though the Caistab (Caisse de Stabilisation, the Ivorian commodities board) has stepped out of the world market,' Mr Manceau said. European traders earlier said the delayed start to Ivory Coast's new crop sales campaign was increasingly weighing on cocoa prices, which are at 16 1/2 -year lows. 'The important thing is that the Ivory Coast set up a control system of its own sales, define its anticipated sales, and its method for a permanent presence on the market,' Mr Manceau said.</p>

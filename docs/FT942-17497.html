			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Ashdown warns on by-election Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has warned that Labour may help the Conservatives win the Eastleigh by-election. Mr Ashdown accuses the Conservatives of 'talking up' Labour's prospects in the hope of splitting the anti-government vote. He stresses in a letter appealing for an all-out effort from party activists that 'a strong Labour campaign could stop the Liberal Democrats winning'. Eastleigh became vacant through the death of Stephen Milligan, who in the 1992 general election had a majority of 13,355 over Mr David Chidgey, who is again contesting the seat for the Liberal Democrats.</p>

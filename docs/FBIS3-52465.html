In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, Dhunaybat  said: This matter has become just an excuse. The fact is that  there is nothing but a number of options which some thought  should be studied, but they were not presented as a proposal.    He added: Every brother has a right to make suggestions and  to think, but the option of dissolving the group and replacing  it with a political party was never proposed.    Dhunaybat played down the dismissal of Ziyad Abu-Ghunaymah  from the group, pointing out that he was dismissed for reasons  of misconduct. Abu-Ghunaymah had been dismissed from the group  while on a visit to the United States but he remained an IAF  member.    A new IAF executive bureau, Shura Council chairman, and  secretary general are due to be elected today.    Dhunaybat had earlier denied that the group had nominated  anyone for the parliamentary elections held recently.</p>

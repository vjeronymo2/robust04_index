			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Expectations of a further improvement in the economy and worries over extra supply will continue to weigh on the Japanese government bond market. The market is closed today for a national holiday, but investors are focusing on the spate of important economic figures to be announced later in the week. Gross domestic production figures for the fourth quarter of last year are expected to confirm weakness in the economy at the end of last year. Market participants are expecting annualised negative growth of around 3.4 per cent. Leading economic indicators of business sentiment are expected to rise to a four-month high, while household consumption for January is also projected to reflect the recent pick-up in spending by households, which are now tired of scrimping and saving. Such data is expected to prompt a further shift in the perception of the economy, and prevent a rise on the bond markets. The Bank of Japan, however,is poised to continue to allow short-term money market rates to remain at low levels due to the high level of demand for funds ahead of the business year-end. Investors are also expected to remain cautious ahead of an increase in bond issuance by municipal governments starting next month.</p>

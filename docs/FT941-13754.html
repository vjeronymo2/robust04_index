			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Checking Lonrho's 'normal' temperature - Other Companies Lonrho's annual results for the year to September 30, to be announced tomorrow, are the first it has published since Mr Dieter Bock, its German joint chief executive, started the process of making the international trading group a 'more normal company', in his words. Last autumn, he succeeded in having non-executives appointed to the board for the first time in 20 years and in setting up an audit committee to review auditing procedures and financial performance. The figures will, therefore, be of particular interest to see if the audit committee's influence is apparent - and whether the company statement contains any tell-tale signs of the state of the battle between Mr Bock and his fellow joint chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland. Analysts believe that profits from ongoing businesses doubled last year to around Pounds 80m and that the figure including gains from disposals could be as high as Pounds 140m.</p>

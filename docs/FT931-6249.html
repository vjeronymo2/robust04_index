			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Germany hints again THE Bundesbank gave another subtle hint yesterday that German money market rates should come down this week after it issued rather less volume in its first tender for short-term liquidity paper than dealers had expected, writes James Blitz. At the weekend, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, revealed a slight change of mood over interest rate policy, suggesting that cash rates could come down as the Bundesbank's new rules on commercial banks' minimum reserve requirements take effect. Yesterday was the first day that the new rules came into operation, and there was indeed a sharp drop in the value of call money. It fell from around the Lombard rate level of 9 per cent at the start of the day to 8.78 per cent by the close of trading, as more funds came into the market. However, details of the issue of 3, 6, and 9-month bills may also have implied that rates could soften this week. Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets in London noted that the Bundesbank had said earlier this month that it would allot up to DM25bn in the first of these new allocations of short-dated instruments to the German money market. Yesterday, the Bundesbank announced it would be allotting DM14.8bn of short-term funds. In Miss Cottrell's view, the central bank was therefore adding liquidity to the market. She believes the Bundesbank's repo rate should therefore come down 15 basis points to about 8.35 per cent later this week. Dealers in Euromark futures contracts continued to assume that there would also be another cut in the Bundesbank's officially posted discount rate at this week's council meeting. The March Euromark contract was little changed on the day, closing 3 basis points down at 92.05. At this level it assumes that three-month money in two weeks' time will be at 7.95 per cent, implying a reduction in the discount rate 'floor', currently at 8.00 per cent. Reflecting the news from Germany, the March French franc contract rose 8 basis points on the day to finish at 88.55. Sterling futures also gained ground: the March short sterling contract closed 2 basis points firmer at 94.06. Three-month sterling cash ended 1/8 percentage point softer at 6 per cent. This reflected the termination of 'end-of-month' factors, which always bring tighter conditions in wholesale cash markets.</p>

In his cordial exchange of views with Nguyen Huyen Chuoc, a  labor hero and prominent machine installation expert, Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet said:    [Vo Van Kiet] "Comrade, do you see any difference between  the  installation of this 500-kilovolt power transformer and that of  a 200-kilovolt power transformer?    [Nguyen Huyen Chuoc] "Well, in principle, there is no  difference. We face a greater danger, however, in term of  insulation here. Furthermore, this project calls for more  stringent quality control measures and higher precision.    [Vo Van Kiet] "Do you think that once you have completed the  installation of this 500-kilovolt power transformer, you can  improve your expertise and cooperate with foreign engineers in  the future?    [Nguyen Huyen Chuoc] "I am positive we can."    Vo Van Kiet noted with pleasure that most of the work had  been completed. He commended everyone for their great efforts  to build the north-south 500-kilovolt power line, which is of  great importance to the cause of national construction. The  prime minister expressed his hope that everyone will continue to  complete the remaining work with the highest results.    Next, the prime minister called on the Vietnamese cadres and  workers and Russian specialists at the Hoa Binh hydroelectric  power plant where the last phase of the installation of the  eighth group of generators was in progress. The prime minister  reminded everyone of the need to make continued efforts to  guarantee the highest level of quality for this last group of  generators.    During his two-day visit to Hoa Binh, Vo Van Kiet devoted  much of his time to touring a number of production  establishments and to working sessions with leading provincial  officials. He also toured Nam Phong Village in Ky Son District,  where he called on a number of households which performed very  well in the movement to promote the household economy. Next,  while touring Trung Phong Village, the prime minister expressed  his keen interest in sugar cane planting. Afterward, he visited  the Cao Phong state farm. In his exchange of views with Farm  Director Hoang Huu Qui, the prime minister said:    [Vo Van Kiet] "What is the average annual income of each  household here?"    [Hoang Huu Qui] "On the average, each worker here earns 20  million dong per year. Some outstanding workers earn as much as  40-45 million dong each per year. The farm management collects  fees on basic depreciation and agricultural taxes. In addition,  each worker also makes a three-percent contribution to the  production insurance fund. Altogether, each worker contributes  about 40 percent of his or her income and keeps the rest, which  stands at about 60 percent."    [Vo Van Kiet] "Is production stable?"    [Hoang Huu Qui] "Yes, it is stable. For example, the  yield of each orchard is about 150 quintals, or 15 tons."    [Vo Van Kiet] "Are there any supplemental measures to  increase the incomes of the farm and households?"    [Hoang Huu Qui] "Well, we think that intensive cultivation  is one way to increase our crop yield. We also think of ways to  generate high-yield saplings, which, in turn, will yield higher  revenues."    Also at Ky Xuan District, Vo Van Kiet visited the forested  area in Dan Hoa village. He urged the local administration and  people to continue to plant forest trees and fruit orchards on  denuded land to earn more income.    After visiting various production establishments, Vo Van  Kiet  held a working session with the leading cadres of Hoa Binh.  Comrade Nguyen Nhu Coc, secretary of the provincial party  committee, briefed the prime minister on the socioeconomic  situation of the province and its tasks for the days ahead.    "In a talk to leading cadres of the province, Vo Van Kiet  commended the provincial party organization and people for their  efforts in improving the economic structure in accordance with  the party lines and policies. He urged Hoa Binh to formulate  plans to plant more crops and improve animal husbandry to  produce a greater volume of products so as to provide good  support to the processing industries. The province should play  close attention to each village and help each family develop  production to extricate themselves from poverty and strive to  amass wealth through their great efforts."    He also urged the province to formulate concrete plans to  reduce the number of poor families by 20 percent annually, while  striving to improve its economic structure through progress  toward agro-industrial development.    During the working session with leading cadres of Hoa Binh,  Vo Van Kiet stressed the necessity of helping the local people  overcome their difficulties and poverty, especially those who  live in the Da River basin. He also stressed the importance of  preserving forests around the Da River basin. The prime  minister said:    [Vo Van Kiet] "I heard that forests in the Da River basin  are  being destroyed by some people. If this is true, it is very  dangerous. We must take most concrete measures to immediately  stop deforestation there [words indistinct]. We must also  formulate plans to help the local people engage in various kinds  of trade. We must educate and motivate the local people to  preserve the forests. For those who intend to destroy forests  through illegal logging, we must take drastic measures against  them. I would like to stress that first we must formulate plans  to help the local people to overcome difficulties, while  encouraging them to preserve forests in the Da River basin."</p>

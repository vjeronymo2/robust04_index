			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Yeltsin warns of coup threat: Russia in crisis as president calls for referendum on who governs RUSSIA was plunged into crisis yesterday after President Boris Yeltsin declared open political war on the Congress of People's Deputies, which has blocked his reforms. Citing a 'creeping coup' against him, Mr Yeltsin said a referendum was necessary to decide 'to whom do you entrust saving the country from economic and political crisis . . . the president . . . or the presently constituted Congress and Supreme Soviet'. In a dramatic speech to the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow, he said: 'Congress is a bulwark of conservative forces and reaction. Reform in Russia is in serious danger. What they failed to do in August 1991, they have decided to repeat now by way of a creeping coup.' His speech provoked uproar in the Congress Hall, the beginnings of scattered demonstrations in the streets and the opposition of vice-president Alexander Rutskoi. General Rutskoi called for the prosecution of presidential advisers, whom he accused of pushing Mr Yeltsin into a confrontation with the Congress and into creating 'anarchy and powerlessness' in the country. The president's proposal was for a referendum to be held on January 24. If the population supported him, parliamentary elections would be convened on March 27. If the Congress won the referendum, he would resign and fresh presidential elections would be held. If neither secured the support of half of those voting, both would stand for election. In the meantime, the government would continue under the acting premiership of Mr Yegor Gaidar - whom the Congress had refused to confirm in his post on Wednesday. Both hardline deputies and presidential supporters reacted with anger. Calls for Mr Yeltsin's impeachment were immediately raised. Mr Sergei Baburin, the leader of the Russia nationalist faction, said: 'They are pushing us towards revolution.' Mr Pyotr Fillipov, a prominent radical democrat deputy, told a small demonstration in front of the Kremlin: 'The Civic Union (opposition group) and the communists were pushing reform off the agenda - we must keep it there by supporting the president.' Mr Gaidar attempted to play down the significance of the event, saying the president's action was wholly constitutional and that government business, and talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, would continue normally. He said he had learned of the president's initiative only yesterday morning, but admitted that he had asked Mr Victor Yerin, the interior minister, to ensure public order. The heads of the so-called 'power' ministries - defence, security and interior - all appeared before the highly charged Congress to report, in a scheduled discussion, on crime and corruption in the country. General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, assured the Congress that the army would remain above politics, but Mr Victor Barannikov, security minister and head of the Russian KGB, produced a Soviet-era speech full of warnings of the growing threat from foreign intelligence agencies and a rising tide of crime. Just before the close of business in the Congress, the deputies voted in closed session to take back under their control a 300-strong armed guard. This militia had been removed from Supreme Soviet to interior ministry control last month by Mr Yeltsin, following its use by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, in his attempt to seize the daily paper Izvestia.

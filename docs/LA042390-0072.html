			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TITAN LINEUP CHANGE PAYS OFF IN SERIES SWEEP OVER UNLV  </P> <P> Moving to the top of the Cal State Fullerton baseball lineup has been a step up  for Phil Nevin and the Titans.  </P> <P> Nevin hit two home runs from the leadoff spot to lead Cal State Fullerton to a  6-1 victory over Nevada Las Vegas in a Big West Conference baseball game  Sunday.  </P> <P> Nevin was moved from the No. 3 spot to the leadoff spot March 22 against  Illinois, and he is intent on staying there.  </P> <P> "I like it a lot," he said. "You get to see a lot more pitches, because  pitchers don't pitch around you -- they don't want to put the leadoff batter on  base. When a pitcher gets behind you in the count, you see a lot of fastballs."  </P> <P> You also get to see a lot of curveballs, which Nevin saw Sunday.  </P> <P> Nevin's first home run led off the third inning to give Fullerton a 2-1 lead.  The second was a wind-aided fly ball that cleared the center-field fence and  gave Fullerton a 4-1 lead.  </P> <P> The victory gave the Titans (25-16, 8-1) a three-game sweep of the series and  extended their winning streak to seven games.  </P> <P> "No doubt, we're playing the best ball of the year," Fullerton Coach Larry  Cochell said. "We got off to a bad start by anybody's standards, but we're  finally getting good defense and timely hitting at the same time."  </P> <P> Fullerton had 11 hits, including a solo home run by Frank Charles and three  singles by Mate Borgogno. Nevin replaced Borgogno in the leadoff spot.  </P> <P> Huck Flener (7-1) pitched a five-hitter. And although the Titans made two  errors, Flener was helped by a diving catch by right fielder David Ayala in the  ninth.  </P> <P> Jonathan Jarolimek took the loss, allowing six runs and seven hits in 5 2/3  innings for Las Vegas (24-18, 5-6).  </P> <P> In another Big West Conference baseball game:  </P> <P> UC Irvine 12, Cal State Long Beach 11 (11 innings) -- Host Irvine rallied twice  and ended its three-game losing streak. The Anteaters trailed, 10-2, entering  the bottom of the seventh inning and, 11-10, in the 11th. UCI (27-20, 5-7)  scored three in the seventh and five in the ninth.  </P> <P> Fred Combs led off the ninth inning with a home run. Irvine pulled to within  one when Ed Luna, drove in two runs with a single and Chris Gallego doubled in  a run. Combs' sacrifice fly scored Gallego to tie the score, 10-10.  </P> <P> Long Beach (29-18, 6-6) scored a run in the 11th inning, but Billy Bardens  drove in Jon Skaggs on a single to tie the score again and Gallego's sacrifice  fly scored Bardens.  </P></p>

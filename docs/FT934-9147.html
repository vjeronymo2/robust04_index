			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland in Gatt deal game-plan MR PETER Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday set out his game-plan for completing the Uruguay Round of global trade talks by the agreed deadline of December 15. He told a meeting of the overseer Trade Negotiations Committee that 'all negotiations on substance' would have to be concluded by that date, which marks the expiry of US negotiating authority. Mr Sutherland rebuked negotiators for wasting time 'on arcane technical points of doubtful importance' and warned against the temptation to leave important concessions until the last possible moment. He said yesterday the TNC would meet at least once a week under his chairmanship to steer the talks. He will chair 'very frequent informal open-ended meetings' of top negotiators to tackle outstanding issues and blockages. He urged greater efforts to achieve 'substantial results' by November 15. Final country schedules setting out market-opening measures for services are due by November 26. Mr Sutherland said revised texts on creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation and improved dispute settlement procedures would be ready by next Monday.</p>

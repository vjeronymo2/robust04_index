			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Simple choice, hard decision - Maggie Urry on today's meeting to settle the future of C&amp;J Clark SHAREHOLDERS of C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe company, gathering today at the Royal Bath &amp; West of England Showground, must decide the future of their 168 year old company. The choice before them is simple. But the decision is far from easy. They must choose whether to accept a proposed Pounds 184m bid from Berisford International, a virtual shell company keen to buy itself a core business, or retain ownership in the hope that the company can find a solution to its undoubted problems. The meeting - at a venue more used to cattle shows than corporate showdowns  -is bound to be stormy. Emotions run high when Clark's shareholders, of which about 70 per cent are members of the founding family, discuss the family business. Put simply, the argument within the family has been whether to stick with the tradition of a family-controlled and run company or to bring in professional managers who might adopt a more ruthless business approach. Since Berisford's bid appeared the alternative to family control and ownership has become a sale of the business. Berisford, claims Mr Alan Bowkett, its chief executive, 'is the solution not the problem'. If the Berisford offer is rejected, he has all but said Clark may go bust. Shareholders against the sale, who have rallied around a standard raised by a group calling itself Shoes, say Berisford is exaggerating the company's problems and the shareholder's disharmony. While the Clarks have been arguing, profits have slumped, and dividends cut. From a pre-tax and exceptionals profit of Pounds 36.1m in 1989-90 the figure dropped to Pounds 14.2m before exceptional costs of Pounds 12.5m in the financial year to January 31. The dividend has been reduced from 9.38p to 3.75p over the last two years. Years of disagreement culminated last October in an acrimonious shareholders' meeting which only ended with an agreement that the board would assess possible bids for the company. That process produced the Berisford offer, which the board has described as 'fair and reasonable'. Seven of the 11 directors have recommended it to shareholders. Berisford is offering 213p per share in cash or securities. On top of that is the promise of another 26p cash as and when Clark's surplus properties are sold. The deferred element depends on the prices obtained and is based on the January 31 book value. That price has attractions given Clark's recent profit and dividend record, and the price at which shareholders have been able to sell through an internal market. The last trade was at 90p and the latest valuation is 100p. Further, the Clark directors who recommend the bid assert that it takes account of management forecasts of a recovery in profits over the next three years. Shoes argues that the Berisford offer fails to recognise Clark's potential, although Shoes has not seen the three-year profit plan. And Clark's supposedly divided board, they say, has implemented a reorganisation plan. Rather than accept Berisford's offer, Shoes proposes a new structure for Clark of a board and a shareholder council. And it suggests a flotation within five years. In response, Berisford says that a two-tier structure would foster rather than heal divisions. And a vague promise of a flotation is uncertain compared to cash in hand. Shoes could have trumped Berisford if it had promised to match Berisford's offer and keep the business within family control. 'They should put up or shut up,' said one stockbroker. But it is in no position to do that. If shareholders reject Berisford's approach, they must ask themselves what guarantee they have that Clark will not revert to the divisions which have weakened its business.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORSE GIVES VISTA HARD FOOTBALL LESSON  </P> <P> The unsuspecting fan who left her car before entering De Vore Stadium at  Southwestern College Friday night didn't have a clue.  </P> <P> "I don't know much about football," she said.  </P> <P> A little more than two hours later, she got a lesson from the best, as  top-ranked Morse manhandled Vista, 48-14, in a 3-A quarterfinal game featuring  runs usually reserved for a guy named "Rocket."  </P> <P> Morse (12-0) had two of them. Gary Taylor and Conan Smith run everywhere but  circles around Vista (6-6). Together, they went ballistic.  </P> <P> Taylor was the long-winded one. He ran for touchdowns of 35, 17 and 66 yards.  Smith was the sprinter. He went in twice from the 1-yard line.  </P> <P> "We're a pretty good offensive team," Morse Coach John Shacklett said. "I'm  never too concerned with being held scoreless."  </P> <P> Vista made a valiant effort to stay in the game, and did, for about a quarter  despite not gaining any yards in 23 carries.  </P> <P> The Panthers even scored first, on a nine-yard run by Donte White at 11:00. The  run was set up when Vista recovered its onside kick on the Morse 45, and Jose  Perez threw a 36-yard pass to Aaron Rounsifer.  </P> <P> "I wasn't too pleased with that," Shacklett said. "They caught us flat."  </P> <P> But Morse came up for air and scored the next four touchdowns, Taylor and Smith  traded scoring runs, to take a 28-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "We played as hard as we could play," said Vista Coach Dick Haines, who watched  the Panthers' six-game winning streak come to an abrupt halt. "I'm proud of my  kids. (Morse) just outmanpowered us. They had too many tools."  </P> <P> And Teddy Lawrence was the keeper of the tool box.  </P> <P> After Vista's Chato Jackson scored on a two-yard run to open the third quarter,  pulling the Panthers to 28-14, Taylor scored on a 66-yard run from his 34.  </P> <P> Then Lawrence unleashed a couple of touchdown passes that couldn't have been  prettier, or more on target.  </P> <P> Lawrence found Dwain Bostic on a 21-yard pass play with 10:23 remaining, then  threw over half the field when he connected with Glenn Steele for a 65-yard  play with 1:26 left.  </P></p>

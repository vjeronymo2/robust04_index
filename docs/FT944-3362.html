			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Spotlight falls on Merrill Lynch investment role: Richard Waters on the part played by the firm in selling the securities on which the losses were made In the war of words being waged between Wall Street and Orange County, the beleaguered southern California authority which faces huge losses on misjudged bond investments, the name of Merrill Lynch is beginning to stand out. Other investment firms, both foreign and US, may have lent the county much of the Dollars 12bn that it used to play the financial markets. However the involvement of Merrill, the US's biggest - and, in recent years, probably its most consistently profitable - securities firm, covered a number of areas. The firm lent Orange County Dollars 2bn, and remains the only investment firm of any size not to have sold the collateral held against these loans. What is more important, it sold the county more than half the Dollars 20bn of securities on which it suffered the losses, which are put at more than Dollars 2bn. And it underwrote a Dollars 600m bond offering for the county in July, several months after the turn in US interest rates first began to hit the county's investment fund. The cash raised through that bond issue was earmarked for the county's investment fund, bolstering its cash resources to buy more securities (some of them through Merrill) or service its borrowings (including borrowings from Merrill.) This multiple relationship has already made Merrill the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the Orange County investment losses, and the target of a lawsuit from bond holders, who argue that they should have been told more about the investment losses in July. A senior executive at Merrill Lynch, who refused to be named, said there was nothing uncommon about either Orange County's heavy borrowings to fund its investments, or about the nature of the investments it made. 'The fact that the reverse repurchase agreements were used as a financing alternative was not uncommon for counties,' he said. 'The securities the county treasurer was buying were all within his legal and legislative ability, and within his investment guidelines. The county (treasurer) was a highly sophisticated investor, and very publicly known for his experience and success in the past.' Merrill also contended that, at any given moment, it did not know the full extent of Orange County's borrowings. The debt level was 'relatively high', the Merrill executive said, but, 'we were not aware of that at any given time.' Other investment houses which lent heavily also said that the treasurer, Mr Robert Citron, did not tell them about his total borrowings. The hunt is under way for other US counties which may have followed similar investment strategies. According to Mr Richard Larkin, a managing director of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, 'We're concerned that other county treasurers were trying to emulate Mr Citron. It's previous investment successes were very well publicised.' Of the July bond issue, meanwhile, Merrill said: 'It was in no way a conflict.' Helping the county to raise money and acting as a broker, were entirely different functions, it added. Some bondholders claimed that Merrill should have forced the county to disclose more about its investment fund in July. The prospectus issued at the time of the bond issue warned that 'the price and income volatility of the . . . securities (in the investment fund) is greater than standard fixed income securities and may serve to increase the volatility' of the fund. It also warns that the fund often borrowed heavily. But the prospectus only showed the original cost of the securities bought by the fund, not their value at the time (a much lower figure.) That figure did not need to be disclosed, given the fund's investment strategy, Merrill maintained.</p>

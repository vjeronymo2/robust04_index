			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Lower productivity hits gold mine profits at Anglo American A decline in productivity at most gold mines in the Anglo American group, the world's largest producer, led to a 4 per cent drop in attributable profits of R263.5m (Dollars 73.2m) in the three months to end-March from R274.4m in the December quarter. Overall production dipped 7 per cent to 61,295kg after reaching 66,115kg in the previous quarter. This offset an increase in the average gold price received for the group, which rose to R41,261 a kg from R39,793 a kg as a result of the higher gold price and the group's reduced exposure to hedging. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo American's gold division, said the group now had 80 per cent of production exposed to the gold spot price and had restructured its hedges so that they could be rolled over. The decline was most apparent in the Freegold division, where gold production was 10.2 per cent lower at 25,272 kg as a result of a lower yield and less ore milled. However, the company declared a final dividend of 200 cents, sharply up on last year's 140 cents payout. Mr Nap Mayer, managing director of the gold division, attributed the 'unsatisfactory performance' to a combination of slightly lower average yields and some industrial unrest on the mines partly related to the forthcoming South African election. The company expects the situation to improve over the next few quarters, but warned that overall production was likely to be down on this year's total of 111,668kg, which was itself below the previous year's record of 115,320kg. Among the group's other big producers, Vaal Reefs, the group's most profitable gold mine, reported a 6.8 per cent decline in production to 17,928kg for the quarter compared to 19,239kg. This was in part the result of the fall-off in yield after the abnormally high grades achieved last quarter. Combined with a higher tax bill, this led to a drop in attributable profit to R65,9m, down 8.3 per cent from R71,9m the previous quarter. Western Deeps proved one of the few bright spots, increasing attributable profit to R47,4m from R42,4m, although this was largely due to lower capital expenditure. Overall production declined to 10,138kg from 11,210kg. The smaller Elandsrand and Ergo divisions also performed creditably and recorded slight increases in overall gold production for the quarter. Mr Sunter said that he expected the overall gold price to remain at current dollar level over the next few months, but warned that fluctuations in the rand as a result of political factors would have an important effect on the market.</p>

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BALTIC RADICALS WINNING POSTS  </P> <P> Radical groups in Estonia and Latvia demanding a return to their Baltic  republics' prewar independence looked set for substantial gains from weekend  local elections.  </P> <P> Preliminary results today in the Estonian capital of Tallinn showed a 12-member  radical alliance had picked up 18 of the 80 City Council seats after preference  votes were counted and was likely to win at least 40 when the final tally was  calculated. Among the 18 was a member of the environmentalist Greens Party.  </P> <P> A complex preferential voting system means the full outcome will not be known  for several days.  </P></p>

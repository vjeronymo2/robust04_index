			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need to assess risks of fuels Sir, It is a pity Michael Pettman (Letters, October 29) has misunderstood the main argument in the debate over fuel composition. It is true that the level of benzene in petrol is controlled but this is irrelevant as other aromatics in the fuel undergo change during combustion to form benzene. It is therefore theoretically possible to have a fuel with no benzene but to have significant quantities in the exhaust gases. Many scientific publications have shown this clear relationship between total aromatic content and benzene emissions. From the data, a recent study has shown that premium unleaded will emit around 20 per cent more benzene than leaded and super-unleaded will emit 30 per cent more benzene, if used in cars not equipped with catalytic converters. Both the select committee and the Royal Commission on Environmental Protection were unanimous in their call for super-unleaded, with the highest average aromatic content, to be banned. In view of the widespread concern over benzene, it is surely time for the government to undertake a full risk assessment of the various types of fuel and their appropriate uses.

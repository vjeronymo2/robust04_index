			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Imports to China up 27% CHINA'S trade account remained stubbornly in the red in the first eight months of the year in spite of efforts to boost exports and curb imports, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation reported that the country's trade deficit to August reached Dollars 5.7bn (Pounds 3.8bn), with imports up 27.3 per cent to more than Dollars 58bn. Exports grew by only 4 per cent to more than Dollars 52bn. Beijing has set as a target for this year a balance between imports and exports, but it seems this will be virtually impossible to achieve. China recorded a modest surplus on its trade account in 1992 of slightly more than Dollars 4bn, half that of the previous year. It last registered a trade deficit in 1989. A stabilisation programme introduced in June, aimed at calming an overheating economy and reducing pressure on imports, has achieved some success. Credit curbs have slowed import growth, but China's export performance this year has proved sluggish. The English-language Business Weekly quoted a ministry official as saying it would be 'difficult to repeat last year's trade surplus'.</p>

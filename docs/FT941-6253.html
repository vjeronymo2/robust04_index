			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: N American groups study Vox stake deal North American media companies are negotiating for a 49 per cent stake in Vox, a private German television station owned by a consortium headed by the Bertelsmann group. According to unconfirmed reports, the bidders are Time Warner of the US and CanWest Global Systems of Canada. Vox is one of nine German-based private broadcasters competing for viewers with 15 publicly-owned channels. Their move is understood to have been initiated last month when the publisher of the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, decided to dispose of its 20 per cent stake in the struggling broadcaster. Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media business with widespread international interests in print and electronic media, holds a 24.9 per cent stake. Other shareholders include the WMB holding company, of which 47 per cent is in the hands of the public sector bank, WestLB. Bertelsmann yesterday would confirm only that it was in talks which should lead to 'stabilisation' of the shareholdings in Vox, which had a shaky launch into the crowded German TV market just over a year ago. The company said a group of American investors was seeking a 49 per cent stake, but that the current owners were not offering that amount. It said that although Bertelsmann had no plans to reduce its stake, an announcement could be made in the next few weeks. Originally conceived as an information channel, much of Vox's output is now entertainment. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, which supplies a magazine programme, S-Zett, and other services to Vox, is believed to want to pull out because of the format change, and the unexpectedly high start-up losses, exacerbated by recession.</p>

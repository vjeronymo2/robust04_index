			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FANS ARE BASHING RIPKEN;  </P> <P> ORIOLE SHORTSTOP IS NOT EXEMPT FROM CRITICISM  </P> <P> No wonder players say they never listen to talk radio shows. How could they  stand to?  </P> <P> Take the other day, on a Baltimore radio station. The subject, believe it or  not, was "Cal Bashing," attacking the Orioles' Cal Ripken Jr.  </P> <P> A woman named Mary got things rolling after someone had nominated Cal for Most  Valuable Oriole.  </P> <P> "He's the Most Disappointing Oriole," Mary insisted.  </P> <P> She went on to say Cal should be batting 30 points higher, that he doesn't hit  with runners in scoring position (especially with the bases loaded), and that  Mark Belanger and Luis Aparicio were much better shortstops.  </P> <P> "Frank Robinson rates Cal one of the two best baserunners on the club," the  station's host informed Mary.  </P> <P> "Who you kidding?" she snapped. "He can't run. He's too big."  </P> <P> "You have to admit," Vair said, "Cal does play an important leadership role."  </P> <P> "Come off it!" Mary said. "Just watch him out there. He doesn't talk to  anybody. He's no leader."  </P> <P> Having trashed the Orioles' only sacred cow, Mary hung up. For the next 30  minutes, other callers raged on about the subject.  </P> <P> What are things coming to when the Orioles' only perennial All-Star is roughed  up in his own town?  </P> <P> Here's a guy, Cal Jr., who plays every inning of every game at a demanding  position like shortstop, going errorless in his last 45 games, and who also has  21 home runs and 90 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Merely being out there for 1,241 consecutive games is leadership of the highest  order.  </P> <P> And yet . . .  </P> <P> Cal's batting average is slip-sliding away as the season comes to a conclusion.  After going 2 for 26 in his last seven games, he's down to .260. The way things  look, he'll finish in the .250s.  </P> <P> He's batting .258 with men in scoring position. With the bases loaded, he's 1  for 14 including his strikeout against Detroit Wednesday night.  </P> <P> This would have been an ideal year for Cal to win the American League's Most  Valuable Player Award, which he also won in 1983.  </P> <P> The Orioles have had an amazing year, and Cal is their best. But nobody wins  the MVP award batting .250.  </P> <P> Cal hit over .300 twice, in '83 and '84. He hit .282 in '85 and '86. He hit a  career-low .252 in '87 and .264 last year. His extra base hits are declining.  </P> <P> What's the problem?  </P> <P> Every fan has an answer, the most popular being that Cal is simply worn down.  Maybe he is, but with the club only one game behind Toronto and each game  weighing a ton, the last thing Ripken is going to get is a rest.  </P> <P> People on the club don't like to talk about Cal's negatives. They respect him  too much for what he is -- a great, dedicated athlete who does a heroic job for  this team.  </P> <P> One man with the expertise to explain Ripken's problems is Tom McCraw, the  club's batting instructor. To him there is no mystery.  </P> <P> "This has been an adjusting year for Cal," says McCraw, who has been in  professional baseball for 30 years, 15 as a coach or instructor.  </P> <P> "It was different when Cal had Eddie Murray hitting behind him, but when we  went into this season we had only two proven hitters -- Cal and Phil Bradley,  and Bradley is more of a top-of-the-order guy.  </P> <P> "Nobody knew that Mickey Tettleton could hit 25 home runs. Nobody knew that  Craig Worthington could be a 75-RBI man. Nobody knew what Randy Milligan could  do.  </P> <P> "So Cal felt he had to pull the whole wagon himself. He expanded his strike  zone. He was overanxious, swinging at bad pitches. It was like having one  Willie Mays on the club."  </P> <P> Ripken's "expanded" strike zone seems to be reflected in his 51 walks, which is  half his 1988 total. That includes a season-high three Wednesday night.  </P> <P> McCraw believes it has been "a relief" to Cal to see players like Mike  Devereaux, Milligan and Worthington deliver.  </P> <P> "It takes a year to prove you can play in the big leagues," McCraw said. "These  guys started off well, then the other clubs went to school on them and their  averages dropped, and then our hitters adjusted and their averages crept back  up. Devereaux went way down, under .240, at one point, but he's back up near  .270 now."  </P></p>

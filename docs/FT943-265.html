			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland ratification push Just a year after hitting the international campaign trail in his efforts to secure a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is globe-trotting once again, this time to lobby for quick ratification of the deal, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. Mr Sutherland told members of the Australia-New Zealand Business Council in Auckland yesterday that next January's deadline for establishment of the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor, was one nobody could afford to miss. The visit to Australasia follows trips earlier this month to Latin America and to Brussels. Next week Mr Sutherland will be in Madrid for the IMF/World Bank meeting where he is expected to buttonhole ministers to urge completion of ratification procedures this year. He has also been in telephone contact with Washington and some other key trading nations. A special implementation conference to decide on the date the Uruguay Round accords come into force has been scheduled for December in Geneva. But, with the timing of ratification in the US and the European Union clouded by uncertainty, most of Gatt's 123 members have taken a wait-and-see approach. Only 26 have ratified so far and the number has not budged since the summer. Still, a letter from Mr Sutherland to all trade ministers earlier this month has elicited a 'very positive response', according to Gatt officials. The majority have told Gatt they expect to complete ratification by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Remy unit increases stake in Shanghai wine project REMY Pacifique, the Hong Kong subsidiary of Remy Cointreau, has nearly doubled its stake in a Chinese wine production joint venture. The investment follows a four-year experiment growing French vines near Shanghai where the climate was once considered unfavourable. The first wine from the 60-acre vineyard - 150,000 bottles of Imperial Court sparkling wine produced in the methode champenoise - went on sale locally in January. Remy has increased its holding in the venture from 32 per cent to 60 per cent, with the remaining 40 per cent split equally between its partners, Shanghai Foodstuffs and Shanghai Malu Xian. The Shanghai venture is Remy's second investment in wine production in China. It has been involved since 1979 in the Dynasty Winery in Tiajin.</p>

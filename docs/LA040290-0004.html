			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UNION-TRIBUNE GUILD OKS PACT  </P> <P> Members of the San Diego Newspaper Guild on Sunday ended a bitter labor dispute  with the Union-Tribune Publishing Co., voting begrudgingly to accept a new,  two-year contract but saying all is not well at San Diego's two largest  newspapers.  </P> <P> Guild members voted 227 to 78 to accept the new labor package that calls, among  other things, for an immediate 10% pay raise -- the first pay increase for many  employees since December, 1987.  </P> <P> The contract negotiated by the guild covers 1,100 employees in the editorial,  advertising, circulation and business departments.  </P> <P> Guild President Ed Jahn said members felt resigned to accept the new contract  because it was the best they could expect to muster from the company. "There  were no shouts of joy," he said of the ratification. "People generally felt it  was a poor, pitiful, unworthy kind of contract. They were hoping for something  much better, but they realized the grim reality of the fight -- that the  publisher had the lawyers and the money."  </P> <P> The dispute at one point boiled to the brink of a strike, which was authorized  but never called. Instead, many reporters showed their dissatisfaction with the  company by withholding their bylines and credit lines, and the guild campaigned  for readers and advertisers to drop their support of the paper.  </P> <P> Jahn criticized publisher Helen Copley for putting the mechanics of publishing  daily newspapers ahead of good morale in the workplace. "After two years of  treating people the way she has, she better not expect us to come waltzing to  work whistling, 'Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go.' The company got  everything and more than it needs.  </P> <P> "Two years ago, we made a poor assumption the company would deal fairly with  us. We've learned from that that we'll have to get meaner a lot quicker with  Copley next time."  </P> <P> Herbert Klein, editor in chief of Copley Newspapers, which publishes the  morning Union and the afternoon Tribune, said management was "pleased" by the  ratification, calling the contract a "fair, workable agreement."  </P> <P> "As a company, we are anxious to put aside the strife of the immediate past and  to move forward to rebuild the professional pride we have in the newspapers,"  Klein said.  </P> <P> He said the labor dispute "went longer than it should have. We'd like now to  build new labor harmony."  </P> <P> Guild members had argued that the tough contract talks were designed to  ultimately bust the labor union, and they said Sunday that, given the contract  terms, the onus was now on guild members to rebuild their organization in order  to posture for new contract talks in two years.  </P> <P> Under the contract, the guild agreed to a modified union shop in which present  guild members and future employees would be allowed to choose whether they want  to belong to the newspaper union or not. The guild also agreed to drop its  demand for automatic dues deduction -- a term that existed in the previous  contract.  </P> <P> Jahn said the guild would now try to show its value to employees by focusing on  "creating a labor consciousness in the work force," by considering such  programs as child care and scholarship programs.  </P> <P> He said the guild succeeded in at least winning a two-year contract; the  company has pushed for a one-year pact until a state labor mediator intervened  in the negotiations.  </P> <P> In addition to the immediate -- but not retroactive -- 10% pay increase,  amounting to $75 a week for reporters and other employees currently receiving  the top minimum pay -- employees covered by the contract would receive a 3% pay  increase the following year.  </P></p>

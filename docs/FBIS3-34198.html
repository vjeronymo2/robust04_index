Nixon says that the liberation of the governorate of Kuwait  was a serious turning point which changed and confused U.S.  plans, and exposed the false cover that gave the impression that  the world was stable and willing and ready to accept the U.S.  dream of leading the world. The liberation of the governorate  of Kuwait has disrupted the U.S. attempt to calmly colonize the  world without any fanfare. But, the Mother of Battles changed  the basic components on which criminal Bush had depended to  control the world. That's why Nixon describes the plan of  cursed Bush to establish a world order under U.S. leadership as  an idealistic dream that faced and was shattered by solid  reality.    This is the gist of what Nixon had admitted. All that we  have done is replace the spiteful words he used to describe  Iraq. Thus, Nixon joins the convoy of those who admit that the  Mother of Battles was the midwife which gave birth to the  factors of rejection and confrontation of U.S. colonialism, and  has exposed the U.S. impotence in quelling the people and  nations and controlling them.    When we used to say this before Nixon's book was published,  some would view what we said as some sort of exaggeration, or  unrealistic wishful thinking. But, here we have the strongest  U.S. President after Kennedy admitting that the Mother Battles  and Iraq's leader, Saddam Husayn, have changed the course of the  major big events in the world and steered them in a direction  that is opposite to that wished by criminal Bush. The era of  fierce resistance to U.S. colonialism has thus begun.</p>

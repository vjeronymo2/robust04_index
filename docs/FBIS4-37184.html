			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Imad Fawzi Shu'aybi: "An Open Letter to </F> Christopher: Seizing the Opportunity Before It Is Too Late and  Referring to al-Asad's Political Encyclopedia"]    [Text] It seems to me that the U.S. policy has not fallen  into such a great contradiction between its private interests  and personal dispositions on the one hand and its decisions,  measures, and political approach on the other, as it has with  Syria. This is clearly and blatantly apparent in the nature of  the U.S. approach to the Syrian track and the measures America  is taking regarding Syria.    We know that it was President Clinton's serious reading of  the State Department's reports that prompted him to hold the  Geneva summit and led him to say objectively that he had heard a  lot about President al-Asad. However, he was surprised to find  that reality was far richer than what was said or written, that  President al-Asad was surely a leader of peace, and that he  learned a lot from him. This seems to indicate that it was that  stand which subjected the United States of America, represented  by its president, to a major campaign from within. Prior to the  Geneva summit we warned that America and Syria would come under  enormous pressure. We showed the conflicts raging among the  U.S. establishments, primarily the Defense Department and the  decision-making organs, to break free of the cold war mentality  that predominates in the Pentagon and to counter the influence  of the Zionist lobby, which uses rumors to exert pressure.    Although Syria has succeeded in surviving this game and  understanding its dimensions, it seems that the U.S.  Administration was only able to curb the pressures on it by  taking two steps backward and turning Warren Christopher's visit  to the region into a mere postman's task.    Serious studies by U.S. political advisers at the highest  levels, like that conducted by Anthony Lake, the U.S.  President's adviser for national security, underline Syria's  importance. Lake emphasized the importance of reaching a  comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict,  particularly between Syria and Israel, in order to consolidate  the Israeli-Palestinian agreement and strengthen the moderates  in the Middle East. He said that Syria plays a crucial role in  the regional peace process and that its past alliance with Iran  and its support for (rejectionists) have given the powers of  (extremism) a vital foundation in the Middle East. [parentheses  as published] Washington, therefore, insists that peace should  be real, safe, and comprehensive.    Without going into an argument about what Lake terms  "extremism," we can say that the U.S. Administration has  realized Syria's importance. However, due to electoral  considerations, it has little influence in the face of Israeli  pressures. Hence, we address our words to U.S. Secretary  Christopher and to whom it may concern in the U.S.  Administration. You are favoring the direct over the indirect  [not further specified]. The U.S. secretary must refer to the  ABC's of politics to understand how to deal simultaneously with  Israel and Syria. If the sources of the State Department and  think tanks are incapable of giving the U.S. secretary true  advice in politics, we will provide these lessons:    1. The American and Israeli electoral game is approaching.  The keys to this game are in Damascus. Unless they hurry up  and make some progress with the peace process, President Clinton  in particular will be in trouble. Moreover, the [Israeli] Labor  Party will not find the necessary assets to run in the coming  elections. Syria alone can frustrate all that has been achieved  so far in the peace process. In other words, each side has only  six months to bolster its position if Syria's lawful demands in  the peace process are met.    2. To understand the Syrian policy fully, it should be  realized that it does not play around, that it is capable of  making its own choices, and that it can considerably upset the  balance of the negotiating powers with its rational silence and  relentless action. Nothing proves that better than the fact that  the Russian giant has found no other gateway but Syria to enter  the region, force itself on the world once again, and reshape  its new image at the NATO negotiations.    When this giant writes off 90 percent of the debts Syria  owes to the former Soviet Union and conducts several trips to  Syria--three visits in one and a half months--it is enough for  everyone to realize that Syria's weight is far greater than they  imagined.    Israel's unserious approach to its proposals, which makes  the  U.S. secretary of state no better than a postman, must end  quickly; otherwise the wasted time will not be in the interest  of the United States and Israel.    3. The U.S. secretary must carefully read his department's  files and specialized books about President al-Asad, because on  this depends the U.S. policy's ability to find sound measures to  facilitate the negotiating process so that no one, including the  United States itself, will miss the opportunity.    Hence, we say that Syria is not negotiating from a weak  position; it is known that President al-Asad does not negotiate  from weak positions. When he negotiates from a strong position,  he does not back down and he has the nerve and the political  strength to play out the negotiations down to the last quarter  hour. His briefing papers are not shown to anyone and he is  able to create unexpected situations and stands. When he is in  the right, he does not bargain; this is not a slogan for media  hype. It is a fact, the bitterness of which has been tasted by  many, such as the Israelis in several places, the Americans in  Lebanon, [former Lebanese army general] 'Awn in his political  vainglory--the list is endless.    Therefore, wasting time in what some imagine is a political  bazaar might undermine the entire peace process, because rights  are not subject to political haggling. Had al-Asad been the  type who engages in political haggling over rights, he would  have taken back the whole Golan over 20 years ago. But he  negotiates only what should be negotiated; this means that  President al-Asad does not negotiate over themes and substantive  issues, only over procedures. It also means that the frantic  political bazaar won't find attentive ears in Damascus except on  procedural details.    Hafiz al-Asad sells but doesn't buy, listens but doesn't  bargain. He doesn't buy the words of those who negotiate with  him, because what al-Asad has means he does not need what the  others might give. He fully realizes that time is on his side  and that Rabin's latest proposals are indicative of this because  it was Rabin who flinched first in this game of chicken. He  initiated the campaign, so he should stay until the end.  Al-Asad also realizes that stalling might--or rather will--turn  the tables on the others.    Al-Asad is willing to negotiate endlessly without  relinquishing his rights; and he knows pretty well that nothing  will happen in the region without his approval.    Peace is not merely a matter of trivial accords like those  some people have accepted. Peace in the region passes only  through Syria. All regional cooperation is geographically  dependent on Syria and every accord on water can only pass  through Syria. As for an agreement on nonproliferation of  weapons of mass destruction, its key lies in Damascus.    No matter how events shape up, everyone has to refer to  Syria  and to President al-Asad himself. Hence, any delay or  maneuvering will only benefit Syria. Perhaps it would be useful  for Mr. Christopher to refer to President al-Asad's biography to  realize who he is negotiating with.    He alone stands out among leaders of the Arab region and the  Third Word as one who constitutes a departure [mufaraqah] from  U.S. policy. He is rejected because he is an opposer, he is  acceptable because he is a skilled politician, he is  unacceptable because he does not agree with others' policies,  and he is acceptable because he is a man of politics not  adventures. He stands out alone among other leaders as being  both an adversary and an arbiter and also someone for whom they  are compelled to announce their respect.    Thus, in a clever and shrewd move, President al-Asad was  able to establish a political reference for his archenemies and  his fiercest foes. He is the only one who plays the game of  "political options," does not put all his eggs in one basket,  and does not give in to whatever the political circumstances  impose on him. He believes in creating options and forcing  static conditions to move by singing the same tune, but in a  tempo he himself dictates.    Turning your back on existing realities means presenting  your  back to others as a target, while accepting existing realities  means submitting to whatever happens so that you end up as  fertilizer for the history of others. Hafiz al-Asad was able to  recognize the existing realities, but he did not surrender to  them. He continued his efforts to make energize the static  conditions, and he has tried to use these fluid conditions to  promote his policies. Through their movement he was able to  seize suitable opportunities to rearrange matters and to change  these conditions.    No man has witnessed such great changes in his time as  President al-Asad has. He has been a man of war and a man of  peace; a man of the cold war and a man of the new world order.  The man soon adapted to the changing circumstances, planned his  policy carefully, and made himself felt on the world stage at a  time when everyone else was shaking their heads and accepting  whatever came their way.    He contends with bad circumstances, but is not overbearing.  He influences them, but is not influenced by them. Everyone  has recognized his shrewdness. Kissinger wished he could become  his foreign minister. On the eve of the departure of the  American forces from Lebanon in the mid-80's, a senior  correspondent said that the one who resides in the White House,  governs the biggest power in the world, but he cannot deter the  resident of al- Muhajirin, who governs a country with a small  population and few resources; he does not deserve his position,  for al-Asad's position is in the White House. James Baker  emerged from a diplomatic shuttle before the Madrid Conference  amazed at the Steel-nerved man he had met. Last but not least,  Clinton's remarks about al-Asad's capabilities, the need for him  to assume a basic leading role in the Middle East peace process,  and his recognition that Syria is the key to a solution was not  flattery. His remarks were in the nature of things, in view of  al-Asad's political importance. As the saying goes, what is  correct will ultimately make itself known.    President al-Asad is known to be a master in discriminating  between strategy and tactics. He is skillful in the only thing  that determines who is a professional and who is an amateur  politician-- the art of choosing the appropriate moment. He  knows how to ride the waves, and by the time the waves start to  recede he has already left the beach for good. He is a man of  nerves of the first degree. He takes the one with whom he is  negotiating to the bottom of the pit, and at the appropriate  moment he emerges with a secure position while the nerves of  everyone else have broken down. Therefore, everyone must  realize that they are negotiating with the eleventh- hour man,  who does not hasten anything nor beg for anything, but lets time  takes its course. He is persistent and is never tired of  details. He discusses in depth every minor or major point.  This man is now dealing with Rabin over the history of the  Labor Party and Labor Party's chances remaining in control of  the government. Realizing that everyone awaits his decision, he  is able to take from them what he did not take from others and  what they could not take from him. Therefore, Rabin will get  tired, but al-Asad will not.    What everyone who has an interest in peace must realize is  that President al-Asad will not be trapped by their schemes, for  he knows how to make hard choices and how to go to the brink of  danger then withdraw quietly, leaving everybody in wonder.  Accordingly, he has mastered the art of attack and retreat, and  combines political and military actions. When he senses the  dangers of direct military action he is the first, and perhaps  the last, to resort to indirect military action--or what is  known as acting by remote control--which enables him to exercise  military command in a unique and effective way. He does not  resort to outmoded methods of military action, for he supports  institutions and organizations that have national legitimacy and  rights recognized under international law. Thus, he wagers on  peace, but he does not rule out the chances of war. In the  welter of political negotiations, his military arsenal abounds  with extra resources that make war an extension of politics and  deterrence effective and a first-class negotiating card. He is  a cautious negotiator who arms himself quietly without indulging  in small-time showing off.    He will exhaust many people, who stand no chance of  obtaining  from him anything that he has not already made up his mind to  give. His negotiating skill features an enormous capability for  endurance and an ideological encyclopedia about rights  throughout history. It is also known that al-Asad links his  personal dignity to the national dignity. As precious as  personal and national dignity are in the East, the legacy of the  relationship with the land is equally rich. For Easterners in  general and Arabs in particular, land is honor. For al-Asad,  negotiations means "either all one's rights or nothing." Either  full rights or let the conflict continue for hundreds of years,  for history does not belong to one individual. Therefore, by  demanding all his rights he is defending history. He is a man  whose buttress, like the Great Wall of China, cannot be  penetrated. But if some people want to advance negotiations  with him, they have to come up with serious initiatives from the  start.    At any rate, it is no secret that he is agreeable to  obtaining full rights in stages, but only in installments that  suit him and that may not necessarily suit others. Accordingly,  President al- Asad accepts a timetable for withdrawal from the  Golan, but he does not accept a phased and unspecified  withdrawal. Thus, we can reiterate here that what is acceptable  regarding the Golan is "all or nothing." Therefore, if the  Israelis like to play for time, let them try it, and we promise  them a sure loss against President Hafiz al-Asad. Likewise, if  some Americans try to manipulate the two sides of the U.S.  Administration--meaning the State Department led by Warren  Christopher and President Clinton personally--they will lose and  put the future of U.S. relations in the region in great  jeopardy, for all the keys are in the hands of Damascus. It is  high time the Americans realized where their interests lie and  learned not to sacrifice them at the altars of old and inherited  policies that time has passed by.    Until the eleventh hour comes, we tell everybody: Seize the  opportunity before you start to pay for not grasping it.  Political reason dictates that you say a positive word in a  world that is changing. Syria is the gateway to the Middle  East. Syria has paid dearly for a policy that has lasted for 50  years, during which it has become the region's axis. Some  people have attempted to marginalize Syria's policy but they  lost, as did the region and the world. Thus, admitting Syria's  pivotal and premier weight in the entire Middle East is the only  key to lasting stability in the region. We believe that it is  high time that the U.S. Administration realizes that Israel's  weight cannot be equated with Syria's regional weight.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to 1986, TREET acquired the Note and the Deed of Trust from the Mercantile Fund. Commencing in 1986, that portion of TREET's assets which included the Note and Deed of Trust was managed by Goldman Sachs &amp; Company (Goldman) pursuant to an agreement with AT&amp;T under which Goldman managed debt investments of TREET.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective December 1, 1990, AT&amp;T commenced leasing from Crowe approximately 13,997 square feet in Southpark C pursuant to a written lease (the AT&amp;T Lease) providing for monthly rental of $6858.75 for a term of 36 months, through November 30, 1993. AT&amp;T represents that at the time the AT&amp;T Lease commenced, neither Karsten nor any other representative of TREET had any authority or control over the leasing of space in Southpark, and TREET's sole interest in Southpark at that time was as the holder of a security interest arising from TREET's ownership of the Note and the Deed of Trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. AT&amp;T represents that during the mid-1980's Crowe began to experience increasing difficulty in meeting its Loan payment obligations, due to depressed real estate conditions in the Austin market, and Crowe and TREET negotiated modified Loan payment terms in 1989, 1990 and 1991. These modifications related Crowe's Loan payment obligation to the level of cash flow generated by the Southpark buildings, and the parties agreed that unpaid accrued interest would be added to the Loan principal. As a result, however, the principal amount of the Loan became so large in relation to the value of the Southpark buildings that it appeared unlikely that Crowe would be able to receive any return on its equity after paying off the Loan. After it was evident that Crowe would eventually default on the Loan and that TREET would acquire Southpark by foreclosure, Goldman took steps to enable TREET to acquire title to Southpark prior to foreclosure, in order to exercise control over the buildings and to directly collect the rents. Crowe transferred title to Southpark to TREET through a deed in lieu of foreclosure (the Transfer Deed) executed on June 3, 1993. At that time, AT&amp;T remained a tenant in Southpark under the AT&amp;T Lease, occupying approximately 18 percent of the rentable space in Southpark. The term of the AT&amp;T Lease expired on November 30, 1993, but the lease continues on a month-to-month holdover basis (the Holdover Lease). AT&amp;T hopes to negotiate a new lease of office space in Southpark (the New Lease), under which it would occupy substantially less space in Southpark, constituting less than ten percent of the Southpark's leasable square footage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. At all times before TREET acquired Southpark, its interests in the Loan had been managed and advised by Goldman, whose responsibilities with respect to Trust assets were limited to the management of debt investments. Upon acquisition of title to Southpark through the Transfer Deed, TREET thereby acquired equity interests, which were not within the scope of Goldman's authority to manage under the terms of its appointment. Accordingly, Karsten, which was already providing investment management services with respect to other assets of TREET, was appointed by AT&amp;T to assume investment management responsibility on TREET's behalf for the Southpark buildings. With the addition of Southpark to TREET assets under its management, Karsten commenced to hold management responsibility with respect to more than twenty percent of the assets of TREET.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In order to secure representation of TREET's interests under the AT&amp;T Lease by a fiduciary which is sufficiently independent of AT&amp;T, Hill Partners, Inc. (Hill Partners) has been appointed to act as an independent fiduciary on behalf of TREET, effective December 1, 1993, with respect to AT&amp;T's lease of space in Southpark. Hill Partners is a Texas corporation engaged in commercial real estate development and management services, with its corporate headquarters in Austin, Texas. Hill Partners represents that it is unrelated to AT&amp;T and TREET, except for the provision of services as leasing agent for Southpark C, which it represents constitutes less than five percent of Hill Partners' total revenues for the past fiscal year. Hill Partners serves as a fiduciary under the Act, to represent TREET's interests for all purposes with respect to AT&amp;T's lease of Southpark space pursuant to the Holdover Lease and any New Lease or extension, renewal or renegotiation of the AT&amp;T Lease. Hill Partners is required to monitor AT&amp;T's performance of all obligations under any such lease, and to pursue appropriate remedies in the event of any default in performance of such obligations. Hill Partners' obligations include representing the interests of TREET in the negotiations with AT&amp;T over the New Lease, and in the oversight and enforcement of AT&amp;T's obligations under any New Lease which is consummated, including any renewal or extension thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hill Partners' role also includes certain determinations with respect to the period commencing June 3, 1993, to December 1, 1993 (the Interim Period), the date of Hill Partners' assumption of duties as independent fiduciary on behalf of TREET. Specifically, Hill Partners is obligated to assess and evaluate AT&amp;T's performance of its obligations under the AT&amp;T Lease during the Interim Period, and Karsten's representation of TREET's interests during the Interim Period with respect to the AT&amp;T Lease. Hill Partners represents that it has determined that during the Interim Period, AT&amp;T was in complete compliance with all terms and conditions of the AT&amp;T Lease. Hill Partners also represents that, based upon its review, it has determined that Karsten's representation of TREET's interests under the AT&amp;T Lease during the Interim Period was appropriate and adequately protective of the interests of TREET.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. With respect to the proposed New Lease, the negotiation of which has been conducted between AT&amp;T and Hill Partners, AT&amp;T proposes to lease 7,600 square feet in Southpark C for a term of three years, effective April 1, 1994. The proposed annual base rent per square foot is $6.00 for the first year, $6.60 for the second year, and $6.96 for the third year, and AT&amp;T is responsible for its pro rata share of expenses. The New Lease's three-year term may be extended for no more than one three-year renewal term at rent of no less than the prevailing market rental rate, by written notice to Hill Partners 180 days prior to expiration of the initial term, subject to Hill Partners' determination that such extension is in the best interests of the plans participating in TREET. Hill Partners confirms that it has represented TREET's interests in negotiating the proposed New Lease, that it approves of all the terms and conditions of the proposed New Lease, and that it would be in the best interests of TREET to execute the New Lease with AT&amp;T. Hill Partners states that it has determined that the rent required under the New Lease is not less than the fair market rent. Hill Partners states that in executing the New Lease, TREET will be retaining a substantial corporate tenant which has an excellent performance record and which constitutes a very high quality tenant. Hill Partners represents that all the terms of the proposed New Lease are at least as favorable to TREET as TREET could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (1) The interests of TREET with respect to TREET's lease of space in Southpark to AT&amp;T under the Holdover Lease and the proposed New Lease have been and will be represented by Hill Partners, serving as an independent fiduciary on behalf of TREET; (2) Hill Partners has determined that during the Interim Period, after TREET acquired Southpark and before Hill Partners' appointment as independent fiduciary, the interests of TREET were adequately protected and appropriately represented by Karsten; (3) Hill Partners approves of all terms of the proposed New Lease and AT&amp;T's continued tenancy in Southpark, and has determined that the rent required under the New Lease is not less than the fair market rent; (4) Under the proposed New Lease, AT&amp;T will reduce the amount of space it leases in Southpark to less than ten percent of Southpark's total leasable space; and (5) Any renewal of the New Lease will require the approval of Hill Partners and will require rent of no less than the fair market rent.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ronald Willett of the Department (202) 219&hyph;8881.

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Pentagon draws on Gulf war lessons IN the midst of a ferocious political debate over how to structure US defences after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US Defence Department has set out to build its answers on the lessons of the Gulf war. In a three-volume report to Congress totalling more than 1,300 pages, the Pentagon has analysed every aspect of the conduct of the war - from the performance of weapons systems to the treatment of prisoners of war, from political leadership in the inter-national arena to coalition command structures in the field. The 'Conduct of the Gulf War' report concludes that the decisive victory of the coalition forces over the Iraqi army is attributable in large measure to the extraordinary effectiveness of the air power deployed. It warns, however, that in future wars air power may not be so successful nor sustain such low casualties. It also argues that the ground offensive of Operation Desert Storm was essential in enabling the coalition to seize the initiative. The report also notes shortages of specific types of transport equipment and shortcomings in intelligence and reconnaissance, in targeting mobile missile launchers and in preparations for defence against biological warfare. Mr Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, has used the report to bolster some of the themes he has repeatedly laid out in his efforts to prevent an over-hasty draw-down of the US military establishment now that the Cold War is over. 'The Persian Gulf war reminds us that we cannot be sure when or where the next conflict will arise,' he writes in an introduction to the report. 'Our ability to predict events five, 10 or 15 years in the future is quite limited. But whatever occurs, we will need high-quality forces to deter aggression or, if necessary, to defend our interests.' Mr Cheney underlines his argument that it takes years to develop both the personnel and the military technology that contributed to the coalition victory. But he faces a hard task convincing Congress that his defence budget cannot be cut more quickly, while at the same time many congressmen will battle to preserve their local army and air force bases, national guard units and defence manufacturing programmes.</p>

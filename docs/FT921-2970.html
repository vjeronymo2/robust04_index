			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nippon Mortgage debt plan SUMITOMO Trust &amp; Banking, a leading Japanese trust bank, will assist in the restructuring of debt-laden Japanese non-bank financial institution Nippon Mortgage, starting on April 1, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Nippon Mortgage has debts of about Y630bn (Dollars 4.85bn) and is behind in interest payments on about 40 per cent of those, Sumitomo Trust said. The plan involves Nippon Mortgage paying back Y200bn to its creditors by selling Y430bn of assets, mainly in property and securities. It will also ask its creditors to delay loan repayment and reduce interest. There are 69 financial institutions which have extended loans to Nippon Mortgage. Sumitomo Trust, Nippon Mortgage's main creditor, now extends it loans worth Y110bn, The restructuring also calls for Sumitomo Trust to extend all necessary funds to Nippon Mortgage from April 1. The trust bank expects to lend about Y28bn in 1991-92. Sumitomo Trust will also send seven officials to Nippon Mortgage, of whom three will become directors after an extraordinary shareholders' meeting this month. Mr Hidemori Idenoshita, one of three former Sumitomo Trust officials already working at Nippon Mortgage, was appointed president on March 10. Nippon Mortgage mainly extends housing loans and loans guaranteed by real estate, but has no overseas operations. Japanese non-banks are financial institutions which offer loans but do not accept deposits. They rely on banks for over 80 per cent of their funds to finance their own lending, analysts said. Some Japanese non-bank financial institutions are facing a rough road after adventurous lending in the 1980s left them saddled with bad property loans and real estate firm bankruptcies.</p>

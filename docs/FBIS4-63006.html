			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Zorkin, leader of "Accord for </F> Russia" movement and former chairman of Russian Federation  Constitutional Court, by Zhanna Kasyanenko; place and date not  given: "Stop Lying to the People"]    [Text] Valeriy Zorkin, former chairman of the  Constitutional Court, was the first person to publicly proclaim  the unconstitutional nature of presidential edict No. 1400  literally a few hours after Yeltsin's televised address  [concerning the suspension of parliament and introduction of  special rule] That move cost him not only his post. He had  also to withstand threats, numerous attacks, press libel, and  unwarranted accusations by his propresidential colleagues on the  Constitutional Court itself. Now, six months later, this same  Valeriy Zorkin is the initiator and one of the leaders of the  "Accord for Russia" movement. What kind of accord does he have  in mind, and with whom? Is it possible in our country at all  today?    [Zorkin] I am very keen to ensure that nobody should confuse  concepts such as accord and appeasement. There is and can be no  accord between a criminal and his victim -- the person robbed  and the robber cannot agree, and still less is it possible to  agree on something with someone who has taken a life. Maybe my  interpretation of the evangelical formula "Whosoever shall smite  thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also" will strike  you as unusual, but in my view it applies only to those who did  this unintentionally, certainly not to an enemy or a criminal.  Does Russia's history itself not confirm this? When enemies  came, Russian people did not bow their heads before them but  fought. For there have been a number of critical moments in our  great history when we seemed to be approaching the very limit,  the very brink, but we won just the same! Let us ask this  question: Thanks to what? Thanks to the pooling of everyone's  efforts and the merging of the will of individual citizens into  the united will of the entire people -- in other words, thanks  to accord. This is the kind of accord I mean. It is not an  accord between a dispossessed people and the criminal power but  an agreement within the people themselves, a kind of citizens'  social charter. Its purpose is, on the basis of measures worked  out by the people, to move away from the abyss into which we are  all sliding.    [Kasyanenko] It seems to me that today we have already  gotten too far away from the line beyond which political and  directly related economic phenomena were still reversible....    [Zorkin] Despite the fact that I hate it when people bang  their fist or raise their voice, despite the fact that I am an  opponent of radicalism and, all the more so, of barricades, I am  forced to admit that without tough measures we cannot instill  order in the country today or tomorrow. Order is the first of  the conditions that are necessary to end the country's free fall  into the abyss. For it is impossible to watch the escalation of  crime, the collapse of industry, and the demise of agriculture.  In the space of two or three years we have almost halved meat  production and reduced the cattle population, simply butchered  it, including the pedigree, elite cattle. Is this not a  national disaster? Every ordinary peasant understands that it  will take more than one year to restore what has been lost. So  why does the government not understand it? We are told -- it is  because of the imperfection of economic relationships. But I  will start with something else -- because the authorities have  not ensured that elementary order of ties which it must maintain  and implement. These are the ties between city and countryside,  between producer and processor, and between suppliers.    [Kasyanenko] You quite frequently encounter facts like  these, for example: A producer is paid 150 rubles [R] for a  liter of milk, the dairy makes as much, if not more, out of this  liter, and [retail] trade makes more again. As a result, we buy  a liter of milk for R400-500 or more, the smallest proportion of  which goes to the one who worked for long months to produce it.  Here you cannot help thinking not just about our Russian  disorganization and muddle but about a well-organized disorder  which is advantageous to the authorities.    [Zorkin] Of course, nothing will come of the economy until  there is normal people's power free from corrupt officialdom,  which today has become a veritable national disaster. Order  presupposes the curbing of corruption in the power apparatuses  themselves. Power must serve not itself but the people and guard  and protect them. Otherwise the power becomes alienated from  the people, as we have been seeing for the past two years. We  must stop lying to the people and say openly what we have ended  up with. We have ended up with a criminal, corrupt, antipeople  state.    Therefore, accord for Russia is not an appeal to live  amicably in the spirit of Leopold's cat [reference to popular  cartoon character]; it must be the people's accord in a united  demand -- to restore the power's responsibility and capability  and, on this basis, to gamble on national priorities in  everything: in industry, in agriculture, in culture. For  Western aid represents fairy tales for children. Everyone  pursues his own interest. It is in the West's interests to turn  us into a colony, into a cheap raw materials market and a dump  for the world's production waste. We are already being turned  into a colony. All the signs are there. English is becoming the  second language in our country, and the dollar the dominant  currency. According to certain information, approximately $50  billion is circulating within the country. Those who either  work in commercial structures geared mainly to the West or who  serve the mafia live well in our country. All the rest are  plunging into poverty. Our national culture is being lost. A  certain cacophony of destruction reigns in the country.    And yet we have a very rich history and country and a  splendid people -- supersensitive and supersincere. We must  turn to the roots from which we grew and go our own way without  copying anyone. The peasant commune, for example, is a  primordial Russian institution. Is it not the linchpin of the  collectivism inherent in our people? Without it the Russian  person becomes a part of the crowd or an isolated grain of sand,  certainly not a constituent part of the people's original life.    Thus, in my view the main, basic principles must be order,  people's power, and national priorities in the economy and in  culture. We base accord on the principles which stem from  reason, from the people's soul. As you see, they are nonparty  principles and can be reduced to a single denominator -- the  principles of patriotism, enlightened patriotism, I would say.    [Kasyanenko] It is difficult to object to anything here.  They really are fine principles. But what about the mechanism  for realizing them?    [Zorkin] This mechanism aimed at changing the situation must  be systemic, since the crisis which has hit the country is  precisely of a systemic nature. It is impossible to change the  situation of the miners without changing the situation in the  whole country. It is impossible to help the peasant without  having resolved the problems of the energy complex or the  machine-building complex. Measures to surmount the crisis must  be based on the people's trust, and the people must be aware of  them and support them. "Accord for Russia" is not a contract  among a few people in Moscow nor their contract with the people.  Everyone must understand that he must not be a blind tool in  the hands of the authorities and that his passivity and  nonresistance merely deepen the abyss and open up the way for  those who wish to assert their radical course and impose their  aggressiveness on society. People today undoubtedly find it  hard to fathom out who is who, because the radicalism of the  mass media, particularly television, does not allow them to form  an objective opinion of what is happening. But there is the  Duma, which constitutes a certain cross section of society, and  there are the regions, whose interests are virtually identical.  On this basis it is necessary to strive for order and the  stabilization of the institutions of power and then carry out  those transformations in the economy which will benefit the  people and Russia.    [Kasyanenko] Do you believe that the president, the  government, and the power structures will agree to -- or will  permit -- a change of course?    [Zorkin] The ideal, of course, would be to hear confession  and a statement that a wrong, antipeople course was chosen and  that they are prepared to change it, to heed the people's  opinion, and to act in the future only for the good of Russia.  This would mean pulling back from the abyss in a peaceful,  bloodless, and civilized manner.    We can see on the basis of our own experience that  transformations should not be entrusted to one person without a  team vested with the people's trust. The present collective  Rasputin can be countered today only by some capable organ, call  it what you like -- collective president, state council, etc.  Naturally, it must be headed by a leader, but he is obliged to  accede to power not with domestic servants but with a team of  authoritative people representing the main political spectrum of  society. This is the only way to achieve accord. Collective  leadership does not mean evading responsibility but creating a  mechanism which enables us to unite various movements and  parties in a single congregational organism responsible for its  actions not to foreign experts but to the motherland and the  people. One person cannot assume the responsibility of deciding  for the whole people, as is done in our practice and as was the  case with the Belovezhskaya Forest troika, for example.    [Kasyanenko] Valeriy Dmitriyevich, certain so-called  "democratic" mass media constantly run the topic of the  president's health, and in this connection, for some reason,  frequently on the same page, they discuss the question of his  possible successors, early elections, etc. I have even read  that your involvement with the "Accord for Russia" movement  marks the start of your election campaign.    [Zorkin] Let such allegations remain on the conscience of  those who make them. In general, this represents one more  attempt to brand the opposition and those people who really want  to do something for the motherland. I personally cannot imagine  myself as president, and I am dubious about the way aspirants in  general are appearing. When the roof of a building is on fire,  it is suicidal to think about which chair it is best to sit in.  Both the chair and the person sitting in it will burn. For me  the question of who will fulfill a package of measures blessed  and supported by the people is secondary. The chief thing is  that it should be fulfilled.    [Kasyanenko] The initiators of the "Accord for Russia"  movement were leaders of the opposition and of the patriotic  forces, very different people who were interesting in their own  way but who had hitherto acted separately. What helped you to  unite?    [Zorkin] Life and destiny. Theoretically, this should have  been done considerably earlier. Then, maybe, what we have now  would not have happened. I believe that life, in the end, will  make not only the opposition unite but also the former union  republics. For we were like a single living organism which  found itself destroyed. As a result, everyone acquired very  similar problems. Why should everyone resolve them on his own  and keep to his own segment when this can be done more  successfully by uniting on terms acceptable to all? Any  division or disunity is always the result of someone's  arrogance, whatever reasons are used to cover this up. The  sooner this is understood in Russia and in other republics, the  better it will be for everyone.    [Kasyanenko] In conclusion, Valeriy Dmitriyevich, please  tell our readers what connections you have with the countryside.    [Zorkin] I believe that there are very few Russian people  whose roots are not connected somehow with the land. My own  grandmother, mother, and other relatives used to live in a  village in Tambov Oblast. I attended my first three classes in  a rural school. They were the hard postwar years. The  countryside fed us with goosefoot, rotten potatoes, and black  bread, but it did not let us die. But there was war,  devastation, and general grief then. I very much want us not to  end up with no awareness of our past and not to forget about our  roots and the land which nurtured us.</p>

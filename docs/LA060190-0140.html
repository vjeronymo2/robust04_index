			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUVENILE HALL RESTRAINTS TRIAL ENDING;  </P> <P> YOUTH RIGHTS: PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS CHARGED THAT YOUTHS WERE TIED TO BEDS UNDER A  "SIEGE MENTALITY" AT THE HALL. THE JUDGE SAID SHE WOULD RULE IN TWO WEEKS.  </P> <P> Lawyers in a class-action suit over Juvenile Hall conditions argued in court  Thursday that a county policy of tying youths to their beds during emergency  confrontations is a product of the operators' "siege mentality" and should be  eliminated.  </P> <P> "It's the staff making exaggerated demands for submission to authority," said  Mark I. Soler, the lead attorney representing past and present Juvenile Hall  inmates. "They are not trained to realize they are only escalating the  tension."  </P> <P> The elimination of the tie-down policy and so-called "rubber rooms" for problem  youths at Juvenile Hall have been the two main issues before Superior Court  Judge Linda H. McLaughlin during the five-week, non-jury trial, which is  winding down.  </P> <P> County Chief Probation Officer Michael A. Schumacher announced during the  proceedings that Juvenile Hall officials had decided on their own to replace  the standard 10-foot cloth restraints with padded, leather handcuffs such as  those used by the California Youth Authority.  </P> <P> The inmates' lawyers, who had argued that the cloth strips tightened and cut  off circulation, hailed the decision but said it wasn't enough. Under the  present policy, Schumacher's staff is still allowed to tie a youth to his or  her bed.  </P> <P> Soler, of the Youth Law Center, and lawyers from the American Civil Liberties  Union want no tie-downs. But if the judge decides to permit them, the  plaintiffs want tie-down orders to come only from medical or mental health  personnel -- not Juvenile Hall duty officers as the policy now allows.  </P> <P> "The only real difference is, instead of tying the kids to their beds, now they  chain them," said ACLU attorney Dick Herman outside the courtroom.  </P> <P> But Judge McLaughlin repeatedly questioned both sides during closing arguments  Thursday. And she pointed out to Soler that emergencies do occur.  </P> <P> "How do you propose to address the clear emergency?" the judge asked, noting  that there was some evidence presented at the trial that simply placing leather  handcuffs on a youth causing a disturbance might not be adequate.  </P> <P> Soler answered that it was acceptable to physically restrain a youth. But if  tie-downs are permitted, he said, it should come only on a temporary order from  a nurse until a doctor can be consulted.  </P> <P> "What we object to is tying the youth to a fixed object (such as a bed)," Soler  said, adding: "The damage comes from the psychological trauma of being tied  down like that."  </P> <P> The county's attorney in the lawsuit, David G. Epstein, argued that the  physical damage that an out-of-control youth can cause should be weighed  against whatever physical or psychological damage might result from being tied  down.  </P> <P> But the judge virtually reprimanded him when he argued that the evidence showed  that the physical injuries from the sheet tie-downs amounted to no more than  discoloration of a youth's wrists.  </P> <P> "I should hope NOT!" the judge cut in. She added that discoloration alone was  enough to make it disturbing, particularly in testimony that one youth's wrists  had actually turned black.  </P> <P> "Just because some didn't get gangrene or a limb cut off doesn't mean that it's  not serious," the judge said.  </P> <P> But Epstein argued that in rare cases, the tie-down was the only method that  could control a youth.  </P> <P> "We don't want these decisions made lightly," Epstein said. "But when all else  fails, we need to have this resource available."  </P> <P> Regarding the rubber rooms -- empty padded cells -- the plaintiffs want them  eliminated. But short of elimination, they want them used only on orders from  mental health personnel. Currently, a shift operator can order a youth placed  in a rubber room.  </P> <P> The ACLU initiated the lawsuit three years ago, claiming a variety of offenses  at Juvenile Hall. Basically, Soler argued to the court Thursday, the staff has  maintained an attitude of demanding obedience from youths detained there.  </P> <P> "Our clients are not angels, nor are they monsters," Soler said. "They are  children who are quite troubled. When they feel like they have been treated  unfairly, they are going to fight back, even when they know they can't win."  </P> <P> Schumacher has defended the Juvenile Hall's operation, calling it a "first-rate  facility."  </P></p>

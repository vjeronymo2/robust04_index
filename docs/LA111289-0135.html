			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> REPORT LINKS HUD PROJECT, D'AMATO  </P> <P> Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) urged former Housing Secretary Samuel R.  Pierce Jr. to approve a multimillion-dollar grant for a renovation project  operated in part by two of the senator's supporters, the New York Times  reported. In a March 15, 1984, letter, D'Amato asked Pierce to use "deliberate  speed" in approving the 65-unit Buffalo project, which was approved within two  months, the newspaper said. The letter appears to contradict the senator's  repeated assertions that he never asked HUD officials to approve specific  moderate-rehabilitation projects, the Times said.  </P></p>

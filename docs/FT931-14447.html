			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / New foreign minister named in Rao reshuffle INDIA'S Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao yesterday appointed a new minister to take charge of foreign affairs. The appointment was part of Mr Rao's wide-ranging ministerial reshuffle designed to bolster his authority in the wake of the Ayodhya crisis. Mr Dinesh Singh will join the cabinet as external affairs minister, taking a portfolio previously held by Mr Rao himself. He is one of four new ministers; the others include Mr Pranab Mukherjee, new commerce minister, who will strengthen the team responsible for the government's economic reform programme. The reshuffle was seen in Delhi last night as a successful bid by Mr Rao to boost his influence in the cabinet. But the new men were not expected to bring any immediate significant change in the government's popularity as a whole, nor in its ability to deal effectively with the crisis caused by the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque and the ensuing violence. Mr Dinesh, 77, is a veteran of the governing Congress (I) party who first served as a minister in 1962. His appointment will bring into the cabinet a representative from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. It is here that the Congress party is in need of reinforcement, having lost ground to the Hindu militant Bharatiya Janata party, whose supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque. Mr Mukherjee, 57, is moving to the Commerce Ministry from being deputy chairman of the government's Planning Commission. He replaces Mr P Chidambaram, who resigned over the Bombay security market scandal. Mr Mukherjee, a former journalist, has served before in the cabinet, including being finance minister in the early 1980s. The two other new cabinet members are Mr A K Antony, minister for civil supplies, and Mr N K Salve, energy minister. In Bombay, businessmen struggled to bring offices and factories back to normal working after the violence that left more than 600 dead and paralysed the city for nearly two weeks, writes R C Murthy. In the city's port, dockers struggled to clear a large backlog and make room for ships waiting in the harbour. The Indian Merchants' Chamber, a leading business body, says the city has lost Rs15bn (Pounds 339m) in industrial production. The worst-hit industry is leather, because many workshops are operated by Moslems, who were the chief victims of the attacks of Hindu-led mobs. Production is concentrated in Dharavi, India's largest slum, where scores of businesses were burned and workers have fled. Mr H R Mallick, vice-chairman of the Leather Export Promotion Council, said it would take months for work to return to normal. The city's jewellery and gemstone polishing industries were also badly hit because workers were unable to reach factories. An international exhibition, due to be held this week by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council was postponed. Mr K R Subramaniam, a former president of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, expressed confidence that investment decisions would not be affected in the long run. Britain is pressing ahead with plans for Prime Minister John Major to visit Bombay while on a trip to India next week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, June 1 (AFP) -- The Ukrainian Parliament began  a debate Wednesday [1 June] on whether to appeal for a court  ruling on Crimea's adoption of a secessionist constitution.    A resolution examined by lawmakers called for the  establishment of a new Ukrainian Constitutional Court that would  be asked to render a judgment on the matter.    The parliament of Crimea voted last month to restore a 1992  constitution that allows for a Crimean citizenship, treaty  relations with Kiev and the establishment of a separate militia  force.    The Ukrainian parliament said the move amounted to a  declaration of independence and gave the local legislature 10  days to reverse its decision.    In Wednesday's resolution, the parliament recognized that  Crimea had not changed its position and reiterated that it still  considered the adoption of the secessionist constitution to be  illegal.    The debate over Crimea's drive for secession came as Ukraine  prepared for key presidential elections on June 26, which  President Leonid Kravchuk was expected to lose and is trying to  postpone.    Ukrainian and Crimean delegations met in Kiev following last  month's parliamentary decision and agreed that they would not  take any additional measures to exacerbate tensions.    Kiev moved about 20 armored personnel carriers in the main  Crimean city of Simferopol in the days following the  parliamentary vote but there has been no violence in the region.</p>

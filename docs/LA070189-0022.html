			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHICAGO ART TRUSTEES CURB 'DISRUPTIVE' STUDENT WORKS  </P> <P> Trustees of a Chicago art school where two recent exhibits -- including one of  a U.S. flag on the floor -- caused heated protests have issued strict new  guidelines allowing for removal of disruptive student artworks.  </P> <P> Under the guidelines, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago can "relocate  or remove" any exhibit that may violate the law or be "hazardous to the health  and or safety of viewers or participants."  </P> <P> The guidelines, formulated by a committee of students, teachers and  administrators, also give the school the authority to determine "when, if, how  long and where" students' art will be shown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Relocate Displays  </P> <P> Displays that "may be disruptive to the educational process" can be relocated  or removed, say the rules, released Thursday.  </P> <P> Marshall Field IV, president of the board of trustees, spelled out the new  policy in a letter to board members.  </P> <P> A long debate in arriving at the guidelines shows "the extreme difficulty of  balancing personal freedom of expression in an educational environment with  responsibilities to . . . community concerns and public sensitivities," Field  wrote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Site of Protests  </P> <P> The Art Institute has been the site of protests within the last two years over  two student exhibits -- one that included an American flag on the floor where  it could be walked on and the other a painting of the late Mayor Harold  Washington in women's undergarments.  </P> <P> State Sen. Walter W. Dudycz, a Republican who led protests against the flag  exhibit, praised the guidelines as an attempt to treat controversial student  exhibits equally.  </P> <P> But Harvey Grossman, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in  Illinois, said the guideline governing health and safety hazards is  "particularly vague and could result in chilling and inhibiting student  creativity and expression."  </P></p>

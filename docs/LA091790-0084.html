			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE FIRMS GIVE MEDICAID BREAKS ON DRUG PRICES;  </P> <P> PHARMACEUTICALS: DISCOUNTS TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE GOVERNMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM  COULD BOOST SALES. THEY MAY ALSO INVITE PRESSURE FOR PRICE CUTS FROM PRIVATE  CUSTOMERS.  </P> <P> California Medi-Cal patients with high cholesterol now have easier access to a  widely known but expensive cholesterol-lowering drug.  </P> <P> Mevacor was added to the list of drugs that doctors can prescribe for Medi-Cal  patients without prior authorization because its manufacturer, Merck &amp; Co.,  was willing to bargain with the state to lower the price.  </P> <P> In a reversal of past practices, drug companies have recently started offering  discounts to Medicaid, the federal/state health insurance program for the poor  known in California as Medi-Cal. They say they are motivated to provide rich  and poor with the same access to brand-name drugs. But they are also clearly  acting under the threat that the federal government will make them bid for  Medicaid work -- in effect, forcing discounting.  </P> <P> The new approach may carry unintended risks for the companies. Some analysts  say it may increase pressure for more drug discounts from public and private  customers. By emphasizing discounts, these analysts say, the drug companies are  also inviting probing questions about how drugs are priced in general.  </P> <P> Nor does the strategy seem to be deterring those in Congress who want to find  ways to cut deeper into the burgeoning cost of Medicaid.  </P> <P> Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) has introduced a bill that would force drug companies  to bid for Medicaid business in an effort to help cut 1991 Medicaid expenses by  $300 million.  </P> <P> States, which share the cost of Medicaid, are also looking for ways to lower  their prescription drug expenses, said Bob Hodgsen, an analyst with  Boston-based Cowen &amp; Co. "There is a lot of momentum at the state level.  There is a realization that cost containment is going to be applied to drugs,"  he added.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, analysts say, Medicaid discounts will not cost manufacturers much  and will likely expand their Medicaid market.  </P> <P> Rahway, N.J.-based Merck, the world's largest manufacturer, has signed about 20  agreements with states since it said in May that its Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme  unit would offer discounts for Medicaid prescriptions. The company said it will  save Medicaid programs more than $20 million a year.  </P> <P> California, which spent a half-billion dollars on Medi-Cal prescriptions last  year, signed its third discount contract last week -- with Chicago-based G. D.  Searle &amp; Co. Maryland has just signed an agreement with Kalamazoo,  Mich-based Upjohn Co. that provides a standard $1.35 rebate on all Medicaid  prescriptions.  </P> <P> In agreeing to discounts, companies are asking states to lift restrictions on  all their drugs, potentially increasing their overall sales to Medicaid. About  19 states have devised Medicaid formularies -- lists of drugs that may be  prescribed without prior approval -- that tend to eliminate many expensive  brand-name drugs. In order to prescribe a drug not on the list, a doctor  generally has to provide written proof that only that brand will suffice.  </P> <P> California did not agree to blanket acceptance of all Merck drugs, said Jim  Parks, chief of the Medi-Cal drug-discount program. "We tell people up front  that we will not agree to any drug sight-unseen," he said. California agreed  that if Merck gets Food and Drug Administration approval of a new drug, the  state will give it "some special consideration," expediting the process for  adding it to the Medi-Cal formulary, he explained.  </P> <P> In the Searle agreement, Medi-Cal agreed to add four Searle drugs to its  formulary. They include Calan SR (180-milligram tablets) and Kerlone, both for  the treatment of hypertension; Demulen, an oral contraceptive, and Cytotec,  which is prescribed for patients who are at high risk for ulcers, particularly  those taking aspirin-type medication for problems such as arthritis.  </P> <P> State officials say their discount contracts contain provisions barring them  from disclosing the amount of the discounts. Without the Searle discounts, a  standard Calan prescription would cost $36.60, Cytotec $54.28, Kerlone $54.32  (for 10-milligram tablets), and Demulen $17.23. The regular Mevacor price is  close to $20 for a month's supply.  </P> <P> The Medi-Cal formulary is based on five factors, including "essential need,"  effectiveness and cost, Parks said. Now that the state has the ability to  negotiate drug prices, "cost will take a less important role," he said.  </P> <P> Maryland does not have a restricted list of Medicaid drugs, but that may  change, said Nelson Sabatini, deputy director of the Maryland Department of  Health and Mental Hygiene. Upjohn has given notice that its rebate deal is off  if the state develops a restrictive formulary, he said.  </P> <P> Sabatini says the discount programs are very positive, but the department  believes that the state needs to establish other criteria that consider both  the cost and therapeutic value of drugs to ensure that Medicaid patients are  getting cost-effective care.  </P> <P> "The drug companies are arguing that if we do (restrict some of their drugs),  that the discount deal is off. We will continue to develop a therapeutic  formulary, and if I find I save money that way, I will do it," he said.  </P> <P> "We are trying to force some price competition in this business," he added.  "There is tremendous competition toward getting doctors to write prescriptions.  But it is not competition that will benefit consumers."  </P> <P> David F. Saks, a New York-based analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, says  offering Medicaid discounts carries risk to drug companies, despite the  possible advantage of increasing sales in a market that is now about 10% of the  prescription drug business. For one, he said, "this issue has unearthed a whole  question about how drugs are priced." Such questions may just increase pressure  to discount, he said.  </P> <P> Merck's share price dropped when it first announced its program because Wall  Street perceived that the door had been opened to more discounting and thus a  squeeze on profits, Saks said.  </P> <P> Less attention had been given to the fact that drug companies have for years  offered discounts to such large customers as the Department of Veterans Affairs  and the Department of Defense -- and discounts to private customers in the form  of lots of free samples and rebates based on volume. Saks said he doesn't  believe that the drug companies' initiatives on Medicaid will stop  government-mandated discounting. "It just adds more fuel to the fire," he said.  </P> <P> Private health care concerns are also pressing for more specific discounts,  said William R. Boyles, publisher of Health Market Survey, a Washington-based  trade publication focusing on health maintenance organizations.  </P> <P> "HMOs and insurers all consider drugs third in line behind hospital and  physician charges for cost containment," he said.  </P> <P> The magnitude of discounting is unclear, but HMOs have obtained "extensive free  samples, which amounts to a discount," Boyles said. Drug companies have tried  to get by with so-called value-added items such as free pens, pads and  seminars, he said. But more and more, HMOs are bringing the discussion back to  bottom-line prices, he said.  </P> <P> A relatively small percentage of HMOs have their own pharmacies, but those that  do "consider discounts the only reason to talk to a pharmaceuticals firm . . .  I'm pleased to see the turn of events on Medicaid," Boyles said. "Drug  companies have overcharged for years."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE FLEXIBLE PRICE OF DRUGS  </P> <P> The pricing of drugs is a mystery to people outside the industry. Drug  manufacturers acknowlege providing discounts to certain large customers. But  many discount contracts contain clauses prohibiting disclosure of the terms.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:4.42IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE>

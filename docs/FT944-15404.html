			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Walker to leave Lloyds for Morgan Stanley post: Deputy chairman was expected to take over as head of UK bank Sir David Walker, the deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank who was widely expected to take over as chairman, is to leave to join the US investment bank Morgan Stanley. Sir David's decision means that Lloyds, the most consistently profitable British bank, must select both a new chairman and a new chief executive within two and a half years. Sir David, who is 54, is to become executive chairman of Morgan Stanley in Europe. He said that he had expected his role at Lloyds to be 'more executive than is the case', and he was attracted by the idea of a 'wholly executive and more than full-time job' when approached by Morgan Stanley. The move could allow Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, to succeed Sir Robin Ibbs as chairman. Sir Robin is due to retire in two years when he is 70. However, it would be the first time a Lloyds chief executive has become chairman. The post has traditionally been filled from outside. Another candidate to succeed Sir Robin may be Sir Richard Greenbury, the 57-year-old chairman of Marks and Spencer, who is a non-executive director of Lloyds. Sir David, a former director of the Bank of England and chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, was thought likely to become chairman rapidly when he joined Lloyds in 1992, but Sir Robin has stayed longer than expected. Sir David said that Sir Robin was 'hale and hearty, and good for another two and half years'. He did not expect there to be 'any problem at all' in finding a chairman to succeed him in what was 'a superbly managed organisation'. The main uncertainty over management succession at Lloyds concerns Sir Brian, who is due to step down as chief executive at the end of 1996 after his term was extended earlier this year. Sir Brian has no obvious internal successor. Lloyds emphasised yesterday that it had two years to make decisions on management succession. One director said that there was 'no rush' for the board to choose successors, and that no decision on either post was imminent. Lloyds emerged as the most profitable of the 'big four' clearing banks in the late 1980s. It is trying to take over Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society for Pounds 1.8bn as part of its effort to expand retail banking. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, said that Sir David, who will be a member of the firm's New York board, would bring both 'a wealth of experience' and 'extensive relationships with key figures'. Morgan Stanley has grown rapidly in Europe in the past two years and generated Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 790m) of revenues there last year. Some directors expect it to double its European business within the next two or three years. Observer, Page 23 Why Walker has changed horses, Page 26</p>

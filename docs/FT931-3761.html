			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / The Long View: Closing escape hatches THIS IS a time for the vision thing. Alas, we are unlikely to get much of this scarce commodity in Norman Lamont's Budget statement next Tuesday, but it is important to turn aside from the narrow focus on occasional greenish shoots of recovery and instead take, to coin a phrase, the long view. Serious errors of domestic economic policy have plagued us but the most important influence is exogenous. As the vast potential of China is being unleashed upon the global traded goods market, with 1 bn people willing to work for Dollars 1 an hour, several hundred million more are entering the global economy in Eastern Europe. It is not just a question of cheap Russian fish, which seems to be the latest point of friction: the point is that the market value of low-skilled labour in Britain is tumbling generally. There appears to be acceptance of this, albeit reluctant; in my district this week, bus drivers confronted with a pay cut of some 10 per cent did not even obey a one-day strike call. For Lamont the serious budgetary consequences include a reducing tax take and rising benefit costs. These structural problems cannot be cured in the short term by any conceivable economic growth rate. So the government's responsibility is not to engineer some kind of economic miracle, but rather to establish a stable financial framework and to attempt to reconcile people to the real world. And while the labour market crisis is painful it does present important opportunities. The immediate budgetary challenge is that the government will have to finance large deficits for several years ahead. There is a feeling that they might not be quite so large as pessimists have been fearing, and the public sector borrowing requirement to be posted for 1993-94 may be nearer Pounds 40bn than Pounds 50bn. The chancellor may have a tactical opportunity to please the markets. But in any event it will be a huge figure. Luckily we are starting from the base of a relatively low debt burden of about 40 per cent of GDP and, although massive deficits could raise that to perhaps 60 per cent in about four years, the burden would be no more than in the early 1980s. But the cost of borrowing will prove increasingly important. Fortuitously, the global bull market in bonds has helped to drag the cost of issuing long-dated British government securities down from over 9 per cent to about 8 1/4 per cent. But the official central expectation of inflation, on the basis of the 1-to-4 per cent target range, is only 2 1/2 per cent. Is the government seriously prepared to fund at a real rate of nearly 6 per cent? The big deficits of the 1970s were financed at a zero real rate. There is profound disbelief among professional investors: the inflation rate implied by the real interest rate on index-linked gilts is still 4.8 per cent. Norman Lamont cannot deliver an economic miracle next Tuesday, but he could attempt the humbler task of undermining these inflation assumptions. How? Well, the reason for the City's cynicism, besides bitter past experience, is that the government is still clinging to inflationary escape hatches: the modest debt-financed recovery in consumer spending in January has been officially welcomed, and there are still dreams of a new wave of mortgage lending at cheap rates that might raise house prices and bail out busted borrowers and shaky lenders alike. The underlying reality, however, is a collapse in earnings growth that is cutting real incomes and is making a house price recovery impossible. This should above all be a Budget for cutting interest rates, long as well as short. The obvious comparison is with Geoffrey Howe's notorious tax-raising 1981 Budget to which 365 Keynesian economists laid unavailing siege (some are still camped outside the gates). But there are big differences. Howe had to contend with a much higher inflation rate of 12 1/2 per cent, but at the same time there was a balance of payments surplus so the country was able to borrow and consume its way out of recession. This time around we must invest and produce towards recovery. These are technicalities, but short-term rates must go down in order to steepen the yield curve, especially between one and five years, and thus to increase the relative appeal of longer-term government paper. This in any case will need to happen if the so-called full funding rule is relaxed with the objective of financing part of the Budget deficit through the banking system. But sterling in these circumstances would be vulnerable, and in the past, most recently in 1988, uncontrolled credit surges triggered by low interest rates have proved highly inflationary. This is the right moment, therefore, to tackle the short-termism of the housing market. Tax relief on mortgage interest should be withdrawn except in respect of loans on which the interest rate is fixed for at least five years. Efforts should also be initiated to redirect small business finance through new longer-term institutions rather than the banks, which no longer want most of this business anyway. Such measures would alleviate fears of inflation because they would tend to reduce the growth of the broad money supply. Moreover the politically-sensitive interest rate paid by home owners would become linked to the long-term one rather than the short-term money market rate. Readers would demand that the sterling long bond yield should be listed on the FT's front page. To keep mortgage rates low the government would need to follow prudent, non-inflationary policies. Signs of irresponsibility would send up rates and tend to produce weakness in the housing market, whereas at present imprudence is often associated with lower short-term rates and therefore with political popularity. Just supposing you were a Downing Street visionary, even higher taxes could have their good side.</p>

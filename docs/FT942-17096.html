			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Brussels threat on Macedonia embargo The European Commission yesterday gave Greece an ultimatum to lift its trade embargo against the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia within seven days or face legal action in the European Court of Justice, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. The decision in principle to go to the court was combined with a plea to Greece and Macedonia to resume efforts to resolve the dispute over Macedonia's constitution and flag. Athens claims that both amount to territorial claims on the northern Greek province of Macedonia. The Commission said that the trade embargo breaches Greece's obligations under the Treaty of Rome, particularly in the area of a common commercial policy, internal market and customs union.</p>

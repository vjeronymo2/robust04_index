			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DISGRACED HONECKER WILL HAVE TO QUIT LUXURY HOME BY FEBRUARY  </P> <P> Disgraced former East German leader Erich Honecker will have to leave his  luxury home by February so that it can be turned into a center for the  handicapped, a government spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the secluded country compound at Wandlitz, where  Communist bosses used to live in luxury, will be turned into a 400-bed  rehabilitation center.  </P> <P> Asked if the ailing Honecker, 77, and other former top Communist Party members  now under house arrest will be evicted from the Wandlitz compound north of  Berlin, Meyer said he assumed that "all will move out by February."  </P> <P> Meyer told a news conference that the government is considering the creation of  an "inquiry department" to examine allegations of fraud, corruption and abuse  of office by former leaders. Honecker, who is reported to be very depressed, is  among those accused and is expected to stand trial.  </P></p>

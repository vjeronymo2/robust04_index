			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miroslav Caplovic: "Slovakia's Heading Toward </F> NATO"]    [Text] For four decades, in which the Soviet Union  dictated in the Warsaw Pact the policy of fraternal cohesion,  the United States was struggling to bring down communism. It is  precisely for this reason that the postcommunist states expect  the U.S. struggle for democracy to lead them among the countries  of the Western world and why it is naive to expect Moscow to  renounce its interests in its erstwhile empire. After all, even  the colonizers of America, Africa, and Asia have retained to  this day indirect influence in their lost dominions.    Slovakia's and its neighbors' heading toward NATO will  therefore be more than arduous. If the Americans sincerely  strive for "Slovakia to be a democratic, stable, and prosperous  state on the map of Europe" (statement made by Deputy Secretary  of State Strobe Talbott in Bratislava the day before yesterday),  they will have to offer us "something extra" besides Partnership  for Peace--that is, they should not confine their assistance to  cooperation in science and education but must raise the level of  investment and make accessible to us the U.S. and West European  markets. It is an unalterable fact that, the more the West is  involved in Slovakia economically, the more it will care about  our security.    Moreover, the West European orientation of Slovak diplomacy  has been complicated by the division of the CSFR. A gigantic  amount of German capital is flowing into the Czech Republic, and  Bonn will therefore undoubtedly give priority to Prague's  admission into the European Union [EU] over the Polish,  Hungarian, or Slovak applications (although no one speaks about  it in public, this is absolutely logical from the geopolitical  viewpoint). Brussels will certainly not support the EU's  expansion up to the borders of Ukraine, where nuclear weapons  are still located. Is the anxiety that the  Warsaw-Bratislava-Budapest axis might become a security vacuum  not justified?    Eduard Kukan, the chief of Slovak diplomacy, said in an  interview for yesterday's RUDE PRAVO that "the best foreign  policy is good and well-considered domestic policy." An  occasional "state show" is an integral part of it. While  receiving Talbott, President Michal Kovac reissued his  invitation to Bill Clinton to attend the 50th anniversary of the  Slovak National Uprising. We may not appreciate this  sufficiently at home, but the August uprising went down in  history as a nationwide and grandiose expression of antifascist  resistance, in which few other nations can take pride. Will our  politicians be able to make use of their foreign contacts so  that prominent Western leaders come to Banska Bystrica this  summer?    A month later, the burden will lie on voters, lest we turn  our existing policy line toward Vladimir Volfovich  [Zhirinovskiy] and send a Pan-Slavic greeting to him....</p>

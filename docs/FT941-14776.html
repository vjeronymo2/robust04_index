			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Financial watchdog is unruffled The board of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new watchdog for retail financial services, yesterday underlined its determination to press ahead with the corporate governance plans that last week prompted one of its directors to resign. After a meeting at which it discussed the planned budget for its first year, the board also appeared likely to retain the systems of existing bodies for deciding what membership fees organisations should pay, instead of creating a new basis for calculating subscriptions. Estimates of the first-year costs are around Pounds 30m. This would suggest higher subscription fees than those paid to existing regulators. The PIA took the opportunity of announcing the appointment of two more public interest directors, Sir John Bailey and Sir Terry Heiser. This confirms that the 19-strong board will contain only nine people currently practising within the industry, as had been planned. It was this decision that led to the resignation from the proposed authority of Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, and the statement from Standard Life that it withdrew its support from the PIA and would favour statutory regulation. Sir John Bailey, a former Treasury solicitor, is a director of Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life assurance industry. He chairs the inquiry into the auditing of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Sir Terry Heiser, a former permanent secretary of the environment department, holds a number of non-executive directorships, including Abbey National and Smith New Court. Two more public interest directors have still to be recruited. Yesterday's meeting also agreed proposals on monitoring, enforcement and acceptance by the new regulator, which is due to come into force around the middle of the year. The board will meet next week to discuss a draft of the PIA prospectus. The prospectus, to be published next month, must be approved by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, in order for the PIA to be recognised as a regulator.

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel chairman dies suddenly aged 50 Mr Nigel Openshaw, chairman of McLeod Russel Holdings, died suddenly on Thursday aged 50. An accountant, he joined the board in September 1981. By 1987 he was group managing director and by 1988 chairman. He engineered McLeod's metamorphosis from a plantations group to its current position as a holding company with interests in surface coatings, air filtration, environmental engineering and property investment. This was initially achieved in 1987 when the group sold 80 per cent of its Indian tea interests and when Kennedy Smale, a glove manufacturer and machinery distributor, took over McLeod in an agreed Pounds 51.5m merger. At a board meeting yesterday Mr James Leek was appointed chairman. He has been a non-executive director since May 1992. Mr Paul Humphreys, finance director, said Mr Leek would be spending an increasing amount of time with McLeod, and that the move had been made so quickly to ensure continuity for the group. Mr Leek is already chairman of Amberley Group, the USM-traded building preservation company, and a director of Caparo Industries, the steel products and engineering group. On Tuesday, McLeod announced a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 5.16m) in the year to September 30.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 4 Feb (MTI) -- Hungarian Parliament will  elect the secretary and four members of the National Election  Committee (NEC) within the next ten days.    Under Hungarian electoral law, the minister of the Interior  proposes candidates for the positions, and Parliament then votes  on whether to approve the nominees. Every party with candidates  on the national list will then appoint one member each to  membership in the NEC, which must have at least nine members.    Sometime in March, the parties will be able to collect their  candidate nomination slips. (The exact date is to be determined  later.) Recommendations from at least 750 people must be  collected to enter a candidate in the elections.    Candidates in the individual constituencies and those on the  national and territorial lists of the parties should be  registered at least 30 days ahead of the election date, which  today was set for Sunday, May 8, by the president of the  republic.    Under the terms of the electoral law, the country's 11,000  constituencies should be created within ten days after February  4. Each constituency must have at least 600, but no more than  1,200 voters.    The law stipulates that there must be at least one voting  station in every town and village. The election campaign will  last until midnight, May 6. A campaign ban will be in force  from then until the end of the voting. The last day when public  opinion poll results related to the elections are permitted to  be published is 8 days prior to the elections.</p>

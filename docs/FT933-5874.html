			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Green thoughts and trade policy IT IS unlikely that the people who share this planet will ever agree about which parts of the environment they want to preserve. The question is how countries should go about settling disputes that arise from their differing environmental standards. Countries accuse others of causing them environmental harm in many different ways. Most directly, pollution may spill across national borders. Manufacturers in developed countries may also claim that laxer regulation in developing countries allows companies located there to enjoy lower production costs. Countries may also damage common environmental 'goods' by polluting the world's atmosphere and oceans. Or there may be perceived harm, arising for example when one country's treatment of certain animals is judged offensive by another. Such accusations have tended to be hurled by developed countries at developing ones. Too often, the complaints are accompanied by threats of trade restrictions. Some argue that the environmental damage is due to economic growth, and that trade is bad because it stimulates growth still further. Others claim that 'ecological dumping' occurs when exporters are able to benefit from an environmentally permissive policy regime and call for protection in response. Some may simply seize on trade as the easiest available tool for enforcing their views. These arguments are often propounded by environmentalists, who have tended to see multilateral trade negotiations such as GATT and Nafta as threats to environmental standards. Comparative advantage Trade policy is generally the wrong response. For a start, poverty is an important cause of environmental degradation, and trade can offer an escape from poverty. Growth and affluence also increase the political demand for a better environment. Furthermore, specialisation on the basis of comparative advantage reduces many forms of pollution. One reason for this is that industrial countries have a comparative advantage in some of the most polluting industries, which are usually capital intensive, but also possess the best anti-pollution technology. Claims of unfair competition are easily abused by protectionist interests. What is more, it is dangerous to behave as if every policy difference between countries represents some kind of subsidy. At the limit all policy differences between countries would have to be eliminated. Hypocrisy Developing countries are also right to detect an element of hypocrisy in the demands of the richer ones that they clean up, since the latter gave scant regard to keeping the environment clean during their own industrialisation. Moreover, the largest output of greenhouse gases - arguably, the most important global threat - still comes from developed countries. That is not to say that pollution is an inescapable by-product of industrialisation - some forms of pollution can be avoided at little cost, examples being land and groundwater contamination. But, as a starting point, the choice of standards should lie with the individual country. Rather than entangling trade with environment policy, rich countries should offer compensation when seeking to impose environmental policies poorer ones do not share. Rio, which secured international agreement on measures to avoid global warming and protect the diversity of animal and plant life, recognised this principle in giving its backing to the Global Environment Facility run jointly by the World Bank and the United Nations. The fund, set up in 1990, plans to make up to Dollars 4bn available for funding projects in developing countries projects over the next three years. Similarly, the 1987 Montreal Protocol on protecting the ozone layer of the atmosphere is backed by a Dollars 200m fund to help developing countries meet its terms. That approach is controversial, with respect both to raising the money and disbursing it, as both these funds have shown. But at least it makes the price of the bargain explicit, and forces the people of developed countries to face up to the question of whether they really want to pay it.

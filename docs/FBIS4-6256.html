			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang-visiting  group of former heads of state and government and politicians of  different countries led by ex-president of Costa Rica Rodrigo  Carazo Odio staying in Korea visited the West Sea barrage Friday.    The barrage with a 8 km dam across a rough sea tens of  metres  deep was built by soldier builders in a matter of 5 years.    The head of the visiting-group had this to say:    "The West Sea barrage is a monumental edifice for the  prosperity of the country and the welfare of the people.    "The excellent monumental creation can be built only when  wise guidance, mass strength and technical wisdom are combined.  I think it is very beneficial for visitors to Korea to see this  monument. It is because the only people who aspire after peace,  progress and prosperity can create such a great and magnificent  monument. It is a creation which serves peace and the promotion  of people's living."    He expressed thanks to the government and people of Korea  who  have built the excellent monument showing the massive will and  strength and leadership as a whole. Executive Director of the  Summit Council for World Peace Antonio Betancourt wrote in  visitor's book that the barrage is a great creation showing the  ardent love of the Korean people for their leader, their country  and future.    On the same day, the visiting group was ushered to the  recreation ground on Mt. Taesong, where the group spent a  pleasant time of rest with working people in Pyongyang enjoying  the April holiday.</p>

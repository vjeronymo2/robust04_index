			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Bowater When a company is de-rated as sharply as Bowater has been over the past few months, the suspicion is that something sinister is at work. But in Bowater's case, it may reflect little more than fashion. After being the belle of the packaging ball throughout the recession due to its defensive charms, Bowater is now looking less modish in recovery. The turn of the investment cycle has resulted in more volatile second-line stocks picking up speed at Bowater's expense. At its peak, Bowater accounted for some 35 per cent of the sector's value. That has now slid to 23 per cent. Although earnings' forecasts for Bowater have remained largely unchanged, some concerns about its strategic thrust have surfaced. The past two years have seen a whirlwind of corporate activity, with Bowater spending Pounds 844m on acquisitions and issuing Pounds 630m of new equity. The management - and the market - have been striving to make sense of this reshuffled pack of assets. The task has been complicated by some of its new businesses in cosmetics and medical packaging running into the brunt of recession in mainland Europe. It has also proved hard to lift volumes and prices in the UK, ensuring lacklustre growth in underlying organic earnings. Supermarkets are squeezing food packaging prices hard and the photographic market remains tough. With gearing at the year-end likely to be just under 50 per cent and the market still awash with Bowater paper, Bowater has little option but to make the best of what it has got. At least its US and Australian operations are showing more bounce.</p>

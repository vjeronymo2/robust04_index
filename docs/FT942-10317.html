			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Observer: Futile exercise Among the more arcane absurdities of British law is a power granted to Customs and Excise prosecutors to overturn court decisions and spring from jail anyone convicted of a Customs offence, no matter how long the sentence or serious the offence. Given by Parliament in 1979, it's apparently intended to enable a convicted criminal to be a witness in other countries. This power was probed yesterday at the Scott inquiry by Lord Justice Scott. Customs chairman Valerie Strachan agreed it was 'totally amazing'. So unusual, that even the Customs Commissioners were initially astonished to find they had been given it, she averred. Lord Scott, dig deeper. What else have they got up their sleeves?</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Call for new rules on car boot sales The government should crack down on car boot sales, the Consumers' Association said yesterday. A report in its Which? magazine said it should be illegal for a trader to operate at non-commercial car boot sales. It said commercial events should be classed as markets and organisers required to register them with a local authority. Which? said new rules were needed to ensure that consumers' rights could be enforced when they bought shoddy goods.</p>

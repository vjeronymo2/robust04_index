			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Andonovski: "Athens' Last `Trump'"] </F>   [Text] Andreas Papandreou has once again shown that he can  surprise us, but unfortunately, this time it was an unpleasant  surprise. The resolution of the Greek Government that put a  stop to the Greek Consulate's activities in Skopje and blocked  the trade of goods from the port of Salonika has certainly  indicated that after assuming, more or less, the role of  observer the past few months, Greece decided this was the proper  time to flex its muscles -- by using the only trumps it has  against Macedonia. Of course, we here exclude the possibility  of a military threat (after closing the border and withdrawing  the diplomats, practically the only thing that can follow is a  proclamation of war) and, at least for now, nobody even thinks  this is in Papandreou's bag of surprises. Greece has embarked  on a course of either losing it all or getting it all, evidently  figuring it will get it "all," which can be interpreted as  "accomplishing a change in the flag and correction of the  Constitution."    To Macedonia's constant efforts to reach out, Athens replied  in a manner totally inconsistent with the proclaimed stance that  "Greece is interested in having a stable and independent country  on its northern border." It is also inconsistent with the norms  of interstate relations.    It is impossible to believe that Papandreou has ignored the  fact that he is undertaking such an action during Greece's  tenure of the chairmanship the European Union, with all the  attendant consequences and blights to its reputation, which will  be even more affected now. It is also improbable that Papandreou  has not taken into account the statement made by German  Spokesman Vogel, who said after the first Greek threats that  Greece could not close the border with Macedonia because it was  not its own but that of the European Union.    Why did Athens, in the middle of this seemingly unfavorable  situation for itself, decide to take this step? There are only  two possible explanations. It is either a desperate attempt on  the part of the insulted, who had expected some concessions on  the eve of U.S. recognition, or Papandreou knows a lot!    Let us imagine a hypothetical situation in which, for  instance, Macedonia and Greece are prepared, or have agreed, to  make a barter agreement: Greece will "get" the flag and the  correction of the Constitution by adopting the minority rights  article from their constitution; in return, Macedonia will be  recognized by the United States and Greece will not veto its  admission to the CSCE. If that is correct, then Papandreou's  move can be seen as a kind of blackmail of the Macedonian  Government, pressuring it to fulfill its part in the disputed  questions without previous negotiations.    And there is more to it. Right or wrong, Athens considers  itself outwitted by Macedonia and President Gligorov, whom they  consider to be the personification of Macedonian policy. Is  this not a "thug's" reply by the unpredictable head of the Greek  government, who is giving the ball back to Gligorov when the  latter's hands are practically tied with the closure of the  border, even if he wanted to make a "gesture of good will." If  he does not relent -- the problem will remain, with greater  shame and degradation for Greece's reputation in the eyes of the  international public. If Gligorov relents -- he himself will be  accused of surrendering to Greek pressure, which could engender  unpredictable internal political complications. All this  written down on paper may look like yet another example of the  Balkan inclination to overanalyze things, however, taking into  consideration the twists in the dispute thus far, it is not  unlikely that Papandreou will try to absolve himself, preparing  a "trap for Gligorov" at the same time. If we read the  essential part of his statement, we once again see the same  hypocrisy as usual. Papandreou said: "So far, Skopje has made  absolutely no effort to demonstrate its wisdom and moderation,"  which is a blatant lie. To begin with, Macedonia uses every  possible opportunity to call for discussions on "all outstanding  questions." Macedonia continually reiterates its readiness to  sign an agreement on respecting borders, friendship,  goodneighborly relations, and cooperation....    Has Athens officially asked itself how it looks when someone  is constantly demanding something, without an expression of good  will or the offer of anything in return. We have yet to note a  Greek gesture of rapprochement.    It would be difficult to minimize the closing of the  borders,  but it shouldn't be exaggerated, either. We say -- closing of  the border, not -- "a halt to the trade of goods from the Port  of Salonika" (as Papandreou whimsically referred to it, avoiding  the unpopular phrase), because that is essentially what has been  going on since yesterday. If the Greek Consulate is closed down  there are no visas, and if there are no visas, nobody can cross  the border. If trade is not allowed from Salonika, it means that  fuel and all trade from Greece will dry out. Nevertheless, on  the other hand, one should not overestimate the effect because  it would appear that Macedonia has enough fuel reserves right  now.    To its constant efforts to reach out to its southern  neighbor, Macedonia has experienced a truly incredible reply,  outside the realm of good behavior....</p>

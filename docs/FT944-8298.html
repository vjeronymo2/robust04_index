			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Zarella - GM's ray of hope In its efforts to rebuild its battered US auto business, General Motors has turned to a man who knows a lot about contact lenses and sunglasses, writes Richard Waters. In a rare move, the car and truck-maker last week turned outside to pick a new head of marketing for its core north American operations. Ronald Zarella had been the number two executive at Bausch &amp; Lomb, manufacturer of trendy Ray-Ban sunglasses. Jack Smith, GM's chief executive, says the automaker was drawn to Zarella by his 'enormous multifunctional experience and global brand-building expertise'. Despite the overblown rhetoric, this may not be far from the mark: Zarella, 45, has an engineering degree as well as an MBA, and spent the early part of his career in engineering and manufacturing jobs. That is no bad thing, given that in future he will have to negotiate with GM engineers over the specifications of new vehicles for the US market. The brand-building came in Bausch &amp; Lomb's international division, whose sales jumped from Dollars 140m to Dollars 850m in the five years under Zarella's control. GM will hope he can rustle up the same magic for its own products, which include venerable but hardly trend-setting names like Chevrolet, Cadillac and Oldsmobile; it has lost ground to family sedans like Ford's Taurus and sport-utility vehicles like Chrysler's Jeep. Zarella says his job involves 'better defining customer segments', then creating and selling products for each. Sounds easy? For GM, whose share of the US market has slipped to 33.2 per cent, it has proved anything but.</p>

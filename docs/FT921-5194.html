			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Technology: Retail sales tracked down The UK government faces private-sector competition in the tricky area of finding out about ups and downs in retail sales - an important part of the economy which accounts for a quarter of total UK output. A computerised system for gathering the data on a weekly basis has been launched by the British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the industry, in an effort to improve on the monthly sales data published by the government's Central Statistical Office. A more up-to-date assessment of trends in this sector would be invaluable in tracking the overall direction of the economy. It could also help the Treasury to improve on its poor record in recent years in economic forecasts  -the latest of which are being released in next Tuesday's Budget. The trade body says it is not making the data public, however, until it is confident they give a true picture of trends in the industry. It also wants to iron out what it says are technical difficulties involving the computers in the system. However, the consortium may ultimately release the data to anyone interested, possibly charging a fee. The consortium's scheme covers roughly half the Pounds 150bn-a-year retail sector - patterns in which provide a useful guide to overall activity, particularly at the consumer level. Many of Britain's biggest retailers are among the 31 companies participating in the initiative. They include Dixons, J. Sainsbury, Boots, Burton and Marks &amp; Spencer. The scheme is the most ambitious effort yet by a private-sector group to improve on knowledge of economic trends by pulling together retailing information on a weekly basis. Private-sector schemes already exist for collecting weekly sales data for the clothing and food sectors. In both cases, the information is largely kept for the internal use of the companies involved. The initiative by the British Retail Consortium follows an inquiry launched last year by Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Concerned that the CSO's data on retail sales might be failing to indicate short-term trends in the economy which might point to a recovery from the continuing deep recession, Lamont asked the CSO to consider its own weekly analysis. Once it became clear that the private-sector scheme was going ahead, the CSO decided against launching its own weekly analysis, arguing that the government would be able to borrow the data. The scheme has been operating on a pilot level for about three months and involves managers from each of the 31 retailers recording at the end of each week the value of takings over the previous seven days. They also analyse how these takings compare with the value in the equivalent week last year. Both sets of information are sent to staff at a London office of Touche Ross, the accountants, who are working on the scheme on behalf of the consortium. Touche Ross collates the figures using computers, to provide a combined sales picture for all 31 companies, and a view of how sales have changed year on year. The data related to the overall market are then returned to the participating companies. To preserve commercial confidences, none of the companies are allowed to see sales data related to individual rivals. Companies involved in the scheme say that so far it is progressing well, and that the information being derived from the system should complement the monthly sales information from the CSO.</p>

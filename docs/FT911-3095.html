			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / GPT and Siemens launch switchboard joint venture SIEMENS, the German electronics group, and GPT, the largest UK telecommunications manufacturer, have agreed to merge their British distribution companies for computerised switchboards. The joint venture will have a turnover of Pounds 170m and employ 2,000 people. It is intended to be a stronger force in the UK market with the ability to cater to the needs of multinational customers. Siemens, which owns 40 per cent of GPT, stressed that it was not taking greater control of the company. There has been speculation since Siemens and the UK's General Electric Company jointly acquired Plessey in 1989 that the German group would gradually come to dominate GPT, a former GEC/Plessey joint venture. However, Siemens said: 'This is not the next step in Siemens taking a greater share in GPT. Whatever happens in that direction is in the hands of Lord Weinstock (GEC's managing director).' The two companies being merged are GPT Sales and Service, which has turnover of Pounds 130m and employs 1,600 people, and Siemens Communications Systems, formerly known as Norton, which has a turnover of Pounds 40m and employs 450 people. The merger is conditional on the approval of the Office of Fair Trading. Following the merger, Siemens and GEC will each indirectly own 50 per cent of the venture, to be known as GPT Communications Systems. Siemens will own 17 per cent of the venture directly with the remainder coming through its 40 per cent stake of GPT. Mr Bryan Meade, a senior GPT executive, will be chairman, and Mr Peter Zaboji, a former Siemens executive, will be managing director. GPT and Siemens will appoint equal numbers of directors to the company's board. The venture will be financially consolidated into GPT, which will own 83 per cent. GPT Communications Systems will have between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the market for distributing private auotmatic branch exchanges (PABXs). The other major players in the market are British Telecom and Mercury Communications, both of which are important outlets for GPT's products. The joint venture relates only to distribution, with manufacturing continuing to be the responsibility of GPT.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / BAA backs new airline at Gatwick BAA, the airports operator, and British Aerospace are backing a proposal by an Italian airline entrepreneur to start a European scheduled airline based at London's Gatwick airport. The new airline, Debonair, plans to operate up to seven jets from Gatwick to European destinations including Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Berlin, Rome, Milan, Madrid, and Barcelona. The airline is being set up by Mr Franco Mancassola, a former senior executive with Continental Airlines and World Airways of the US, who has 30 years' experience in the international airline industry. Mr Mancassola said yesterday he had already raised Pounds 6.5m of the Pounds 13m equity finance for his new airline and planned to launch Gatwick scheduled services next autumn. BAA supports the venture because it has the potential to fill the gap left at Gatwick by the collapse of Air Europe and the demise of Dan-Air, which has been absorbed by British Airways. Mr Allan Munds, Gatwick airport's managing director, said passenger traffic on European scheduled routes from Gatwick had fallen from 5.5m-3.5m in the past three years. With BA dominating short-haul European scheduled airline services from Gatwick, Mr Munds said many long-haul airlines using the airport were keen to see a new airline offering European services from Gatwick. The government's liberalisation of London air traffic rules has encouraged many international airlines to switch services from Gatwick to Heathrow, which has become overcrowded. Both BAA and the international carriers using Gatwick see a new entrant as creating greater competition and choice at Gatwick. The new airline plans to start services in September using four BAe 146 regional jets leased from British Aerospace. Mr Mancassola plans to increase the fleet to seven by the summer of 1995. Mr Robin Southwell, of BAe's asset management organisation, said the UK manufacturer was backing the new venture and proposing to lease the first four aircraft for a total of Dollars 500,000 a month. Apart from daily scheduled services to European business cities, the new airline plans weekend services to leisure centres including Nice and Venice.</p>

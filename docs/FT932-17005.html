			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Route into Europe is on the cards - Unigate and its interests in continental expansion WHEN MR Ross Buckland became chief executive of Unigate two-and-a-half years ago, the sprawling group was described by one observer as 'a business which, if it didn't exist, nobody would have wanted to invent.' From its dairy industry roots, Unigate had spread into areas as varied as trade exhibitions, US fast-food restaurants, car auctions, road freight and large-scale poultry breeding. The supposed logic for this diversification - a balanced earnings portfolio  -was belied by an increasingly dismal profits performance. Mr Buckland, an Australian who formerly headed the European operations of Kellogg, the US breakfast cereals company, has worked hard to give a more coherent shape to the group. Declaring food and distribution to be its core businesses, he has set about shedding operations which were performing poorly or had limited potential for development. The loss-plagued JP Wood chicken subsidiary was acquired by Hillsdown Holdings for Pounds 30m last year. Unigate's unprofitable contract car hire business is being wound down, its US cheese unit has been sold, and its American restaurant chain is being prepared for possible flotation on the US stock market this summer. Further disposals are likely, Mr Buckland says. Meanwhile, Unigate has hit the acquisition trail. A Pounds 17m bid for some of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk businesses in January was followed by a Pounds 50.4m friendly offer for Clifford Foods, a Berkshire-based dairy and juice company, and the Pounds 54m purchase of Glass Glover, which operates warehouses and distribution for large UK retailers. This flurry of activity has yet to produce a convincing improvement in pre-tax profits, which fell slightly in the first half of this year. Nonetheless, the stock market seems to believe a corner of some sort has been turned. After sliding steeply last summer, Unigate's share price has rebounded since the autumn. The Co-op and Clifford deals are expected to boost Unigate's profits in the next couple of years by enabling it to use dairy capacity more efficiently. The Glass Glover purchase, while generously priced, will broaden Unigate's distribution franchise with big supermarket groups by adding warehouse contracts. It is much less clear, though, that Unigate has yet found a formula for sustained longer-term growth. Though its distribution arm is regarded as efficient and well-managed, warehouse management is a relatively mature business which offers limited opportunities for scale economies. The recent expansion of Unigate's liquid milk operations - which the group spent the 1980s trying to de-emphasise - looks to most observers like a defensive attempt to secure competitive position in a business which is a handy source of cash. UK liquid milk consumption has been declining steadily by a percentage point a year, while doorstep deliveries are losing sales to supermarkets at a considerably faster rate. Though Mr Buckland expects these trends to stabilise in the next few years, he concedes that the profits outlook for liquid milk is hardly electrifying. So where will the growth come from? Mr Buckland says part of the answer lies in moving Unigate's food-processing operations into higher value-added areas. He points to the recent expansion of dairy desserts output and the Pounds 15m invested in the past three years to double capacity and produce more cooked meats at its Malton bacon factory, which has won back market share from imports. However, profits on these operations fell in the first half due to recession, higher pig prices and increased marketing costs. Meanwhile, St Ivel Gold, which pioneered the market for low-fat spreads and is the company's biggest brand, has seen its sales stagnate and faces fierce price competition. Unigate's recent performance in yoghurt, another main product line, has also been undistinguished. Since the late 1980s Muller, a small German dairy company, has captured almost 20 per cent of the UK market by offering an innovative range of yoghurts at premium prices. Muller is now the 26th largest UK supermarket brand, well ahead of St Ivel Shape yoghurt. Asked why Unigate allowed itself to be trounced on its home ground, Mr Buckland throws up his hands and exclaims: 'Mea culpa] All of us in the UK failed to make the right judgement. Muller was fundamentally not seen as a threat by established yogurt producers. The consumer saw things differently and said, l like Muller's products.' Unigate is now making yogurts intended to match the German company's range. Recently, Mr Buckland's horizons have begun to extend beyond the UK to continental Europe. An important objective in re-shaping the dairy and distribution businesses, he says, has been to build a domestic base solid enough to support the risks inherent in overseas expansion. He says Unigate is interested in pursuing continental joint ventures or acquisitions of more than Pounds 50m. He sees particularly good opportunities in private-label manufacturing, which he thinks is set to grow rapidly as food retailers in Europe become steadily more powerful. He would fund acquisitions by making further disposals, if necessary, to avoid the need for a rights issue or a further increase in Unigate's gearing, which stands at about 60 per cent. One possible route to the continent lies through Nutricia, a Dutch babyfood and clinical nutrition company of which Unigate owns a third. Unigate, which acquired its original stake when it sold its Cow &amp; Gate division to Nutricia in 1981, purchased further shares last year. Mr Buckland, who sits on Nutricia's board, says relations with the Dutch company have grown much closer recently, and both sides are interested in strengthening their links further. Could an eventual full takeover of Nutricia - which has a stock market valuation of more than Pounds 400m - be on the cards? Mr Buckland's answer is intriguingly equivocal. Unigate would never consider a hostile bid, which could in any case be easily frustrated under Dutch takeover rules. However, he also says: 'The relationship has not been static. Don't be surprised if it doesn't remain static for the next 18 months.'</p>

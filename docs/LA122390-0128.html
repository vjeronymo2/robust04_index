			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: MISCELLANY  </P> <P> A TAC panel hearing the appeal of shotputter Randy Barnes' drug suspension  adjourned without reaching a finding.  </P> <P> The panel, meeting in Washington, could not reach a decision because it was  waiting for documents to review. A decision in the case is expected next week.  Barnes, the world record-holder in the shotput, was suspended by the  International Amateur Athletic Federation for two years on Nov. 6 after testing  positive for an anabolic steroid at a meet in Sweden last August.  </P></p>

"I am grateful to all North Ossetian electors who supported  my candidature at the Russian presidential elections. The new  Russian parliament will have to work hard in the name of  economic revival of the country and its indivisibility. My  hopes are pinned on the new Russian constitution approved by the  people," he said.    Speaking of the North Ossetian presidential elections  scheduled for January 16, Dzasokhov noted the supreme official  should personify the spirit of accord and well-wishing in the  multi- national republic. Any social-economic policy can be  successful only on this basis.    "I would wish the future North Ossetian president to be more  active in solution of personnel issues and combine experience  and youth. When introducing the presidency in Northern Ossetia,  we should clearly decide on our foreign and domestic policy,  development of the social sphere and perfection of inter-ethnic  relations," added Dzasokhov.</p>

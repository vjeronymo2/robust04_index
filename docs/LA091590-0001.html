			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO TOLL ROAD PLAN AMONG FOUR OKD BY STATE;  </P> <P> HIGHWAYS: 10-MILE ROUTE THROUGH SOUTH BAY AREA WOULD BUILD RT. 125 TO OTAY MESA  BORDER CROSSING.  </P> <P> Nudging the state a step closer to an era of toll roads, Gov. George Deukmejian  on Friday unveiled plans to allow entrepreneurs to build $2.5 billion worth of  private expressways around the state, including a 10-mile toll road in southern  San Diego County leading to the new border crossing.  </P> <P> The San Diego project was one of four selected in an unprecedented competition  to see who could best plan, finance, construct and operate their own private  transportation projects before turning them over to the state.  </P> <P> Other winners in the transportation competition included consortiums planning  to build two toll roads in Orange County, and a third group that wants to  construct a toll road in the fast-growing suburban counties east of Oakland.  </P> <P> The winning San Diego project would take the proposed California 125 south of  the Sweetwater Reservoir, near California 54, to the new international border  crossing on Otay Mesa. The 10-mile, four-lane toll road would run through some  of the most desirable land slated for development in the South Bay.  </P> <P> "It's desert with scrub brush now," said Bruce E. Podwal, president of  California Transporation Ventures, the business consortium that proposed the  toll road. "The developers have all said they would all donate the property  (for the road) and contribute toward the project."  </P> <P> Podwal said the developers that would benefit from the project include EastLake  Development, which already has donated land for a year-round Olympic training  center now under construction by the Lower Otay Lake. Other beneficiaries would  include San Miguel Partners, McMillan properties and the Baldwin Co., which  submitted an unsuccessful toll road proposal of its own for the same route. All  own land in the area that would be served by the toll road, Podwal said.  </P> <P> State transportation officials said Friday that the proposed route would  accommodate plans for an international airport near the border. Podwal said the  $400-million road project is scheduled for completion in December 1995 and  would cost commuters about $1 to use.  </P> <P> Deukmejian hailed the winners as part of a "historic public-private  partnership" that would give congestion-weary commuters an alternative to  traditional freeways. Tolls on the new roads are expected to range from 10 to  20 cents a mile.  </P> <P> "While privatizing roads is not something totally new in the country,  California's approach, I believe, is unique," Deukmejian said, trying to make a  distinction from East Coast toll roads. "Rather than dictating which projects  should be bid upon, we allowed the private sector the flexibility to go out and  determine the projects that would best serve the public."  </P> <P> Other winning projects announced Friday:  </P> <P> An 11.2-mile, $700-million elevated expressway to run through the middle of the  Santa Ana River flood plain in Orange County. The four-lane tollway would link  Interstate 5 near Anaheim Stadium with California 73 near the John Wayne-Orange  County Airport. Completion date: 1997.  </P> <P> A 10-mile, $88.3 million toll road along California 91 from Anaheim to the San  Bernardino County line. Completion date: 1994.  </P> <P> In Northern California, a $1.2-billion, 40-mile toll road stretching from Sunol  in Alameda County on the south to Antioch, on the edge of Contra Costa County.  The toll road would be the first phase of a proposed 85-mile arc through a  fast-growing suburban corridor that stretches from Oakland to Sacramento.  Completion: 1997.  </P> <P> Passed over by the state was a proposal to rebuild San Francisco's Embarcadero  Freeway, damaged in the Oct. 17 earthquake, and two Low Angeles-area entries  that included plans for a high-speed, high-tech train from Los Angeles  International Airport to Palmdale.  </P> <P> Caltrans Director Robert K. Best also said that "there are a lot of economic  incentives" for large landowners near the proposed toll roads to cooperate with  the projects. He added that he hadn't realized before Friday that the winning  proposals were in heavily Republican areas.  </P> <P> But the coincidence didn't escape Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who said  the department's selection of the winning bidders showed "a  pro-development-at-all-cost attitude. It's a Caltrans giveaway to Republican  supporters."  </P> <P> Although still facing local environmental review, those private builders  announced Friday now have the legal authority to begin negotiating details with  the state. Political opposition to stop them would be an uphill fight.  </P> <P> One of the big winners was Texas computer magnate H. Ross Perot, whose  consortium proposed the Santa Ana River project. James E. Erickson, an attorney  for the Perot group, said Friday that the consortium now plans to ask  Disneyland, Anaheim Stadium, large office towers and South Coast Plaza Shopping  Center to chip in.  </P> <P> "We're going to tell them, 'If you want to get an off-ramp into your parking  lot, there's some value here. . . . We may be able to put an off-ramp to your  parking lot. Do you want to pay for it?' " he said.  </P> <P> The idea of toll roads, common for a time during California's Gold Rush days,  has made a comeback in recent years because of increased congestion and a  shortage of highway funds.  </P> <P> Two years ago, the Legislature gave grudging approval for three locally  controlled toll roads to be built in southern Orange County. And, last year,  Deukmejian won the right to take toll roads statewide in exchange for his  support for the 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase, approved by voters in  June.  </P> <P> Best said Friday that toll road projects will receive no state or federal  funding. Although the state could assist by condemning property, he said the  winning proposals are planned for existing public right-of-way or are in favor  with neighboring landowners.  </P> <P> Once completed, the toll roads will be deeded over to the state but then leased  back to their builders, who will have the right to charge tolls for the next 35  years. Tolls will be set to guarantee a reasonable rate of return and can only  be changed with state approval, said Best.  </P> <P> Asked if the state would bail out any private project that goes broke,  Deukmejian quipped, "We'll let the next governor worry about that."  </P></p>

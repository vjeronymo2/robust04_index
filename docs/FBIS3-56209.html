			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the </F> Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, by Nadezhda Garifullina in  Moscow; date not given; carried under the general heading "`We  Have a Chance. Let's Fight!'"]    [Text] "In someone's pocket," "unfit for work" -- all  kinds of descriptions, mainly unflattering, were being applied,  long before the session, to the lower chamber of the new  parliament, for which politicians and political scientists are  not predicting a long life. What do the deputies themselves  think? In the break I approached Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of  the "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] bloc. It was a  mystery to me why Grigoriy Alekseyevich had decided to run for  the Duma at all, and so I asked him:    Do you believe that parliamentarianism is possible in  Russia,  after the shootout at the Supreme Soviet?    [Yavlinskiy] First, I think it is necessary, and as for  whether it is possible or not, let us try once again to find out  in practice. Second, after the situation we found ourselves in  after 3-4 October, there was simply no alternative to holding  elections -- in any form, even with all the shortcomings, which,  of course, we knew about. Third, the Duma will have done its  job if it acts as a Constituent Assembly, and that is its main  mission. It must approve two things that are fundamental for  Russia: electoral laws and an electoral code, and it simply  must prepare Russia for elections of a real parliament and a  president, and for elections of local organs of power. This is  essential.    [Garifullina] And how long will the Duma be able to exist?  Is it possible that a conflict could break out between the new  paerliament and the president?    [Yavlinskiy] One would wish to avoid that. But the fact is  that the Constitution today is structured in such a way that the  president possesses full power. Therefore the Duma apparently  has virtually no areas where it overlaps with the president.  But at the same time the president bears full responsibility  for what happens in the country. The Duma was elected for a  short term -- only two years. Well, I don't know.... I would  not wish to make pessimistic predictions. But if you think that  after it is dissolved the next Duma will be better, I have grave  doubts of that.    The majority of my voters did not participate in the vote,  because the attitude to the elections themselves was negative,  people did not have confidence in how they were organized, how  they were called, how they were conducted, who supervised them.  That was inevitable: When an authoritarian regime holds  elections, it holds them in order to strengthen itself. But  this is our road and we must follow it. We have a chance.  Let's fight!</p>

Clinton pledged to get personally involved immediately after  the conclusion of his European tour this week. He made the  pledge during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou and European Commission President Jacques Delors at  the sidelines of the NATO summit in Brussels yesterday.    Kasoulidhis stated "the Cyprus government welcomes the fact  that President Clinton, personally, and this is a great positive  development for Cyprus, will handle the Cyprus problem."    He added the Greek Cypriot side should also think hard "as  to  the way we should responsibly handle our sincere objectives for  a just and workable Cyprus settlement."    Asked whether President Glavkos Kliridhis was briefed on  what  exactly was stated by President Clinton, Kasoulidhis replied he  based his statements on press reports from Brussels.    He said the government was in touch with the American State  Department special Cyprus coordinator and the U.S. Embassy in  Cyprus and no further contacts between the Cyprus and U.S.  presidents were being fixed.</p>

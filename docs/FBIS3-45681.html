The plan was drawn up at a recent annual municipal economic  work conference for 1994.    Zhang Lichang, mayor of the municipality, pointed out at the  conference that state-owned firms could only become more  competitive in both international and domestic markets after  being restructured.    According to sources from the conference, most of the  well-run large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the  city will be transformed into companies with limited liability  or limited liability stock companies.    Meanwhile, systems of shareholding, joint stock, contracting  and leasing will be expanded in small-sized enterprises.    Zhang is also encouraging well-run firms to form groups by  means of merging and integration and said that in place of the  single- product and single-sector operation, a diversified  economy should be adopted and spread in state-owned enterprises,  especially loss- making ones.    According to official statistics, there are now nearly 600  large and medium-sized enterprises in Tianjin, which involve the  industries of textiles, machinery, automobiles, metallurgy,  electronics and automobiles.</p>

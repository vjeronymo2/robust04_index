			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> A MEETING OF BLACK AND WHITE;  </P> <P> A SUBURBAN HOMEMAKER AND A WORKING MOTHER EXPERIENCE EACH OTHER'S WORLD IN  SOUTH AFRICA. FEAR GIVES WAY TO FRIENDSHIP.  </P> <P> Sue Ingram felt sick with fear. She didn't know where she would sleep or what  she would eat. She imagined bugs crawling around her feet and throngs of black  people who might resent her, even kill her.  </P> <P> Her bags stood beside the door of her warm, secure home. She had packed  carefully, nothing too fancy but nothing too casual, either.  </P> <P> She took a last look at herself in the mirror: She was 55 years old, a  descendant of the first white settlers in South Africa, the product of a life  of white privilege. And she was about to take her first step into a black  township. She quickly put on some rouge to hide the pale fear.  </P> <P> Half an hour later she was in Tembisa, her throat burning from the haze of coal  smoke. Crowded taxi-vans sped past. Thousands of blacks walked the dirt paths.  </P> <P> Ingram rubbed the rouge from her now-flushed face and began to think that maybe  her friends had been right all along. Maybe this was a foolhardy mission. But  it was too late to turn around.  </P> <P> Down a rutted dirt road, past an overflowing trash bin and houses with only  candles for light, she found Joyce Mkuwane's house.  </P> <P> "Thank you, Sue, for coming to my home," Mkuwane said. "And thank you for not  thinking we're animals."  </P> <P> So began an emotional and eye-opening voyage for two ordinary women, one white  and one black, across generations of fear and distrust in South Africa.  </P> <P> Black and white leaders are talking to each other as equals these days about  the country's future. But deal-making alone cannot bridge the divide carved by  42 years of legal racial segregation and centuries of master-servant  relationships. Closing that gap begins not with news conferences and formal  agreements but with people like Sue Ingram and Joyce Mkuwane, in places like  Tembisa.  </P> <P> Tembisa is a sprawling ghetto of 450,000 people, one of the satellites created  by South African social engineers as a repository of cheap black labor for the  white-run factories and homes of Johannesburg. Like most townships, Tembisa is  hidden from the main thoroughfares and the eyes of white motorists. It is not  on the way to anywhere.  </P> <P> Joyce Mkuwane lives here with her husband, Thomas, a son and daughter-in-law  and a granddaughter. A large woman with a gap-toothed smile, Joyce is 48 years  old, the mother of three and the owner of several day-care centers. Thomas is a  supervisor for the state-run bus company, where he started out as a driver 18  years ago.  </P> <P> Their home stands in a barren tract with thousands of look-alike concrete  houses known as "matchboxes," each with four rooms and an outdoor toilet. But  the Mkuwanes have used their money and carpentry skills to expand their  matchbox to 10 rooms that cover their small plot of land.  </P> <P> When Sue Ingram stepped through the front door, she found Thomas watching  television in a living room overstuffed with soft furniture, plants and  paintings. It was "nice and warm, clean-smelling," Ingram remembers.  </P> <P> "Oh, but this is beautiful," Ingram told her hosts and added, modestly, "I'm  afraid to have you come to my house. I don't have all the nice things you  have."  </P> <P> Ingram lives 10 miles away on a quiet, middle-class street in Germiston, an  industrial suburb of Johannesburg. The road in front of her house is paved, and  no two houses are alike. The manicured lawns and lush shade trees are protected  by short fences and private security company signs that promise a quick "armed  response" to reports of prowlers.  </P> <P> Ingram, a small, thin homemaker, is also the mother of three grown children.  Her husband, Bob, now retired, was a supervisor with the state-run airline.  </P> <P> She had decided to visit Tembisa when she saw an item in the church program one  Sunday morning about a weekend "Christian encounter" between whites and blacks  in the township.  </P> <P> "When I read that, my heart gave a little jump," Ingram remembers. She showed  it to her husband, who said, "That's for you."  </P> <P> Soon after she had signed up, though, Ingram began to have doubts. Concerned  friends asked her again and again: Was she sure it was the right thing to do?  Could the actions of one person really make any difference in South Africa?  </P> <P> Ingram had to admit that the closest she had come to a township was when she  drove past the grass huts of South Africa's rural black homelands. Her first  thought had always been, "I hope the car doesn't break down."  </P> <P> Making her decision more difficult was a pamphlet being circulated in the  townships that urged blacks to rise up and kill whites. Anti-apartheid leaders  had condemned it, and many thought it the work of right-wing whites trying to  stir up trouble for the government. But it was hard to ignore because, as  Ingram said, "it was all written down."  </P> <P> As the date of the encounter approached, Ingram twice changed her mind about  going. She became a nervous wreck, crying over the most insignificant things.  </P> <P> "I was ashamed of myself for being scared," she said.  </P> <P> In the end, faith, or maybe fatalism, saw her through. Whatever happened, she  figured, the Lord was on her side. If only that would be enough.  </P> <P> Most of her worries began to fade the first night, when she sat down for dinner  in Tembisa. Joyce covered the table with chicken and mealie pap, a thick  maize-meal porridge that is the staple of most African meals. Thomas decreed  that the family would speak only English during Sue's stay.  </P> <P> "It was amazing, really," she recalled. "They were chatting to me as if I was  one of them."  </P> <P> One thing that worried her was the Mkuwanes' neighbors. She was afraid that  they would see the white house guest and make trouble for the Mkuwanes later.  But Joyce reassured her that "nothing like that will happen."  </P> <P> As midnight approached, Ingram tried to explain, over coffee and dessert, why  she had decided to come.  </P> <P> "I wanted to see," she said. "You're never too old to learn."  </P> <P> Later, Mkuwane turned the living room sofa into a bed for her guest. "I stay  here when Tommy and I have a fight," she said with a conspiratorial laugh.  </P> <P> Ingram giggled. "I do that at home sometimes, too," she said.  </P> <P> The next morning Mkuwane put a kettle on the stove for tea, and the two women  chatted leisurely like old friends.  </P> <P> "They don't rush anything," Ingram said later. "When they start rushing is when  they're too late already. They just live."  </P> <P> The Mkuwanes own a car, but the purpose of the encounter was to introduce their  visitor to life in a township, so Joyce and Ingram walked two blocks to the  taxi stand. Black strangers waved, and Ingram, with her host's tutoring, began  greeting people in Zulu -- "Sabona" for one person and "Sabonane" for a crowd.  </P> <P> The women squeezed into one of the private taxi vans that carry millions of  blacks to work each day. Ingram was nervous, but she tried not to let it show.  </P> <P> "You're in this black taxi with all these black people, and I guess you're a  bit scared that they might turn on you or something," Ingram said.  </P> <P> Walking the streets of Tembisa and riding taxis turned out to be "much safer  than I thought," she said, adding: "But there are still some blacks who look at  you with eyes of hate. They hate white people because of apartheid."  </P> <P> As Ingram and Mkuwane talked, they discovered that they shared many of the same  values and concerns about life, but differences in their background and  experience were apparent, too. They didn't talk much about those.  </P> <P> Joyce Mkuwane had spent most of her life as a nurse, working in whites-only  hospitals and white homes, seeing the inequities of apartheid up close.  </P> <P> "Our blacks know about whites," she said. "But whites don't know blacks at  all."  </P> <P> She quit work at a private, multiracial hospital when she overheard two white  doctors discussing the death of a brain-damaged black child.  </P> <P> "That's minus one garden boy," she quoted one of the doctors as saying with a  shrug.  </P> <P> One of her most vivid memories was the bloody uprising of 1984-85.  </P> <P> "If the police saw four of us on the street, they would start shooting," she  said. "I didn't know from one day to the next whether my children would come  home alive."  </P> <P> Although she didn't admit it to Ingram, Mkuwane said, she remains "a little bit  bitter" about the way whites have treated blacks. "But in my heart of hearts,"  she said, "I want to make friends with whites. I wish more whites wanted to  make friends with us."  </P> <P> Sue Ingram, on the other hand, had seen little of the effects of apartheid. She  grew up on a farm near Johannesburg. Her father, a construction foreman, moved  the family to the city when she was 13. She married and raised her children in  an environment of white schools, white hospitals, white neighborhoods, even  white parks.  </P> <P> Although she supported racial reform in South Africa, the only blacks Ingram  knew were her maid, her neighbors' maids and the black customers at the  pharmacy where she worked for a time. She remembers those black customers as  "very proud people" who always insisted, against her recommendation, on buying  goods with the highest prices even when similar, less expensive goods were  available.  </P> <P> "I don't think they trusted us," she said.  </P> <P> In their long talks, Ingram and Mkuwane tiptoed into politics, to which so many  conversations in South Africa eventually turn. But both were wary of the  terrain.  </P> <P> "I wanted to make her feel at home, to be accepted, so I tried to avoid talking  about anything I knew would worry her," Mkuwane said.  </P> <P> She was particularly concerned that Ingram might be shocked by some of her  radical opinions, such as her belief that whites should invite their black  maids to the dinner table, and her deep suspicion that the government's recent  reforms are "just more tricks."  </P> <P> "I used to be the sort of person who just succumbed" to the system, Mkuwane  told a reporter later. "But now I'm very revolutionary. If I know my rights, I  stand up for them."  </P> <P> Ingram too held back some of her innermost thoughts. She did not tell Mkuwane,  for example, of her deep concern that a black government would run whites out  of South Africa.  </P> <P> But Ingram admitted to her host that she felt guilty "because of the way you  have been treated, being pushed into places like Tembisa. Even if you put a dog  in a pigsty, that dog is going to live like a pig very soon."  </P> <P> Ingram said later she suspected that Mkuwane would support a quick black  takeover of power in South Africa.  </P> <P> "I don't blame her," Ingram said. "But some of the blacks blame everything on  the whites, and it's not our fault. It's our forefathers'. But that's the past.  Many of us want it to be different now."  </P> <P> On Ingram's last night in Tembisa, Mkuwane got an urgent call from a friend, a  black councilor in the township. The councilor was worried that radical young  blacks, who regard the council as an instrument of white oppression, were  planning to attack her home. Mkuwane and Ingram rushed to the councilor's  house. It was late, and Ingram was frightened.  </P> <P> "I was looking for a place where I could hide," Ingram said. "They offered to  take me back, but I said, 'I'm in it with you, so I might as well stay.' But I  was thinking, 'Yes, please take me home.' "  </P> <P> It turned out to be a false alarm. But when they got home, Ingram swallowed one  of the tranquilizers she had packed.  </P> <P> "My poor heart," Ingram said. "Even an hour after taking that tablet, my heart  was still beating fast."  </P> <P> On Sunday morning, Ingram's last day in Tembisa, the Mkuwanes were running late  for church. Joyce still had to take a bath and iron her dress, so Ingram  offered to do the ironing.  </P> <P> "It was the strangest thing," she said. "I thought, 'Here I am ironing a black  girl's dress. The first time in my life.' It was unreal."  </P> <P> Ingram was one of 80 whites who signed up for the Tembisa encounter, but 20  dropped out at the last minute under pressure from worried friends and family.  Barry Poppleton, the organizer, said he had many more blacks volunteering to be  hosts than whites willing to be guests.  </P> <P> "It's very sad," Poppleton said. "There's so much positive happening in South  Africa today, but there is still a lot of fear, too. And getting together is  the only way to prepare people for the social transformation that is coming."  </P> <P> Rain fell that Sunday afternoon, and Ingram and Mkuwane said goodby to each  other with a long hug in the rain.  </P> <P> "I love Sue," Mkuwane said. "I only wish there were more whites like her."  </P> <P> Ingram was more hopeful. "At least there were a few pink faces in Tembisa," she  said. "And we have something to tell our friends about."  </P> <P> A day later, Sue Ingram picked up the phone in her white neighborhood and  placed a call to her new friend, Joyce Mkuwane. Just to say hello.  </P></p>

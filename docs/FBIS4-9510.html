			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Privatization Minister Milan Janicina by </F> Igor Zvach in Bratislava; date not given: "We Have To Take a  Chance on Privatization"]    [Text] Bratislava--Perhaps nothing of late has led to such  contradictory polemics as the decision by the provisional  government to again prioritize the coupon method of  privatization in the second privatization wave.    We discussed this issue--why, even at the cost of certain  known risks or disadvantages of this method--with Milan  Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of  national property.    [Zvach] So, Mr. Minister, why?    [Janicina] The main reason is that we do not have the  domestic financial resources, including credits, which are very  hard to get. Moreover, the influx of foreign capital is not as  great as we would wish, for reasons I do not want to go into  now. Set against this, there is the need to privatize a certain  amount of property. And so, coupon privatization really seems  to be the most viable starting point. In addition, this is, in  fact, the most open and clear method of privatization, and many  people are calling for openness. Quite simply, it is very  difficult to "procure" property here for a "party" friend. This  leads to one thing--to again place this method on a par with the  others.    [Zvach] But this will not solve the lack of capital....    [Janicina] It is necessary to realize here that the aim of  coupon privatization is not to gain capital but to transform  ownership. However, a certain percentage of the shares, which  will be earmarked for sale, will bring capital to a specific  interested party.    [Zvach] There is still some anxiety that certain investment  funds may, because of a lack of money, follow the path of  foreign loans and so, in the end, a considerable proportion of  our enterprises may end up uncontrollably in the hands of  foreign owners. Has the government considered this risk?    [Janicina] We know about this risk. Capital is, however,  international, and every economy faces a similar risk. This is  really a matter of the seriousness or lack of seriousness of the  approach of the individual funds. It cannot be ruled out, but  we must take this chance if we want to proceed. We cannot talk  ad infinitum about how and why something will not work. We  simply cannot turn Slovakia into a fortress that could survive  on its own.    [Zvach] Incidentally, the risk is the same with any influx  of foreign capital, including direct capital. It is always  possible to consider whether the foreign partner is, let us say,  merely interested in gaining control of our markets and  destroying domestic production. Is it ever possible to  completely eliminate these risks?    [Janicina] Absolutely completely not. This is always  connected with the appropriate agreement and the competence of  the people who conclude it. We must never view an agreement  only through the promises or obligations a foreign partner takes  upon himself. The most important thing is to specify precisely  these obligations in the agreement and then discuss exactly the  sanctions that will be imposed if these obligations are not  adhered to. If we proceed in this fashion, and, moreover, if we  verify the seriousness of our partner beforehand, the risk, if  not ruled out, is at least minimized.    [Zvach] In conclusion, something that perhaps interests the  citizen most. Do you have any specific ideas yet about the  price the citizen will pay for a coupon book and about the time  frame for coupon privatization?    [Janicina] All of this will be discussed at the next  government session on Tuesday, 26 April.    I am personally of the opinion that the price of a coupon  book should not be higher than in the first round--that is,  1,000 korunas. In my view, there are even sufficient reasons  for the price being lower. We will not itemize now. As far as  the dates are concerned, according to our proposal, the  registration of citizens should begin on 1 September 1994. The  registration of investment privatization funds should also begin  on the same date. The subsequent preliminary round--that is,  ascribing the investment coupons to the funds--could begin on 3  October 1994, and the second round could begin on 2 January  1995. We are allowing for a total of five rounds; the last one  should begin on 1 May 1995. So, in essence, we would like to  complete the entire process within a year.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT FEE INCREASES APPROVED  </P> <P> Residents and businesses will now pay substantially more to meet property  development requirements under a fee schedule approved by the City Council this  week.  </P> <P> Planning fees are paid to the city whenever there is development or  redevelopment that requires a zone change, a special permit or some other  review by the city.  </P> <P> The fees cover the administrative costs incurred by the city staff.  </P> <P> The fee increases affect conditional use permits, which will go up from $200 to  $400; variances, up from $100 to $400, and zoning ordinance amendments, up from  $250 to $650.  </P> <P> Also, if an environmental impact report is required, the developer must pay  $500. The service was free in the past.  </P> <P> Other planning fees, including appeals, site plan reviews, general plan  amendments and tentative tract and parcel maps, were also increased.  </P> <P> City Planner Larry Emerson said that while the increases are significant -- in  many cases doubling and in one case even quadrupling the old fees -- they are  comparable to the actual costs and will bring Los Alamitos in line with what  other cities in the county charge for such services.  </P> <P> "I don't think it is unreasonable at all to get these increases, to recover our  costs," Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi said.  </P> <P> Over the last several months, the city has increased fees and fines for a  variety of city services, including permit and annual monitoring fees for the  city's alarm system and parking ticket fines.  </P> <P> The council was told at its midyear budget review session in January that the  city -- because of a declining sales tax base -- would have to look for other  sources of revenue.

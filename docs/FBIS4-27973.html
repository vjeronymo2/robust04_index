			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station Commentary] </F>   [Text] Khmer Rouge Radio on 31 May ran a story about the  so-called statement by 154 students and teachers in various  localities in Cambodia on the establishment of the National  Temporary Committee against the second (?war) aggression by the  United States in the country. Copies of the statement were then  distributed to the press. The Khmer Rouge statement said the  United States has declared a second aggression against Cambodia,  and called on the entire Cambodian population to fight this  aggression. The statement [word indistinct] said at present  tens of thousands of Vietnamese people are coming for business  activities and natural resource exploitation, endangering  Cambodia.    The distortion of facts has become a nature of the Khmer  Rouge. Most recently they accused Vietnam, the United States,  France, and Australia of backing the Cambodian Government troops  in attacks on Khmer Rouge bases.    Concerning the latest fabrication, a spokesman of the  Cambodian Information Ministry, Mr. Sieng Lapresse on 1 June  said the allegation used by the Khmer Rouge was an insult to  Cambodian teachers and students. He also pointed out that the  Khmer Rouge who had burned schools, books, and killed  intellectuals cannot represent teachers and students to trick  people; and that the Khmer Rouge should be outlawed and chased  out of the Royal Palace. Mr. Sieng Lapresse also termed the  Khmer Rouge as butchers who have destroyed the country's  culture, and sold off the country interest to foreigners. At  the beginning of the peace process in the country, the Khmer  Rouge sought all means it could to destroy peaceful  reconstruction. Quite recently,the round table peace talks also  failed due to the Khmer Rouge absurd demands. It is of no  surprise that the Khmer Rouge resorts to other tricks.</p>

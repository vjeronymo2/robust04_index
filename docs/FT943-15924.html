			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Liebenberg, tough player who delivers the goods: Mark Suzman looks at the career and prospects of South Africa's future finance minister At another time in South Africa's history the appointment of Mr Christo Liebenberg as finance minister would probably have been greeted with approval and relief. He is a respected banker with strong private-sector credentials, a sound understanding of the economy, and a tough, conservative attitude to fiscal discipline: all ample qualifications for the job. Unfortunately for Mr Liebenberg, credentials are not enough. Although perhaps the worst that can be said of him is that he is not Mr Derek Keys, the widely admired incumbent who on Tuesday announced his decision to step down in October, it is at present almost the only thing being said of him in the Johannesburg business community. So profound has been the influence of Mr Keys during his two years at South Africa's economic tiller, and so deep the dismay at his departure, that relatively little attention has so far been focused on Mr Liebenberg and what he is likely to do with the job. None the less, as replacements go, Mr Liebenberg is among the most credible. He retired in February as chief executive of Nedcor, South Africa's fourth largest banking and financial services group, where he had built a solid reputation as a dedicated and hard-working executive. Born in 1934 in the small town of Touwsrivier in the Western Cape, he was educated at Worcester Boys' High School, where he matriculated in 1951. He started work in the mail room of a Nedbank branch a year later and worked his way up the ranks while moving around the country with Nedbank and taking a short stint with Morgan Guaranty in New York. En route, he picked up qualifications from the Institute of Bankers, Insead and Harvard. Under his leadership, Nedcor became increasingly involved in social policy. The Perm, its mortgage arm, is the biggest provider in the black home loan market, and his appointment has met with the approval of both President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and Mr F W de Klerk's National party. With no previous political experience, it is business credentials rather than political skills that Mr Liebenberg will be expected to bring to his new post. 'He's a very good backroom man,' says one businessman who has worked with him. 'He understands the issues, works through them carefully and delivers the goods.' Another banker agrees: 'Liebenberg's a journeyman executive. He's capable and will work hard at the job.' Affable and good-humoured, Mr Liebenberg is seen as unlikely to diverge much from the cautious fiscal policy framework set out by Mr Keys over the past two years. But he is both less charismatic and less cerebral than the ebullient Mr Keys, and will find it harder to win people over to his point of view. He also has a much lower international profile than his predecessor, which may be a handicap in dealings with the global banking community. 'He's not as persuasive or influential as Keys and will probably have difficulties in the cut-and-thrust of politics,' says another businessman. As a businessman Mr Liebenberg was regarded as an opponent of the maintenance of South Africa's two-tier currency and exchange controls, but is seen as a strong ally of Mr Chris Stals, the Reserve Bank governor, who is known to be reluctant to alter the present system until economic fundamentals improve. As a result, most observers expect little alteration to existing policy in the immediate future. One probable result of Mr Liebenberg's appointment will be a shift of influence within the government's economic policy team. Whereas Mr Keys was the dominant figure in the troika he made up along with the ANC's Mr Alec Erwin, his deputy, and Mr Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio, the new arrangement will probably be more of a gathering of equals. While Mr Keys has made Mr Liebenberg's job easier by giving his successor an economy in much better shape than the one he inherited, he has made it much harder by having set such a capable example. 'Keys was so good at the job, many people seemed to feel he could walk on water if he had to,' said one grudging admirer. 'Mr Liebenberg, however, will have to learn to swim.'</p>

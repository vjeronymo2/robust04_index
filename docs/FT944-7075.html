			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Royal household to publish accounts Buckingham Palace is to publish annual accounts detailing how Pounds 20m of taxpayers' money is spent running royal palaces. The first annual report will be published in July. This follows a call by the Commons public accounts committee in September for greater 'public visibility' of how public money was spent at the royal palaces. Yesterday the government recommended publication of the royal household's annual accounts. The palace said the royal household had nothing to hide and would be delighted to publish a full annual report.</p>

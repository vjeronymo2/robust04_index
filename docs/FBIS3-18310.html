			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Silvio Berlusconi has unveiled his plan for  government. It is almost 100 pages long and is a recipe for the  creation of what the Forza Italia leader calls the new Italian  economic miracle. Renato Andreolassi reports from Milan.    [Andreolassi] A whole day of meetings with Forza Italia  candidates who all had their electoral kits with them, in order  to discuss the outline of the political program. This was  followed by a news conference.    Silvio Berlusconi responded to journalists in calm and firm  tones. Above all he replied to the bullets fired by Bossi on  the themes of enemies and false friends. Berlusconi said that  he would not accept provocation and that he would not fall into  the trap of replying to questions in argumentative tones and  therefore sparking off further debate. He said that Forza  Italia is fighting for a new strategy, a new political plan  which aims to give this country a majority, liberal democrat  government. He added that the movement is presenting itself in  the election along with other forces in order to defeat the  Left, which is responsible for out-of-control public spending.    Let's see what the main points of Forza Italia's political  program are.    [Reporter Anna La Rosa] Reduction in the number of taxes  from  200 to not more than 10, and no taxes at all for the poorest  members of society; removing the management of taxes from  central government and handing it over to local authorities.  Public spending must be reduced, its growth is the root of all  evil. Forza Italia would encourage new businesses and would  levy no taxes on newly-created work places. There would be the  progressive privatization for all state-owned companies, and  above all direct presidential elections.    There would be fewer laws, but more judges and a reduction  in  the use of preventive detention. There would be a report on the  armed forces and increase in their resources.    Forza Italia would impose fewer taxes on one-income families  and a crackdown on the distribution of drugs. There would be a  gradual transition from the public pension system to a private  one, however, guaranteeing help for those who are less well-off.</p>

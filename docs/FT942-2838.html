			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / People: Hamish Grossart takes third chair Hamish Grossart is to become chairman of Hicking Pentecost, the quoted Cardiff-based textile and industrial products group. It is a non-executive job which he will do alongside the task he took on in January of chairing and sorting out Ashley Group, the window blind company which had hit trouble with a Spanish acquisition, as well as being chairman of EFT, the Glasgow-based asset finance company he helped found. The 37-year-old Glaswegian corporate finance specialist has long been intent on pursuing a career outside the orbit of his better known uncle Angus Grossart, chairman of the merchant bank Noble Grossart and a man with his finger in many Scottish pies. Hamish worked at Noble Grossart for a time before creating EFT in 1987. He had intended to make it a mini financial conglomerate, eventually spreading from Scotland to London. But the corporate finance arm withered in the recession and closed in 1992, and the fund management subsidiary was sold, leaving asset finance. Grossart moved up to become non-executive chairman and sought other outlets. Until last month he was chairman of Quality Care Homes, the nursing homes group which he took public in 1992. He has been involved with Hicking Pentecost since 1991 and organised its recent Pounds 9m acquisition of Barbour Campbell, a former Hanson offshoot. 'It's virtually Wales's only successful quoted company,' he says, and points out that its market capitalisation has risen tenfold since 1990. Grossart sees his speciality as helping companies with 'financing, City relations, management structure and problems of growth and development, but not deciding how many cans of beans go out each day'. He is also on the boards of Scottish Radio (formerly Radio Clyde) and British Thornton, the quoted furniture and drawing equipment company.</p>

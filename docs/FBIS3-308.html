Speaking on  Thursday [3 March] after a meeting with Organisation of African  Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim in Umtata in Transkei,  Mr Mandela said a Zulu homeland was a point raised during his  meeting with Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu  Buthelezi earlier this week. "I indicated to Mr Buthelezi this  was a matter we were prepared to discuss directly with the king  and we requested Mr Buthelezi to arrange a meeting. We are  awaiting a response," Mr Mandela said.    The ANC had decided in principle to accept international  mediation, but it had not yet discussed the structure through  which this would take place. "But the principle has been  formally accepted and we have conveyed this fact to Mr  Buthelezi," he said.    Mr Mandela said he had briefed Mr Salim on the latest  political developments during their hour-long meeting in the  offices of the Transkei Military Council in Umtata. Mr Salim  said he had been encouraged by the discussions he had had with  Mr Mandela, Mr Buthelezi, State President F W de Klerk, the Pan  Africanist Congress leadership and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front]. "What has encouraged me more is the  meeting the president of the ANC had with Mr Buthelezi. From  all indications, it was very constructive. I believe and I'm  hopeful that arising from the serious discussions and  understandings arrived at there, the prospects for the country  are certainly brightened," Mr Salim said.    The OAU looked forward to a peaceful election. A successful  outcome was vital not only to the people of South Africa, but to  the continent as a whole. The attention of the international  community was focused on this country, he said. "We want to see  an emergent, stable South Africa which can play a central role  in Africa and can be an important factor of stability for our  continent," Mr Salim said.</p>

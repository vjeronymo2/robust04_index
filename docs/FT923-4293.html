			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Some teenagers 'paid 90p an hour' SCHOOL-LEAVERS, who since 1986 have not been covered by minimum wage legislation, are working for as little as 90p an hour, the Greater Manchester Low Pay Unit said yesterday. The survey was compiled because parents had complained to the unit about the jobs their children were obliged to accept. The unit said youngsters faced pressure to accept poorly paid jobs because the alternatives were bleak, particularly as there were waiting lists for Youth Training places. 'Those unable to get a Youth Training place or a better job face poverty and/or dependence on friends and family,' the unit said. 'Income support is no longer available to most 16 and 17 year-olds. 'They are not entitled to claim unemployment benefit, and child benefit for young people leaving full-time education this summer will be payable only until January 3 next year.' Examples of low pay cited by the unit included: A 16-year-old youth from Stockport who worked a 50-hour-week in a supermarket for Pounds 1.40 an hour. The adult legal minimum for food shops is Pounds 3.08p an hour. A 16-year-old youth from Wigan whose 47 1/2 -hour week in a garage earned him Pounds 1.26 an hour.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: SA gold mines improve 14% Gold mines in the Anglo American group, the world's largest gold producer, announced a 14 per cent increase in earnings to R208.1m (Dollars 58.2m) for the September quarter, up from R182.1m in June. The improvement resulted from a higher gold price as average revenue for the quarter rose 2 per cent to R44,408 a kg from R43,462 a kg, and improved overall production, which increased 5 per cent to 60,331 kg from 57,683 kg. This helped offset a 1 per cent increase in working costs, which rose to R34,139 a kg from R33,923 a kg, largely due to higher wages. Freegold mine, the group's flagship, turned in a particularly good performance, lifting production to 25,614 kg from 23,982 kg and raising its profits to R98.7m from R47.7m. Western Deep raised output to 10,021 kg from 9,309 kg, while Vaal Reefs lifted production to 17,861 kg from 16,889 kg. However, Elandsrand was hit by industrial action and gold output fell to 3,303 kg from 4,193 kg while profits dropped to R7.1m from R17.8m. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo American's gold and uranium division, said he was satisfied with the quarter's results and said the gold price would breach Dollars 400 an ounce during the current quarter on the strength of increased demand for gold jewellery.</p>

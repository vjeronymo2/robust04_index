			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Letter: A surfeit of scorn, a tilt at British institutions - and meanwhile the barbarians are at the gate Sir, I was sickened by Michael Thompson-Noel's two articles, 'Travel-Soothing luxury of the 'real' Bali', and 'Hawks &amp; Handsaws' (April 10/11). The first was an unoriginal piece of nastiness: the journalist from his all-expenses-paid five star hotel pouring scorn on the local culture which he has neither the wit nor the inclination to research. But it was the second piece, about the Grand National, which really made me see red. How dare he compare the voided race with the fall of Saigon? How dare he label as unintelligent all those who enjoy or are involved in National Hunt racing and the Grand National in particular - no football hooligans these but the widest possible cross section of the British public? Has he ever been to a race meeting? Yes, the anachronistic starting system will be modified; but it worked well enough in previous years. Significantly, it was delay and the resulting over-anxiety at the start which exposed the flaws in the system. And what caused the delay? An animal rights protest. But Mr Thompson-Noel is not really interested in horses. He has just used the event as an excuse to tilt at Britain's traditions and institutions (including the poor old monarchy again) - his target being those special attributes of English heritage which in the past have earned the respect and admiration of the rest of the world. And what shall we have left when these traditions and institutions have been dismantled? A mediocre England in a mediocre Europe, governed by classless politicians and media men, a country within which the pseudo-intelligentsia like Mr Thompson-Noel can flourish. The irony is that one of these respected institutions, the Financial Times, can allow a member of its staff to publish such subversive propaganda. And what will he achieve from this, the odious Mr Thompson-Noel, the middle class revolutionary with the double-barrelled name? Well, probably another freebie holiday in an even more exotic place than Bali, well beyond the means of those who earn their living from a less distasteful profession. I despair more and more for the future of this country. Truly, there are barbarians at the gate. J G Freeland, 122 Rivermead Court, Ranelagh Gardens, London SW6 3SD</p>

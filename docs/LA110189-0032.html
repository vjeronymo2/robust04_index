			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCEAN POLLUTION  </P> <P> I am a surfer from the South Bay. Recently, while I was sitting in the lineup  at Torrance Beach I began to smell an obnoxious odor. It had rained the night  before, but I thought nothing of it. I soon forgot about the smell because the  conditions were good. I saw that there were better conditions farther down the  beach, so I walked down to check it out. While walking the smell grew stronger.  I neared a concrete drainpipe and saw it spewing out garbage and raw sewage  into the ocean. I looked farther out and saw my unknowing friends surfing.  </P> <P> Not only was sludge gushing out, but plastic cups, bags and cans were also  floating around. I walked back down the beach toward my car and I almost  tripped over three dead rats that had washed up. That whole day I never even  saw a sign posted giving warning. When I got to the public shower I felt like I  could not clean myself enough.  </P> <P> DOUG AITKEN  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (19): Senior status among US companies - Ray Bashford probes General Electric's Dollars 500m commitment General Electric has emerged as the flagship of US investment in India. After concluding four years ago that the country was transforming into a new industrial frontier Mr Jack Welsh, the chief executive, launched a high profile investment strategy which has given the conglomerate this senior status among the US companies crowding into Delhi. GE's much publicised plans to invest up to Dollars 500m in India in the next three years also has made it an important participant in several vital areas of infrastructural development through the private sector. The group's diverse spread of operations is being replicated in India. The power engine, finance, home appliance and lighting, locomotive and medical divisions are at varying stages of growth. And to complete the group's involvement, the television, electrical distribution and control and motor engine businesses are seeking routes for entry. Responsibility for GE's strategy in India has been handed over to Mr Scott Bayman, 47,-who hails from Louisville, Kentucky. He took put the position eight months ago but watched the Indian plans mature during three and a half years as a senior executive in the group's appliance division. 'This is an exciting place to be for GE. It's being part of changing GE's centre of gravity towards this part of the world and that is rewarding,' Mr Bayman says. GE is becoming known for 'what it has done not what it is going to do,' he adds. 'This means that the government is able to point to GE when other foreign companies are interested in coming in.' US companies, particularly customers of GE such has Ford and Allied Signals, have sounded out Mr Bayman on the opportunities in India. Many others groups are watching GE's progress before making commitments. Mr Welsh's study found that India, China and Mexico were the key growth areas for GE into the next century. After follow-up investigations by the corporation's strategists the decision to tilt investment funds towards these areas was put into effect about three years ago. 'We came to the conclusion that there were large opportunities in India,' Mr Bayman says. 'Look at the growth opportunities in India and compare them with the mature markets of North America and Europe and you can get awful excited.' As the result of discussions on the ground with business and government leaders, the company dismissed as out-dated the view of India as over-populated, over-governed and irreversibly Third World. Instead it concluded that India was potentially one of the two biggest markets in the world, had a Western-based financial system and, most importantly, wanted change. To date, Dollars 150m has been invested. Final approval for two power projects where GE is co-developer, equity partner and power equipment supplier, could soon push investment to more than Dollars 250m. With power engines one of GE's main businesses the group's success rests heavily on the national government's ability to force through its energy policy which is pivotal to the development of the industrial infrastructure. Mr Bayman, while admitting a vested interest, expresses concern about any slow down in the process of infrastructural development. 'If we are going to build world-class products here I want to be able to get the products to customers on time,' he says. 'We don't want to be unable to expand fast enough because of the lack of water or power. Development of the infrastructure has to be on the top of everyone's list.' To capture the growing market for consumer items GE has cultivated joint ventures with several of the country's leading companies. In the white goods area it has teamed up with Godrej &amp; Boyce and in lighting with Gujarat Apar. The Wipco-GE Medical Systems subsidiary will manufacture ultrasound equipment and last November a joint venture with Indian Petrochemicals Corporation began production of advanced engineering plastics. The government is considering a radical proposal to upgrade the country's locomotive fleet. It has offered to upgrade all electrical engines to boost haulage capacity and speed before leasing them back to the government. Two green field plants have been established through these joint ventures. GE Capital is a fully owned subsidiary in India and has established a joint venture with the Housing Development Finance Corporation based in Bombay. GE will import a broad range of the finance arm's international activities, including auto finance, credit arms and leasing. It will also become an integrated support operation to finance the sale of GE capital equipment. By transferring most of its business divisions to India GE believes it has minimised the effect of possible failure in any single area. 'Although the amount of each investment is big in relative terms it is not a bet-your-business investment. If one venture does not make it you are not risking the profitability of the group (in India),' the American says. Mr Bayman believes that an increasing availability of consumer durables will eventually help fuel the liberalisation process. 'The impact of foreign investment will be to improve the standard of living and this has not been felt yet. If we show the benefits we will see the benefits,' he says. GE feels that there is not a shortage of international funds available for investment in India, but that the onus rests with the government to establish boundaries for acceptable risks and rewards. 'I tell Indians not to worry about competing against China for investment. India has to compete against the world with competitive products,' Mr Bayman says. However, the question of what are acceptable profit returns from new private sector industry is likely to become an increasingly politically charged issue at a state and national level. It will certainly emerge as a key issue in several of the coming state elections and GE is aware of its importance. 'We know there are going to be bumps in the road. There will be bumps in the road for the next 10 years but there are also bumps in the road in North America,' Mr Bayman says.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATED DEMAND FOR POWER IN 1996-97  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Region               Requirement (m kwh)       Peak load (MW)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern                   129,587                24,234 Western                    121,159                 9,587 Southern                   103,191                18,150 Eastern                     56,011                10,250 North-eastern                6,169                 1,388 Andaman, Nicobar Is.           140                    39 Lakshadweep                     17                     4 ALL INDIA                  416,274                76,356  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Eighth Five Year plan 1992-97  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The death of Holst, who played a pivotal role in the Middle  East peace process, was "a great shock," said Foreign Ministry  spokesman Sadaaki Numata, adding it is a loss not only for  Norway but the whole world.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata and other Japanese Government officials will send telegrams  of condolence later in the day, the spokesman said.    Holst, 56, who was instrumental in brokering the historic  agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation  Organization (PLO) last Septmeber for limited Palestinian  self-rule in the occupied territories, died after reportedly  suffering a stroke.    He visited Japan last October and held talks with Hosokawa  and Hata.</p>

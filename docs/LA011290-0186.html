			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PICKENS SUES FIRM IN TOKYO COURT  </P> <P> T. Boone Pickens is carrying his Japanese corporate battle to court with a  lawsuit to gain access to the financial books of Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd.,  the auto parts maker of which he is the largest shareholder, Pickens' lawyer  said today.  </P> <P> Pickens filed the lawsuit in Tokyo District Court, his lawyer, Kanji Ishizumi,  said.  </P> <P> "We are confident that Pickens will win. But it is all up to the judges,"  Ishizumi said.  </P> <P> Koito has not agreed to Pickens' request for the right to look over its account  books covering the years from April 1, 1979, he said.  </P> <P> Koito told Pickens to wait until Jan. 22 for a response, Ishizumi said. "But  there is no reason why we have to wait that long," he added.  </P> <P> Pickens holds a 26% stake in Koito through his private investment firm Boone  Co. Toyota Motor Corp. holds 19% of Koito's shares, buys the bulk of its  output, and has three seats on its board. Pickens has been denied any seats.  </P></p>

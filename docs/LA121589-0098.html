			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANNED CBS MOVIE OUTRAGES JAILED MOM;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: OUT OF JAIL, ELIZABETH MORGAN BELIEVES STORY IS BASED ON HER  CELEBRATED FIGHT TO PREVENT HER EX-HUSBAND FROM SEEING THEIR DAUGHTER.  </P> <P> In South 1, Cell 37, on a day earlier this year in the District of Columbia  Detention Center, the celebrated inmate Dr. Elizabeth Morgan received a  surprise package. A TV script. Unsolicited. She didn't know who sent it.  </P> <P> It was "In the Best Interests of the Child," a grim story about a woman who  discovers that her ex-husband has been sexually abusing their 5-year-old  daughter. The judge insists that "Jennifer" permit "Walt" unsupervised visits  with "Mandy." Jennifer hides the child and goes to jail for contempt.  </P> <P> Morgan was sent to jail for contempt of court in August, 1987, for defying a  judge and hiding then-5-year-old daughter Hillary from her ex-husband, Dr. Eric  Foretich, who angrily denied her charges of raping the girl.  </P> <P> How close is the script to her story?  </P> <P> Morgan, now out of jail and interviewed by phone from a friend's house in  Virginia, said, "Well, first of all, the script that I saw was clearly my story  for various reasons -- but the obvious one is that a mother goes to jail for  years and years."  </P> <P> She laughed. "I mean, there's only one person in the history of mankind who's  done that. I mean, thank heavens (nobody else has gone to jail) -- but that can  only be me."  </P> <P> And she has sold the rights to her story to another producer, who has not yet  assigned a writer to the project.  </P> <P> Morgan's outrage was re-ignited last week when casting notices circulated among  Hollywood agents for the CBS production of the "In the Best Interests of the  Child" script from Papazian-Hirsch Entertainment, with shooting planned to  start the first week of January. There is no air date yet.  </P> <P> Producer Robert Papazian, in a telephone interview with The Times, said that  the story is about a woman going into the "underground" to hide from  authorities, and then "she goes to jail like a lot of other people who have had  the same problem."  </P> <P> Papazian, who had met with Morgan in jail in late 1988, then said he was being  interrupted by a long-distance call. An officer in his company called back  later to say that there would be no further comment.  </P> <P> CBS said through a spokesperson: "There are a lot of stories out there of women  in very similar situations. And Elizabeth Morgan's is one. But unfortunately  she's not alone in this whole thing, and they all play themselves out somewhat  differently.  </P> <P> "The Papazian piece is a compilation and it's not the Elizabeth Morgan story  and, in fact, we feel that the stories are so different that the network's  willing to listen to a pitch from those who own the rights, and we wouldn't be  averse to airing them both."  </P> <P> Linda Otto, the producer whom Morgan settled on to tell her story, said that  she didn't know how many mothers of sexually abused daughters had gone to jail  but "there are not 'a lot' of women (who went to jail). . . . And there's only  one famous woman and it's Elizabeth Morgan. So who are they kidding?"  </P> <P> Morgan, 42, a plastic surgeon, was finally released from jail Sept. 25 after 25  months via special legislation signed by President Bush. On Dec. 2, she married  her fiance, Federal Appeals Court Judge Paul Michel, and they are living in the  Washington area.  </P> <P> Morgan said that, after a lengthy meeting with Papazian, she didn't feel he was  "right" to produce her story. Later, she said, he told her agent that CBS had  given him the go-ahead to make "a generic sexual-abuse story about a mother who  goes underground."  </P> <P> Morgan quoted Papazian as saying, "Would Dr. Morgan be willing to talk to me  about her story, not to make a movie about her story, but so I can sort of  understand what happened in her case just to help, you know, get a grasp on how  these things play out?"  </P> <P> She met two hours in the jail with the assigned writer early this year "and he  told me that I was just part of their background research."  </P> <P> Then the script arrived. She was outraged: "It was a travesty of Hillary's  suffering. It portrayed her father as believable and sympathetic. I thought it  portrayed her suffering as really minimal. I felt it portrayed her statements  as partly incredible. I thought it portrayed her relationship with me as poor  and disturbed. I just thought it was a travesty of the facts about what she  went through."  </P> <P> The casting announcement indicates that ex-husband Walt might be tougher and  less sympathetic. Morgan said there did appear to be changes from the script  she read.  </P> <P> Is there any legal recourse? "It's very hard to know," Morgan said. "Mr.  Papazian approached me when I was pretty powerless in jail, when I am fighting  the legal battle of my life to protect my daughter. He couldn't have chosen  someone less able to protect themselves."  </P> <P> Los Angeles attorney Shelley Browning, who handles rights negotiations for  Morgan, said, "I think this leaves a real bad, unsavory taste in everybody's  mouth, that somebody would do this. Because this is not just another story.  This is a story that needs to have incredible sensitivity in the telling.  </P> <P> "And there's a real possible and maybe even probable jeopardy to Elizabeth and  to Hillary by virtue of some sort of a distorted version coming out, a sort of  homogenized, commercialized version of this story."  </P> <P> Out of more than 500 calls to Morgan's agents and attorneys inquiring about  film-TV rights, they finally were assigned in October to producer-director  Otto, a longtime child advocate who had produced the TV movie "Adam," which  helped instigate federal legislation on behalf of missing children.  </P> <P> With the Papazian-Hirsch project, this would be the second time within a few  months that her projects were the victims of similarities in CBS movies. Last  spring she directed "Unspeakable Acts," a docudrama based on a child day care  scandal in Country Walk, Fla., close in nature to the McMartin Pre-School case.  In October, CBS aired a fictional drama with a similar plot, "Do You Know the  Muffin Man?" "Unspeakable Acts" now is scheduled to run on ABC Jan. 15.  </P> <P> Otto said that she was "most upset" about the draft she saw of "In the Best  Interests of the Child" because it takes a complicated issue and muddles it up  by oversimplifying and trivializing it: "It made it seem as though you never  know who's telling the truth. And that's just not true and it's certainly not  true in this case, in my opinion."  </P> <P> The script was weighted in favor of the father-ex-husband, she said. "You liked  him. So what it did, it made him the nice guy because she was the accuser. It  stereotyped the unhappy divorced wife and, although it may not have come right  out and said it, it implied very strongly that in cases like this, children are  coached by their mothers to say that their fathers did something to them. It  perpetuated in its way that myth."  </P> <P> To make this issue appear "unsolvable and unprosecutable . . . is not in the  best interests of the child or anybody else."  </P> <P> Morgan said that she would like to get back to doctoring "but at the same time  I feel there are things that I have to do morally, given what I've been through  -- the legal system and child abuse and the whole problem of the D.C. Jail."  </P> <P> Has she had any contact with Hillary, now 7?  </P> <P> "I don't mind your asking," she said. "I don't answer though. But I can tell  you she's OK. She's going to have a happy Christmas."  </P> <P> What did Mom get her for Christmas?  </P> <P> "Well, again, I give you the same answer. Because anything specific about what  I do makes me nervous."  </P></p>

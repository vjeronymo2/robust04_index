			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Tchaikovsky - Edinburgh International Festival THIS year the festival has a musical mission: to present Tchaikovsky in bulk and in the round. On paper this may not look a very startling proposition; but already halfway into the first week, its fulfilment is proving wonderfully ear-opening. In the words of an impassioned programme note by Conrad Wilson, 'Tchaikovsky, 99 years after his death, remains the most neglected of great popular composers. . . the truth is that we hear a handful of his works again and again while the remainder of a sizeable output is ignored.' The achievement of a more rounded composer-portrait is the goal of the 1992 musical schedule, and it has been approached with expert skill and taste. The popular pieces are not excluded - that would be a different but equal sort of absurdity - but ranked alongside others less often or indeed never heard. So there are the Violin Concerto, the First Piano Concerto and the last three symphonies - but also the other symphonies (Manfred included) and piano concertos; such orchestral rarities as the Overture on the Danish National Anthem and the cantata Moscow; a generous helping of the songs, piano solos and chamber works; and a rare opera (Iolanta) staged and an even rarer one (The Oprichnik) in concert form. One of the points proved after only a short period of festival attendance is how little justice the popular Tchaikovsky impression - of big gestures, exotic colours laid on with a trowel, emotional splurge - does to his compositional personality. In this regard, the morning recitals by the Borodin Quartet devoted to the three string quartets (and placed, interestingly, alongside one of Brahms's three) have been particularly revealing - and this in spite of the patches of ragged ensemble and rusty tuning from this usually most suave and euphonious of leading quartet groups. To proceed from the early B flat quartet movement through the D major Quartet, no 1, to the F major, no 2, has been to follow Tchaikovsky step by step in his most assiduous attempts at mastery of craft. His most characteristic mode here is, if anything, too earnest a desire to cross every t and dot every i, with the direct consequence, on occasion, of prolix point-repetition. But in the movements where the balance between form and content is exactly struck - the contained, magically tender Adagio of the First and the rhythmically asymmetrical scherzo of the Second, with its delicious sleights-of-hand with the first beats of the bar - the Tchaikovsky that emerges is a composer of singular and unparalleled richness, copious in 'feeling', but also copious in the discipline and containment of that feeling, and vernally fresh in the sheer sound of his every invention. The same heart-easing freshness was the great joy of the First Symphony ('Winter Dreams') at the close of Monday's first-rate Usher Hall concert by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra under Dmitry Kitayenko. On Tuesday the Scottish Chamber Orchestra had set themselves the fascinating task of elucidating the ties of kinship between Tchaikovsky (in the Rococo Variations and the orchestra version of the Souvenirs de Florence Sextet) and Stravinsky (in Apollo and the re-scoring of the Sleeping Beauty Bluebird pas de deux). This worked out rather less well than one hoped only because the conductor, Yury Simonov (replacing the ill Charles Mackerras), was in self-indulgent mood, demonstrating show-off stick technique rather than close communication with the SCO players, and woefully slowing Apollo down. Even so, the relationship between the two greatest Russian composers was made the nub of an out-of-the-ordinary concert adventure. Of those, over the coming Edinburgh weeks, there promise to be a good many more.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARVIN DAVIS WANTS FIRST INTERSTATE TO SELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis revealed Tuesday that he owns a  "significant amount" of First Interstate Bancorp's stock and suggested to its  directors that now may be the "ideal time" for them to sell the struggling  banking firm.  </P> <P> Davis' move did not trigger a major immediate reaction, but some analysts and  investors suggested that Davis -- a major corporate raider -- may be trying to  spark a shareholder revolt or proxy fight.  </P> <P> In a letter sent to directors through First Interstate Chief Executive Edward  M. Carson, Davis said he is dissatisfied with the bank's management, saying he  has "watched with distress" the bank's "deteriorating financial condition." He  suggested that the Los Angeles-based banking firm, historically plagued by high  overhead costs, find ways to operate more efficiently or look for a buyer.  </P> <P> With a net worth estimated by Forbes magazine in October at $1.65 billion,  Davis has some of the deepest pockets around. Still, investors generally  shrugged off the letter. First Interstate's stock hardly moved, finishing the  day at $25.125 per share, up 37.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> "The market is not sure how to read this," said Donald K. Crowley, a banking  analyst in San Francisco for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.  </P> <P> Davis and his associates declined to comment on the letter. Davis did not  reveal how much First Interstate stock he owns, but he is known to typically  buy 3% of the shares in companies he is active with. Davis made huge profits on  his stock holdings after threatening last year to buy the parent companies of  Northwest and United airlines.  </P> <P> First Interstate has been hit hard during the past year by losses stemming from  its ill-fated move into Texas in the late 1980s and problems in Arizona, where  the economy has softened.  </P> <P> Simon Barker-Benfield, a First Interstate spokesman, said the bank was unaware  that Davis was a shareholder until he sent the letter.  </P> <P> "We take his concerns seriously as we do the concerns of all of our  shareholders. We also are encouraged by the progress we have made so far this  year," Barker-Benfield said.  </P> <P> Investors and analysts said Davis is probably hoping to ignite a revolt among  the handful of institutional shareholders who control First Interstate's stock.  Some 70% of the stock is owned by institutional investors, with nearly half  owned by six institutions.  </P> <P> One possibility is that Davis may launch a proxy fight to pressure management.  Indeed, his letter was released publicly by the well-known proxy solicitation  firm D. F. King &amp; Co. A D. F. King spokeswoman said the firm frequently  releases financial information for clients. She said releasing the letter does  not mean that Davis is using the firm's proxy solicitation services.  </P> <P> Investors and some securities analysts discounted any threat and questioned  Davis' conclusion that now is the time to sell the bank. They cited the serious  slump in the banking industry and, more important, the small number of  potential buyers who could pull off such a large transaction.  </P> <P> "This is hardly an ideal time to sell a bank or parts of a bank," said John  Neff, who heads Windsor mutual fund, one of First Interstate's largest  shareholders. Neff is one of the bank's most vocal critics.  </P> <P> The list of potential buyers is growing shorter all the time. Security Pacific  Corp., once at the top of the list, acknowledged this week that it won't be  expanding for at least a year in the wake of the $320-million to $360-million  loss it expects to post in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Large New York banks once considered likely buyers of California banks, such as  Citicorp and Chase Manhattan, are having their own huge problems and are in no  position to swallow such an acquisition. Japanese banks as well are under  pressure in the wake of Japan's real estate and stock market slump. Large  regional banks are loaded with problem real estate loans or are still working  through other acquisitions. Banks that could buy First Interstate, notably New  York giant J. P. Morgan, have no interest in retail banking.  </P> <P> That leaves two most likely candidates: BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp;  Co. Neither is likely to make a bid unless it is on friendly terms, and  industry executives believe it is unlikely for now that First Interstate's  management would want to do that. In addition, Wells Fargo and BankAmerica are  digesting large savings and loan acquisitions, and also face uncertainty next  year because California's economy is softening.  </P> <P> In addition, nearly 10% of First Interstate's shares are held by Kohlberg  Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the huge investment firm. Earlier this year, KKR  willingly granted First Interstate an agreement in which it will not sell to a  buyer without First Interstate's permission until February, 1992. First  Interstate management has portrayed the investment as friendly.  </P> <P> Any suggestion that Davis may try to buy the bank himself was widely  discounted. Banking industry lawyers and executives said the layers of state  and federal regulatory laws would be so cumbersome that it would be virtually  impossible. All told, Davis would have to go through at least 14 state banking  regulators and at least three federal ones.  </P> <P> Furthermore, they said, regulators would undoubtedly frown on Davis' reputation  as a corporate raider. In addition, regulators would scrutinize the financing  of the acquisition because banks by nature are highly leveraged.  </P></p>

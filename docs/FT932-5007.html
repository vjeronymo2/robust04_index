			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Coal mine row Mr George Shiflett, president of Peabody Coal Company, ordered the dismissal of 163 Union County Kentucky coalminers yesterday after the workers disrupted a meeting he had called to discuss coal company issues, chanting that they wanted a new labour contract, Laurie Morse writes from Chicago. The incident drew loud protests from the United Mine Workers' Union, which is in the midst of a month-long selective strike against a group of US coal producers, including Peabody, over job security issues. Peabody, a division of UK-based Hanson, was selected as a fresh target for the strike last Wednesday.</p>

In his speech at the dinner, Eduard Shevardnadze described  the first official visit of the Russian president to independent  Georgia as an historic event, with which hopes are being linked  for reviving the traditions of spiritual proximity between the  peoples of the two states. "Or, speaking in political terms,  hopes for building fundamentally new Georgian-Russian relations  in the spirit of equality, mutual understanding,  good-neighborliness, and friendship," Eduard Shevardnadze said.  Shevardnadze added that this event raises hopes for a  "restoration of justice, which to us means restoring Georgia's  territorial integrity."    In his speech, Boris Yeltsin also noted the importance of  the  summit in Tbilisi. "We have made mutually beneficial and  perspective decisions in the political, economic, and other  spheres of mutual cooperation," he underscored.    The Russian president said that he is determined to continue  patiently seeking mutually acceptable solutions to the conflicts  in Abkhazia and South Ossetia in order to transform the whole  Caucasus into a zone of stability and stable peace.    In conclusion, Boris Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for the  warm and hearty welcome "which was rendered to the Russian  delegation in friendly Georgia," and proposed a toast toward  friendship between the people of Russia and Georgia, and for  their further cooperation.    This evening the Russian delegation left for Moscow. At  Tbilisi Airport Boris Yeltsin and members of the Russian  delegation were seen off by Eduard Shevardnadze, Prime Minister  Otar Patsatsia, and other officials.</p>

This action is necessary to reduce the likelihood that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch limit established for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish under halibut bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives of the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 9, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Individual copies of the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review (EA/RIR) prepared for this action may be obtained from the Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O.

The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing regulations provide a framework process for the annual specification of GOA halibut PSC limits for trawl and fixed gear fisheries and for apportioning these limits by season. Although these regulations limit the bycatch of Pacific halibut in the GOA groundfish trawl fisheries, they have resulted in conflict among and preemption of groundfish trawling operations in the GOA as different trawl fishery components compete for shares of the available halibut PSC limit. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch cap before some groundfish Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations in the GOA, even though the full groundfish harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule implements the following three measures to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Establish two GOA trawl fishery categories for the purpose of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit already established for the trawl gear fisheries (&sect;672.20 (f)). These two categories are the following: (1) The shallow-water fishery complex (pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species''); and (2) the deep-water fishery complex (the deep-water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and rockfish). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Revise the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards (&sect;672.20(h) and &sect;675.20(i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder, or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other, more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Adjust the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 1. As a result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species at &sect;675.20(h)(2) also are revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule also implements editorial changes to regulatory language pertaining to the annual specification and management of GOA halibut PSC limits. In addition, NMFS apportions the 1994 GOA halibut trawl PSC limit among fisheries and seasons as set out below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Hoechst board steps in over chemical accidents HOECHST said yesterday that its management board was assuming joint responsibility for plant safety and environmental protection, taking over the task from Mr Karl Holoubek, the board member who to date has handled it on his own, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The move follows a string of accidents at the chemical group. This led to the call by Mr Joshka Fischer, environment minister in the state of Hesse, for Mr Holoubek to step aside until a thorough investigation of safety systems could prove that a recent series of accidents at company facilities were not caused by mismanagement.</p>

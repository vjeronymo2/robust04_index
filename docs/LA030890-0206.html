			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. THEATER DRAWS 8 GROUPS FOR 1ST SEASON;  </P> <P> MUSIC: SEVERAL GROUPS ARE SWITCHING TO THE NEW 750-SEAT IRVINE THEATRE, WHICH  IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN OCTOBER, BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE AND LOCATION.  </P> <P> Eight Orange County music groups and presenting organizations -- including a  new chamber orchestra -- will play at the new Irvine Theatre during its  inaugural 1990-91 season, theater general manager Douglas C. Rankin announced  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The organizations range from the new Irvine Chamber Orchestra, which will hold  its first concert on March 19, 1991, to the UC Irvine Chamber Music Series,  which has booked six dates beginning Nov. 4.  </P> <P> Two groups -- Ami Porat's Mozart Camerata and John Larry Granger's South Coast  Symphony -- also will give concerts in other venues (see related story, F2).  </P> <P> The 750-seat Irvine Theatre, under construction on the UC Irvine campus, is  scheduled to open in October.  </P> <P> Several groups are abandoning other locations to play at the new venue, citing  reasons ranging from the hall's size to its acoustics to its location.  </P> <P> Robert Hickok, music director of the Irvine Camerata, said his group is leaving  St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, after one season there.  </P> <P> "The people at St. Andrew's are wonderful to work with," Hickok said Tuesday,  "but we need our own home, and that's what the Irvine Theatre is going to be  for us." Hickok also is dean of the School of Fine Arts at UCI.  </P> <P> Micah Levy, music director of the 7-year-old Orange County Chamber Orchestra,  is giving up two locations: St. Joseph Center on the Orange Campus of Loyola  Marymount University, and South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "Attendance has been declining at St. Joseph's Center and increasing at SCR. I  don't know why," Levy said Tuesday. "So we've decided to consolidate at the  Irvine Theatre. . . . It's hard to say if we will lose people from North  County. We certainly won't lose people from SCR. But we feel that the theater  will be very important acoustically, and this should help us in terms of ticket  sales and general support. It all works together."  </P> <P> John Elg, an Irvine resident and music teacher who recently founded the Irvine  Chamber Orchestra, which has yet to give a concert, believes the theater is "a  nice size for a chamber group doing 20th-Century literature."  </P> <P> "I don't think it's realistic to think we could fill (3,000-seat) Segerstrom  Hall doing contemporary music. Also, a new theater sparks a lot of interest in  artists to see that certain things happen. But if this develops, I'm not  opposed to doing run-out concerts in schools and churches."  </P> <P> Groups, dates and repertory, where available, are:  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST SYMPHONY -- John Larry Granger, music director.

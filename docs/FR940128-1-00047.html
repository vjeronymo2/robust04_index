			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c)(3) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filtration and other equipment used to protect the food from such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants be inspected, and the inspection documented, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such frequency as is necessary to ensure control. Normally, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency will be directed by the manufacturer of the filtration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. FDA is not proposing to require daily inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the filter and related equipment do not normally need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning or replacement on a daily basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(13) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor take action to ensure that unprotected cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products, raw molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish, and raw fish and fishery products are physically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separated from each other during refrigerated storage. Cooked,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ready-to-eat products are products that will not normally receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a cooking by the consumer adequate enough to kill pathogens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, any microbiological recontamination of the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after cooking can subject the consumer to health risks. Raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molluscan shellfish may contain pathogens that can cause severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illness to certain at-risk individuals, e.g., those who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immunocompromised. These individuals might know to avoid eating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raw molluscan shellfish but would not expect the same health risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from cooked, ready-to-eat products. Similarly, raw fish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery products may contain filth and pathogenic microorganisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not normally associated with raw molluscan shellfish or cooked,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ready-to-eat products (Refs. 63 and 84).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerated storage areas be inspected at least daily to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the three types of products are physically separated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each other. This check should normally be performed during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual operations, at a time when commingling of these products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is likely to take place. The agency has tentatively concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that daily inspection is necessary because products are normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moved in and out of refrigerated storage areas on a regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, creating an ongoing threat that problems will occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(14) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerated storage units operate at 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when storing raw materials, in-process or finished cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products, and fish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery products made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forming species. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that processors control microbiological hazards associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerated storage for these products (Refs. 85 and 86).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooked, ready-to-eat products as defined in proposed &sect;123.3(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and smoked fishery products (see Appendix 1) are not shelf-stable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and must be kept refrigerated to retard the growth of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms. As stated above, these products will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normally be cooked by the consumer at a sufficient temperature to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroy any pathogens that may be present. Scombroid toxin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forming species are addressed in considerable detail later in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document. These species can form a toxin harmful to humans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if subjected to time/temperature abuse after capture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proper refrigeration is essential for fish and fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products that include these species. Maintaining product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures during storage in a range that will minimize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth of mesophilic and psychrotropic pathogens is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure product safety throughout the shelf life of these products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 85). It is uniformly more convenient to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration unit temperatures than to control and monitor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal temperatures of the various products under refrigerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage, particularly when these products are in sealed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers. For these reasons, FDA is proposing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration units be operated at or below 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively finds that this temperature is appropriate because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is adequate to minimize the growth of pathogens (Refs. 85 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 86.) The agency also strongly recommends this temperature or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower for all fish and fishery products that need refrigeration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of whether safety is an issue. The agency is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially interested in obtaining comment on the appropriateness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(c)(4) the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor use instruments that monitor the temperature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration units on a continuous basis. The measurements from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those instruments must be checked and documented with such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency as is necessary to ensure control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

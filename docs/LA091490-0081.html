			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SAID READY TO PHASE OUT MILITARY BASES IN PHILIPPINES  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is ready to begin phasing out U.S. military bases in  the Philippines, acknowledging for the first time that the end of the Cold War  has lessened the need for the facilities, sources said Thursday.  </P> <P> With negotiations on the bases scheduled to begin Tuesday in Manila, U.S.  negotiators will seek a phase-out period that could last up to 10 years.  </P> <P> That would be followed by continued military access to the facilities, perhaps  on a commercial basis, after the last American forces depart, according to  officials familiar with the U.S. negotiating stance.  </P> <P> The officials said the United States will not propose a definite timetable for  departing from the facilities -- Clark Air Base in Angeles City, Subic Bay  Naval Station in Olongapo and four smaller installations. Instead, they said,  the U.S. negotiating panel will stress the need for a gradual withdrawal to  allow sufficient time for the Philippine government to prepare alternative  plans for the bases and to cushion what is expected to be another adverse blow  to the Philippine economy.  </P> <P> The bases have become an irritant in U.S.-Philippine relations under the  government of President Corazon Aquino, as a vocal nationalist minority has  stepped up demands for their removal. Opponents see them as the last vestige of  U.S. domination of a former colony, and an infringement on Philippine  sovereignty.  </P> <P> In Manila, Philippine Communists on Thursday urged Aquino to open peace talks  to end one of Asia's oldest insurgencies after an indefinite limited truce  began in Manila and northern parts of the country. The future of U.S. military  bases in the Philippines is one of the issues that should be discussed, the  Communist-led National Democratic Front (NDF) said.  </P></p>

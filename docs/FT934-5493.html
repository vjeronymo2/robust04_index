			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Fears grow over services liberalisation Trade diplomats yesterday voiced fears that continuing differences between the US and the European Union could sabotage ambitious plans to liberalise services in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. With just two weeks of negotiating time left before the round ends in mid-December, divisions between the two biggest traders over financial services, ocean-going shipping and audio-visual services seem as intractable as ever. Negotiators say failure to resolve any one of these issues would almost certainly lead to that sector being pulled off the table, with the risk that the others would follow. 'We might end up having no deal at all in services', one senior trade official warned yesterday, as US and EC services negotiators converged on Geneva in an effort to make progress before tomorrow's crucial meeting in Brussels between Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. In advance of the meeting, President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday held a 30-minute telephone conversation during which they discussed 'their mutual desire' for a Gatt deal, said a White House spokeswoman. Mr Lawrence Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, and Mr Rufus Yerxa, US deputy trade representative, yesterday met Mr Peter Sutherland, head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and key trading partners, including the EU, to explain Washington's controversial plan for two-tier access to the US financial market. The proposal, which has aroused a storm of protest from Gatt members, would distinguish between countries that have or have not, in Washington's judgment, made adequate market opening offers of their own. While all countries would be given equal access to the present US market, only those with adequate offers would be able to benefit from future liberalisation. The EU has already said the two-tier idea is unacceptable, and a number of developing countries have threatened to take their own financial services offers off the table, the exact reverse of what the US hoped to achieve. US officials stressed yesterday the alternative to the two-tier approach could be a move to pull the entire sector out of the Uruguay Round accord. The US financial services industry, once a prime mover in the round, now says the offers by Japan and some other East Asian and Latin American nations are too poor to justify opening the US market equally to all comers. In the maritime sector, the US is holding firm in refusing to include ocean-going shipping in its services liberalisation offer. EU officials, say this sector is of vital importance for members Denmark and Greece, and they may be obliged to pull audiovisual services out of the agreement if deep-sea shipping is excluded. The Commission is hoping to secure ministerial approval on Thursday for its stance on audio-visual services, such as films and television programmes, which would keep the sector within the services accord but with important restrictions. These restrictions are certain to be opposed by Washington.</p>

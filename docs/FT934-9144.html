			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Family agrees SR6bn aid package for Saudi bank Correction (published 12th November 1993) appended to this article. THE FAMILY shareholders of National Commercial Bank, the biggest bank in Saudi Arabia in terms of assets, have agreed to inject SR6bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in a rescue package that has enabled the bank to publish its first accounts for four years. The accounts, published yesterday, reflect a victory for the Bin Mahfouz family and majority shareholders who want to restore the bank's reputation after a series of damaging court actions. The family is also anxious to draw a veil over the connections of its former chief operating officer, Sheikh Kahlid Bin Mahfouz with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. NCB, the kingdom's only private bank and which holds all the Saudi royal family accounts, produced an operating income in 1992 of SR3.48bn, 41 per cent down on 1991's SR5.87bn. The accounts show that total assets dipped from SR78bn in 1991 to SR26bn in 1992, attributable mainly to the closure of NCB branches in London, New York and Grand Cayman. The injection of the fresh capital, however, has enabled the capital adequacy to be raised to 14 per cent, compared to an 8 per cent level set for commercial banks by the Bank for International Settlements. Mr Omar Bajamal, chairman of the credit policy committee said earnings, which had been hit by loan write-offs, would 'improve substantially'. The accounts note that lawsuits have been filed against the bank outside the kingdom. One of the lawsuits has been launched by Touche Ross on behalf of BCCI creditors. Separately, Sheikh Kahlid has been indicted in the US on fraud charges in connection with BCCI where he was a former shareholder. The indictment was issued by Mr Robert Morgantheau, the New York District attorney. CORRECTION TOTAL assets of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank stood at SR63.7bn in 1992, and not SR26bn as stated in some editions yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Estonian-Russian talks on troop withdrawal will  be continued in Moscow "maybe even next week," Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin announced in Tallinn today.    Commenting on the results of his two-day meetings with  Estonian Foreign Ministry Vice Chancellor Raul Malk, Churkin  hoped that the parties would agree that social guarantees be  given to retired Russian servicemen living in Estonia. Churkin  said there must be a special document for preventing possible  tension between Tallinn and Moscow. The document must be  realistic and conform with the highest standards in human  rights, Churkin pointed out.    Churkin did not rule out that Russian troops could be  withdrawn from Estonia by August 31, 1994.    Russia conditions the troop withdrawal with social  guarantees  for retired Russian servicemen in Estonia (there are about  11,000 of them). There are currently about 2,300 acting Russian  servicemen in Estonia.    Commenting on the recent statement by Estonian Defense Force  Commander Aleksander Einseln saying that if the appropriate  order were received, force might be used to push out Russian  servicemen who would remain in Estonia after August 31, Churkin  said, "We have absolutely no doubt that the position of Estonia  consists in settlement of all problems by political means,  through negotiations. The position of Russia is the same."</p>

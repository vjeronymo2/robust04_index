			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 21 Jun (EFE) -- Frantz Robert Monde,  president of the Haitian Chamber of Deputies, today criticized  the U.S. plan to establish a radio station on a ship in  international waters off the coast of Hispaniola Island to urge  Haiti's military leaders to relinquish power. Monde said it is  immoral for U.S. President Bill Clinton to expect Haitian  soldiers to stage an uprising against their generals. According  to the legislator, the United States "knows" that the soldiers,  not the generals, staged the coup that toppled constitutional  President Jean Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. To explain  the alleged immorality of Clinton's position, Monde said it is  as if the United States were to encourage U.S. Marines "who are  not homosexuals to rise up against Marines who are."    Meanwhile, former Senate President Dejean Belizaire said the  issue of exile for the military is a form of bait. "We must not  lose the country's sovereignty," Belizaire said.    The right-wing organization "Capois La Mort" said, regarding  the establishment of the U.S. radio station, that the Armed  Forces should not "yield to blackmail."    Likewise, according to Monde, the mission of Duly Brutus,  former president of the Chamber of Deputies, and Deputy Datus  Milcent, who traveled to Washington on Sunday as guests of the  "Heritage Foundation," is to denounce the plan to invade Haiti  and prove the "negative influence" William Gray, Clinton's  adviser on the Haitian crisis, has had on U.S.-Haitian policy.  Brutus and Milcent will meet with three former U.S. secretaries  of state and members of Congress during their visit to  Washington.    "Gray has no credibility to negotiate the crisis the country  is experiencing because of the circumstances under which he left  Congress," Monde argued, although he did not mention what the  motives were. In his opinion, Gray "hides under President  Aristides' table and obeys every word he says." "    On the other hand, since this past Monday, the Haitian banks  began to apply one of the measures imposed by the U.S.  Government by limiting the delivery of funds sent by Haitians  from their relatives living in the United States to $40. This  measure has caused dissatisfaction among the Haitians who  survive on the funds their relatives send. In addition, the  Haitian banks advised their clients that they could no longer  use credit card services.    On the other hand, the "Haiti Trans Air" airlines, which has  regular flights between Port-au-Prince and Miami, announced  today that its last flight to U.S. territory would be on 24 June  as a result of the measures adopted by President Clinton, who  unilaterally decided to suspend flights between both nations.  With Haitian Trans Air discontinuing flights, a measure also to  be supported shortly by "American Airlines," only "Air France"  will cover the Port-au-Prince journey, with a stopover on  Guadeloupe island, three times a week, and to Santo Domingo once  a week.    As result of the situation, hundreds of travelers remain in  the Port-au-Prince airport trying to arrange a flight out of the  country before the commercial flight suspension declared by  President Clinton enters into effect this weekend.    Similarly, Emmanuelle Constant, head of the Front for  Haiti's  Advance and Progress (FRAPH), reiterated today that the  foreigners currently in Haiti are in no danger. According to  Constant, the majority of those foreigners are still in the  country and have not heeded the calls to abandon Haiti made by  the United States and Canada, which he believes is evidence that  they are not in any danger.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dari </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Last night and today, the Golboddin-Dostum  militia martyred a number of our innocent compatriots by firing  lethal rockets into the residential areas of Kabul. A BAKHTAR  military correspondent reports that as a result of this rocket  attack by the militia, a number of our compatriots were also  injured and were taken to hospitals for treatment.    Similarly, as a result of rocket attacks and the firing of  mortar shells into residential areas, which continued during  today, much damage has been inflicted on public utility  institutions, on residents, and public property.    In response to the savage rocket attacks by the militia, the  Islamic Afghan Army's artillery delivered crushing blows on the  bases of the enenmy in Maranjan hill and Bala-Hesar. As a  result a number of the militia were killed and a number of their  positions were destroyed. The savage rocket attack by the  Golboddin-Dostum militia has no justification but their defeat.

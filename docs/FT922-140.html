			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Morland to buy 72 pubs from Inntrepreneur MORLAND, the Thames Valley-based brewer facing a hostile Pounds 101m bid from Greene King, has agreed to buy 72 pubs for Pounds 16.9m from Inntrepreneur Estates, the Grand Metropolitan/Courage joint venture. The deal, which would increase Morland's estate by about 25 per cent to 350 pubs, is conditional on Greene King's offer lapsing or being withdrawn. Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, Morland's chief executive, said the acquisition would benefit the company's brewing, wholesaling and retailing operations. 'It further enhances our excellent prospects as an independent company', he added The pubs, mostly let on 20-year leases at market rents, would extend Morland's trading area in south-east England and make a substantial contribution to profits in the first year. 'This further development in our business, following the trading agreement with Courage and distribution agreements with Boddington and Everards, makes us even more certain that the Greene King bid is too low,' Mr Clutterbuck said. Morland will finance the acquisition from existing cash resources and committed bank facilities. Net borrowings will be contained at about 26 per cent of shareholders' funds and the company does not plan to increase its gearing significantly above that level. Mr Simon Redman, Greene King chairman, described the deal yesterday as 'the latest in a series of flawed actions by an increasingly desperate board'. He added: 'Morland clearly regards a quick fix as a substitute for a sound commercial strategy.'</p>

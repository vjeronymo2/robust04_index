There is nothing wrong with this  international status we got not so long ago, for over the last  three years the gross national product has abruptly fallen.  This information was told to SNARK today by the Armenian  Minister for Economics Armen Yegiazaryan. He states that the  real gross national product in 1990 was on the level of 4 700  [figure as received] dollars per head. Last year it became  700-800 dollars per head.    In Yegiazaryan's opinion, it would be incorrect to increase  the incomes artificially, and at this stage there is no  alternative to the policy of "tightening the belt". The  minister thinks the three indexations of wages since January 1  speak in favor of this assertion, as in conformity with the  expectations there was no essential rise of the prices. "We have  a situation in Armenia when the insolvency of the mainstream led  to the drastic consumers' market contraction and, therefore,  supply decrease", concluded the minister for economics.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Argentina seek to avoid Italy Nothing is likely to stop Argentina reaching the World Cup second round today as top team in Group D. But coach Alfio Basile wants no slip-ups when Argentina meet Bulgaria at the Cotton Bowl, Dallas. The reason? Argentina do not want to play Italy in the second round. Basile's team must overcome a Bulgarian side scrambling for a third-place qualification spot. The Argentine coach is forced to make one change. Defender Nestor Sensini has a knee injury and will be replaced by Hernan Dias.</p>

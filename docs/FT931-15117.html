			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ciments Francais raises FFr600m in asset disposal CIMENTS Francais, the scandal-scarred French cement group, has raised FFr600m (Dollars 109m) by selling peripheral businesses to try to cut its debts and to offset the losses from the off-balance sheet dealings discovered last autumn. The disposals, which were completed before the end of last year, include Ciments Francais' 32.9 per cent stake in Guintoli, the French building company at the centre of the scandal, part of the group's stake in Scori, an industrial concern, and mineral interests. The FFr600m raised by the disposals will be injected into Ciments Francais' 1992 accounts. But the group will continue to benefit from the subsequent fall in its financial costs due to the cut in the interest payments on its debt. Ciments Francais has been clouded by controversy since the discovery in September of hefty losses on its off-balance sheet dealings estimated at FFr1.05bn. The company has already announced it fell into the red with a net loss of FFr740m in the first half of 1992 (from net profits of FFr113m for the same period of 1991) mainly because of the FFr655m exceptional losses on its off-balance sheet dealings.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / De Maiziere claims unity close run thing THE SWIFT moves towards German unity very nearly provoked Soviet military intervention last spring, according to Mr Lothar de Maiziere, former leader of the democratic East German government elected in March 1990. In an interview with east Germany's new tabloid Super, which is part-owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch, the former premier said that while on a visit to Moscow last spring he had sensed the tension and heard that 'there were several marshals who still wanted to drive their tanks up to the Brandenburg Gate to stop the unity process'. On his return, said Mr de Maiziere, he told Chancellor Helmut Kohl that he thought there were only three months, at most four, before the window to unity would close. The Christian Democrat leadership, to which Mr de Maiziere briefly belonged, has always maintained that the uncomfortable speed at which unity was completed was necessary for foreign policy reasons. Mr de Maiziere also said that he thought the Soviet Union would not have agreed to unity today.</p>

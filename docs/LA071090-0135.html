			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Hughes Accuser: Michael C. Denlinger, the former Hughes Aircraft Co. staff  engineer who filed a $9.6-billion "whistle-blower" lawsuit against his former  employer, is back in court.  </P> <P> Denlinger's original suit, filed in June, 1989, charged that Hughes covered up  flaws in 4.75 million microchips produced in its defense systems since 1985.  </P> <P> The Justice Department, after conducting its own investigation, decided in  March that it would not join the suit.  </P> <P> The suit was dismissed April 9 for lack of evidence. At the time, Denlinger's  attorney, William Humphreys of Santa Ana, said the dismissal was a procedural  matter, and he vowed that he would file an amended suit.  </P> <P> An amended suit, with what Humphreys said are basically the same charges, was  filed June 6. Richard Dore, a Hughes spokesman, said the company filed its  answer denying all charges on June 28.  </P></p>

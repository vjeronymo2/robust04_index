			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDICAP PARKING  </P> <P> Recently in Sherman Oaks I returned to my car after doing some shopping and  found a printed piece of paper stuck to the outside of my windshield. This is  what it said: "This parking is reserved for the handicapped.  </P> <P> You are in violation!" The paper wouldn't come off, so I had no choice but to  drive with it there. It hindered and endangered my driving; it clearly had been  placed directly in front of a driver's eyes for the purpose of doing just that.  When I got home I confirmed that it had been glued to the windshield.  </P> <P> Ironically, whoever stuck that note in place must have more malice in his heart  than sense in his head. Had his eyes been open he could scarcely have avoided  seeing the conspicuous hand control just under the steering wheel. Or the  fender sticker that says "Paralyzed Veterans of America." Or, most important of  all, the special license plates.  </P> <P> Plates bearing the prefix "DV" (disabled veteran) or "DP" (disabled person)  entitle the driver to the same parking privileges as does the more familiar  windshield card.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, any person who himself has a disability has little excuse for not  knowing about them. And would, in any event, be well advised to just leave a  note under the wiper blade of an offending car. Or call the police and let them  handle the matter. Malicious vigilantism is scarcely becoming to those of us  who enjoy special parking privileges only through the admirable generosity of  the general public.  </P> <P> WARNER CLEMENTS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Observer: Down and out Glasses were being raised at Number 11 Downing Street last night, but not in honour of its new occupants. The occasion was a fund-raiser arranged months earlier by Mrs Rosemary Lamont for the Family Service Units charity. That could be handy, since the organisation specialises in helping people with no jobs and no homes. But the Lamonts should have been forewarned. FSU's last reception, a year ago, was at Canary Wharf and sponsored by Olympia and York, its owners. Days later, the development went into receivership.</p>

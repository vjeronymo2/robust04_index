			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: John Surman's Brass Project The 10-piece Brass Project - trumpets, trombones and rhythm section - is a luxurious vehicle for John Surman's baritone saxophone to ride solo with. As is the case for any of Surman's many means of musical conveyance, it is distinctly European in design, veers to the left field, and is physically demanding of the man himself. The Brass Project has been around since 1984, when Surman first collaborated with his 'musical director' and co-writer John Warren. It stands alongside his work with Synths (for the German ECM label), or accompanying the icy vocals of Karin Krog, as a favourite way to play. Musically, the present show at Ronnie Scott's Club (until tomorrow night) is a long way from his first date in the club with the house band, under saxophonist Scott's leadership, 24 years ago. 'I wasn't paid much in those days,' he teased the proprietor. 'We're not paying you much today,' came the tart reply from the wings. Mixing originals (like Warren's rolling 'New one two') and standards (a soulful 'The thrill has gone') Surman is both waywardly mobile and mischievous with both baritone and soprano saxophone. Four trombones (three of them bass instruments) provided rumbling ostinato passages over which Surman edgily flurried baritone notes. Alternatively, searing harmonies from three trumpets laid the ground for jaunty soprano and occasional piano accompaniment. Alone with a straight blues walking bass and drum, Surman, who is classically trained, maintained a peculiarly un-American attitude in his playing - even with that genre. Bumping and squealing against a heavily laden brass section, his arrangements remain strangely European in accent and eccentricity. For sophisticated technique and emotional commitment, the leader himself is still hard to beat. If American Gerry Mulligan is the name immediately associated with this friendly but cumbersome instrument, Devonian John Surman has surely done more to test its possibilities - and it's upper registers - in a variety of settings. And for a daring improvisor with a disarmingly unpretentious rapport with his audience, a club setting suits him fine.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bezmenov: "Rostov Becomes the Business </F> Center of the North Caucasus"]    [Text] The people of Rostov may remember this spring  by virtue of the introduction of major construction projects  coming one right after another--first there was the Whole World  park, a kind of Rostov "Disneyland" (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 24  May), and now--the International Business Center. The initiators  of the latter project managed to enlist support from large-scale  investors at the Ceetex International Investments Exposition  held in London. The European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD), East-European Bank, and Deutsche Bank agreed  to finance this project--the first international business center  in the south of Russia. An impressive amount of money was  required--at least $40 million. Yesterday the Tandem  Corporation, established for construction of the business center  in Rostov, started searching for consulting firms in Europe to  conduct the project marketing.    The Tandem financial-industrial corporation was  established in 1994 in Rostov-on-Don for constructing the  business center and carrying out foreign economic transactions,  investing in the production and installation of sewage systems  and modular pavement surfacing, and delivering and servicing  public utility and road construction equipment. Tandem was  founded by the Moscow concern Stroydormash and a number of  Rostov enterprises: the joint-stock companies Stroydormashservis  and Rostovsotsbank, the Elektroapparat conversion plant, the  city administration, and private firms.    Tandem general director Igor Gorin informed KOMMERSANT-DAILY  that the business center in Rostov-on-Don will include office  space occupying 35 percent of the center area, a top-quality  hotel (25 percent of the area), conference halls, sports  facilities, restaurants, and stores. The total area of the  center is 25,000 square meters. The matter of foreign  investments was virtually resolved during the course of talks in  London. Magne Haga, head of the CIS Division of EBRD, assured  Mr. Gorin that the bank was prepared to assume 70 percent of the  expenditures. The guarantor of these investments is the Russian  Government and Rostov City Administration--which is allocating  the land for construction. The financial director of Deutsche  Bank, Mr. Lars Saunus, noted that German bankers were interested  in establishing a business center in Rostov that would improve  operating conditions for FRG businessmen in the south of Russia,  the number of whom is quite great. Agreement with the  East-European Bank was reached prior to the start of the  exposition.    It is highly likely that the list of investors will expand.  Tandem has enlisted the support of British intermediary  companies (the London firms J&amp;B Direct Introductions  International Consultants, Dixon &amp; Company) prepared to begin  the search for new investors--under the condition, of course,  that European banks extend guarantees. In such event, the volume  of construction will have to be expanded since the  intermediaries seek investors for projects costing not under  $100 million.    The general contractor for the Rostov project will be the  major German construction company Strabag International GmbH in  Dortmund. Ireland's Independent Project Management intends to  erect the hotel for the business center. Successful project  implementation (the authors of the concept are counting on  recouping their outlays in five to seven years and on achieving  profitability on the order of 28 percent) will enable Rostov to  consolidate its position as the business center of the region.    [begin box] Founded in 1796 on the banks of the River Don,  Rostov has always been a traditional "merchant" city. The city's  advantageous geographical location contributes toward the active  development of local commercial structures, mainly in the sphere  of trade. Through the Taganrog Bay, the Don is connected to the  Sea of Azov, Black Sea, Aegean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Sea  of Marmara. Freight passes through the Volga-Don Canal from  Moscow to Rostov and return. In addition, the city is a major  railroad and motor vehicle transportation center.</p>

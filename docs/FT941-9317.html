			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Weakness in gilts and other European markets brought a retreat in stock index futures and undermined the cash market, writes Joel Kibazo. Independent traders adjusting positions led the selling early in the session after the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened the new account at 3,373. The selling briefly steadied with the release of favourable producer price index figures. However, dealers were soon reflecting on the weakness in the gilts and other European markets which brought further selling of the contract, pulling the cash market lower. One dealer said: 'The cash market surprised us with its resilience, given this kind of weakness in the futures.' The firm start in New York failed to lift the gloom and having traded at a discount for most of the session, March ended at 3,354, a 9 point discount to its fair value premium to cash which now stands at around minus 5 on this account. Volume was a modest 10,822 contracts at the official close. Turnover in traded options was well down on Friday's strong total, reaching 41,377 against 72,492 contracts. Business in the index options was also down reaching only 18,003 in the FT-SE 100 option. In the stock options, HSBC traded 2,943 lots and was followed by British Gas at 2,632 lots. Barclays, Asda and Lucas Industries were also busy.</p>

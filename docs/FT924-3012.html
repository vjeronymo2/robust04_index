			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Waigel unveils investment incentives THE German government yesterday approved a package of corporate tax reforms designed to make the economy more attractive for investors, and stem a large net outflow of investment capital. The key elements in the draft law are a reduction in the peak rate of corporation tax on retained profits from 53 to 44 per cent, and a cut in the tax on distributed profits from 36 to 30 per cent. There are also measures designed to help small and medium-sized companies, including a new tax-free allowance of DM500,000 (Pounds 206,000) for death duties. The tax reform package was presented to the cabinet yesterday by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, who said it was intended to maintain Germany's competitiveness as an investment location. Many countries had reduced their top corporate tax rates to between 30 and 35 per cent, he said. The package is intended to be self-financing, and the tax cuts have been balanced by the reduction in a series of tax allowances. Thus the depreciation allowance on movable assets is cut from 30 to 25 per cent. The draft law, intended to pass through parliament next year and come into effect on January 1, 1994, includes an extension of supplementary depreciation allowances on investments in east Germany by two years, to the end of 1996. The suspension of property tax and working capital tax in the eastern Lander will also be extended to the end of 1995, Mr Waigel said.</p>

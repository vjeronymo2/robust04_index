			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Major makes friends in east Europe: Former Soviet satellites want more than just EC membership THERE was a simple objective behind Mr John Major's tour of central Europe this week: to convince the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to look to Britain as their natural ally in western Europe. As he returned home yesterday, the British prime minister was content he had made a good start. But he had learnt also that the aspirations of the former Soviet satellites are running far ahead of what is on offer from the west. The leaders of the three countries accepted with alacrity an invitation to visit London during Britain's presidency of the European Community later this year. They praised Mr Major's commitment to act as a sponsor in their efforts to secure membership of the EC by the turn of the century. Making appearances in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest does not quite add up to striding on the world stage. But fresh from his election victory, Mr Major left behind him an image of the sort of secure political leader they need to fight their corner in the western club they are so anxious to join. In Prague Czechoslovak president Vaclav Havel publicly congratulated the British electorate on their choice on April 9. In Budapest, President Jozsef Antall was equally effusive about Mr Major's efforts to play a prominent role in shaping Hungary's new relationships with the west. Mr Major intends to reinforce that goodwill by putting preparations for enlarging the Community at the centre of the six-month British presidency which begins in July. He is aware that even Hungary, the most advanced of the three in terms of the transition to a market economy, is unlikely to be ready for membership until the year 2000. For Poland, in the grip of political paralysis and economic crisis, even that looks impossibly ambitious. In Czechoslovakia, the impending elections have put a serious question mark over its future as a unitary state. And, despite the evidence of blossoming capitalism in all three countries, they remain desperately poor by EC standards. From this Mr Major concludes that the Community must do more rather than less to reassure them that the pain of economic adjustment will in the end be rewarded with membership of the club. He promised to press during the presidency for a joint declaration publicly committing the Community to their eventual inclusion. On a more practical level, he will seek to ensure that the association agreements signed with Brussels last year do not have to wait for formal ratification by every EC state before being put into action. He takes as the basic premise a view that an organisation established to entrench democracy in western Europe cannot now deny the same framework to the fledgling democracies of the east. His stance has also a domestic political dimension. Mr Major is aware that the aspirations of his European partners to deepen rather than widen the Community may produce in two or three years a new series of tensions within his own Conservative party. He wants by then to have entrenched, as a positive alternative to federalism, the notion of a Community of 20 or so sovereign nations. If this happy coincidence of self-interests brought him an enthusiastic welcome in central Europe, Mr Major was told by his hosts that membership of the Community marked the beginning rather than the end of their ambitions. The recurring theme in the three capitals was that the rebuilding of communist economies along capitalist lines had to be accompanied by much stronger guarantees of their political and military security. In Warsaw, Mr Jan Olszweski, the Polish prime minister, warned that the security vacuum in the area needed to be filled by a pledge to extend Nato's security umbrella to central Europe. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) was not strong enough to replace the anchor once provided by the Warsaw Pact. Mr Havel made the same point in Prague, drawing a comparison between the 15 permanent staff who work for the CSCE and the 30,000 employed by the United Nations. Like its neighbours Czechoslovakia wanted the security of the US military umbrella which could only be provided by Nato. It was not a pledge that Mr Major could give. With much of the former Soviet empire in turmoil, no western leader is prepared to pledge an extension of the military guarantees which underpin Nato. A vague suggestion that it would be a natural corollary of EC membership was as far as the British prime minister would go. Mr Major's hosts did not press the point. They judged that their visitor had demonstrated his credentials as a powerful sponsor of their cause within the Community. Now he must deliver.</p>

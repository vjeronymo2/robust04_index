			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Simpler credit licensing sought The government is proposing to simplify the consumer credit licensing system as part of its drive to cut the burden of red tape on business. The Office of Fair Trading issued a consultation document yesterday which canvasses the idea of extending the system of group consumer credit licences to trade associations, professional bodies and non-commercial organisations to reduce the need for traders to apply for individual licences. A consumer credit licence is required to carry on one or more activities of consumer credit, consumer hire, credit brokerage, debt adjusting, debt counselling, debt collecting and credit reference agency. At present there are some 350,000 consumer credit licences in existence. Only 16 are group licences. Each must be renewed every five years, placing a considerable burden on traders and administrators. Last year the OFT issued almost 19,000 new licences and 4,718 renewals. Extending the group licence to trade associations and other non-commercial organisations would allow members of such groups to be covered by one licence. Responsibility for regulating members and ensuring they were fit to offer consumer credit would pass to the association or group. Mr John Mills, OFT director of consumer affairs, said it was looking at ways of encouraging more self-regulation while maintaining high levels of consumer protection. He said the OFT's policy until now had been to confine group licences to a few professional bodies and advisory organisations. But there might be other organisations such as trade associations which would also be able to take on the obligations of a group licensee. The Law Society is the largest current group licence holder, covering 58,586 solicitors in England and Wales. Other group licences are held by bodies which represent solicitors, accountants and chartered surveyors throughout the UK. Such licences do not authorise any of those covered by them to canvass debtor, creditor, supplier or regulated consumer hire agreements off trade premises - anyone wishing to do so needs a standard licence specifically authorising that activity.</p>

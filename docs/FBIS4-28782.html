			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Iran Government Must Not Make Accusations </F> or Interfere in Thailand's Internal Affairs"]    [Text] The Iranian Embassy in Bangkok issued a statement  on 9 June urging the Thai Government to be vigilant against  Zionists who use Thailand as a tool to discredit its government.  The statement said the Zionists had created a false terrorist  scenario. It added that Iran opposed and condemned all forms of  terrorism against the life of innocent people and regarded them  as inhumane and un- Islamic.    Earlier, the Iranian Government through its Foreign Ministry  protested against the Thai police's arrest of three Iranians on  charges of colluding to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok to  avenge the Hebron massacre. One of those arrested was suspected  of being the driver of the bomb-laden truck which was involved  in an accident near the Israeli Embassy and who had subsequently  fled abroad.    The Thai officials did not disclose how they had obtained  information about the terrorists. By charging that the Zionists  had created a false scenario, the Iranian Embassy was probably  referring to any Jewish group or person. Zionist is the  definition of a Jewish who seeks to create a Jewish nation. A  Jew who believes in this doctrine works openly or secretly, and  sometimes illegally, to achieve his goal without regard to the  effect his action may have on others. Based on this  characteristic of Zionism, Iran has charged that Thailand was  being used by Zionists as a tool to create hatred toward it.    As a member of the mass media not under government control,  we wish to argue against the Iranian Government. Thailand is  independent and neutral in its relations with other countries.  It treats all countries equally. It does not engage in  prejudice against any person. If a person is suspected of a  crime, he will be arrested for questioning. It is inappropriate  for the Iranian Government to use Thailand as an arena for  international political conflict, particularly as Thailand has  good relations with Israel as well.    A religious dispute exists between Iran and Israel. It is  inappropriate to make an accusation against Thailand over the  arrest of Iranians suspected of a crime in Thailand. The Thai  Government has the perfect right to investigate and try the  suspects free from interference by any government.    We do not want to see Thailand used by any country as an  arena for waging a cold war or any kind of war. Regarding the  Iranian Government's reminder to Thai officials to promptly  process the case for the sake of clarity, Thai officials are  already doing so with due care. A reminder from any government  is not necessary because the case affects Thailand's security.  The Thai people earnestly desire the case to be solved so that  Thailand will not be viewed suspiciously by other countries,  which would affect foreign investment and trade.    If the suspects did not commit any wrong doing or if there  is  insufficient evidence, we are confident that the Thai court will  dismiss the case. Therefore, we urge the Iranian Government to  treat Thailand fairly. It should not feel that Thai officials  might be so gullible as to use information from the Zionists to  convict the suspects.    The Iranian Government's action is regarded as interference  in Thailand's internal affairs. If it persists, obstacles will  result in its diplomatic relations with Thailand, despite the  fact that trade and political relations between the countries  have been proceeding smoothly with very few problems. Please  cease your interference in an internal affair that affects only  Thailand's security and public safety.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rheem filed a ``Petition for Waiver,'' dated July 15, 1994, in accordance with section 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. The Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 15, 1994, Rheem's petition and solicited comments, data and information respecting the petition. 59 FR 47317. Rheem also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on September 7, 1994. 59 FR 47317, September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Rheem Petition. The FTC did not have any objections to the issuance of the waiver to Rheem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Assertions and Determinations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rheem's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Rheem requests the allowance to test using a 20-second blower time delay when testing its GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces. Rheem states that since the 20-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate, and since such a delay results in an average of approximately 3.0 percent improvement in energy efficiency, the petition should be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay times of less than the prescribed 1.5 minute delay. Rheem indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these exceptions for its GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the blower controls incorporated on the Rheem furnaces are designed to impose a 20-second blower delay in every instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the 20-second blower time delay when testing the Rheem GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces, today's Decision and Order exempts Rheem from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing with the 20-second delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is, therefore, ordered that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Rheem Manufacturing Company. (Case No. F&hyph;075) is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Rheem Manufacturing Company, shall be permitted to test its GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedure specified in 10 CFR Part 430, with modifications set forth below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.0&blank;Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82 with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.10&blank;Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Rheem Manufacturing Company shall comply in all respects with the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures appropriate to the GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces manufactured by Rheem Manufacturing Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the petition is incorrect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Effective November 1, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Rheem Manufacturing Company on September 7, 1994. 59 FR 47317, September 15, 1994 (Case No. F&hyph;075). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued In Washington, DC, on November 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Christine A.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Niangui (2621 1628 6311)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- All-China Federation of  Trade Unions held a forum here today to discuss publishing "Deng  Xiaoping's Works on the Working Class and Trade Unions." It  also issued a circular on studying the works, in which it urged  the trade unions at all levels to integrate the study of the  works with that of Volume 3 of Deng Xiaoping's Selected  Works. They should earnestly study and read the original  works by bearing in mind the reality of trade union work,  grasping the essence of the works, and applying the scientific  theories to arm themselves, and directing their practice so as  to bring about prosperous development in trade union work and  the workers' movement in the new historic period.    Attending the forum were Wei Jianxing, Yu Qiuli, several  scores of cadres from the Federation, and the representatives of  staff members and workers. Speaking at the forum were Yu Qiuli;  Zhang Dinghua, vice president of the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions and first secretary of the Federation's  Secretariat; Gu Dachun, former vice president of the Federation;  Yang Chungui, vice president and professor of the party school  under the CPC Central Committee; and Liu Li, leader of the  operation group of the western district international affairs  bureau under the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Bureau.  They pointed out: In directing the grand cause of socialist  modernizations, reform, and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  has always attached great importance on the working class and  trade union work. His important expositions on a series of  issues, such as relying on the working class wholeheartedly and  bringing into full play the role of trade unions, represent his  scientific summarization on China's workers' movement and trade  union work. They also represent the most powerful ideological  weapon to bring about the sound development of the workers'  movement and trade union work in China and constitute the  important component of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. They contended: Earnestly studying  and deeply exploring Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideology on the  working class and trade unions is of great, practical, and  far-reaching importance to deeply understanding the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to implementing  in an overall way the party's basic line and its fundamentally  guiding principle of relying on the working class  wholeheartedly; to actively exploring a new way for the trade  union work of socialism with Chinese characteristics; to  vigorously creating a new situation in trade union work; to  uniting with and mobilizing hundreds of millions of staff  members and workers to closely rally round the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core; and to uniting  as one and waging arduous struggles so as to win an important  and great victory in the socialist cause with Chinese  characteristics.    In editing the publication of "Deng Xiaoping's Works on the  Working Class and Trade Unions," the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions has selected 55 works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with  regard to the expositions made by him on the working class and  trade unions during the various periods. Of these works, those  that first became available to the public include "The Outline  of His Report Made at the Urban Work Conference Sponsored by the  Southwest Bureau" and "The Issue on the Correct Relationship  Between the Party and Mass Communities."</p>

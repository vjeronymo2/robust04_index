			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / People: Interventionist climbs Whitehall ladder Taking a further step up the Whitehall career ladder is Robin Mountfield, 53, who is to become the Treasury's new deputy secretary in charge of civil service pay and management. The job provides a broad perspective of the civil service and has been used in the past to train promising mandarins for the top Whitehall role of permanent secretary. Mountfield, who has been at the Treasury for less than a year after a 19-year stint at the DTI, is currently head of the Treasury's industry division. For most of his civil service career Mountfield has been known as an unashamed interventionist, who was thrilled by his 1970s job of taking the aerospace industry into state ownership. It is testimony to his flexibility of character and good nature that he continued to prosper during the laisser faire years of Lady Thatcher. With the UK government now stepping up efforts to make Whitehall more sympathetic to the needs of industry, Mountfield probably feels his star is in the ascendancy. Taking over from him as head of the Treasury's industry division, which also carries the rank of deputy secretary, is Steve Robson, 49, who is currently in charge of the Treasury's public enterprises group and is an expert on public expenditure. Mountfield replaces Michael Scholar who becomes permanent secretary at the Welsh Office. Scholar displaced Hayden Phillips, who left the Treasury to become permanent secretary at the Department of National Heritage.</p>

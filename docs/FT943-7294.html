			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: Humane observations - 'More Cuddles Now' on the Edinburgh Fringe The perceptibly larger share of drama claimed by gay themes at this year's Edinburgh fringe still leaves room for old friends such as Jack Klaff, whose acute and humane observations on the way of a man with a maid (and vice versa) can be seen at the Assembly Rooms. More Cuddles Now has all the Klaff virtues: a wicked ear for the banalities of dinner-party profundities, the quickfire kaleidoscope of cliches behind which we almost but do not quite hide, and the self-sustaining jargon with which we salve hurt pride - 'You're really forcing the pace,' says the disgruntled man when the woman is offered a high-powered job in his field. 'We should have a discussion about how fast we're to walk.' Klaff portrays all the characters, not as an impersonator but as a sketcher with a lightened tone and economic body language. The central thread is the relationship between Mike, of Aldwych Films, and Kim, who comes to him with an idea for a film on children and art. Growing attraction is charted, with Klaff's customary amusement at external cool and internal turmoil, hopes, fears, agonising self-consciousness. ('This woman hasn't blinked for 12 minutes,' is one desperate inner comment.) He fancies himself, she gushes. Their affair is fondly chronicled ('unique . . . never been able to talk to anyone before'), the living together and clashes over life-style ('I don't think you know what pastel means]' 'For me pastel is girlie'). Rifts and rows prompt a ventriloquial episode with a squeaky-voiced quark that takes the place of conscience for both partners. Towards the end, kids, serenity and the death of Kim are telescoped into a bumpily-attained happy ending: 'We showed them. We made it]' Klaff's satire on how the sexes communicate is as affectionate as ever without losing its bite. His repertoire now includes a monstrous id, ape-like and bellowing, inside Mike, providing a counterpoint to the careful political correctitudes he comes out with, not always for the most correct of motives. Funny thing, relationships . . . Also at the Assembly Rooms, 7:84 Scotland gives the premiere production of Twilight Shift by Jackie Kay. Kay is a considerable poet, and her heightened sense of language (even including rhymed couplets at times) permeates the play. It all adds to the unreality of this study of a gay relationship in a small mining community. It is any sense of that community which is lacking, however. There is no feeling that Joe, the homosexual barber, has ever faced hostility or the need to conceal what he is, though the audience is evidently meant to take this for granted. Steven Wren plays him as uncomplicatedly cheerful as opposed to the tortured emotional writhings of his secret lover, Alexander, a married man with a child. The cast of four is completed by the two men's womenfolk, grandmother and wife respectively. Deirdre Davis's Ella is intelligent and touching as she perceives her husband growing away from her. Her tendency to compare herself with the heroine of Middlemarch (the book, Penguin edition, mark you, not the television serial) I attribute to the traditional superiority of Scottish education in even small mining communities. The climax is wildly contrived - the revelation of a love between the fathers of Joe and Ella - and only just avoids melodrama. Iain Reekie's direction is intense, spare and stylised, except for some rather glassy-eyed fondling for the men. The recorded poem of a child mine-worker is beautiful. But then the play is the work of a poet, whose characters are explored in a vacuum rather than the fully depicted world of a natural dramatist.</p>

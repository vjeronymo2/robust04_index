			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 14 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe Monday [14 March] slammed the United Nations saying  it lacked the "determination" to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "I don't have the feeling that officials on the ground --  those who represent the UN secretary general -- are firmly  committed to resorting to force everytime it's necessary," Juppe  said on Europe 1 radio.    "One must act faster and be more determined," he said,  referring to this weekend's failure by North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation warplanes to retaliate against Serb forces in the  western Bihac region, despite calls for strikes by French  peacekeepers.    One French peacekeeper was killed in the Bihac pocket last  week.    French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who visited Bihac on  Sunday, strongly criticized "the often overly long delays, (and)  the too heavy administrative and political procedures"  preventing immediate retaliation when blue helmets come under  fire.    He had earlier spoken of his concern to the UN's special  envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi.    Juppe, for his part, said that "Americans, Russians and  Europeans had to convene again around a table," failing which  there could be no global solution to the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia.</p>

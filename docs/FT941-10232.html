			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Another victim of the fall-out in chemicals: Why pressure has mounted for a reorganisation of Europe's fibres sector Reorganisations are beautiful. Or so the giants of Germany's chemicals industry seem to think. If Hoechst goes ahead and puts its huge synthetic fibres operation into a separate legal entity, it would be only the latest in a series of moves that are splintering the chemical empires of continental Europe. These empires span fibres, bulk and speciality chemicals, pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Once the backbone of a huge manufacturing sector, the 1990s have seen profits slide under the weight of over-capacity, recession, imports and high wage costs - aggravated by social policies and strong currencies. Germany has proved especially vulnerable. The German Chemical Employers Federation, the BAVC, says that chemical industry wage costs rose by 42 per cent between 1984 and 1992 in western Germany. In the UK they gained 18 per cent, while in the US they fell by 31 per cent. As a result of these factors, a tide of reorganisation has washed over many parts of the European chemicals industry. In agrichemicals, the Common Agricultural Policy is leading to a cut in the acreage under cultivation by up to 20 per cent. Last July, Shell sold its agrichemicals business to American Cyanamid, and Hoechst and German rival Schering merged their plant protection divisions. Petrochemicals has seen chronic overcapacity undermine prices and profits. This January alone saw the closure of BP Chemicals' ethylene production plant at Baglan Bay in South Wales and the completion of the sale of ICI's polypropylene division to German company BASF. Now fibres seem to be in the firing line. Hoechst last May merged its viscose and acrylics operation into a joint venture with UK company Courtaulds, under the latter's management. Bayer, Hoechst's arch rival in Germany, will next week hive off its textiles division into a new subsidiary. The move means lower wage costs as Bayer trims perks and other special payments to employees, without formally leaving the fixed pay scales of the German chemicals industry. Du Pont, of the US, is in the midst of a programme to cut 20 per cent from the operating costs of its European fibres businesses. Meanwhile, Akzo of the Netherlands said that 2,600 fibre jobs are at risk if workers at its German fibres plants do not accept a 10 per cent wage cut. Fibres have come under pressure for several reasons: An explosion in European and Japanese investment in synthetic fibre manufacture in Asia. Imports now account for some 40 per cent of the polyester filament consumed in Europe. Asian countries supply the overwhelming majority of that. Shrinkage of the European textiles industry - the fibre manufacturers' main customer base. Import penetration exceeds 50 per cent in parts of the clothing and textiles industry. Again the competition is based in Asia, so European textiles companies are lobbying for cuts in prices of European made fibres. High wage costs. Although Hoechst denied that this would be a reason for hiving off the fibres operation, doing so would enable it to follow Bayer and reduce wage costs towards the levels paid to workers in the textiles industry, traditionally well below those in chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Hoechst says that it has not yet made the decision to hive off the fibres operation in Europe. But the pressure is rising.</p>

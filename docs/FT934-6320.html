			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nobel little changed at SKr298m Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals group to be taken over by Akzo of the Netherlands, yesterday announced profits little changed at SKr298m (Dollars 35.6m) for the first nine months of 1993, from SKr304m last time. However, the company said it was benefiting from low interest rates and the sharp fall this year in the value of the Swedish krona. It predicted that full-year profits would 'improve somewhat' over the 1992 result of SKr237m. Nobel and Akzo announced earlier this month an agreed deal under which Akzo would pay SKr16.6bn to take control of the Swedish company. Nobel is 73 per cent-owned by the state through Securum, a 'bad bank' set up to group the bad debts of the state-owned Nordbanken. When combined, Akzo-Nobel will be the world's biggest paints group and the second largest pulp and paper chemicals producer. Nobel said currency hedging had blunted the effect of the falling Swedish krona, knocking SKr247m off operating profits in the nine months. The operating profit was down at SKr819m from SKr836m last time, in spite of a rise in sales, to SKr17bn from SKr15.8bn. However the group, which has most of its production in Sweden, said the currency fall had strengthened its competitiveness. It said the unwinding of its hedged position would lead to stronger results in the first half of 1994.</p>

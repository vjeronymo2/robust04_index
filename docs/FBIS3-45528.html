			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Learn From Persons of Outstanding </F> Ability, Protect Persons of Outstanding Ability"]    [Text] The deeds of Comrade Chen Wensong, former Dalian  Shipyard director are heartbreaking and reveal the brilliant  features of a contemporary entrepreneur who was a Communist.    As a Communist, Chen Wensong always bore in mind the lofty  responsibility and mission on his shoulders. He said: "I am  primarily a party member, then a director." His strong  enterprising spirit, selfless devotion, style of being upright  and honest, and his broad vision of attaching importance to  solidarity and taking the overall situation into consideration  were precisely the embodiment of a high-level party spirit.  Chen Wensong's sterling character and fine style are in the  same strain as the numerous heroes and models in our party  history.    As a contemporary intelligent entrepreneur, Chen Wensong had  his own characteristics of the times which differed from those  of past heroes and models. Facing new problems and new tests,  he did not flinch and nor did he waver. He courageously met  them face on and learned the art of swimming in the sea of the  market economy, while improving his talent in the practice of  reform and opening up. His strategic eye stood high and saw far  and his superb and wise decisionmaking and managerial abilities  enabled him to successfully lead the enterprise out of the  valley and, furthermore, dash toward the world market,  eventually joining the advanced ranks in the world shipbuilding  industry. Every one of our cadres who are party members should  follow the example of Chen Wensong and inherit the party's fine  traditions, while continuously absorbing the rain and dew of the  times to continuously renovate themselves and always stand at  the forefront of the times.    From a secular angle, Chen Wensong was very poor, did not  have rich properties, nor had he been given the senior  professional title to which he was entirely entitled and nor  could he have enjoyed more warmth and happiness in his family  reunion; nevertheless, from the concept of life value, he was  very rich -- he possessed a cause he cherished and had  undeniable successes; he had won the party's trust as well as  mass support and devotion and the spiritual heritage he has left  people is invaluable.    Here, we should like to strongly appeal to the many Chen  Wensongs striving at the forefront of economic construction:  For the cause of the party and the people, for your enterprises  as well as your families, please prize your own health and  lives, for your health and lives do not belong to yourselves  alone. We should like to strongly appeal to the various  relevant leading organizations: Do please prize and do your  best to protect the Chen Wensongs who are going all out to work  for the party and the people with selfless devotion!</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] You can imagine that people in Israel followed  this morning's events with a lot of attention, concern, and  hope. The first Palestinian police officers have arrived in the  occupied territories and in Gaza. As for our special  correspondents, Isabelle Baechler and Patrick Voigt, they were  in the company of Palestinians opposed to this autonomy treaty:    [Baechler] It is 1130 in a house in the Beach Camp district  of the town of Gaza. Most of the men watching the historic  moment of the signing in Cairo are on the list of terrorists who  are most wanted by the Israeli Army. They are Fatah Hawks, the  military branch of Yasir 'Arafat's organization. They are a bit  sullen, despite the process of autonomy which is under way:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified Fatah Hawk, in Arabic, with  superimposed French translation] We are happy. We have been  waiting for this moment for a long time, but we fear that  nothing may come of it. This is not the first time that  agreements have been signed, but thus far we have not seen any  change.    [Second unidentified Fatah Hawk in Arabic, with superimposed  French translation] We are happy, but we are still wanted.  Normal people are rejoicing, but we are still in hiding.    [Third unidentified Fatah Hawk in Arabic, with superimposed  French translation] All right, they are signing today, but as  recently as yesterday the Army erected roadblocks to capture us.  [end recording]    [Baechler] The Fatah Hawks will not lay down their weapons  until the new Palestinian authorities ask them to do so. What  is different for them today is the fact that they feel closer to  the new power. The entire population of Gaza is hoping. These  800,000 Palestinians packed together on 375 square kilometers  are waiting for signs of sovereignty from their future state.  For the time being, nothing has changed. Israeli soldiers are  still here, right in the center of Gaza. [passage omitted]</p>

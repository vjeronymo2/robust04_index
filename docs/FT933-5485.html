			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Keidanren to stem party funds THE KEIDANREN, Japan's leading business grouping, yesterday endorsed a plan to stop contributions to political parties from next year. The decision will cut off funding of more than Y13bn (Pounds 83m) a year to the Liberal Democratic party, which lost power last month. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, Keidanren chairman, said the move was in response to heightened public criticism that corporate gifts to political parties led to corruption. The Keidanren's move will also affect some parties in the new coalition government which depend on corporate contributions. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, who has pledged to clean up politics by cutting links between companies and politicians, has been forced to pare this down and is now calling for a ban in corporate donations in five years' time. However, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the Keidanren's decision was inevitable, while Mr Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the LDP, criticised the move, saying the current system had contributed to a 'clean' flow of funds. The Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, has acted as a conduit of funds from its members to political parties since 1955. The decision is likely to prompt similar moves by businesses and other industry associations. Mr Hiroshi Saito, Keidanren vice chairman, president of Nippon Steel and chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said the steel industry would follow the Keidanren's line. But Mr Yotaro Iida, another Keidanren vice chairman and chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, said he opposed an immediate halt of corporate donations. The Keidanren is calling for the introduction of public subsidies for political parties and an increase in donations from individuals. Mr Hiraiwa expressed support for the ruling coalition's plan to use Y60bn a year in public funds, or Y500 a head, to support the parties. This plan has run into increasing criticism, and the coalition may be forced to cut the amount. But Mr Hiraiwa yesterday said ordinary Japanese might be able to shoulder an even larger amount. The Keidanren said that it would help the LDP repay loans totalling Y14.5bn from eight leading Japanese banks. The business group will solicit donations of Y10bn over the next three years, but it will leave the LDP to repay the remaining Y4.5bn by itself.</p>

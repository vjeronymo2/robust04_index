			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Sobolev report: "Lever of Equilibrium. Kalmykia, </F> Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia Have Joined the `North  Caucasus' Association"]    [Text] "The past does not divide us, it merely reminds us  that the future of Russia and the Caucasus are entwined....  Recognizing that the Caucasian war was a tragedy for all the  peoples of the Caucasus, we must strive for cooperation, mutual  understanding, and peace in the region." These were the words  of Nikolay Yegorov, speaking for the first time as Russian  minister for nationalities affairs, at a rally in Nalchik. It  is well known that in Krasnodar Kray, whose administration he  used to head, he actually managed to prove that such mutual  understanding is possible: Interethnic conflicts were avoided  in this area where representatives of various peoples live. It  is no accident that it was Yegorov's idea to assemble the  political leaders of the North Caucasus at a major council which  would enable them to pool their resources in order to tackle  common tasks more effectively.    The next step on this road was the conference of the "North  Caucasus" Social and Economic Cooperation Association held just  the other day in Krasnodar; this was attended by official  delegations from the region's republics, krays, and oblasts, as  well as representatives from Volgograd Oblast, Kalmykia, Crimea,  Abkhazia, and South Ossetia.    Association Chairman Nikolay Pivovarov announced that at the  conference Kalmykia was granted permanent membership of the  "North Caucasus" Association, and Crimea, Abkhazia, and South  Ossetia were granted associate membership.    Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme  Council, announced that "the Abkhazian leadership opposes the  division of the Caucasian peoples by new state borders" and  supports "the restoration of comprehensive ties that have been  broken off." Consequently, he expressed his satisfaction that  Abkhazia has been granted associate membership of the "North  Caucasus" Social and Economic Cooperation Association.    For its part, Crimea too needs effective contacts with  neighboring regions of the Black Sea coast. There are plenty of  reasons for this, one of which is the problem of the Crimean  Tatars which has flared up recently. Suffice it to recall the  recent speech delivered in Simferopol by Mustafa Dzhamilev,  chairman of the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly. At the present  time, he stated, thousands of Tatars returning to Crimea "find  themselves in a tragic and frightening situation." At the same  time, in his opinion, certain difficulties are being  artificially created by forces "which advocate the idea that  Crimea belongs to Russia."    Bearing in mind that, according to some reports, the Crimean  Tatars are starting to receive weapons illegally from Turkey, it  is clear that the unpredictable "Tatar factor" could become the  catalyst for a major conflict on the peninsula. And the  position of the North Caucasus republics, united as they are in  a social and economic cooperation association, could serve as a  stabilizing lever of equilibrium in Crimea given their religious  affiliation.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIRING PROGRAM FOR PASADENANS ADOPTED  </P> <P> A "First Source Agreement," requiring developers in Pasadena to provide jobs  for city residents first before considering non-residents, was approved Tuesday  by the Board of Directors.  </P> <P> The board also approved spending $48,756 to implement and administer the  program.  </P> <P> The agreement was devised to comply with the Growth Management Initiative  passed by voters last year.  </P> <P> The policy was initially opposed by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and  Jurgensen's grocery store, which thought that it was unconstitutional and  overly burdensome to developers and employers. They withdrew their objections  after the policy was revised.  </P></p>

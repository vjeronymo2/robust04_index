The court initially sentenced Sun Naign to seven  years but commuted the sentence because he had pleaded guilty.  Sun Naign, 28, was among four Burmese arrested in November last  year at a house in Bangkok's Ratthewi district. Police seized  two sticks of TNT, two M-26 hand grenades, a detonator, electric  wire and handgun cartridges in their rented house.    The four said they had planned to use suicide bombs to  assassinate Gen. Khin Nyunt, the chief of Burma's military State  Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), on Burma's  Independence Day on Feb 4. Following their arrest, Thai  authorities have tightened enforcement of laws to try to control  the large number of Burmese illegally in Thailand. The move has  been criticized by the international community over the human  rights issue.    Sun Naign was previously arrested and imprisoned in 1989  after he and another Burmese student hijacked a Thai Airways  International flight from Rangoon to U-Taphao, in an action he  said was to raise international awareness of the suppression of  the democracy movement in Burma.</p>

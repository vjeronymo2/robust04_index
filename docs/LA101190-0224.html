			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT REFUSES TO HEAR KEATING'S APPEAL ON BAIL  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court declined Wednesday to hear an appeal from Charles  H. Keating Jr., the former thrift owner now in Los Angeles County Jail on fraud  charges, to lift or reduce his $5-million bail.  </P> <P> Without comment, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas signed an order that simply  denied Keating's petition. Only two of the court's seven justices -- Stanley  Mosk and Edward A. Panelli -- voted to grant a hearing on the petition.  </P> <P> Keating's lawyers could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. But they  indicated earlier that they would take the bail issue to federal court -- most  likely U.S. District Court in Los Angeles -- should the state's high court  reject the petition.  </P> <P> His lawyers also could ask Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lance A.  Ito, the trial-court judge recently assigned the case, to lower bail. Keating  and three co-defendants are scheduled to appear Monday before Ito to settle  some procedural matters.  </P> <P> Keating, former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, has been in  jail since Sept. 18, when a grand jury indictment was unsealed in court. The  indictment charges Keating and the others with 42 counts of securities fraud in  the sale of American Continental junk bonds through the 29 Southern California  branches of the company's main subsidiary, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in  Irvine.  </P> <P> More than 17,000 people, mainly elderly depositors at Lincoln, invested nearly  $200 million in American Continental bonds during a two-year period ending in  early 1989. Many said they moved their insured deposits over to securities  accounts at Lincoln because they were misled into believing that the bonds were  safe and insured.  </P> <P> Those bonds have become worthless since the company filed for bankruptcy  protection in April, 1989. Regulators, who seized Lincoln immediately  thereafter, now estimate that it is one of the worst thrift disasters ever and  will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> Though the Los Angeles County district attorney's office originally made no  recommendation on bail, Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner set a $5-million  bond for Keating. The high bail stunned Keating and his family. Keating said he  is broke and cannot pay the bail. And his attorneys have argued that his  imprisonment will make preparation of his defense more difficult.  </P> <P> Klausner, however, rejected arguments to lower the bail, citing the seriousness  of the charges and the danger that Keating would flee. Keating is the subject  of numerous civil and criminal investigations. A state appeals court also  rejected a petition to lower bail.  </P> <P> However, some prosecutors and law enforcement officials have said that they  consider the bail excessive. Had Keating been charged in federal court, one  federal agent said, he likely would have been released on his own recognizance  -- essentially on his word that he would return.  </P> <P> "It's possible that the U.S. courts will do something with this, but I wouldn't  be surprised if they didn't," said Caleb Foote, a retired UC Berkeley law  school professor.  </P> <P> Foote, a criminal-law expert and author of a book on bail, said that the bail  rule is intended to allow defendants charged with serious crimes, but not  convicted, to be released. Now, he said, that rule is often not followed, and  the result is a severe clogging of the nation's jails.  </P> <P> "The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed a level of (acceptable) bail to build up  that is just way out of line," he said. "The court has essentially deprived  defendants of that clause in the 8th Amendment that says excessive bail should  not be required."  </P></p>

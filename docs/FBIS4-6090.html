			<p>BFN     [Text] All major semiconductor makers will increase their  production of microcontrollers for home electric appliances  because there is a sign that the slump in sales of home electric  appliances in Japan has hit bottom. While Toshiba Corporation  plans to increase its monthly production of microcontrollers --  especially 8-bit products for which demand is high in the home  appliance industry -- by 20 percent by September, Mitsubishi  Electric Corporation plans to increase monthly production by 14  percent. The production of microcontrollers is a leading  indicator for predicting shipments of home electric appliances  three or six months ahead. Their plans to increase production  are noteworthy because they indicate that semiconductor makers  have concluded that business in the home appliance industry will  be on the full-fledged track for recovery as early as this fall.    Toshiba is currently producing a total of 15 million units  of  4- bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit microcontrollers monthly at both its  Oita Plant (located in Oita City) and its subsidiary Iwate  Toshiba Electronics (located in Kitakami City, with Yasuhiro  Sumitomo as its president). By September it plans to increase  production by 3 million units to a total of 18 million units.  Of the 3 million units, 2 million units are 8-bit  microcontrollers. The company will shift some production lines  for 4-bit microcontrollers at Oita Plant to Iwate company to  increase production of 8-bit microcontrollers at the Oita Plant.    Most of the 8-bit microcontrollers will be exported to  subsidiaries of Japanese home appliance makers in Southeast  Asia. This is because the subsidiaries have increased their  production "due to active demand for home electric appliances  for export to the United States, as well as due to an increase  in exports to Japan" (according to Toshiba).    Mitsubishi is producing a total of 22 million  microcontrollers -- centering on 4-bit and 8-bit products --  monthly both at Kumamoto Corporation (located in  Nishigoshi-machi, Kumamoto Prefecture) and its Saijo plant  (located in Saijo City, Ehime Prefecture). It will increase  production from the current 22 million units to 25 million  units. Some production lines for memory products at the Saijo  Plant will be diverted for microcontroller lines.    NEC Corporation also plans to increase its monthly  production  of microcontrollers by 10 percent by September from the present  34 million units to 37.5 million units. While Hitachi Ltd. will  increase production by 25 percent this summer from 16 million  units to 20 million units, Fujitsu Ltd. will increase production  by 11 percent by the end of this year from 9 million units to 10  million units.    On the home electric appliance market, the domestic shipment  of VTR's [video tape recorders] in February registered an  increase over the same period of the previous year for the  fourth month in a row. Moreover, there is a sharp increase in  imports of television sets and VTR's from Southeast Asia in  response to a growing demand among consumers for low price  products.</p>

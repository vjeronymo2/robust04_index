			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In June of 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree in a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EDF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reilly, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Civ. No. 89&hyph;0598 (D.D.C.)), in which the Agency agreed to publish a proposed determination as to whether or not to list as hazardous wastes from the production of five other organobromine chemicals by April 30, 1994 and to promulgate a final decision on whether to list on or before April 30, 1995. The Agency reserves the right to evaluate wastes from the production of other organobromine compounds in the future, if and when such an evaluation is deemed necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide a sound technical basis for this listing determination, EPA conducted another study of the organobromine chemicals industry in 1991 and 1992. Six firms were identified as currently manufacturing organobromine chemicals at eight facilities in the United States. Under the authority of RCRA Section 3007 (42 U.S.C. 6927), EPA sent questionnaires to these firms and four of them were selected for engineering site visits. These four facilities account for over 99 percent of total production. Samples of process residuals were collected during the site visits to familiarize the Agency with the types of materials generated by the industry. Later in the study, record samples were collected at facilities of the two largest domestic producers. The next section summarizes today's proposal and describes the basis for EPA's decision to list one waste from this industry. The Listing Background Document for this listing determination contains a detailed description of the Agency's basis for proposing to list one waste, and to not list ten other waste streams. The public version of this document, which does not contain Confidential Business Information can be copied at the RCRA public docket. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third criteria described above for listing hazardous wastes in 40 CFR 261.11, is applicable to this proposal on organobromine wastes. That is, wastes may be listed if they contain hazardous constituents identified in Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261 and the Agency concludes the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the other two criteria, the wastes under consideration here are not acutely hazardous and ``characteristic'' wastes are not listed separately, since their classification depends upon whether they qualify as wastes based on various tests described in the regulations. EPA notes that any of the organobromine wastes could be classified as ``characteristic'' wastes if they ``fail'' the applicable tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with its regulations, EPA determined whether there were present any Appendix VIII constituents and whether there was information on any other constituents of the waste that could lead to health or environmental concerns. The health effects data, along with other factors (generally related to exposure) required to be considered under 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3), were then evaluated to decide whether the wastes should be listed as hazardous wastes. These factors include the plausible types of mismanagement scenarios to which the wastes could be subjected and the potential of the constituent or any toxic degradation product to migrate from waste into the environment under the improper management scenarios (40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) (iii) and (vii)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of data on health effects and exposure to the wastestreams, EPA decided that certain wastes from 2,4,6-tribromophenol production warrant listing. None of the constituents have previously been listed in Appendix VIII, however. Accordingly, EPA is proposing to list 2,4,6-tribromophenol as an Appendix VIII constituent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

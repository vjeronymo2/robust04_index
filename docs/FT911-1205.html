			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television As we move towards the millennium it looks more and more probable that the main cause of international tension, instead of the politics of the Cold War, could be that old Hollywood plot favourite, water rights. Israel has given up the Sinai which has oil but no water, but the same is not true of the West Bank and the Golan Heights: they have water which is vital for Israel. Syria, Turkey and Iraq are locked into a major disagreement over the uses of the Euphrates, a water course with significance dating from the Bible and beyond. BBC2 investigates these modern feuds in Water Wars (8.10). That is followed by the consistently outstanding MASH (9.00) and then the first part of an Australian mini-series about a newspaper tycoon: The Paper Man (9.25) .....Australian newspaper tycoon? There's no such thing, surely? The story of the Soviet Union's most important Cold War turncoat, Oleg Penkovsky, is told by ace spy-chaser Tom Bower in BBC1's Inside Story (9.30). Channel 4 offers yet another introduction to its Satyajit Ray season in Movie Masterclass (11.45) where Mamoun Hassan gives a shot by shot analysis of that marvellous film 'The World Of Apu'.</p>

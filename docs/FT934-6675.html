			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Satellite operator's sell-off will make a world of difference The international commercial satellite industry is on the verge of a transformation, thanks to a plan by Inmarsat to turn itself from a quasi-public sector satellite operator into a private-sector company. Inmarsat has assets of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) and annual sales of almost Dollars 400m, which have been rising since the 1980s at more than 20 per cent a year. If it succeeds in re-inventing itself it would be a powerful rival in the private sector to the likes of Motorola, the US electronics company, in the race to create a global mobile satellite network for portable telephones by the end of the century. The plan, revealed last month, is that the organisation's 70-plus partners - the world's telecommunications companies and authorities including British Telecom and France Telecom - should be able to trade their holdings. It sounds simple, but it would mean a profound change in the way the organisation works. Inmarsat is the Cinderella of the satellite and telecommunications industries. It was created by inter-governmental treaty in 1979 to plug a gap in the fast-growing world of satellite telecoms: the provision of telecommunications services to ships, especially those from poorer countries which could not afford to offer even emergency satellite links. This public-service duty has since been eclipsed by the explosive growth in mobile telecommunications. Inmarsat's sales have almost quadrupled in the space of five years as it has expanded into portable satellite communications for emergency services, the media and airlines. Inmarsat's partners believe there is huge value locked up in their holdings, 'substantially more than the (Dollars 1bn) asset value', says Mr Bruce Crockett, chairman of Comsat, the publicly quoted US company, which is the biggest stakeholder in Inmarsat with 25 per cent. There is also a pressing commercial need for Inmarsat to distance itself from its partners. Many of them are state-owned, non-profit organisations, and private-sector companies are trying to exclude Inmarsat from sectors in which they compete. Inmarsat's assailants, led by Motorola, have a point. Thanks to the inter-governmental treaty and the links with its partners, Inmarsat has tax and regulatory advantages over the private sector. In the past this has mattered little because only Inmarsat used satellites and offered a single global network. But Inmarsat's monopoly is being challenged by Motorola and other large US electronics companies. They all want to create their own global mobile telecommunications services, based on satellites, and they argue that Inmarsat in its present form would be an unfair competitor. Inmarsat recognises the threat to its operations, and is prepared to rise to the challenge. Its director-general, Mr Olof Lundberg, says: 'If we are going to join the commercial world, we need a new set of attitudes. We need to remake ourselves. Several groups are now preparing to tackle us head on.' But time is short. Motorola's consortium has already raised Dollars 100m in cash and another Dollars 700m in pledges as the first stage in financing its mobile satellite telephone project, called Iridium. Inmarsat will propose what will in effect be its privatisation in the first quarter of 1994 and, if all goes to plan, begin the process in the final quarter. Others may follow: Inmarsat has a sister organisation, Washington-based Intelsat, and a pan-European cousin, Eutelsat. Their structures are much the same as Inmarsat's. Intelsat and Eutelsat do not face the same pressing need to change. Nevertheless, they will be closely watching Inmarsat's progress. If they decide to follow, the world of telecommunications will be changed beyond recognition as buyers of telecommunications services find a new group of suppliers knocking at their doors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis met with Russian Ambassador  Aleksandr Rannikh today. The Russian ambassador came at the  president's invitation to discuss relations between the two  countries. The Latvian president's letter to Russian President  Boris Yeltsin was submitted to the ambassador.    Speaking of progress in implementing the Latvian-Russian  agreements, Rannikh was concerned about Latvia's insufficient  practical work in the area of the Skrunda new radar station.  The Russian ambassador also told the president that at the  beginning of June the last Russian Navy warship will leave  Liepaja port and thus the Russian Navy will have completely left  Latvia.    During the talks the opinion was expressed that the Latvian  and Russian executive powers must act more responsibly and  energetically so that the scheduled visit by Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Latvia can take place by the end  of May.    Both the president and the ambassador assessed Latvia's  recent joining of the Western European Union as an associate  partner as a big success by Latvian diplomacy. Rannikh said  that this event is evidence of the unified support by Europe and  the Western European Union, which is an institution of European  security, for the package of Latvian-Russia agreements signed in  Moscow.</p>

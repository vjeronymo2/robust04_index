			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Observer: Can the twins keep flying? Who has the safer job - Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or his twin brother Bernard, chairman of Air France? Until recently, the betting would have been that Bernard boasted the greater degree of security, especially since the hullabaloo about the spending habits of the EBRD. The presidency of the London-based EBRD was never going to be an easy job, whereas the boss of France's flag carrier has long enjoyed the support of President Mitterrand. Now however, not only has the political wind swung round, but Air France's losses have only been piling higher under Attali's pilotage. If France's new centre-right government really does intend to match words with action and adopt a much tougher stance towards state-owned loss-makers, such as SNCF and Air France, then there could be some truth in the rumours that Peugeot boss Jacques Calvet may be in the running to take over from Bernard Attali. Having worked for Valery Giscard d'Estaing at one stage, Calvet's politics are more in tune with the new government. During his 10 years at Peugeot, Calvet has proved that he knows how to rationalise a business and cut borrowings. And when it comes to fighting his corner, he is, if possible, even more outspoken than British Airways' Lord King who restored the fortunes of Britain's national flag carrier.</p>

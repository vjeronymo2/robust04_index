			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Text] At exactly 1630 [2230 GMT] this evening [12 January]  a demonstration for peace in Chiapas State left the Revolution  Monument and headed to El Zocalo Square in Mexico City.  Thousands of members of people's organizations, independent  worker's unions, political parties, student groups, and human  rights advocates make up this enormous contingent. The  demonstrators -- singing, chanting, and waving banners -- asked  for a peaceful solution, not an armed solution, to the conflict  in that region. They chanted: Peace yes, war no.    Traffic remains insane, mainly in downtown Mexico City, as  groups of demonstrators continue to converge on the square.  Fortunately, no serious incidents have been reported thus far.  Security operations are being carried out by 600 units from the  General Secretariat of Protection and Highways and coordinated  with the District Judicial Police. As of this moment, no  incidents have been reported. Main roads and avenues such as  Paseo de la Reforma, Juarez and Hidalgo Avenues, Lazaro Cardenas  and Francisco Madero Street, and others have suffered the  consequences of the demonstration. It should be pointed out,  however, that commuters have realized the significance of the  grand demonstration and, instead of expressing their anger, have  understood the message of peace for Chiapas.    The obvious roads have been blocked throughout the two hours  of the demonstration, but alternate routes have also been  overcrowded. The commentary here is that fortunately no  incidents have been reported up to now, except for the heavy  traffic, especially around this main square in Mexico City.  Thousands of voices are calling for peace in Chiapas State.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0056 GMT on 13 January transmits a  150 word, Mexico City-datelined report that notes "more than  100,000 demonstrators, according to observers, chanting 'Death  to the Institutional Revolutionary Party' and 'Salinas is a  murderer,' filled the plaza in front of the National Palace."  The report also states that "the demonstrators paraded an  effigy of Emiliano Zapata, crying vivas to Zapata and painting  the Zapatista National Liberation Army symbol on walls as they  marched." According to AFP, the crowd chanted "Death to the bad  government," "cease the bombings," and "massacre or Indians,"  reminiscent of "the slogans used in Latin America during the  1960's and 1970's."]</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sandberg behind trade bank purchase SIR Michael Sandberg, former chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, is behind the acquisition of First American International Bank of Miami, a subsidiary of the BCCI-tainted First American Bank of Georgia, which is in liquidation. First American of Miami, which specialises in trade finance for Latin America, will be acquired for Dollars 6.5m by AmTrade International Bank of Georgia. Amtrade International Bank, which is being created for the Miami acquisition, also intends to start the only bank exclusively devoted to trade finance in Georgia. AmTrade International is 94 per cent owned by a holding company called Broadstreet, organised last year and chaired by Sir Michael. Broadstreet won approval this week from the US Federal Reserve for the two transactions. Mr Robert Glustrom, an Atlanta attorney who is president of Broadstreet, said the group aimed to expand substantially the trade finance business of the Miami bank, which will be renamed AmTrade International Bank of Florida. The bank last year was rolling over around Dollars 75m to Dollars 80m in trade financing every 90 days, according Mr Vincent Cater, formerly an official with First American in Miami and now president of AmTrade International. The company is linked to a network of 450 corresponding banks in 88 countries. AmTrade International in Atlanta will target small and medium-sized companies, said Mr Glustrom. He said both banks would focus on building trade finance business with Asia and Europe. The Miami branch will seek to expand its US-Latin American business to finance Latin American trade with Europe and Asia. Given the Federal Reserve's approval, the creation of AmTrade International of Georgia and the Miami acquisition are expected to be completed in the next few weeks.</p>

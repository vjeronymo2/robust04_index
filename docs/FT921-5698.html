			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: European Leisure passes preference dividend EUROPEAN LEISURE, the entertainments group, is to pass this year's dividend on its preference shares in the light of a profit warning it gave yesterday. The group is expected to announce later this month that interest payments on its borrowings, which are now in excess of Pounds 72.5m, have wiped out operating profit for the half year to the end of December. The shares fell 2p to 5p. In the first half of the year to June 1991, pre-tax profit nearly doubled from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 4.42m. Passing the dividends due in April and October will save Pounds 1.5m, including ACT. A comprehensive review of strategy and trading operations is likely to lead to the sale of a number of assets in the UK and the Continent. The disposals are expected to be made at about half their valuation, resulting in a write-down as an exceptional item for the half year. The group, advised by the merchant bank Charterhouse, has reached agreement with its banking syndicate for the provision of additional borrowing facilities through to April 1993.</p>

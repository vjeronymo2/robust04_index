			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Hong: "State Bid to Improve Builders, Architects"] </F>   [Text] A plan to license architects and improve the  supervision of building projects is being launched by the  Ministry of Construction.    The plan is being started to improve the quality of  construction in China, said a ministry official at the weekend.    And the licensing scheme has been tested successfully in  Northeast China's Liaoning Province.    It is expected to be introduced nationwide soon, said the  official.    The first examination for architects, an indispensable part  of the licensing scheme, is planned for later this year, he  added.    The trial in Liaoning has been done in line with  international practice and includes the appraisal of an  applicant's academic qualifications, professional training and  achievements.    Only licensed architects are allowed to bid for contracts,  the official said.    The move had come after years of chaos in the profession.  Unqualified people were able to practise and architects' rights  and responsibilities had long remained vague.    Designs used to be done by State-owned institutes instead of  architects.    This lack of organization has crippled many architects'  creativity and enthusiasm. And moves to improve standards have  so far been very slow, said the official.    The new system, he said, aims to bring standards  sufficiently  high that they will be recognized in other countries and regions.    Several countries, including the United States, have yet to  acknowledge Chinese architectural qualifications.    At the same time, the ministry is to expand its  building-control system to all projects in China.    Supervisors will make sure projects' quality, progress and  finances tally strictly with the contracts, the same official  said.    Under the old planned economy there were frequent lows  between owners and contractors over poor construction quality  and delayed payments because there was no supervision of their  contracts.    About 15 per cent of China's construction products are said  to be substandard last year, while building firms were owed 20  billion yuan ($2.3 billion), causing more and more distress for  project owners and contractors, said the official.    The supervision system was first brought in to cover the  Beijing Tianjin-Tangu Expressway and hydro-electric power  stations in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the late 1980s.    Now, many construction projects, including the Guangzhou  metro system, the new Beijing railway station and the gigantic  Three Gorges Dam project, are endorsing it.    Ministry officials say they plan to bring the new system  into  housing projects as complaints have been rising.    The Shanghai-based Wen Hui Daily [WEN HUI BAO] reported last  week that up to 60 per cent of the city's new homes leak.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Japan Trade Surplus Shrinks: Japan's trade surplus shrank for the fifth  straight month in September, but economists said the trend could stall if a  stronger dollar accelerated growth in Japanese exports. Japan's September  customs-cleared trade surplus fell 6.7% to $7.24 billion from $7.76 billion a  year earlier, the Finance Ministry announced. Industrial machinery and office  equipment exports were particularly strong. The drop in the trade surplus was  smaller than many analysts predicted because exports rose a surprisingly strong  4.8% from a year earlier to $24.29 billion.  </P></p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / How to Spend It: Three cheers for chainstore chic - At last, Marks and Spencer's home furnishings venture is on the right line who would have thought it? Here we have a brand-new home furnishing catalogue from Marks and Spencer which is bold, colourful - and in tune with the times. It is also slimmer and leaner than its predecessors and is all the better for it: no longer is it puffed out with dinky ornaments and dreadful pictures, or with the sort of superfluous accessories that few of us want and which add to nothing but the dusting-load. You will not be surprised to learn that it offers no radical new direction. There is little that is innovative or challenging; no new aesthetic frontiers are being opened up. Trendy or avant-garde are not the words that the catalogue brings to mind. But then, that never was what the famed UK retail chain set out to do. What it does offer is a pared down, edited selection of basics - what I once called 'the furnishing equivalent of the polo shirt, the navy-blue sweater or the blazer' - in other words the sort of thing that most houses actually need. There is a big selection of well-shaped sofas that could be covered in the currently ubiquitous checks - blue and white or beige and cream, in plain linen-like fabrics, or, if you really must, in Dralon. There is also the splendidly capacious Hampton Chair (photographed left covered in Boston check). There are 100 per cent cotton sheets and duvets in pretty stripes with matching plains. If you prefer your bedlinen in an 'easy-care' cotton and polyester mix you get a bigger ranges of colours and patterns - from an exceedingly smart rich tartan to bold geometric prints. There are pure cotton towels in a good range of colours and a series of pleated lampshades and uplighters in colours that tone with the linens and fabrics. Look out for the simple, clean-lined range of children's furniture  -everything from a white-painted wardrobe and four-drawer chest to bunk beds and bookcases. Look, too, for the range of furniture in cherrywood - the plainest and simplest of the designs seem to me the best. The sideboard which can be used on its own or topped with a glass-glazed cupboard is splendidly simple and sturdy, but at Pounds 1,998 for the two pieces (or Pounds 999 each) they cannot be said to be cheap. All in all the new M and S catalogue seems to me a vast improvement on the earlier efforts. There still seems to be a taste gap between the innovative and sophisticated nature of its food and the furnishing products it sells but the dreadful air of decorous daintiness has mostly gone, although a little lingers on in some of the china and some of the floral fabrics and bedlinens, presumably to keep faith with those customers who have already embarked on that decorative road. Abandoned, too, is the attempt to offer a total 'concept' - in its place is a collection of basics which, though certainly not cheap, are well-made in sound materials, are unobtrusive and round which the customer can build a life-style of his or her own. The catalogue costs Pounds 1 and everything in it can either be seen in the Home Furnishings sections of Marks and Spencer stores or ordered by telephoning 0925-851100. Delivery is free. If you want to see what a really first-class designer can do with the basic Marks and Spencer range, hurry along to The Ideal Home Show, at London's Earls Court until April 12, where David Davies uses the bold blue and yellow theme with great panache. If you are in the mood to give your house a face-lift and are looking for a floor-covering in the mood of the times, take a look at the flat woven woollen carpeting by Roger Oates Design Associates. In sober plains, stripes or herringbones they provide a chic and subdued background to any furnishing scheme and would fit in wonderfully with the new mood for Shaker-style simplicity. Though simple, the Roger Oates range is made from the finest wools so they are not as inexpensive as one might hope. The Venetian quality works out at Pounds 60 per linear metre (it comes as runners or as rugs). If that is more than you can afford you should perhaps consider the latex-backed seagrass which is just Pounds 10.36 a square metre. It comes in a greeny-yellow colourway, has a roughish surface (so possibly not ideal where there are crawling babies or young children) and is a splendidly neutral background to almost any scheme.

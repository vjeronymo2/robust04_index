			<p>BFN     [Summary] A news conference was given by President  Nursultan Nazarbayev at the national press-center in Tokyo. He  said he is satisfied with the results of his first official  visit to Japan. He emphasized the importance of the joint  Japan-Kazakhstan committee for cooperation that unites 32  leading Japanese companies. Missions of 16 Japanese companies  have opened in Kazakhstan. President Nazarbayev expressed hope  that their number will increase after his visit to Japan.  Nazarbayev spoke about prospects for future cooperation with  Japan. According to him, the most promising areas for  cooperation are the oil and railway industries, mainly in the  Asiatic region.    An unexpected resignation by Japanese Prime Minister  Hosokawa  will not affect the implementation of agreements and treaties  that were signed between Kazakhstan and Japan, said Nazarabyev.

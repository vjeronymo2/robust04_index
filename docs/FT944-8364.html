			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Irish wait to see which way Spring jumps: John Murray Brown assesses the tough choices facing the Labour leader As Ireland's political parties try to patch together a new coalition government in the wake of the last week's crisis, all eyes are on Dick Spring, the Labour leader and outgoing deputy prime minister and foreign minister. The choice of coalition is largely Mr Spring's, in many ways the principal actor in last week's drama, which resulted in the collapse of the 22-month coalition and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister. He has three options. He can go back into coalition with Fianna Fail under its new leader, Mr Bertie Ahern - the unanimous choice of the party on Saturday. Labour and the conservative Fine Gael, the main opposition party could put together a government with one or both of the smaller opposition parties (the Democratic Left or the Progressive Democrats) although this would produce a paper thin majority in the 166-seat parliament. The third option is to go to the country, and seek a new mandate. Overriding all this is another concern: that a protracted search for a new government could damage the Northern Ireland peace process. A poll in yesterday's Irish Independent suggests Mr Spring is the main beneficiary of last week's turmoil. Confidence in his performance is at an all-time high of 69 per cent. His party's standing is at 19 per cent. If he heeds the results, a Fianna Fail coalition seems inevitable: 43 per cent are in favour, while, perhaps more significantly, only 27 per cent want a general election. Returning last night after a weekend in his North Kerry constituency, Mr Spring may well have reflected that he has been here before. In 1992, his rating and his party's were also on a high. Even his parliamentary speeches  -attacking Fianna Fail in a no confidence motion in November 1992 - have an uncanny resemblance to last week's assault. And yet just two months later, in January 1993, Labour was in coalition with Fianna Fail, for the first time in the history of either. How different is it this time? Mr Ahern is from the left wing of the party. Indeed, as a former trade union negotiator, he earned a reputation as an effective conciliator. Mr Ahern is also said to have a special relationship with Labour's Mr Ruairi Quinn, who as employment and enterprise minister was a key architect, with Mr Ahern, of the government policy programme under the outgoing administration. Mr Ahern is described as a Fianna Fail moderate. On social and moral issues, some commentators believe he may be closer to Labour than his party's mainstream. In Ireland, much has been made of the openness with which he has discussed the breakdown of his marriage. However, in his acceptance speech after winning the party nomination on Saturday, he promised social reform 'that takes account of our distinctive values and convictions' - a remark which seemed to be aimed more at Fianna Fail traditionalists than designed to court his possible coalition partner. A coalition with Fianna Fail would have some supporters within Labour's parliamentary party, anxious to avoid an election and confident in the carve-up of cabinet jobs that Labour could dictate the terms to a cowed Fianna Fail leadership. Labour party managers will be only too aware that yesterday's poll, although showing increased support for Labour, actually only restores the position the party enjoyed prior to the 1992 election. Labour was bitterly criticised for betraying grassroots support. Indeed, the party's strong showing in the 1992 election, where it secured 33 seats, was largely because the voters believed they were voting Labour to root Fianna Fail out of power. At grassroots level, Mr Ahern, who was present at the cabinet meeting on Monday, is just as culpable as Mr Reynolds in misleading parliament over the paedophile priest extradition case. Mr Jim Kemmy, Labour's chairman and an astute judge of grassroots mood, made it clear over the weekend he opposed another deal with Fianna Fail. Given Mr Spring's personal difficulties with Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, that alternative would be difficult to imagine. Moreover, Labour party managers will be aware that with three or more parties in coalition, Mr Spring would have difficulty arguing for as many the six cabinet portfolios which the party held in the outgoing administration. If both options are ruled out, then the only alternative will be a general election. It all rests with Mr Spring. See Editorial Comment</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "pw": "A Poor Army"] </F>   [Text] "This year's Defense Ministry budget is so  limited that the country's security is endangered," said General  Zbigniew Zalewski, chief of the logistics inspectorate of the  General Staff, during yesterday's economic meeting of Army  leaders.    It was the first economic meeting since 1989 with the  participation of commanders of all military districts and of  commanders of all types of the Armed Forces.    Acting Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak, who took part in  the  meeting, argued that the Defense Ministry's budget is a result  of a "difficult compromise," but the military present at the  meeting were of the view that it is the Army that is the victim  of the compromise. Gen. Zalewski argued that it would be easy  to help the Army by limiting tax levels because it is "illogical  for the Army to put money back into the budget and then use this  same money."    The officers argued that the Army finds it hard to adapt to  the market economy. They complained of a lack of laws that  would make it possible for the Army to sell unused buildings,  storage areas, or garages, while there is no money to continue  to maintain the premises.    The topic of wasting resources in military housing, revealed  by the Supreme Chamber of Control, was discussed repeatedly.  According to the general cadre, "deficiencies of human nature"  were the main reason for what happened. The logistics chief  assured that clearing up the issue completely and bringing the  guilty to justice is in the Army's interest.</p>

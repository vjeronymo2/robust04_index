			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: Islamic tradition rewarded - Architecture IS there an architectural future? With more than a third of the architectural profession out of work and a Government keener on belt tightening than expansion, the immediate future could well be described as gloomy. Architecture is not like fashion. We are told that skirts get longer when times are bad. Buildings do not get any larger - they just do not get built. September is a month for looking ahead after the summer break, and this year I can see that there are not going to be so many new buildings to write about. The in-tray is, however, far from empty. There is a lot of cultural activity ahead and I foresee considerable debate about the need for unfashionable things like centralised planning of the infrastructure, the renewal of the housing stock and the development of policies for expansion that will be environmentally safe and appropriately green. In the run-up to the United States presidential election, the democratic candidate is already promising to spend billions of dollars on the collapsing infrastructure of America's cities. In Japan, the government has decided to spend millions of yen on urban and transport projects. In the United Kingdom, there is a sense of dismay at the failure during the 1980s to secure an alliance between the state and the private sector that really worked. The dreadful shadow of Canary Wharf casts a pall over Mrs Thatcher's efforts to rejuvenate the inner cities. That failure was undoubtedly caused by a refusal to recognise the Government's responsibility for improving infrastructure. Problems in the building world of the United Kingdom are put into perspective by a glance in the direction of the politically uncertain states of Eastern Europe and the countries of the third world. There is one architectural agency that consistently draws attention to the achievements and problems of architects working in the Muslim world and that is the Aga Khan Award for Architecture. This award is not just a prize, it is a complex and well funded process that began by alerting Islamic countries to the dangers of ignoring their particular architectural legacy during the oil-boom years of the 1970s. The award combines its search for the best architectural achievements with a teaching programme in Islamic architecture at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at schools in Pakistan and Jordan. It is an immaculately managed award and some of its seminars have been highly constructive, particularly in the field of housing and in the debate about architectural tradition. This year the prize-giving ceremony itself achieves a particular distinction by being held in the newly created independent Republic of Uzbekistan in the ancient Muslim city of Samarkand. From some 259 entries, the international Master Jury has chosen nine projects, ranging from the restoration of the seventh century city of Kairouan in Tunisia to the careful improvement of a squatter settlement in Yogyakarta in Indonesia. One of the nine entries that exactly matches the aim of the award - 'to navigate between the twin dangers of slavishly copying the architecture of the past and of foolishly ignoring its rich legacy' - is the Pan African Institute for Development at Ouagadougou, in Burkina Faso. The campus is modelled on Volta village plans and is built entirely of the local material of stabilised earth brick. The award tries to encourage architects and builders working in Muslim countries to avoid the anonymity and alienation of much contemporary architecture that is built with no sympathy for its immediate surroundings and no acknowledgement of tradition. The prize funds are generous - some half a million US dollars - and the winners will be announced in Samarkand on September 19. The Aga Khan Award has not ignored the best contemporary architecture and one of the architects it has commended is the Frenchman Jean Nouvel. He is really famous for one building - L'Institut du Monde Arabe on the banks of the Seine in Paris. This is an amazing marriage between Moorish traditions and high technology. From December 16 he is to be the subject of a exhibition in London at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. His opera house for Lyons and his conference centre in Tours will be included in the show and I am particularly looking forward to seeing his 'Tour Sans Fins' the tallest tower in Europe and the slimmest in the world to be built at La Defense in Paris. This has been described as, 'emerging from a dark crater it appears to dematerialise as it rises, seeming to soar from the centre of the earth to the skies.' * * * European architecture is to be featured strongly in the forthcoming BBC television series, 'Building Sights Europe' which starts transmission on a weekly basis on Sunday evenings on September 27. The composer Iannis Xenakis and the playwright Vaclav Havel are two of the contributors who select buildings they like. Richard Burdett, who runs the Architecture Foundation in London, chooses the house on Capri built during the Second World War for the Italian writer Curzio Malaparte. It was liked by both Mussolini and Brigitte Bardot. . . * * * The Architecture Foundation exhibition about the City of London 'City Changes' is to be extended until October 2 at the Royal Exchange - it is worth seeing if only to compare the recent crop of new buildings in the City with the quality and potential of some of the other cities of Europe.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of  the peace conference on former Yugoslavia, had a meeting with  Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu in Bucharest this  morning. At the end of the talks, the head of Romanian  diplomacy said:    [Begin Melescanu recording] It was a discussion whereby Lord  Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg briefed us on the results of the Geneva  talks on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We had a  discussion on the prospects for a peaceful solution of this  conflict. Of course, the two mediators also expressed the  desire to discover the opinions, views, and suggestions of  Romania and the Romanian Government on the continuation of the  peace process. I believe that I can sum up the visit by  describing it as an integral part of the efforts undertaken by  the two mediators to examine the way in which the countries in  this region, the countries neighboring the former Yugoslavia,  can contribute to the progress of the peace process. [end  recording]    In his statement, Lord Owen said that, at the beginning of  the year, the explicit decision was made for the two cochairmen  to pay visits to all the countries in the vicinity of former  Yugoslavia, since there is a very strong imperative demand in  the region to solve the conflict. Here is Lord Owen's answer to  a question put to him by our radio station correspondent Doina  Saiciuc regarding Romania's possible contribution to a  resolution of the Yugoslav crisis:    [Begin Owen recording, in English with superimposed  translation into Romanian] I believe that Romania has a  considerable contribution to make. You have good relations with  the countries in the region and the countries of former  Yugoslavia. Obviously, this includes the relations with Hungary  and Bulgaria, too, but not only with them. In a broader sense  -- I am now referring to the whole region -- I know that there  is a strong relationship between Romania and Turkey. You are  feeling the economic consequences of the sanctions. These  contacts with your foreign minister are not the first such  contacts with Romania. I would like to introduce a dose of  self-criticism here, since this is indeed my first visit to  Romania. However, I have been in constant touch with Romania  and I now believe that Romania's influence on this conflict  should become more palpable. [end recording]    The two mediators in the Yugoslav crisis also had talks with  Adrian Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies. At this  time, they are meeting with President Ion Iliescu, our  correspondents inform us.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union Commercial Union has a seemingly insatiable appetite for equity. Yesterday's enhanced scrip dividend, which will add 3.5 per cent to shareholders' funds, comes hard on the heels of February's rights call and two preference share issues last year. The saving on advance corporation tax arising from the scrip - and the improving profits trend - will doubtless overcome shareholders' reservations about being asked to supply additional funds so soon. The broader question is whether CU can spend the money wisely. The rights and preference share issues are already contributing to profits growth. Investment income from the proceeds, together with favourable exchange rates, accounted for half of yesterday's Pounds 80m improvement in interim operating profits. That is not to deny the strength of underwriting recovery in the UK, which made up the remainder of the profits increase. Like General Accident, CU has now nosed into underwriting profit on most of its UK personal lines. But CU's premium growth has already slowed from the heady rate set last year, underlining that rights issue provided retrospective backing for business already written. The slow-down in its drive for market share offers comfort that CU will not plough headlong into the next UK underwriting downturn. With a solvency ratio of around 50 per cent it is hardly awash with capital even after the rights issue. Growth is more likely to come from overseas markets and life assurance. With almost one-third of group premiums already coming from life business, CU already looks more of a hybrid insurer than others in the sector.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLARK, TIGERS ARE SET TO SIGN BIG CONTRACT  </P> <P> After a month of negotiations, the Detroit Tigers appear ready to make Tony  Clark the richest high school draft pick ever, Clark's father, Arthur Clark  said Sunday.  </P> <P> Clark, who was drafted second in the nation out of Christian High School in the  June free agent draft, is expected to sign by Wednesday or Thursday and report  to the Tigers' Rookie League team in Bristol, Va. by July 16. Last season,  Clark batted .524 and hit 11 home runs in just 44 official at bats.  </P> <P> The Tigers have compared Clark, a 6-foot-8 outfielder, to the Mets' Darryl  Strawberry.  </P> <P> Currently, Clark, who has already signed a basketball letter of intent with the  University of Arizona, is playing for the West squad at the U.S. Olympic  Festival in Minneapolis. Clark, who was unavailable for comment, scored nine  points in the West's 134-120 loss to the South.  </P> <P> "There's just a couple of minor parts to be worked out, but we've agreed on the  money," Arthur Clark said. "That was a stumbling block. We're ready to sign."  </P> <P> Although Tiger officials were unavailable for comment, they are believed to be  offering Clark a signing bonus of between $400,000 and $500,000. The No. 1  pick, Chipper Jones, signed with the Atlanta Braves for a reported $275,000,  but he did not have the leverage Clark did.  </P> <P> "I'm excited for Tony," Arthur Clark said. "This is probably the best contract  any kid out of high school has ever received."  </P> <P> The Tigers and the Clark family have worked out a deal that would give Clark  the right to leave Bristol for college on Aug. 16, a week before school begins  in Tucson -- meaning Clark would only play for about four weeks this summer.  </P> <P> Next year, Clark, the state's leading scorer in basketball at 43.1 points per  game last season, should be able to play a full summer season.  </P> <P> "I don't think Tony will be in Bristol next season," Arthur Clark said.  </P> <P> Lute Olson, Arizona's basketball coach, said he expects Clark to compete for a  starting job this fall along with Chris Mills, a transfer from Kentucky.  </P></p>

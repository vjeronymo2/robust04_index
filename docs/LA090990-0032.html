			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ'S ARSENAL A PEACE BARRIER, MUBARAK SAYS  </P> <P> The Middle East can never enjoy real peace as long as Iraq maintains its potent  arsenal of missiles and chemical weapons, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said  Saturday.  </P> <P> And, without setting a deadline for the current economic sanctions to force an  Iraqi capitulation, Mubarak strongly suggested that the military threat posed  by Baghdad must be eliminated within a matter of months.  </P> <P> With Secretary of State James A. Baker III standing at his side, Mubarak said  he would prefer diplomatic measures to neutralize President Saddam Hussein's  threatening weaponry but that military means may prove necessary.  </P> <P> "You know we are against chemical weapons, against the presence of missiles,"  Mubarak said " . . . I think peace will never go with the presence of all these  forms of weapons in the area."  </P> <P> Asked if he thinks there is any chance that Iraq will give up those arms unless  it is defeated militarily, Mubarak said, "We would like, first of all, to try  peaceful solutions. We shouldn't go through war solutions at all unless that is  a hopeless case."  </P> <P> By suggesting that the five-week-old gulf crisis cannot be resolved until Iraq  surrenders its missiles and chemical weapons, Mubarak went far beyond U.N.  Security Council resolutions calling for Hussein's regime to end its occupation  of Kuwait and restore the exiled emir to power.  </P> <P> Iraq has scorned the U.N. sanctions, insisting that it will never reverse its  annexation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Hussein's regime is even less likely to agree to give up its chemical weapons  capabilities without a fight. However, if Iraq reverses course and ends its  occupation of Kuwait, there would be tremendous pressure to end the economic  sanctions, making it unlikely that Baghdad could be persuaded peacefully to  destroy its chemical arms.  </P> <P> Egypt has sent several thousand troops to the multinational force in Saudi  Arabia, probably making it the second-largest foreign contingent on the ground.  While refusing to disclose exact numbers, Mubarak said Egypt will soon expand  its contribution.  </P> <P> "We are supporting the Saudis as much as we can," he said. "We will send them  the forces needed which is agreed upon. We sent some forces now. We are  intending to send other forces in the very near future."  </P> <P> So far, the Bush Administration has said that a military offensive cannot be  ruled out if the U.N.-imposed economic boycott does not force Hussein to end  his occupation. But Washington has set no deadline.  </P> <P> However, Mubarak said the crisis must be resolved -- either peacefully or by  armed force -- within the next few months.  </P> <P> He said he could not predict that the crisis would end in one, two or three  months "but I'm telling you that doesn't mean it is going to stay for one  year."  </P> <P> Mubarak and Baker met alone for 90 minutes in a lavish 19th-Century palace  overlooking the Mediterranean which once was used by King Farouk, the  free-spending libertine who was Egypt's last monarch.  </P> <P> Immediately after the meeting, Baker flew to Helsinki, Finland, to attend  President Bush's summit meeting today with Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Mubarak said he had told Baker that he hopes Bush and Gorbachev will be able to  avoid any sort of disagreement on their approaches to the gulf crisis. He said  that if there were differences "this would be a hell of a problem in this  area."  </P> <P> During a hectic three days in the Middle East, Baker discussed the crisis with  the king of Saudi Arabia, the president of the United Arab Emirates and the  deposed emir of Kuwait as well as with Mubarak.  </P> <P> Baker told reporters that he discussed the possible use of military force at  every stop.  </P> <P> However, it seems clear that no consensus has emerged on military measures. A  senior Saudi official said the kingdom opposes the use of force unless Iraq  attacks Saudi Arabia, but a member of Kuwait's exiled Cabinet said military  action probably will be needed to end the occupation and it should be  undertaken as soon as possible.  </P> <P> Before leaving Washington, Baker suggested the creation of some sort of Persian  Gulf security structure, including long-term American participation, to contain  Iraq's military might even if the crisis ends peacefully.  </P> <P> In response to questions from the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday,  Baker compared his proposed structure to the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization. The next day, in an appearance before the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, Baker said that consideration of the plan was still in its  early stages and that the NATO analogy might not be apt.  </P> <P> Saudi officials, perhaps alarmed by a banner headline in the English-language  Saudi News saying Baker had proposed "a Gulf NATO," told Baker they did not  want a NATO clone in their region but were willing to discuss other approaches.  </P> <P> After his meeting with Mubarak, Baker said, "We don't have anything  specifically in mind. . . . The president (Mubarak) and I discussed the  importance of states that are located in the region giving some thought to what  form of security arrangements can best guarantee peace and stability in the  Persian Gulf after we get beyond the current crisis."  </P> <P> As for long-term deployment of U.S. forces in the area, Baker noted that  Washington has had at least a token naval presence in the gulf since 1947.  </P> <P> In one consequence of the crisis, Mubarak hinted that he may be ready to end  Egypt's support for Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat,  who embraced Iraq's invasion.  </P> <P> "The (Israeli-Palestinian) peace process is not only for Yasser Arafat but the  Palestinian people," Mubarak said. "So, anything that is done by Yasser Arafat  doesn't mean we are going to stop dealing with the Palestinian problem."  </P></p>

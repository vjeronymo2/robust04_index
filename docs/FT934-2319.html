			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Russian reformists pin their hopes on Yeltsin's support The survival of economic reforms in Russia depends on President Boris Yeltsin's will to push them forward, leaders of Russia's divided and shaken pro-reform camp said yesterday. The most popular reform party Russia's Choice become more confident that, in coalition with the three other main reformist parties, it could command more seats than the combined anti-reform forces of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, Communists, and Agrarians. The earliest results were for parliamentary seats being selected by proportional representation from party lists. First results yesterday for seats filled on a first-past-the-post basis suggest that reformists may have benefited by being unaffiliated. Reformists seem to be winning such seats because many are former officials whose names were recognised by voters. The latest results for the seats being drawn from party lists which are being determined by proportional representation, gave Mr Zhirinovsky 24 per cent, followed by Russia's Choice with 15 per cent, the Communists with 11 per cent, and others, including Mr Yavlinsky's Yabloko bloc, about around 7 per cent. Although serious bargaining on forming a new government was delayed as participants waited for proper 'working results' before committing themselves, the main parties spelt out their conditions for joining the government. Mr Zhirinovsky, whose ultimate goal is the presidency, said he would join a coalition government only if his party could occupy the foreign ministry, defence, security and interior ministries. Yesterday he adopted a more moderate tone compared with his on-the-stump comments, in an effort to soothe critics fearful of his ultra-right and expansionist platform. He promised not to'destabilise' the situation if he was left out of the government, indicating that he would use parliament to increase his popularity. However, all the main pro-reform parties have excluded any co-operation with Mr Zhirinovsky. Mr Yeltsin, who has said he would use his new powers to pursue democracy and reforms, has made no comment about Mr Zhirinovsky's electoral success. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the second largest reformist party after Russia's Choice, said the reformers' success would depend entirely on how President Yeltsin used the sweeping and permanent powers granted to him by Russia's newly approved constitution. Mr Yavlinsky said any new cabinet would have to be homogeneous and not like the present government in which 'one third is building communism, one third is building capitalism, and a third are looking after their personal affairs.' He said it was also essential to give up attempts to dash to financial stabilisation overnight because the fight against inflation would only lead to 'bloody clashes'. He said the electoral victory of Mr Zhirinovsky's 'national-socialist' party of was in large part a reaction against reforms which had been harsh and incoherent.

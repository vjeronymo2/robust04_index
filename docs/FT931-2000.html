			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (20): Force for radical change - Software: object-oriented technology will lead to upheavals THE abstract and esoteric world of computer software shares one thing in common with the real world; it has the equivalent of an 'ecology.' And, like the real world, the structure of this ecology is subject to changes and shifts as a result of external pressures. Advances in hardware technology, increased user-demand and straightforward improvements in software itself have come together to create a force for radical change in the ecology of the software world in the last few years. Experts talk of 'paradigm shifts' and 'revolutions.' At the heart of this upheaval is a new way of thinking about information technology called object-oriented technology. It aims to define a new approach to the design and construction of information systems and the software which supports them. The ecology of the software world defines the relationships between the building blocks of modern computer systems. It includes everything from the basic operating software, which controls the internal workings of the system, to the graphics-based 'front end' interface which the user sees. Traditionally, these components have been closely tied to each other, overlapped in their functionality and been mainly concerned with internal technology issues such as performance and system efficiency. By contrast, the object-oriented approach aims to separate software into a set of components according to their function and define ways in which they can talk to each other. Traditional engineering provides an analogy. Engineers see a motor vehicle, a washing machine or, for that matter, a computer system, as a series of components which are connected together to create the finished product. Each of the components - a motor, an electronic controller, and so on - has a pre-defined function and standard links to connect it to other components. SYSTEMS designers and software engineers can use the object-oriented approach in the same way to re-define the ecology of computer software. Object-oriented also introduces several new ideas to thinking about computer software. Objects can, for example, be 're-used' in other applications. New objects can be created easily from existing objects. As a result, it promises to improve programmer productivity and make long-term maintenance easier. Object-oriented technology is gaining ground - both among suppliers, which see it as an opportunity to expand the scope of information technology products, and among users who see it as a better way to solve their information processing problems. UK market research company Ovum forecasts staggering growth in the market for object-oriented technology between now and 1997. Last year the combined US/European market for object-oriented software - including development tools, languages and databases - was worth Dollars 865m. This will rise to over Dollars 4bn by 1997 and, although the annual growth rate will have fallen back from its current high of 69 per cent, it will still stand at 27 per cent a year. The rush to move into object-oriented technology is confirmed by other sources. The Object Management Group (OMG), an organisation founded in 1989 to promote the cause, reports that the embryonic US market for object-oriented databases grew from Dollars 18m in 1991 to Dollars 60m last year. Mr Christopher Stone, president of OMG, says: 'Compared with the early growth rates for relational database technology about ten years ago - this represents a high early acceptance of object-oriented systems.' The level of interest is also reflected in the growth of the OMG itself. It now has over 300 members, including all of the leading hardware and software companies from IBM to Microsoft. Mr Stone also reports an upsurge of interest from user organisations. This year, there are three big conference/exhibitions taking place in the UK alone - including the OMG-sponsored Objectworld. This level of interest is reflected throughout Europe and the US. There is good cause for this strong interest in object-oriented technology. It promises to change the ecology of software for the better and correct many mistakes of the past. Mr Steven Cook, managing director of the UK object-oriented software specialist Object Designers, sees the level of interest moving from the exploratory to the pragmatic: 'We founded our company to help large users make strategic long-term decisions about object-oriented technology. Their position has shifted noticeably from asking what it is to asking how it can be done.' MR COOK is the chairman of the Object Technology 93 conference in Cambridge at the end of March and notes that prospective attendees are asking practical questions: 'Object technology is obviously going to effect the whole ecology of software and applications. Users want to know what is going to happen.' 'There is a stage when the penny drops and people start to realize how powerful object technology can be,' explains Paul Fitzgibbon, marketing director with UK software company Protek. Some users are already building systems using the object-oriented approach. Kredietbank in Belgium has started a pilot project to analyse balance sheets using the approach. It uses Hitachi's Object IQ development package running on a network of Hewlett Packard computers. 'We chose ObjectIQ - not for its object-oriented capabilities but its rule-processing features,' explains Dr Marc de Brabanter, head of Kredietbank's research and development team. 'We've long-term plans to use more object-oriented techniques - but these are driven by the business. The tools we want just happen to be object-oriented,' Dr De Brabanter adds. Few users have reached this stage of course. But with the growing bandwagon and the inevitable surge in marketing hype, it will not be long before users will have to take account of the new ecology for software.</p>

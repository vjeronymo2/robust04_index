			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today we received one of the most important pieces  of news of the year, a true happening, a news bomb, if you  permit me the exaggeration, because it is something really  significant.    The arrest of former President Luis Garcia Meza has been  officially confirmed. The news has shaken the country. The  capture occurred in Brazil. But I would prefer that Minister of  Government German Quiroga inform you himself, through a special  note prepared by Gabriela Orosco at Government Palace. The  minister made official what we advanced at noon today. This is  the official communique, read around 1230.    [Begin Quiroga recording] The government reports to the  public the following:    1. Citizen Luis Garcia Meza, former de facto president of  Bolivia, who was condemned by the Supreme Court to 30 years  imprisonment without pardon, was captured early today in the  Brazilian city of Sao Paulo.    2. Citizen Garcia Meza surrendered without offering  resistance. He was captured while returning to his residence.  Garcia Meza was staying in that city with false documents.    3. This has been an operation coordinated by Bolivian and  Brazilian authorities working together.    4. The Foreign Ministry is taking steps before the  Brazilian Government to extradite Garcia Meza to Bolivia.    This is all the information we can release at this time.  Thank you. [end recording]    This was what the minister of government said in making  official what was learned unofficially through the state channel  at noon today.    Let us ratify the information. Luis Garcia Meza was arrested  at Guarulhos Airport -- one of the two international airports in  that important Brazilian city -- by the airport police at around  0800 this morning. At the time of his arrest he was accompanied  by Gualberto Rico, who was one of his assistants during his  1980-1981 dictatorship. Rico was arrested for carrying false  documents. The airport police arrested Garcia Meza on charges  of carrying false identity documents.    Two possibilities are being studied: first, his extradition;  and second, that he be expelled to Bolivia. Apparently the  Brazilian Government does not want anything to do with Garcia  Meza; it does not want to hold him a single minute longer than  necessary, and it might want to deliver him to Bolivian  authorities immediately.

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Swiss departure tax The Swiss government has approved increases in departure taxes at the country's two biggest airports, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. As in so many other things, the old Swiss joke - 'they do it differently in every canton' - applies. At the moment, departure taxes for international flights range from SFr10 (Pounds 4.60) in Lugano to SFr12 in Bern, SFr12.50 in Zurich, SFr13 in Geneva and SFr15 in Basle.  From November, the tax at Geneva will rise to SFr14.50 and that at Zurich to SFr14 - and by July 1 1996 both will reach SFr15.50.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: France sells FFr3.3bn of retail-targeted OATs The new French government bonds specifically targeted at individual investors appeared to have proved highly successful yesterday, with the amount already sold totalling about FFr3.3bn, the Treasury said. The state announced last month that it aimed to sell nearly FFr20bn over the next year in OATs - obligations assimilables du tresor. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, stressed that the aim was to offer government bonds to a wider audience, in the same way that the public can subscribe to bonds in many other European countries. In total, FFr19.42bn in bonds were allocated yesterday with a coupon of 7.5 per cent and due to mature in 2005. Banks are confident they can sell all of this amount to the public over the coming year, and their pressure triggered a decision by the government to double the amount offered. The Treasury said the final details of subscriptions from the public would be known by October 25.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- The United States has  demanded in the resumed "framework" trade talks that Japanese  automakers adopt specific purchase plans for U.S.-made parts,  government sources said Saturday.    The demand for the purchase plans as part of "objective  criteria" for improving foreign access to the Japanese market  was made in subcabinet-level framework talks on auto trade held  Friday and Saturday in Tokyo, the sources said.    U.S. officials also demanded as part of the criteria that  Japanese-owned auto assembly plants in the U.S. increase the  local content ratio in their production, the sources said.    The Japanese side did not directly respond to the U.S.  demands and asked that further discussions be held at the  working-level talks starting Monday, they said.    Japan told the U.S. at the beginning of the resumed talks  that it would not accept any numerical targets as objective  criteria for improving market access in Japan.    At the talks, both Japan and the U.S. presented their own  versions of a draft agreement on auto trade, the sources said.    U.S. officials also asked that a bilateral agreement  incorporate plans for purchases of U.S.-made auto parts that  five Japanese automakers recently announced, the sources said.    An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and  Industry told reporters that serious differences remain on key  issues of auto trade in the talks.</p>

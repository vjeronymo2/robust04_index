DP spokesman Rep. Pak Chi-won issued a statement attacking  President Kim's planned tour to Beijing as contrary to the  principle of "reciprocity."    "Former President No Tae-u first made an official visit to  China in September 1992, while in office," Pak said.    "Therefore, according to the principle of reciprocity, the  Chinese head of state, President Jiang Zemin, has to pay a visit  to Seoul this time," Pak insisted.    If President Kim goes through with his plan to China, the  criticism will be unavoidable that his administration hasn't yet  broken away from diplomatic flunkeyism, Pak said.    President Kim himself has said that his new administration  would carry out its diplomatic policies on an equal footing with  the world's super powers, calling it a "new diplomacy," said Pak.    "We are worried Kim is not keeping his own word. We also  fear that the so-called new diplomacy may turn into a new  slavish diplomacy," Pak said.</p>

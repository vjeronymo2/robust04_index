			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Rate cut lowers sterling Sterling yesterday moved lower against leading currencies after the Bank of England announced a 25 basis-point cut in the minimum lending rate, writes Philip Gawith. The decision to reduce rates to 5.25 per cent from 5.50 per cent received a mixed reception in the market. Some applauded the scope and timing of the move, while others questioned the government's motives and said it would harm sterling. The pound fell some two pfennigs to trade at DM2.59 before recovering to close in London at DM2.5956, compared with Monday's DM2.6111. It also declined by more than a cent to end at USDollars 1.47, down from a previous USDollars 1.4811. While sterling's drop was by no means calamitous, observers said the extent of its weakening left the rate cut 'at the margin' in terms of success. The Bank's announcement caught the market unawares. Most observers had been predicting a  1/2 percentage point reduction in late March ahead of tax increases that come into effect in April. It is 10 years since the Bank last cut rates by  1/4 point. Many in the market welcomed this new approach, saying it lent greater flexibility to the conduct of monetary policy. Others noted that it appears to represent a shift towards the more incremental, fine-tuning of policy favoured by many countries in continental Europe. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, told reporters that future interest rate cuts were likely to be of a similar size to yesterday's 25 basis points. There was some puzzlement about the timing of the move. The government said the announcement was timed to coincide with the release of its latest inflation report, but some observers queried whether the report shed any new light on the inflation outlook. The government firmly resisted suggestions that the rate move was timed to obtain political advantage. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, commented: 'This has nothing to do with elections or tax rises. It has everything to do with wanting to have interest rates as low as they can be consistent with maintaining downward pressure on inflation.' One view is that the Bank would probably have liked to delay cuts for a while, but had its hand forced by events. One commentator noted: 'They probably recognised that if they did not move now they might not be able to move at all.' Three factors in particular have lessened room for manoeuvre: the new trend in US interest rates; the prospect that the January inflation figures, to be released next week, may well show inflation rising and make presentation of a policy-easing difficult; and the fact that tax increases will soon be taking effect. Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, told reporters the decision had been taken last week at his monthly monetary meeting with the chancellor, and the announcement timed to coincide with the release of yesterday's encouraging inflation report. Another view heard in the market was that the size of the rate cut represented a compromise between the government's wish for a  1/2 percentage point change and the Bank's desire to hold its fire for the time being. The Bank was said not to want to reduce rates too much ahead of an upcoming gilts auction. The last auction was not particularly successful in attracting funds. The D-Mark and other EMS currencies traded in fairly narrow ranges with the focus on sterling. Following Friday's increase in US rates, the German currency held up quite well against the dollar to end at DM1.7658, slightly lower than Monday's DM1.7630 close. It finished New York trading at DM1.7650. The Bundesbank continued its recent practice and set the weekly repo at a fixed 6 per cent rate with a 14-day maturity. There had earlier been speculation that it might set a lower rate, which would have indicated a willingness for rates to fall. Dealers in Frankfurt said the Bundesbank was intervening in the market, buying D-Marks for dollars at around the DM1.7650 level. London dealers said there was no evidence of the central bank's involvement in the market beyond its normal covert operations. The outlook for the yen remains fairly uncertain even after the passage of a Y15.25trillion (million million) fiscal package. Although Japanese officials said it should boost GNP by 2.2 per cent over a year, comments from senior US officials made clear that the US has no intention of easing pressure on Japan ahead of Friday's trade summit between President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, in Washington. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, described the package as a 'modest step'. The yen closed in London at Y108.900 to the dollar, marginally down from Monday's Y108.705. In New York it ended at Y108.75. The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 50m of late assistance yesterday. Earlier in the day the Bank provided Pounds 1.024bn of liquidity, compared to a revised forecast of a Pounds 1.1bn liquidity shortage. The outright and repurchase agreements with the market were conducted, following the rate cuts, at new rates of 5 1/8 per cent and 5 5/32 respectively.  ----------------------------------- Pound in New York  ----------------------------------- Feb 8         Close    Prev.

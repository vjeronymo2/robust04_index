			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (7): Speroni seeks power for regions - Institutional reform Reform has been one of the most abused words in Italian politics. Much promised in every sphere of life, at best reforms have been timid and half completed. Usually, they have been still-born. Yet Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, more than any other postwar administration, has come to power with the promise of reform - from the tax system, pensions, health and the civil service to the very structure of the state. There is little doubt about the new government's good intentions. The prime minister wants to make the state apparatus work better, be 'citizen-friendly' and to reflect a more federal structure. His partners, the Northern League, have made 'federalism' their battle cry, even if the concept remains ill-defined. With an ample majority in the chamber of deputies, reform measures stand a good chance of passing through parliament without being emasculated. The main problem is establishing a set of priorities and co-ordinating policy within the government alliance. Mr Berlusconi would like to proceed as rapidly as possible with a further overhaul of electoral reform. The changes introduced at the March elections showed that the August 1993 electoral reform measures were inadequate. They managed to combine both the best and worst of the old proportional representation laws and the first-past-the-post system. In both houses 75 per cent of the seats were allocated under the first-past-the-post system. This was designed to encourage the formation of electoral alliances and promote a move towards a two-party or three-party system instead of the old 16-odd parties that made up the previous legislatures. In contrast, the retention of proportional representation, willed by the bulk of the old parties as an insurance policy for their survival, led to precisely the opposite tendency. It encouraged the permanence of small parties which retained at least a few seats. At the same time, the voting age of the senate was left unchanged from the minimum 25 years, unlike the minimum 18 years for the chamber. Italy is the sole European country that now discriminates by age for representation to the upper house. The age difference produced a slightly different voter profile in March with maturer voters still favouring the centre. As a result, the Berlusconi alliance failed to obtain an outright majority in the senate. An age change for the senate is an obvious move. But a more fundamental shift, to 100 per cent majority voting, is also required. This would either be with a single round of voting or a second round run-off, as in France. Only with such a system would the electorate clearly vote for a government and a programme. At present voters are still asked to endorse a particular party or candidate rather than a programme. The most tangible evidence of electoral reform is in the hectic activity of Mr Francesco Speroni, the bicycle-riding League minister for institutional reform. In the formation of the government, the portfolio was hotly contested by the League who wanted this ministry, along with that of the interior, as a symbol of their commitment to federalism. With elections for 15 of the 20 regional councils in Italy due next May, Mr Speroni has been drawing up proposals to harmonise the election rules for the regions with those already introduced for municipal councils. Since last year, the municipalities have seen their mayors directly elected on a voting system that also enables the winning party/alliance to enjoy a ruling majority. This combination of directly elected mayors and special provisions enshrining the principle of ruling majorities has brought about a sea-change in local government. Mayors are no longer imposed by the parties after the elections but are 'democratically elected' specifically for the task. Coalitions have been encouraged by a system of second round run-offs between the two top candidates. This has improved the municipal decision-making process considerably and ensured that local election results reflect local issues. The Speroni proposals would introduce majority voting, while allowing individual regions to opt for their own type of first-past-the-post system. But Mr Speroni's real aim is to make this the first step towards far greater devolution of power to the regions. He would like to see a high degree of fiscal devolution to encourage better use of resources and more local initiative. Until now, local government has been funded by centralised hand-outs from Rome. These were poorly accounted for and permitted the local authorities to adopt a passive attitude to administration. Mr Speroni insists greater fiscal devolution would not be at the expense of the principle of solidarity between regions. Richer regions would still be obliged to transfer part of their resources to the poorer ones. However, the latter would be placed under tight scrutiny as to how such monies are disbursed. It remains to be seen how quickly Mr Berlusconi wishes to move down this path and where he will delineate the bounds of federalism. The neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance is uncomfortable about the League's federalist impulses and will endorse no measure that weakens the unitary state of Italy. The League itself has allies outside government, notably in the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), which favours greater devolution - not least because this would permit greater autonomy in the 'red belt' of Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, parts of Liguria and northern Lazio. The government also has its eye on reforming the legislature. It is increasingly absurd to see the two houses duplicate their powers as well as their activities in debates and commissions. The attributes of the two houses need to be more complementary. Forza Italia's electoral programme proposed to transform the senate into more of a consultative and monitoring body, elected indirectly by regional councils, representatives of the provinces and municipalities. At the same time, the party pledged to increase the legislative authority of the lower house. Another proposal oft repeated by Mr Berlusconi is to introduce a directly elected president and reduce his/her term from seven to five years. The president's limited powers would not be increased, rather he or she would have increased moral authority from a popular election. In contrast, Mr Berlusconi wants to increase the powers of the prime minister as the chief executive. In all these various proposals, there is a clear move away from the former system that encouraged compromise and horse-trading to greater efficiency and transparency. But the inefficiencies of the old way of doing things were the result of a desire to provide checks and balances, and to avoid the concentration of too much power in one person's hands. There is now a danger of swinging the other way, with insufficient attention paid to providing checks and balances.</p>

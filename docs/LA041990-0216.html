			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL DELAYS DECISION ON SUING BROOKINS  </P> <P> Delaying a decision on whether to sue Bishop H.H. Brookins, the Los Angeles  City Council on Wednesday directed the city attorney's office to negotiate with  Brookins in a dispute over $48,000 he may owe the city.  </P> <P> The council gave the order during a closed session and continued the matter  until May 11, Councilman Robert Farrell said.  </P> <P> At issue is $48,000 in Community Development Department funds paid to a  Brookins organization to rent a building that Brookins owned.  </P> <P> The CDD has concluded that the money is owed to the city because Brookins had a  conflict of interest in his dual role as a landlord who collected city rent for  his property while serving as the head of a poverty program located in the  building.  </P></p>

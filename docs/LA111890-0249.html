			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: EARTH TO BIG WEST: BASKETBALL'S YOUR GAME  </P> <P> Hapless Bowl '90 is over, and we have a loser. It wasn't even close -- Cal  State Fullerton under New Mexico State, 9-43, snapping the Aggies' amazing  streak of consecutive losses at 27 and leaving the Titans all alone atop the  Division I-A football rankings, assuming you're looking at them standing on  your head.  </P> <P> They're No. 106.  </P> <P> Out of deference to Gene Murphy, we'll cut the one-liners there. Murphy is a  good coach who deserves much, much better.  </P> <P> But a crossroads was reached Saturday in Las Cruces, and it raises a question  that deserves immediate attention, along with an answer.  </P> <P> We're not talking about Fullerton dropping football.  </P> <P> We're talking about the Big West Conference dropping its football fixation.  </P> <P> The Big West has been flogging a dead horse for years, pretending to play  grown-up football without the money, the resources, the players and the  facilities necessary just to scrape together the dream. When Big West football  is bad, it is as bad as it gets. No one in the Big West can be proud of  Saturday's Fullerton-New Mexico State fiasco.  </P> <P> But even when Big West football is good, no one takes it seriously. Saturday,  the Big West also staged its championship game -- Fresno State vs. San Jose  State for a trip to the California Raisin Bowl for the thrill and prestige of  getting to face . . . Central Michigan.  </P> <P> Hurry, get those tickets today.  </P> <P> You'd accuse the Big West of fooling itself, except it consigned itself to  national obscurity by agreeing to the bowl tie-in with the Mid-American  Conference in the first place. Today, that's how the rest of the country views  Big West football -- the Toledos and the Ball States of the Pacific.  </P> <P> And now, with the sport braced for the dawning of the Age of the Super  Conference, Big West football has hit a wall it is never going to ascend or  obliterate. It is time the Big West faced facts, called off the sham, cut its  losses and let San Jose State and Fresno State go free.  </P> <P> It is time the Big West went the way of the Big East:  </P> <P> Basketball first, second and third . . . and let the football programs fall  where they may.  </P> <P> Right now, the Big West has a first-in-a-lifetime opportunity to capitalize on  an NCAA basketball championship, even if Nevada Las Vegas can't. Last April,  after UNLV nuked Duke in Denver, the Big West grabbed the nation's attention at  last. If it wants to keep it -- and the Big West has two more top 25-type  programs at New Mexico State and Cal State Long Beach -- it had better do  something about its football-and-chain.  </P> <P> In San Jose and Fresno, the Big West has two viable, thriving, year-in and  year-out legitimate Division I-A football programs. It used to have three, but  San Diego State got smart and jumped to the WAC in 1978. San Jose and Fresno  are making noises about testing the same waters, and the Big West would do best  to step aside.  </P> <P> Of course, without San Jose and Fresno, Big West football would have to be  reclassified Division I-AA. So let it. There's nothing wrong with playing  Division I-AA football. Some of Gene Murphy's best friends play Division I-AA  football. Playing Division I-AA football doesn't make you a bad person.  </P> <P> Fullerton would have room to breathe and grow in Division I-AA. So would New  Mexico State and Long Beach, which needed a PR gimmick as outlandish as George  Allen to resuscitate its program.  </P> <P> How could that be any less desirable than the current state of affairs, with  five of the Big West's eight football-playing schools unable to crack the top  90? Before Saturday, one national poll had the University of the Pacific at No.  91, followed by Long Beach at 93, UNLV at 98 and the Fullerton-New Mexico  anchor at 105 and 106.  </P> <P> The conference clearly sought to emulate the Big East in 1988 when it changed  its name from the Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. The name has caught on, helping  the Big West garner equal billing with the Big East and the Big 10 on ESPN's  periodic "Big Monday" basketball triple-headers.  </P> <P> Now, it should take the next step.  </P> <P> The Big East is a conference with its priorities in order. It exists for  basketball, first and foremost, and is regarded as the heaviest of all college  basketball heavyweights, depending on how one feels about the ACC at a given  moment.  </P> <P> Big East schools also play football -- on three levels. Boston College,  Pittsburgh and Syracuse are Division I-A independents. Connecticut and  Villanova are members of the Division I-AA Yankee Conference. Georgetown and  St. John's play Division III football.  </P> <P> Break up the Big West the same way. Let San Jose and Fresno joust their  big-time windmills as either football independents or part-time WAC tack-ons.  If UNLV wants to follow, fine. Group the others under a Division I-AA heading,  with maybe Cal State Northridge thrown in, so that the pigskin heads can keep  their football while the conference can be called something other than the Big  Drain.  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of dollars will be saved. Imagine what that could mean to  Big West basketball: Better recruiting. Better arenas. Better names on the home  schedule. How about UCLA at Fullerton instead of, as always, the other way  around?  </P> <P> Imagine, someday, a Big East-Big West Challenge, with Georgetown-UC Irvine at  the Bren Center. OK, OK, bad example.  </P> <P> Imagine, someday, a Big East-Big West Challenge, with Syracuse-Long Beach at  the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> There.  </P> <P> It could happen here.  </P> <P> Big West basketball is closer to prime time than it has ever been before. The  final leap isn't unfathomable. Unlike football, basketball programs can make  major strides in a hurry, and with the exception of Irvine, every Big West  school has been to the NCAA Tournament at least once since 1977.  </P> <P> The only thing standing in the way of Big West basketball is Big West football.  </P> <P> Sacrifice the Hapless Bowl for more trips to the Final Four.  </P></p>

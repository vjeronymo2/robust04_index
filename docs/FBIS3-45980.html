"We cannot let those countries and people working to rid  themselves of tyrannical rule fall into slavery again," Lee said  during an address to the World Freedom Day gathering here.    All countries should join hands to promote economic  development and improve the people's livelihood in an effort to  eliminate the source of world violence, the president said.    For the future of world liberty, the president added, the  world should confirm the achievements in the Middle East and  South Africa and condemn regimes which use political power to  intervene in the democratic movement. The world should urge  these countries to release political prisoners and encourage  joint efforts to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons, he  said.    More than 500 political leaders from some 40 countries  around  the world were present at the gathering, sponsored by the World  League for Freedom and Democracy and the Asian Pacific League  for Freedom and Democracy. The organizations were established  40 years ago with the purpose of promoting world freedom  following the defection of 14,000 Chinese Communists POWs to  Taiwan.</p>

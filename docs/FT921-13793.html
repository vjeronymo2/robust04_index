			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Publishers fight for their advertising LEADING European publishers have drawn up a declaration on press rights and freedoms to put to the European Commission in the face of proposed regulations threatening to affect advertising of everything from tobacco and alcohol to pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs. It will form the basis of talks between Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, and the European Publishers Council (EPC) next month. The publishers, including Axel Springer and Burda of Germany, Elsevier of the Netherlands, and News Corporation and the Daily Telegraph group of the UK, are stressing how the viability of an independent press depends on advertising revenues. 'Advertising revenues therefore support pluralism, diversity and the freedom of the press,' the declaration argues. The publishers, who spell out the importance of an independent written press to political democracies, also want newsprint tariffs abolished. A survey of EPC members by consultants Touche Ross found that revenues from tobacco and alcohol advertising amounted to almost 18 per cent of net profits of newspapers and magazines combined - 40 per cent for magazines alone. Advertising of foodstuffs, and pharmaceuticals as well as tobacco and alcohol together represent 22 per cent of magazine display advertising and 10 per cent of total magazine revenue. In the longer term a reduction of advertising revenues could lead to smaller publications or even the closure of titles.</p>

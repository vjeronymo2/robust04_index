			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / International Company News: Earnings at shipbuilders squeezed as sales improve MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Japan's leading shipbuilders, posted firm sales due to brisk demand in their shipping divisions. However profits were squeezed by a slump in industrial machinery demand due to the economic slowdown, and an increase in non-operating costs. MHI posted a 1.8 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to a record Y155.5bn (Dollars 1.2bn) on a 6.8 per cent increase in sales to a record Y2,484.2bn. Operating profits grew 12.1 per cent to Y176.6bn, and after-tax profits rose 9.1 per cent to Y105.7bn. Its financial balance fell from a profit of Y14.3bn to Y4bn due to lower interest received on deposits, and an increase of interest payments. For the current year to March 1993, MHI forecasts a decline in demand, and sees a 3.7 per cent fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y150bn on a 0.6 per cent rise in sales to Y2,500bn. Sales at IHI rose 11 per cent, thanks to strong sales in its shipbuilding sector. However, pre-tax profits plunged 21 per cent to Y21.4bn due to losses from an affiliate's deposits at BCCI. After-tax profits increased 26.5 per cent to Y19.2bn as a result of extraordinary profits from the sale of a stake in a Singapore shipping company. IHI posted Y5.8bn in loan-loss reserves to cover half of the Y12.7bn deposits of its affiliate at BCCI.</p>

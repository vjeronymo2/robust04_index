			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Election `94" program] </F>   [Text] The ANC's Patrick Lekota, nicknamed Terror on the  school soccer field, was born in Kroonstad in 1948. He grew up  in this house as the son of a domestic worker and truck driver,  herding cattle and walking 14 miles a day to and from his farm  school.    [Begin Lekota recording] Although, of course, as early as  time, especially the late 50's, I began to notice the relations  between black and white and the whippings that took place of  farm workers -- and things like that began to make an impression  me. [end recording]    He was unable to finish his social science degree at the  University of the North after being expelled for his involvement  in the SRC [Students Representative Council]. At this stage  Lekota was heavily influenced by his tutor, Steve Biko, and  involved in the Black Consciousness Movement -- but meeting the  then banned Beyers Naude left a great impression.    [Begin Lekota recording] I was really moved by the fact that  there was indeed a white man who was giving the rest of his life  fighting this thing. He had become a reject among his people.  It didn't change me immediately, but it was something that  stayed with me. I faced tremendous problems the following years  in terms of moving me from black consciousness to nonracial  politics. [end recording]    Although Terror was arrested under the Terrorism Act in 1974  and sentenced to 10 years on Robben Island, he valued his  experience there.    [Begin Lekota recording] One of the most important events  for  me was meeting the leadership of the ANC for the first time on  Robben Island. I had come from a background in which their  names had featured significantly but never really in a situatio  in which one could learn intensively. [end recording]    But there were bad times in Robben Island as well.    [Begin Lekota recording] I think that is was the most  difficult blow for me -- was when I lost my brother when I was  in jail and I was unable to come out and come and bury him. I  thought really at that time that I deserved to be released to  bury him, I was only on trial after all. I was not a serving  prisoner and also I must say that in 1975 I got married in  Pretoria Prison. Again you know at that time I thought the  state could have released me. [end recording]    By the time Terror was released eight years later he was to  play a prominent role in the UDF [United Democratic Front],  leading towards his arrest and conviction in the Delmas Treason  Trial. When the appeal court quashed all convictions he  returned to work in t!?? UDF [United Democratic Front], and  later the ANC.    [Begin Lekota recording] Well, if it is not some physical  exercise one way or the other, I love to play scrabble. I like  to watch soccer, boxing, rugby, and more recently cricket. [end  recording]    Terror, who helped launch and rebuild the ANC in the Orange  Free State, is the party's candidate for premier in that region.</p>

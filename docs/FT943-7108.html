			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / People: Non-executive directors The search for a new chairman at Associated Nursing Services has come to an end with the appointment to the board of former Tory MP and junior sport minister, Sir Neil Macfarlane (above). The nursing homes group has also invited John Hodson, chief executive of the merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander, to become a non-executive director. Singer &amp; Friedlander holds 24 per cent of ANS. ANS is paying Sir Neil and Hodson Pounds 18,000 and Pounds 10,000 a year respectively for 'about five' and 'at least two' days' work a month. Nick Dhandsa, chief executive, says this is the going rate. Sir Neil, 58, will become non-executive chairman in October, on the retirement of Robert Upsdell, who joined the group in 1990 and who, according to Dhandsa, had originally intended to stay with ANS for only two or three years. Sir Neil is a non-executive director of several companies, including RMC, Securicor, and the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society. Hodson's financial expertise, meanwhile, is expected to help ANS forge joint ventures with City institutions to fund expansion plans. The group recently called on shareholders for Pounds 10m to fund expansion through a one for three rights issue.</p>

Around 800 billion rubles will  be used directly in agriculture.    As Vice-Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent, this will be enough to cover the end of the  livestock wintering season, the preparations for spring sowing,  and the payment of the many debts of farms to numerous suppliers.    Aleksandr Zaveryukha still hopes that the agroindustrial  complex will receive the requested 6 trillion rubles in credit  in the first half of the year. He believes that branches of the  complex cannot survive their present difficulties without this  money. The use of credit, tax, and price policies to support  agriculture is a common practice in all countries, he stressed.  This is particularly important today, now that price disparities  are growing more pronounced. Last year the prices of  agricultural products increased 8.5-fold, but the prices of  manufactured goods increased 12-fold.    In reference to the heated arguments over the financial  requests of the agroindustrial complex, Aleksandr Zaveryukha  suggested that certain groups are disturbed by the position of  complex administrators. These groups, which include officials  from some ministries and departments, he remarked, "are  infuriated that we are not requisitioning imports, requesting  credits for imports, or requesting funds in connection with the  so-called coefficients that forced us to lower the prices of our  own products to someone's benefit. They also object to our  insistence on the use of customs duties for the slight reduction  of food imports."    The vice premier said that the projected financing for the  agroindustrial complex is "closely related to the preliminary  budget." The budget is based on earlier decisions, particularly  the presidential edict on the creation of a fund to support the  most important branches of the national economy.</p>

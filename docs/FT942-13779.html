			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Dividend unchanged at Vienna airport Vienna International Airport (VIA) group yesterday rep-orted lower profits for 1993 but said that it would maintain its dividend at 8 per cent. Group pre-tax profit was Sch540.9m (Dollars 45.3m) - down from Sch554.3m in 1992 - on turnover of Sch3.1bn. Passenger traffic rose by 5.3 per cent to 7.2m. 'Ruinous price and competition wars and the beginning of the liberalisation phase in air traffic' had adversely affected the results, the company said. However, it added that strong growth was expected this year. VIA is 27 per cent private and the government is expected to sell at least half of its 36.5 per cent stake this year. The city of Vienna and the province of Lower Austria each have 18.25 per cent stakes. Austrian Airlines posted a loss of Sch737m after tax last year, in spite of a slight increase in traffic and steps taken to reduce costs and increase revenues. The number of passengers carried rose by 1.8 per cent compared with the previous year to just above 3m. Air freight increased by 5.6 per cent. But flight revenues fell by 1.4 per cent to Sch9bn, and total income was down 1 per cent to Sch10.9bn.</p>

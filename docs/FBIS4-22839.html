Kostin, V.A. Skvortsov, and V.Ye. Fortov, </F> Institute of High Temperatures at Russian Academy of Sciences,  Science Department; Moscow; UDC 539.124]    [Abstract] Breakdown of metal targets by high-intensity ion  beams and the dynamics of stressed state formation in targets  during their bombardment by proton beams are analyzed by  mathematical simulation. Interactions of high-intensity ion  beams and target material not resulting in high-temperature  heating of the plasma corona are considered so that preheating  of the target can be disregarded. Correspondingly is considered  interaction of high-energy (about 10 MeV) proton beams incident  on solid targets in short pulses of up to 100 ns duration. The  nonsteady flow of target material under an incident  high-intensity ion beam is calculated in the hydrodynamic  approximation in accordance with the three applicable  integrodifferential equations of mass, momentum, and energy  conservation. The elastoplastic characteristics are evaluated in  accordance with the Mises model. The simulation program includes  a two-dimensional ``flow of continuous medium'' algorithm in  Lagrangian coordinates, constructed according to the explicit  ``cross'' scheme and involving the ``predictor-corrector''  procedure of second-order precision. Oscillations of nonphysical  quantities are prevented by insertion of an artificial viscosity  into both tensor and scalar forms. The breakdown model is based  on the kinetic description of crack formation as a defect  buildup process and attendant weakening of the material, the  system of its equations being closed by an equation of state  which covers not only a large class of materials but also wide  temperature and pressure ranges up to extremely high ones. The  deformation resistance increases with increasing intensity of  the compression shock and reflection of the latter gives rise to  a rarefaction wave, the tensile stresses in latter disrupting  the continuity of the material. Numerical calculations on the  basis of this model have been made for an aluminum target and  two different high-intensity ion beams delivering the same total  energy to the target: 1) thin tubular beam about 0.5 mm wide  with the maximum current density at the 1 mm radius, 2) solid  cylindrical beam with a Gaussian radial distribution of the  current density peaking at the 0.5 mm radius. For  simplification, the kinetic energy of protons is assumed to  remain constant at the 10 MeV level over the duration of an  incident pulse. An important parameter included in the  calculations is the strain rate characterizing the response of a  target to an incident shock wave. The results indicate that both  the evolving stressed state of a target and the degree of its  breakdown depend largely on the configuration of the focal  radiation spot, a tubular beam producing defects over a larger  target area. A high-energy proton beam evidently forms a large  region of lower-density material surrounded by higher-density  condensate, both temperature and pressure in this region rising  appreciably within the Bragg peak deeper inside the target.

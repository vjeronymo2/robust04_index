			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION I BASKETBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> GIRLS  </P> <P> In successive years, Mt. Carmel went from holding the keys to the section to  watching as the locks were changed. Now what for an encore?  </P> <P> Tonight at 6, top-seeded Mt. Carmel (21-5) meets second-seeded Santana (24-4)  in a rematch of the 1988 San Diego Section Division I girls' basketball final,  which Mt. Carmel won, 57-47.  </P> <P> The Sundevils danced with history then. But a year later, they tripped over  their own feet, losing to Santana, 54-46, in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> It was in a semifinal two years ago that Mt. Carmel was able to do something  that hadn't been done in the section playoffs for three years and hasn't been  done there since: defeat Point Loma. The Pointers had won three consecutive  section, Southern California Regional and state Division I championships. The  upset was one of the biggest of the tournament.  </P> <P> Tuesday in a semifinal against Poway, a team it had beaten only once in four  meetings this season, Mt. Carmel again scored a magical victory.  </P> <P> "We hate drawing parallels," Mt. Carmel Coach Peggy Brose said. "Beating Point  Loma, that was special and emotional for us. Poway was the emotion this year."  </P> <P> It was so emotional that Santana Coach Wade Vickery said Mt. Carmel should be  content with it.  </P> <P> "I think they should be satisfied with that, then take it easy on us," he said.  "They won the Poway championship."  </P> <P> And about that beachfront property in Arizona . . .  </P> <P> Brose said she discussed the possibility of a letdown with her players at  length.  </P> <P> "We said let's not be content with that," she said. "We put Poway in  perspective. You don't play just to get to the final. So there's no problem  with motivation."  </P> <P> Four of the players in this final saw considerable playing time in 1988: junior  Vicki de Jesus (5-8, 17-point average) of Mt. Carmel and three from Santana:  senior Rebecca Aase (5-8, 19) and juniors Stephanie Thompson (5-10, 18) and  Desiree Weimann (5-4, 18).  </P> <P> Vickery said it will help to have three girls who are experienced and not in  awe of reaching a section championship.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel is concerned with all three but especially Weimann. She was missing  when Mt. Carmel defeated Santana, 58-54, in December.  </P> <P> "She's the floor leader," Brose said. "She makes them go. I've seen them play  with her and without her. They have a hard time carrying the floor without  her."  </P> <P> Santana primarily wants to keep de Jesus in check.  </P> <P> "We don't want de Jesus to go crazy on us," Vickery said. KIM Q.

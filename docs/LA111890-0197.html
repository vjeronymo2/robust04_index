			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAIN POINTS OF THE SOVIET PLAN  </P> <P> Here are the main points of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to  drastically change the Soviet governmental structure:  </P> <P>  * Abolish the position of prime minister and downgrade the Council of  Ministers, the main government organ, chaired by the prime minister. However,  Gorbachev adviser Georgy Shakhnazarov said the council, or Cabinet, would  continue to exist as a "working organ" to furnish technical and executive  expertise.  </P> <P> * Overhaul the Federation Council, a consultative body of leaders of the 15  Soviet republics plus Gorbachev, granting it a veto over actions of any  republic that affect national interests.  </P> <P> * Create a National Security Council, subordinate to Gorbachev, to include  chiefs of KGB secret police and Interior Ministry. Its powers and functions  were not immediately clear. Political scientist Fyodor M. Burlatsky,  editor-in-chief of Literary Gazette, said the council would be the "real  Cabinet."  </P> <P> * Form an elite law-enforcement agency, the Special Service, to fight organized  crime, black-marketeering and other illegal acts "engulfing the country." Its  officers could be on the streets in 10 days, Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> * Complete within 14 days a food-distribution plan to ensure that famine does  not break out in the Soviet Union this winter.  </P> <P> * Take "operational measures" to guarantee functioning of "life-support  systems," including railroads and coal mines, that have frequently been closed  by strikes or ethnic unrest.  </P></p>

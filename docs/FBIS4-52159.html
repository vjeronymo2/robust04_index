			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  spoke to his cabinet ministers Monday [9 May] about the need to  express to future generations the importance of Japan's remorse  for its former wartime aggression, government officials said.  Hata outlined his basic position on Japan's behavior in World  War II after former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano created an  uproar last week with his denial of historical facts on Japanese  aggression, the officials said.    "As the head of Shinseito during last year's general  elections, I expressed (in speeches) my deep remorse and  convictions over the Japanese military's aggressive behavior and  colonial rule (in Asia)," Hata told the cabinet meeting.  "Looking ahead to the 50th anniversary of the end of the war  next year, we must express to future generations (our remorse),"  Hata was quoted as saying.    On his decision to appoint Nagano as justice minister, Hata  said that he had asked about his views of the war and got the  reply that "war must not happen again."    When Nagano offered his resignation over his controversial  remarks, including the charge that the Chinese account of the  1937 Nanjing massacre is a "fabrication," Hata said he accepted  the resignation without any special effort to dissuade Nagano.    At Monday's cabinet meeting, newly appointed Justice  Minister  Hiroshi Nakai greeted the ministers, but did not go on to offer  his views of the war, the officials said.    During an extended Japanese holiday period last week while  Hata was on a four-nation tour of Europe, the prime minister  outlined his position on the war and Japanese colonial rule in a  letter to the cabinet ministers.    Borrowing from former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata  wrote "In the past, the aggressive behavior and colonial rule of  our nation inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on many  people. I want to express anew my feelings of deep remorse and  apology."    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said he thought the  cabinet ministers fully understood Hata's cautionary letter  regarding Nagano's controversial remarks.    Meanwhile, Hata spoke at a ceremony at the Foreign Ministry  to officially hand over the post of foreign minister to Koji  Kakizawa, and said he is well aware that Japan's colonial policy  and actions during World War II inflicted unbearable suffering  upon neighboring and other Asian nations.    The prime minister said he wants to do his best to bring  peace to the world based on remorse.    Hata called Nagano's remarks on Japan's wartime aggression  very "regrettable" and that it was an "unexpected happening"  since he personally had trust in Nagano.    Nagano resigned over the weekend due to international  outrage  over his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing massacre never happened  and that Japan's invasion of China and other Asian nations was  not an act of aggression but aimed at liberating these countries  from colonialism.    Hata said that as a Japanese, he feels proud to apologize  and  show remorse about the fact that Japan caused pain to other  nations. He urged Kakizawa to carry out diplomacy aimed at  bringing peace to the world.    Kakizawa told the same ceremony he will carry forward Hata's  diplomatic policy and work to create a Japan which can be  trusted and loved by other nations.</p>

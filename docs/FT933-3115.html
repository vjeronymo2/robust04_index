			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Lafarge to make FFr2.5bn international share issue LAFARGE Coppee, the French company which is one of the world's largest building materials groups, is seeking to capitalise on the strength of international stock markets through a FFr2.5bn (Dollars 446m) share issue. Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman, said that the proceeds of the issue, which was announced yesterday, will be used to contain the level of the group's debt while expanding in rapidly growing markets. He said the issue would not dilute earnings per share, even in the short term, because of the reduction in financial charges and the earnings potential of the funds to be raised. The announcement of the share issue coincided with the release of the group's results for the first half of the year. Net profits were stable compared with the first six months of 1992, slipping by 0.3 per cent to FFr693m. Sales of FFr14.3bn were 5 per cent down on the same period in 1992. Shares in the the company rose sharply, by FFr8.3 to FFr422.3. Market analysts in Paris said this was because the profits were stronger than expected while the share issue was smaller than anticipated. The new shares will represent about 10 per cent of the group's capital. The shares will each have a warrant attached, with two warrants giving holders the right to a further share. A bonus share, for every 10 shares held, will also be issued by the end of the year. Mr Collomb said that the company had decided against a rights issue to attract foreign investors and to enable the shares to be offered simultaneously on international markets. The shares will be issued on the Paris, London, Frankfurt, Madrid and Barcelona stock markets. The terms and pricing of the issue will be set next Monday, subject to market conditions. The company said it wanted to move quickly to take advantage of the rally in French and international stock markets and to pre-empt the French government's privatisation programme. The programme will be launched with the sale of the state's 73 per cent stake in Banque Nationale de Paris within the next few weeks. Mr Collomb said that the company's performance in the first half of the year showed resilience in the face of depressed European markets. He said he expected the trends in the first half to be repeated in the second six months of the year, prompting analysts to forecast stable full-year net profits of about FFr1.25bn. The company said the French market continued to be depressed, but the rate of contraction had slowed and could stabilise next year. In the first half of this year, the downturn in most of its European markets was offset by a strong performance in eastern Germany and increased prices in the US. According to Mr Collomb, the group would continue to expand through acquisitions in fast growing markets in eastern Europe, the Mediterranean region and east Asia, and through the introduction of higher value added products. Lafarge Coppee said that it would strike a balance between further acquisitions and containing group debt, which stood at a net figure of FFr10.2bn at the end of the first half. Analysts said that the proceeds of the rights issue should allow gearing to be brought down from the current level of 44 per cent to nearer 30 per cent by the end of the year.</p>

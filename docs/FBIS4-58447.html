			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha -- Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad  Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani opened the fifth multilateral  meeting of the Middle East Arms Control and Regional Security  working group at the Doha Sheraton Hotel this morning.    The four-day meeting is attended by 220 representatives from  43 countries. His Excellency Muhammad al-Za'abi, United Arab  Emirates [UAE] ambassador to Qatar, heads the UAE delegation to  the meetings.    In a speech opening the meeting, the Qatari foreign minister  said that he hopes that the meeting will succeed, and that this  meeting confirms the desire to effectively participate in the  Middle East peace process. He said this meeting falls within  the framework of Qatar's eagerness to render this peaceful  process a success and of its continued participation in the  multilateral talks, which basically deal with the post-peace  stage. He explained that the aspired peace is one that  restores all the occupied Arab territories to their owners,  foremost holy Jerusalem, as well as restoring the Palestinians'  legitimate national rights, including the right to  self-determination.</p>

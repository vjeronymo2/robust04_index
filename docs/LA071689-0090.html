			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER TRIES TO PUT HOUSES ON EASTPORT SITE;  </P> <P> MISSION CANYON OWNERSHIP KEY TO LAND-SWAP PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Real estate developer Ray A. Watt's complex land-swap proposal would pave the  way for his firm to build hundreds of high-priced homes on Santa Monica  Mountains property embroiled in a protracted legal battle pitting developers  against homeowners and the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Watt, one of California's biggest and politically well-connected builders, is  seeking to construct up to 750 homes in the Mission and Mandeville canyons area  west of the San Diego Freeway and south of Mulholland Drive. As part of a  complex series of high-stakes deals, Watt has proposed that his company obtain  Mission Canyon from Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under Discussion  </P> <P> Watt's tentative proposal -- a copy of which was obtained by The Times -- is  under discussion at the same time that Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City)  is trying to negotiate an agreement with city and county officials involving  many of the same properties, including a proposed landfill in Elsmere Canyon in  the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> Under Watt's three-page plan, which has been distributed to numerous city,  county and federal officials, the following would occur:  </P> <P> Watt Industries would make the Hatchet Ranch it owns north of Jackson Hole,  Wyo., available to the U. S. Forest Service, which has long sought to obtain  the property in scenic Buffalo Valley. In exchange, the Forest Service would  give land in Elsmere Canyon to a city or county government agency for a  landfill. Watt's company would also provide 630 acres that it owns in adjacent  Whitney Canyon for access to the dump.  </P> <P> U. S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) plans to introduce a bill shortly to swap  rights to the Wyoming property for Elsmere Canyon. Under the measure, the  Forest Service would not acquire the Hatchet Ranch but would obtain a "scenic  easement," which means that the property could only be used for ranching and  farming, not for real estate development, said Wallop spokesman Stan Cannon.  Watt would still own it.  </P> <P> Watt would share in the "tipping fees, surcharges and other revenue sharing"  from the landfill, which would have a capacity of about 200 million tons. Watt  did not specify his percentage in the proposal. But one of those privy to the  negotiations said the developer is asking for $3 for each ton of garbage, or  $600 million over several decades.  </P> <P> Watt would deed 1,200 acres next to Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa  Monica Mountains between Mission Canyon and Topanga Canyon Boulevard to a  federal or state parks agency. In exchange, Los Angeles County would deed  Mission Canyon to Watt and all of Rustic and Sullivan to a park agency as  permanent open space.  </P> <P> The city would permit Watt Industries to build 300 housing units in Mandeville  Canyon and as many as 450 other residences in Mandeville and Mission canyons.  Homes in the area -- some of which afford spectacular views of Brentwood and  the Westside -- sell for upwards of $500,000. Numerous city permits and  approvals would be necessary for the project to proceed.  </P> <P> Watt Industries would pay the county up to $70 million to offset the costs of  closing Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons as possible landfill sites. The  county has been determined to retain the canyons as long- term landfill  options, especially with Los Angeles rapidly running out of dumping space.  </P> <P> Various officials involved in the behind-the-scenes discussions -- including  Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage -- say Watt is a factor in the negotiations.  But Gage called Watt's initial proposal "totally unacceptable to the city," and  Berman said he would not be party to a package that includes construction of  750 homes in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Clout  </P> <P> Still, Watt's political and financial clout and strategically located  landholdings have prompted some of those involved in the process to suggest  that he could be an impediment to an agreement. Environmentalists, meanwhile,  privately express concern that Watt could wind up with the city's support to  build far more houses in the mountains than otherwise might have been  politically possible.  </P> <P> "He's very high-power, he's a very wealthy man, he's got lots of friends in  City Hall," said Nita Rosenfeld, who heads the Mandeville Canyon Assn.'s  governmental committee. "It's going to be a formidable battle to make sure that  he doesn't get away with anything."  </P> <P> Watt Industries in Santa Monica, one of scores of real estate companies in  which Watt is a principal, posted $420 million in housing sales in 1987, the  second highest total in Southern California.  </P> <P> Like other large land developers, Watt has been generous to elected officials  who decide on real estate projects. Since 1984, Watt, his companies and company  employees have given at least $155,000 in campaign contributions to city and  county politicians.  </P> <P> The top recipients have been the campaign committees of Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley, $25,850, and County Supervisors Deane Dana, $21,000, and Mike  Antonovich, $17,600.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Influence  </P> <P> Asked about the possible influence of Watt's contributions, Gage replied:  "Contributions are never a factor in weighing people's proposals in this  office."  </P> <P> In addition, the influential Los Angeles law firm of Manatt, Phelps,  Rothenberg, Tunney &amp; Phillips is representing Watt on his land-swap  proposal. Bradley has retained the firm to represent him in the city attorney's  inquiry into his ties with two financial institutions.  </P> <P> Berman has been contacted by Charles T. Manatt, a senior partner in the firm  and a former national Democratic Party chairman, and Mickey Kantor, a  well-connected Democratic attorney from the firm, according to Gene Smith,  Berman's chief Washington aide. Neither Manatt nor Kantor returned phone calls  to discuss the Watt proposal.  </P> <P> Watt, 70, was out of town and could not be reached last week. He lives in  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "He's really the one who should be discussing it," said Meg Gilbert, director  of special projects for Watt Industries. "It's sensitive and complicated."  </P> <P> The 1,500-acre Mandeville property where Watt proposes to build 500  single-family homes already has a long and controversial history. It is owned  by Eastport Associates, which filed for bankruptcy after it was unable to  develop the property.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $69-Million Offer  </P> <P> Eastport has accepted a $69-million offer for the land from Watt-Terramics Co.,  another of Ray Watt's companies, said Robert Greenfield, an Eastport bankruptcy  attorney. He said Eastport will ask the bankruptcy court to approve the sale.  </P> <P> Eastport had received approval from the city in 1978 to build 300 residences on  the property and 200 more if it could construct a secondary road to the site.  </P> <P> But a lawsuit filed by the homeowners and other problems -- including Los  Angeles County's refusal to approve the secondary road across county-owned  property -- prevented the company from beginning construction by June, 1987. At  that time, its most recent approval extension expired and, with it, the  authority to build the 300 homes, said Deputy City Atty. Tom Kathe.  </P> <P> In 1988, the Legislature passed a bill sponsored by state Sen. Joseph B.  Montoya (D-Whittier) that stipulated that any housing projects approved by a  county Board of Supervisors would carry over when a new city is formed.  However, a little-noticed provision in the measure had the effect of extending  Eastport's subdivision approval until Jan. 1, 1992, according to the company.  </P> <P> "When we heard that, we were flabbergasted," Kathe said.  </P> <P> Eastport had maintained that the construction approval never lapsed. But when a  judge ruled otherwise, the company sought legislation that would apply  retroactively to its project, said K. Phillip Nierim, Eastport's attorney. "I  was principally responsible for drafting the legislation," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge's Ruling  </P> <P> The city argued that the law did not apply to the Eastport property, but  Bankruptcy Court Judge Barry Russell ruled that it did. Watt-Terramics'  $69-million offer had been contingent upon such a ruling, Eastport attorneys  said.  </P> <P> The city has appealed Russell's decision and the three Mandeville homeowners  associations plan to file a supporting brief, said John B. Murdock, the  associations' attorney.  </P> <P> If Watt's proposal is accepted, the city presumably would drop its appeal.  Acquiring Mission Canyon would give the developer the property for the road  that is required to build the full 500 units. He would then need approval for  the additional 250 homes.  </P> <P> Rosenfeld of the homeowners association said Watt's plan appears to be a bid to  circumvent the public process.  </P> <P> "Let the man come in and show the public what he's going to do and then we'll  talk."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Gabe Fuentes and Amy Pyle contributed to this story.  </P></p>

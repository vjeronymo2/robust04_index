			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> HOTEL SHOP CEILING FALLS; WOMAN KILLED  </P> <P> The ceiling of a food shop collapsed in the Ansonia Hotel on Manhattan's Upper  West Side, killing a woman and injuring 12 other people, authorities said.  </P> <P> A Fire Department spokesman said the building was evacuated after the collapse  in the Croissant &amp; Co. shop on the ground floor of the 17-story hotel. City  Buildings Commissioner Charles Smith said that the ceiling was old and ornate,  and a new ceiling suspended from it apparently had added too much weight.  Police said those inside were briefly trapped in the debris, and three of those  hurt suffered head injuries.  </P></p>

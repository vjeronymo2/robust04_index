			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Talks with GEC on naval link - British Aerospace interim results BRITISH AEROSPACE is holding discussions with the UK's General Electric Company to pool the two companies' efforts on future naval programmes. The talks are aimed in the first instance at collaborative arrangements for a new generation of air-defence frigates, which Britain currently plans to develop jointly with France and Italy. A further stage would involve seeking the prime contractorship for an updated version of the Royal Navy's Trafalgar class nuclear-powered attack submarine. The UK share of the Pounds 4bn frigate project is expected to be worth about Pounds 2.4bn. Under present plans, partner countries would share development but each would build its own ships. The UK side would not involve a single prime contractor but separate contracts for the hull, weapon systems and electronic command system. BAe and GEC are understood to envisage bidding jointly for all three. However, Mr John Weston, chairman and managing director of BAe's defence division, said an overall merger of the two groups' naval businesses was not under discussion. BAe, which makes naval weapons and has a 50 per cent interest in the BAeSema systems company, has ambitions to expand its naval business, both to broaden its coverage of the defence sector and to break into new markets, especially in the Far East, reducing its dependence on arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Exploratory talks on wider defence links with GEC were suspended in July after press reports suggesting a merger was on the cards. One senior BAe executive said talks could not be continued 'in the full glare of publicity'. BAe is meanwhile pursuing negotiations with Matra of France on pooling missile interests in a joint venture with combined annual sales of more than Pounds 1bn. GEC is among other European companies seen as potential future partners in the venture. Mr Weston said yesterday there was 'definite interest among other manufactureres to join us.' Defence continued to be BAe's only significant source of profits in the first half of this year, offsetting losses in other sectors. Defence profits before interest and tax dropped to Pounds 230m (Pounds 264m), on sales reduced to Pounds 1.93bn (Pounds 2.02bn). However,the completion of deliveries of Hawk trainers to South Korea helped to limit the reduction that had been anticipated.</p>

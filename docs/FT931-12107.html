			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax relief on a farm AN ELDERLY spinster owns and farms 250 acres of land in Scotland. Her nearest relatives are two nieces, both in their twenties. Neither would be able to continue the business but they would stand to inherit any money on the death of their aunt. The farm would be sold. Would the money realised be eligible for inheritance tax relief at 100 per cent and would capital gains tax relief be passed to the nieces, or do the concessions benefit only sons and daughters of a farmer? For IHT purposes, and provided certain conditions were met, 100 per cent agricultural relief would be available on the agricultural property on the death of an aunt where she both owned and farmed the property. The conditions are that the property must have been either: (a) occupied by the aunt for the purposes of agriculture throughout the period of two years ending with the date of death; or (b) owned by the aunt for a period of seven years ending with the date of her death, and occupied throughout that period by her or another person for the purposes of agriculture. The property would not be subject to CGT on death and would, in fact, be revalued for CGT purposes so that the base value of the property would be revised to the value as at the date of death. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Revolution reconsidered By any prudent rule of thumb, revolutions are usually best avoided. They may be exciting at the time, they may be inspiring later, but they are liable to do much more harm than good. That's what my granny always said, so it must be right. History mostly backs her up. The French revolution was a national and international calamity, and it is still not certain that France and Europe have quite got over it. The Russian revolution was a direct descendant of the French revolution, and no one is in any doubt of the scale of that disaster, from which the Russians have yet to recover. Then there was the Chinese cultural revolution. All in all, my granny's case seems pretty conclusive. And yet there are circumstances where what is needed is a total reform of the whole system. Systems are by definition incapable of reforming themselves from within; so if total reform is to take place at all, it must be comprehensive, radical, and very fast - in short, a revolution. The critical question, if the condemnation of history and my granny is to be avoided, is whether such a revolution can be carried out without violence. There are two places where this question may apply: Italy and Russia. In Italy the conditions for transforming the corrupt political system have been created from outside by the magistrates, who are keeping up the pressure by arresting politicians and businessmen. But it is hard to shut out the idea that last week's murderous car bomb in Florence may be an awful omen of just how much may be at stake. General system failure is much more comprehensive in Russia than in Italy. But outsiders are perplexed to make sense of what is going on, because all economists, east and west, and all governments, east and west, conspire to tell us that the main issue at stake is economic reform. That economic reform is a problem of enormous importance is not of course in dispute. But there can be no doubt that by far the biggest issue is political reform. Everyone knows the Russians are not doing too well on the economic reform; but they cannot get the economics right because they are not getting the politics right. Ever since the Berlin wall came down, economic experts from east and west have been arguing fiercely about the best way to make the transition from a command to a market economy. 'Revolutionaries' said it should be fast and radical; reformers said it should be slow and careful. In theory, the revolutionaries have sold their case to the Moscow government; in practice, the results so far have been pretty terrible, with falling production, runaway money supply and rocketing inflation. Critics say this seriously undermines the case for shock therapy. But Anders Aslund from Sweden, who is a leading expert on Soviet and east European economies, and also one of the leading advocates of shock therapy, thinks there is a different explanation. 'The most conspicuously misunderstood part of the process of systemic change in Russia', he says in a new report *, 'is the role of democratisation. . . . In order to pursue any kind of change of economic system, or even run a state, certain powers are required. . . . The best means for this purpose was democratization. 'The key problem is that Russia has only had properly democratic presidential elections. . . . Thus, stalled democratization is in fact the major source of the economic failures to date.' The Aslund analysis makes clear that the situation is much worse than a simple stand-off between President Boris Yeltsin and a conservative parliament, which thus prevents economic reform. On the contrary, the tension between them is itself creating massive inflation and generating systemic corruption and theft on a heroic scale. First, the parliament demands inflationary expansion of bank credits to keep state enterprises afloat. Second, the vast gap between inflation and interest rates gives those with borrowing power (that is, the former communist establishment) a great incentive to speculate in commodities. Third, the remaining price controls on energy, raw materials and metals, holding them well below world prices, create another a large incentive to speculate, smuggle and steal. 'To judge from conversations with well-informed businessmen and government officials', says Aslund, '10 to 20 per cent of the oil and at least one-third of the metals exported from Russia in 1992 were smuggled out of the country. Naturally the revenues from these sales stayed in bank accounts abroad.' He estimates this capital flight at 'billions' of dollars. Some people deplore the low level of foreign investment, especially in the oil industry, which they explain by generally chaotic trading conditions. But there is a more important reason - oil smugglers have no incentive to accept foreign partners, who would stop their game. Aslund's conclusion is that Russia still needs economic shock therapy. But the prequisite for any strategy must be rapid democratization, because that is the only way to break the power of the old nomenklatura. The French revolution started with a debate on the bankrupt finances of the state. The revolutionaries responded by issuing paper money on a vast and rising scale. They tried to deal with the resulting inflation by price controls. The consequence was famine. This led in turn to the terror. * Systemic Change and Stabilization in Russia, by Anders Aslund; Royal Institute of International Affairs</p>

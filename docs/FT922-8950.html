			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Beregovoy says France must take lead over Maastricht MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday warned that Europe would come apart unless France showed the lead and ratified the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. French politicians who opposed the treaty on grounds of national sovereignty were living in the wrong era, said Mr Beregovoy, in his first full-length television debate since becoming prime minister on April 2. 'If the treaty is not ratified by France, which in my view must show the way, or by any other country, then Europe risks coming apart,' he said. 'Germany, which is today integrated into Europe. . . could be at that moment left to follow its own free will,' he added. Mr Beregovoy's remarks came ahead of a national assembly vote due tomorrow on the constitutional changes required by the treaty in the first step towards ratification. A majority is expected to vote in favour, but the government has been surprised by a larger than expected minority, mostly on the right, against the European Community generally. Nearly half the Gaullist members of parliament - led by Mr Philippe Seguin, the MP for Vosges in north-east France - came out in favour of throwing out the treaty. Mr Seguin's arguments belonged to the time of Bismarck, said Mr Beregovoy, referring to the 19th century German chancellor. The constitutional changes are due to go to the senate, the upper house of parliament, on May 20, and then for ratification by a joint sitting of both houses, known as the congress, next month. Mr Beregovoy thought it possible that the treaty might also have to go to a national referendum, though this was 'not indispensable'. A referendum is needed if the project fails to get a three-fifths majority in the congress. However, Mr Beregovoy said the government would also consider whether a referendum was desirable in the light of the parliamentary debate. Until now, the government has appeared against a referendum on the grounds that it might produce another protest vote against President Francois Mitterrand, instead of an accurate public opinion on the treaty itself.</p>

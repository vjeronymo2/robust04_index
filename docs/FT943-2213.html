			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Sanderson Bramall Sanderson Bramall Motor Group, the West Yorkshire-based motor distributor, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 3.01m in the first half of 1994, boosted by acquisitions. In August 1993 Sanderson bought Skipper Group from RTZ for Pounds 14m and in April this year it acquired Petrogate for some Pounds 5.5m plus its debt of just under Pounds 11m. These lifted the number of the group's dealerships from 12 to 33. Of this, 24 are car dealerships and nine commercial. Operating profits rose to Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 1.25m), including Pounds 864,000 (Pounds 75,000) from acquisitions. Turnover advanced to Pounds 189.9m (Pounds 64.4m), with Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 4.86m) from acquisitions. The number of new commercial vehicles sold jumped to 1,564 (200), while new cars sold rose to 6,490 (2,925). However, Mr Tony Bramall, chairman and chief executive, said that the group's main profit centres were its after-sales business, the value-added packages underpinning its new and used car sales, and the used car operations. Used cars sold increased to 5,440 (1,780). Mr Bramall explained that the used car operations benefited from the lack of makers' restrictions imposed on new cars, that trade prices had held up well, and that there had been none of the previously seen 'seasonal drift-down'. Since the acquisitions - which lifted gearing to the mid 80s, since reduced to the low 70s via property disposals - the group 'needed to digest', said Mr Bramall. It still had about Pounds 5m-worth of property to sell, half in the second half and half in 1995. The interim dividend is lifted to 1p (0.66p), payable from earnings per share of 6.3p (3.7p). The interim is likely to be one-third of the year's total.</p>

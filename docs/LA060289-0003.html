			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COME TO MARKET  </P> <P> The cows came home, almost, when a dairy chain decided to mark the beginning of  National Dairy Month by taking Holstein cows to a Burbank supermarket. The idea  of the guest performance was to show kindergarten-aged, city-bred children  where milk comes from. Not to confuse the issue, but also in attendance was an  18-wheeler truck with a pink fuel tank underneath.  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Technology: New objective for software - Claire Gooding looks at a flexible program, geared to clients' needs When Software 2000, a US company, tried to assess the evolving needs of customers four years ago, it was faced with a problem. Users wanted constant improvements to their existing packages, while prospective buyers were looking for something new. To solve the dilemma, Software 2000 decided to rewrite its entire package using the latest programming techniques of object-oriented software. This would offer companies a more flexible and simple system. With the recent launch of its new accounting and software product based on this technology, Software 2000 has become the first software house to bring such a package to the market. Software programs based on object-orientated design are easy to use, with on-screen icons and windows like most personal computer software of the 1990s. But a big difference is that such programs can be used in many different hardware situations, from mainframe to PC. In software terms, 'objects' are prefabricated chunks of software that can be used again and again, making programs easier to write and maintain. An object view presumes that any transaction or business operation starts with an object and gives a choice of related activities. An object can be any item used by anyone in their everyday work. Activities to do with that object - information, an invoice, even a diary date for a customer - are all options attached to that object. A user simply picks the relevant activity. All the information about one object is stored in one place. This contrasts with the usual practice in which each application, such as purchasing, sales and forecasting, is handled separately. Most object-oriented products on the market are software tools: systems components such as databases and development aids. Many big corporations have adopted the technique to bring disparate applications into line. Before rewriting its package, Software 2000 asked people at all levels of responsibility what they sought from such a system. Everyone wanted immediate access to information, speed and the ability to interact with people on the telephone and deliver information wherever it was needed. 'We put our software through its paces in a 'usability lab',' says Michael Hunt, Software 2000's chief executive. Accessibility to information was the feature that convinced Baxter International, the US healthcare group, to spend an initial Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 331,125) on Software 2000's revamped personnel package. Baxter's reorganisation in 1992 emphasised European rather than local control for operations in the region. Managers in its five business lines became responsible for profit and loss, which made information about salaries and other employment costs a critical part of the European picture. 'We call it a human resources system, but it's really a business system because line managers will have access to it,' says Bert den Breejen, Baxter's Netherlands-based director of human resources. Typically of Baxter's new structure, he also has responsibility for pan-European systems. Den Breejen argues for a devolution of personnel responsibilities to line managers. The Software 2000 implementation at Baxter will give up to 1,000 managers easy access to the European-wide information they need to assess and react to the ever-changing deployment of staff. Previously, the 16 national offices in Europe, all using different personnel systems to manage the 7,000 regional employees, could not supply information to fill vacancies, estimated at between 700 and 1,000 annually. Now, personnel staff will spend less time on administration and more on problem-solving. The object-orientated software not only capitalised on Baxter's use of existing IBM AS400 computers and PCs, but also allowed for local tailoring for national regulations. No other software supplier, says den Breejen, could satisfy that need with easy-to-use software.</p>

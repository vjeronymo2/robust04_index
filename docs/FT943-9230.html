			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Personal View: Riding tandem along UK superhighway The communications industry is facing a future of im-mense potential with the development of a new generation of broadband 'information superhighway' networks delivering telephone, computer, television and other services. Using optical fibre and advanced electronics, these networks will enable visual and virtual reality images, speech, sounds and graphics to be communicated instantly between any two points on the globe. Today, it can only dimly be visualised what will develop from this: a new dimension to commerce and industry; a revolution in education, medicine, shopping and leisure; quite possibly a decisive cut in the need for physical travel and thus in energy consumption, pollution and traffic congestion; and a new medium for political activity. Telecommunications carriers such as BT have good reason to push broadband. Growth of conventional telecoms is slowing. The carriers have turned to specialised international business services; but the market for these is limited and competition is fierce. Broadband for their home markets is the big opening on their business horizon. The report on optical fibre networks by the House of the Commons select committee on trade and industry, published on July 27, is the first all-party parliamentary judgment on the UK telecommunications regime. It makes three principal criticisms. UK policy is too concerned with infrastructure and competition in existing services and needs to be refocused on broadband services; there is little sense of urgency about broadband development; and there is a lack of a clear sense of vision about what broadband could do for the UK and its people, in contrast to the type of leadership being shown in the US. The US is seizing the high ground. The US administration has forward-looking legislation before Congress which in particular will enable cable TV and telephone companies to compete in each other's business areas. US telecoms operators are planning to invest millions of dollars in a broadband adaptation of the coaxial cable technology traditionally used by the cable TV industry. US computing and entertainment interests are scrambling to dominate the world market for broadband applications. Japan is not far behind. The challenge to Britain and the rest of Europe is pressing. Britain is a world leader in optical fibre broadband technology. However, it is bogged down by dispute about a regulatory ban, rooted in the thinking of the 1980s, which excludes BT from cable TV in order to protect Britain's combined cable TV and telecoms operators. There is right on both sides. The cable companies are committing large investments in reliance on this ban. But, as the principal national operator, BT has a role in broadband which should not sensibly be denied. The select committee has proposed lifting the ban on a franchise-by-franchise basis, with protection in any given franchise lasting only seven years. This is fair and workable. But even if accepted by government, it would take years to have effect nationally. I suggest an alternative which would cut through the difficulties and work more rapidly. The cable companies plan to invest Pounds 6bn just to create conventional facilities for two-thirds of the population. They would have to spend a lot more to upgrade to broadband. A national broadband network would cost BT Pounds 15bn or more. All this investment would be risky. Both investment and risk would be greatly reduced and progress would be faster if the two sides co-operated to create a single national broadband network. The classic objection to this would be that it creates monopoly and inefficiency. To counter this I propose a new formula. BT and the competitors should form a network company which they jointly own in equal shares. BT's contribution would include its existing duct network, which is a central resource. The company would have a professional board made up exclusively of its owners' representatives. To ensure efficiency, its managing director and its top executives would be appointed by the owners on regularly renewable contracts, with stringent performance-related pay requirements. The board would control expansion of broadband across the country, in step with success in marketing. Charges and profits would be determined by a return on assets requirement, set to correspond to the upper quartile of returns being earned by blue-chip companies generally and ratified by the industry regulator, Oftel. Profits would be reinvested or distributed by agreement between the owners. Initial investment and later investment requirements not met from profits would be found by the owners or from the market. Anyone who wished to provide broadband services to the public, including of course BT and the present cable TV operators, would be entitled to use the network, paying standard charges to the new company. Again, charges would be ratified by Oftel. There would be free, fair and unregulated competition for provision of services over the network. Technical and commercial problems of interconnecting competing networks, which are getting more difficult with no obvious way out, would be eliminated. The need for the ban on BT would disappear. The way would be cleared for broadband services to develop freely by competition to their natural commercial level. The author was the last public-sector managing director of BT's inland operations. He is now senior partner of the Lullington Group of telecommunications advisers</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 13 -- Spokesman for the Defence  Ministry Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki has been recalled from the  post, PAP learnt unofficially Monday. The reason behind  Rozbicki's dismissal was his article published in the Thursday  issue of "GAZETA WYBORCZA" in which he argued that Poland's  signing arms reduction agreements was unjustified.    He also argued that shifting the military information  service  WSI (intelligence and counterintelligence) from the ministry's  civilian structures and making it subordinate to the General  Staff may bring positive results as, according to him, for the  sake of state security it would be better if a civilian minister  would not have full access to information delivered by the WSI.    In response to the article the Presidium of the Sejm Defence  Committee charged Rozbicki with "incompetence," "disrespect for  civilian politicians" and "lack of understanding of the  fundamental principle of full control of the state authorities  over the armed forces." Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk  also distanced himself from the text of the article.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Case for rail privatisation THE PRIVATISATION of British Rail has been characterised by erstwhile friends of the government as a 'privatisation too far'. It has few enthusiastic proponents outside the ranks of cabinet ministers and their political advisers. Rail commuters and other train users have no great fondness for the often shambolic service that BR inflicts on its passengers. But they find it hard to see privatisation as anything more than an attempt to cut rail services and force fares up still further. That is strange, for given the success of past privatisations, neither outcome seems inevitable. Prices for telephones, gas and electricity have fallen for many customers. In telecommunications, where privatisation has released the strongest competition, new services are added to the existing ones almost weekly. It is true that water prices have risen since privatisation. But this has more to do with tighter European Community water standards than private ownership. Higher water bills would have been inevitable whatever the industry's ownership (a point not readily grasped by the public after the unwisely large pay rises for the directors of the privatised water companies). What is unarguable is that all the utilities have found it easier to raise capital outside the public sector, free of Treasury constraints on borrowing. Investment long-delayed under nationalisation has been funded after privatisation. Regulation has increased competition and kept the lid on price rises. The utilities have also improved their service standards, addressing familiar complaints such as unreliability over home appointments. Fiscal climate Similar benefits cannot be guaranteed for rail privatisation. But they are surely more likely than under public ownership. In the present fiscal climate, the investment the rail network needs if services are to improve will not be found in the public sector. Capital needed to upgrade track, modernise rolling stock and build new lines will come from the private sector or not at all. Privatisation also offers the chance to bring in commercial management and to open the railways to innovation. The productivity savings that commercial management can find in nationalised industries have been demonstrated in earlier privatisations. In some cases, it may be management buyouts which win the franchises to run rail services. Released from the shackles of a nationalised industry, the existing managers will be free to manage and to compete with other forms of transport. This is already evident on the line between London and Gatwick airport, the first to experience competition. The three BR divisions competing for passengers on this line have been spurred on to find new ways of expanding their market share. Exchequer subsidy What makes rail different from previous privatisations is that it involves a public service which is loss-making. Other nationalised industries may have temporarily lurched in and out of the red. But most of the rail network will require an exchequer subsidy well into the medium term. That is why BR could not be sold off as a whole, with the sort of share sale that in previous privatisations generated razzmatazz and some popular enthusiasm. That is also why rail privatisation has had to be so fiendishly complex, making it harder to sell to a sceptical public. The track infrastructure will be separated from the running of trains. Rail freight will be sold off. But BR's passenger services will be franchised out, with the contracts going to the bidders requiring the lowest subsidies. In effect, the private sector is being invited to manage passenger rail services on behalf of the public sector. If loss-making rail services can be contracted out to the private sector in this way, the same approach could be extended to other public services. Indeed, the management of 10 per cent of the UK's prisons is already being put out to tender in a similar manner. Rather than being a privatisation too far, the model adopted in rail privatisation could be the future that works for unprofitable public services. This is the first of two leaders on rail privatisation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Marat Abdulkhatin, </F> Lyudmila Aleksandrova, Aleksandr Romanov, Pavel Spirin and  Vyacheslav Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing, 27 May -- A stable, friendly China that is  successfully implementing reforms is in Russia's national  interests. The strategic aims for the socioeconomic development  of both states coincide in what is most important or are running  in parallel, which, consequently, creates reliable preconditions  for joint production and cooperation. This was stated today by  Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, as he  addressed representatives of Chinese business circles at the PRC  committee for promoting the development of international trade.    Broad prospects are now opening up, the prime minister  noted,  for Russian-Chinese relations to attain a fundamentally new  level of constructive partnership, geared toward the 21st  century. It [the partnership] is in the two countries' national  interests and is an important factor in maintaining peace and  stability in the Asia- Pacific region and throughout the world.    Meanwhile, continued Chernomyrdin, Russia and China -- whose  trade turnover is approaching $8 billion -- are yet to explore  the great potential of objective possibilities for joint  economic activities. The noticeable drop in trade turnover,  especially at the beginning of the year, prompt us to look for  new forms of mutually beneficial forms of interaction.    In Chernomyrdin's opinion, mutual investments and attracting  Chinese investments and the work force into exploration of  Russian natural resources and construction of infrastructure  facilities, as well as Russia's participation in large projects  in China. [sentence as received]    It is now time to think about creating joint investment and  brokering corporations and there is the possibility to  re-examine the agreement on the clearing system of payments.    The Russian prime minister also called for broadening  cooperation in the sphere of conversion of defense enterprises.    He proposed elevating border ties to a higher level by  promoting production cooperation and the creation of trade zones  with a special regime for foreign investment. At the talks with  Premier Li Peng there was a discussion of the question of  setting up a bilateral inter-regional body for coordinating  trade and economic cooperation between border regions.    Dwelling on the economic situation in Russia, the Russian  Government chairman noted that in just over two years of reforms  progress had been achieved in establishing market relations and  consolidating the legal basis of the state.    Chernomyrdin told the representatives of business circles  that the Russian Government intends by January to reduce  inflation to 5-7 percent. In his opinion, of important  significance here are the edicts signed a few days ago by the  Russian president on tax policy, strengthening the budget and  payments discipline, normalizing accounting, liberalizing  foreign economic activity, and the reforms of state enterprises.    The state does not intend to throw loss-making state  enterprises to the mercy of fate. The necessary help will be  given to ease the difficulties of the period of transition.  Above all, this concerns questions of the social sphere. The  government is taking specific actions, which will help to  prevent, in practice, a further reduction in the living  standards of the Russian people and to keep inevitable  unemployment at a socially acceptable level, the Russian prime  minister said.</p>

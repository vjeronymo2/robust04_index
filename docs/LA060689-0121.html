			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S IN NAME? UNWARRANTED WOES, IF YOU ASK LINCOLN BANCORP  </P> <P> Being confused with his near-namesake, Charles H. Keating Jr., has only paid  off once for John J. Keating.  </P> <P> That was about five years ago when John Keating, president and chief executive  officer of Lincoln Bancorp, the Encino-based holding company for Lincoln  National Bank, was visiting Scottsdale, Ariz., home territory of the other  Keating, chairman of the parent company of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan.  </P> <P> At a restaurant, John Keating was mistaken for a relative of the Arizona  businessman. "My wife and I were treated incredibly well," Keating recalled.  Then the restaurant staff discovered its mistake and service returned to  normal.  </P> <P> Recently, however, public confusion of the executives and their institutions  has been a problem, especially since April 14, when federal regulators seized  the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> The Federal Home Loan Bank Board alleged that the S&amp;L had been run in an  unsafe manner and that its assets had been "substantially dissipated."  Regulators said the S&amp;L "has repeatedly violated regulations relating to  transactions with affiliates, used poor underwriting and has refused to follow  supervisory directives."  </P> <P> Lincoln National's John Keating said that since the seizure of the S&amp;L, his  bank has received 10 to 15 calls from shareholders who thought that the Lincoln  S&amp;L scandal involved the company in which they had invested.  </P> <P> John Keating said the geographical distribution of investors in Lincoln Bancorp  was probably saving the company from more troublesome confusion. "The fortunate  thing is that most of our shareholders are out of state and obviously they're  not reading the local press," he said.  </P> <P> In contrast to the S&amp;L, 7-year-old Lincoln National Bank has been enjoying  good times recently.  </P> <P> About a week before the S&amp;L was seized, Lincoln National Bank's holding  company reported record earnings for the first quarter of 1989. The bank said  it earned $1.4 million for the quarter that ended March 31, up from $616,500  for the first quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> The bank also reported that its net worth, or total assets minus total  liabilities, equaled a healthy 6.58% of its total assets.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the coincidence of similar names has even caused John Keating's  family some difficulties. His daughter, who recently graduated from Chaminade  College Preparatory, "went into school one day and some girl came up and said,  'My grandfather is suing your father.' "It hasn't been fun, that's for sure,"  John Keating said.  </P> <P> Since Charles Keating's Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. acquired  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in early 1984, he involved the S&amp;L, which had  previously focused on home loans, in risky real estate investments.  </P> <P> After federal regulators had been examining the S&amp;L's operations for three  years, American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection. Several regulators  said they thought that the filing was intended to prevent federal officials  from seizing some American Continental assets.  </P> <P> The Times reported last week that Charles Keating, his companies and about 75  relatives, associates and employees contributed more than $700,000 to the  campaigns of three dozen state and federal politicians over six years in what  critics described as an effort to influence officials.  </P></p>

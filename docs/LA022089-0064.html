			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Members of the Baltimore Symphony orchestra return to the concert hall this  week after ending the longest strike in American symphony history. After 84  canceled concerts during the 22-week walkout, the orchestra will return to its  home at Meyerhoff Hall for a performance Thursday. Orchestra members ratified a  contract that assures them a minimum $1,040 a week in the 1991-1992 season. By  the end of the four-year, $4.6-million contract, players will earn 35% more  than the $770 weekly minimum they received at the end of the three-year pact  that expired in September. Unlike many orchestras, the musicians in the  Baltimore Symphony are paid for a 52-week year. The contract was approved late  Saturday by a vote of 78-7; members of the orchestra board had approved it on  Friday. "We think it's an excellent settlement and it meets the players' needs  for parity with the orchestras of St. Louis and Cincinnati," said Charles  Underwood, the players' representative in negotiations. He referred to the  musicians' demand that their wages be on a par with those of orchestras they  consider equals. "Hopefully, we'll be able to face the future and become a  better and deeper institution," said John Gidwitz, the orchestra's executive  director, who added that ticket prices may go up "modestly."

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Another facet of political levies Sir, The hearts of readers must be bleeding for your correspondent Mr R Stewart of Ayr (Letters, July 3/4) who was apparently: (a) forced to become a shareholder in a UK quoted company; and (b) unaware that the perusal of a company's annual report will provide useful information on its accounting and political policies. In view of his strongly held opinion that 'it should be left to individuals to decide to whom and by how much they wish to support any political party', it would be unwise for him to move to Germany. Here, he would find that a portion of any taxes he pays would be likely to be used to finance every political party while, at the same time, he would be prohibited from voting for any party at any level of election. Julian Smith, Bussardweg 11, D-61440 Oberursel 4, Germany</p>

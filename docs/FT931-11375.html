			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Scotland 'not gaining full benefit of multinationals' SCOTTISH-based companies are failing to fully exploit the opportunities presented by large multinational electronics companies based in Scotland, says a new academic study. As a result inward investment in electronics is not producing as much benefit to the Scottish economy as it should. A survey of 106 multinational electronics companies in Scotland by Dr Ivan Turok of Strathclyde University shows they bought only 12 per cent of the components and other material inputs from Scottish-based companies. This percentage is roughly in line with past studies conducted by the Scottish Development Agency. Scottish companies tended to supply the multinational plants with simpler products such as keyboards, plastics, cables, sheet metal, packaging and printed materials, although Scottish companies were also significant suppliers of printed circuit boards. Output by electronics companies located in Scotland rose by an average of 14 per cent a year during the 1980s, reaching Pounds 3.9bn in 1989, while the output of the rest of Scottish manufacturing industry stagnated, Dr Turok says. The value added in Scotland - the locally purchased inputs of material and labour - declined from 39 per cent of output in 1983 to 24 per cent in 1989. The relative decline in value added suggests that multinational plants are increasingly importing components and sub-assemblies from overseas, and confining their operations in Scotland to final assembly in what are sometimes called 'screwdriver' operations, Dr Turok says.

Present at the closing ceremony were Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Qian  Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wang Zhan, Geriletu, Yang Enbo, and  Wuyunqimuge.    Wu Liji made a summing-up speech. Wang Zhan chaired the  session.    The session approved the report entitled "Expand the Extent  of Reform, Accelerate the Economic Development, and Strive To  Create a New Situation in Setting Up the Socialist Market  Economic System" made by Comrade Wang Qun on behalf of the  standing committee of the regional party committee.    The session called on the party organizations and the broad  masses of Communist Party members across the region to firmly  remember the purpose of serving the people, regard the task of  ceaselessly liberating and developing productive forces and  making the people of various nationalities rich and happy as  their own duty, further strengthen the sense of responsibility  to history and the sense of urgency for the times under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th  Party Congress, unite with and guide the people of various  nationalities across the region, emancipate the mind, keep  forging ahead, work with one heart and soul, conduct pioneering  work arduously, and fight to create a new situation in setting  up the socialist market economic system and promoting sustained,  rapid, and sound development of the economy.    Wu Liji said in his speech: "This is a policy-making session  to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee, to set up new  systems, and to create a new situation and set up a mobilization  meeting to emancipate the mind, seek unity of thought, promote  reform, accelerate the pace of development, and welcome the key  year.    After analyzing the development situation ahead of the  region, Wu Liji said: At present, our region is confronted with  five favorable opportunities. First, the international  environment has brought extremely good advantages to us in  regards to further expanding the scale of opening up and  accelerating the development pace. Second, the state cancels,  in a step-by-step manner, the dual-pricing system and decontrols  the prices of the majority of energy resources and raw  materials. The region's long-term phenomena in which the value  of raw materials deviates from their prices tend to have been  alleviated. A large number of enterprises engaged in the  production of the products of these kinds will create better  economic results through market competition. Third, through the  readjustment of the product mix and the reform of the old  investment system, the central and western parts of the region  have increased their input in the development of energy  resources and raw materials. All this has created a favorable  environment for realizing the strategy of transforming natural  resources. Fourth, along with the implementation of the tax  distribution system, the state will gradually enhance its  financial resources. This has created prerequisite conditions  for increasing the input to the undeveloped areas through the  implementation of the system wherein the central fiscal  authority returns and transfers payments to local authorities.  Fifth, through the efforts made over the past 40 years or so,  our region has had good foundations in materials, technology,  and development. Therefore, our region should abide by the  following guiding ideology for economic development in 1994:  Comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee and the eighth  (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party  committee, persist in the basic line of the party, expand the  extent of reform, vigorously readjust the industrial structure  and the product mix, and increase economic results. On the  premise of continuously grasping the basic industries and the  pillar industries, we should positively cultivate and develop  new economic growth points and promote better and faster  development of the national economy.    Wu Liji pointed out: According to this guiding ideology, the  region has tentatively set 1994's major economic and social  development targets as follows: We should guarantee a 10  percent increase of GNP and strive to increase 12 percent. The  total agricultural output value should increase by 6 percent,  the total industrial output value should increase by 14 percent,  and the investment in fixed assets should reach 20.25 billion  yuan. We should guarantee an increase of $1.4 billion in total  export and import trade volume and strive to create $1.5  billion. We should strive to create 5.5 billion yuan in  revenues. The index of retail sales of commodities should be  controlled within 10 percent, the per capita income of the  peasants and the herdsmen should increase by more than 100 yuan,  and the population natural growth rate should be controlled  within 13.5 per thousand.    Wu Liji said: Through full discussions, the delegates  maintained that we must pay attention to and embody the  following principles in order to realize the 1994 economic and  social development targets: That development is an essential  criterion should be persisted in. We should try every possible  means to accelerate the pace of development. We should  persistently take the increase in economic results as a key  link, persist in the principle of taking the overall situation  into consideration and ensuring key projects, adhere to the  "three-conducive" standards, and persist in the idea of  self-reliance and arduous struggle.    Focusing on the general target of setting up the socialist  market economic system and comprehensively promoting the  progress of reform according to the arrangements of the central  authorities and in line with the provincial actual conditions is  the important subject discussed at this session. Wu Liji  pointed out: The 1994 reform priorities are as follows: In  regard to the reform of the financial and tax system, we should  carry out the tax assignment system on the basis of a rational  division of power between central and local authorities. In  regard to the reform of the banking system, we should separate  policy-lending banking from commercial banking. In regard to  the reform of the investment system, we should gradually  establish risk liabilities for corporate investment and bank  credits. In regard to the reform of the export trade system, we  should cancel the mandatory planning of the foreign trade  enterprises and further decontrol, in a well-planned manner, the  import and export commodity managerial rights. The prices of  the majority of production factors should be decontrolled in a  step-by-step manner; and the grain and cotton purchasing prices  should rise. Enterprises should set up a modern enterprise  system characterized by clearly defined property rights, rights,  and responsibility, separating the government administration  from enterprise management; and scientific management. In  regard to the reform of the social guaranteeing system, we  should perfect the system of providing for the aged staff and  workers and the system of medical insurance for staff and  workers. In regard to the reform of the urban housing system,  we should focus on marketing public houses; pay equal attention  to sales, rent, and construction; and accelerate the  commercialization and socialization of houses.    According to the guidelines of Comrade Wang Qun's report and  the discussion situation of session, Wu Liji stressed the  necessity to attend to the 1994 work. First, we should focus on  changing the enterprise mechanisms and win the general war of  reform. Due to the fact that the focal and difficult point of  the 1994 economic structural reform is to blaze a new trails in  the enterprise system, we must adopt major measures, go into  mass action, and strive to make a big breakthrough in this  regard. At the time of grasping the enterprise reform, we  should continue to regard the increase in the industrial  production as the focal point of the region's economic work and  positively readjust the industrial structure and the product mix  according to the market demands.    Second, we should vigorously develop the economy of the  rural  and pastoral areas and strive to increase the income of the  peasants and the herdsmen. The focus of the work of  agriculture, animal husbandry, the rural and pastoral areas, and  the peasants and the herdsmen is to increase the income of the  peasants and the herdsmen. According to the requirements of the  two-stage fighting targets, the per capita net income of the  peasants and the herdsmen must increase by more than 200 yuan in  the next two years. The party committees and governments at  various levels should continue to persist in the idea that  agriculture and animal husbandry are the foundation of the  national economy, put agriculture and animal husbandry in the  primary position of the economic work, stabilize the party's  basic policies toward the rural and pastoral areas, deepen the  rural and pastoral areas, and promote the overall development of  the rural and pastoral economy. All leagues, cities, banners,  and counties should focus the work toward banners and counties  on grasping town and township enterprises and ensure that town  and township enterprises really play a key role in developing  the banner and county economy.    He also urged to conscientiously attend to the financial and  tax reform, realistically improve and strengthen the financial  and tax work, further expand the scale of opening to the outside  world and developing the lateral economic cooperation,  conscientiously implement the strategy of relying on science and  technology to rejuvenate Shandong, realistically grasp various  social undertakings, and conscientiously arrange the people's  livelihood.    Wu Liji concluded: The reform and development tasks in the  next year and in the foreseeable future are extremely arduous.  The party and government leaders at various levels across the  region should hold themselves responsible to the party and the  people; further strengthen and improve the leadership over  reform, opening up, and economic construction; greatly change  and improve their ideas, work style, and work methods; and  regard the year of 1994 as one to emancipate the mind, change  work style, and implement tasks.</p>

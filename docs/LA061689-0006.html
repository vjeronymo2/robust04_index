			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AID TO ISRAEL  </P> <P> How atrocious, how gruesome, how heartbreaking it was to watch Chinese people  being murdered for the "crime" of wanting more independence, more democracy.  Our President, expressing the outrage of the people of this country, has  declared military sanctions against the government that has committed this  atrocity.  </P> <P> Why, then, does the U.S. continue to send military aid to a government that  ruthlessly and relentlessly murders a people who are also guilty of the "crime"  of wanting their independence? That ruthless country is Israel and the victims  are the Palestinians.  </P> <P> PHYLLIS SOLOMON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Chimely] </F>   [Excerpts] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 4 December--The profits of  the drug trafficking groups operating in Mexico have increased,  because in 1991 they represented $500 billion, and the 1993  figure is $800 billion: equivalent to eight times the nation's  foreign debt. This disclosure was made today at the Colloquium  on the Drug Traffic, Security, and Human Rights.    Those participating in the event agreed that now that the  Colombian drug trafficker, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, is dead there  will be many others to take his place.    The director of strategic studies at the National Institute  To Combat Drugs, Efren Ortiz Villasenor, commented, ``Much  attention is being paid to the effects of the drug traffic, and  not so much to its causes; however, we must make use of  prevention.''    He declared: ``Education is the most important factor  enabling people to develop a critical capacity, because  conducting campaigns with moralistic or censuring focuses brings  no results.''    He stressed, ``It is no longer a matter of merely fighting  drug consumption and trafficking. Rather, it entails a more  ambitious effort: determining how to achieve a rational control  over them.    ``The drug traffic, attacking the nation's fundamental  values, should be viewed as a national security problem, and all  the necessary resources should be activated to prevent it.''  [passage omitted]    Alejandro Reyes Posada, a researcher from the Institute of  Political Studies and International Relations at the National  University of Colombia, claimed that the illegal status of drugs  ``has created an artificial market with large profits. The more  their trafficking and production are repressed, the greater the  increase in the drug dealers' profits.''    He emphasized that the illegal status of the latter's  activity induces them to protect their interests by using  violence and corrupting civil servants.    He also noted: ``The most dangerous threat to any country's  security insofar as the Mafias are concerned is that they become  associated with big capital, because of the lucrative nature of  the drug trafficking business and its great capacity for  violence. As a result, movements of a fascist type appear.''    He indicated, ``The genuine weapon of societies in their  battle against those groups is the reinforcement of the state,  the law, and justice, as well as of democracy and civilian  society.    ``Involving university students in the discussion and  understanding of the problem is part of an effort to organize  and strengthen societies, so as to prevent the Mafias engaged in  this illicit business from absorbing and destroying them.''    The rector of the University of Guadalajara, Raul Padilla  Lopez, observed: ``In our time, the drug traffic has become a  serious public security problem. It is impossible to disregard  the frequent occasions on which the battle against it has led to  violations of individual guarantees and human rights.''    He added that a global problem such as the one described  demands solutions of an equal magnitude, which do not exempt  nations from a clear commitment to combat it within their  borders. It also requires ``an extensive, pluralistic dialogue  with society.''    The state attorney, Leobardo Larios Guzman, who opened the  meeting representing Governor Carlos Rivera Aceves, claimed that  fighting the drug traffic is not an exclusive function of the  government system, because the whole society, through its  various sectors, is also committed to it, particularly in the  area of prevention.</p>

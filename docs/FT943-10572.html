			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / People: Bromsgrove Industries Steven Mills, managing director of BROMSGROVE INDUSTRIES and one of the architects of its strategy to grow primarily through acquisitions, is stepping down. His departure is further evidence of the change in direction at the specialist engineering group, where consolidation has replaced diversification as the preferred method of increasing earnings. Mills arrived in 1987 as part of the management team chaired by Bijan Sedghi. Since then, shareholders' funds have expanded to Pounds 36m from Pounds 5.7m. But with the accent on organic growth and the number of operating divisions cut from six to three, Mills' financial background has become less relevant. 'We do need an engineer at the centre,' said Sedghi. There seem to be no hard feelings about the parting of the ways. Sedghi called Mills 'a man in a million' and stressed that Mills would not be severing his links - he would advise on the group's property interests and stay on as an independent trustee of the pension fund. The decision that Mills would go was taken during discussions at which Mills was present. 'The discussions were sensible, amicable, the decisions maturely arrived at,' Sedghi said. The company is now looking for a replacement.</p>

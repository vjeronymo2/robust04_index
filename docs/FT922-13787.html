			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: T'ham Hotspur Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club controlled by Mr Alan Sugar and Mr Terry Venables, has cleared the way for a resumption of dividend payments. The company said a Pounds 6.8m deficit on the profit and loss account prevented a dividend being paid, even though it had returned to profit. To eliminate the deficit, Pounds 7m would be taken from the share premium account, which stood at Pounds 8.2m after a rights issue in December. A High Court order is being sought to allow the premium account reduction.</p>

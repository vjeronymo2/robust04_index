			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RHETORIC OF DEFIANCE  </P> <P> Some comments made by Gen. Manuel Noriega about his and Panama's relationship  to the United States:  </P> <P> "The humble, the poor and the blacks, they are the utmost authority of the  people."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega speaking of his humble origins while characterizing his opponents,  the "rabi-blancos" or "white butts," as rich and white.  </P> <P> "A man is not the problem. The problem is Panama's canal and the presence of a  foreign army in our territory."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega, in March 1988, claiming the United States was behind his nation's  unrest and rejecting calls to step down.  </P> <P> "There cannot be conversation if the (U.S.) aggression continues, aggression at  whatever level, whatever magnitude, whether it is psychological or economic  aggression."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega, on May 21, 1988, saying he wants recognition of his hand-picked  provisional president and a reduction of U.S. forces in Panama before he agrees  to end his standoff with Washington.  </P> <P> "Pardon the ignorance but we cannot understand how these rich candidates in the  United States don't use the flag to solve the problems of the blacks in New  York, of the poorer classes, of the minorities, of those who have no heat, of  the foreigners. ... Those are pretty themes for democracies."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega, in May 1988, complaining about his role as campaign fodder for  American presidential candidates.  </P> <P> "A commander doesn't abandon his ship in stormy weather."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega responding to questions about whether he would step down in the  face of pressure from the United States, May 1988.  </P> <P> "The gringo piranhas want to do away with me."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega, blaming the United States for the failed coup attempt in October  1989.  </P> <P> "I was unarmed during this time. ... I'm a man of peace. I fire on my enemies,  not against my brothers."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega, after unsuccessful coup attempt in October 1989.  </P> <P> "We are in trench warfare now and we will maintain the resistance. ... We ask  the world for help, with men, dignity and strength. ... Our slogan is to win or  die, not one step back, and onward in the step of conquerers."  </P> <P>  -- Noriega in radio broadcast after American troops arrived Dec. 20.  </P></p>

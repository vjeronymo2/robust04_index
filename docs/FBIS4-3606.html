			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Won] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten says there is a "red carpet  ready to roll down the steps of Government House" to welcome  senior Chinese official Lu Ping.    He said during Legislative Council question time that it  would be a matter of "considerable satisfaction" for the whole  community if Mr Lu were to come to Hong Kong.    "I think we would throw our hats in the air...my door  remains  always open and there is a red carpet ready to roll down the  steps of Government House," he said.    Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, is said to have arranged a visit to the  territory to attend meetings of the China-appointed Preliminary  Working Committee (PWC). However, it is unlikely he will meet  Mr Patten because of the row over political reform. The  Governor was less generous to the PWC, saying he would welcome  it holding meetings in Hong Kong, just as he welcomed those of  the International Lions and the International Rotary Club. But  he said all he could offer would be his "thoughts and prayers"  that it would give "advice in the interests of Hong Kong" to the  Chinese Government. "It would be totally wrong of me to offer  anything else and I'm sure if I were to do so, I'd have my wrist  very promptly slapped by the NCNA (New China News Agency).    Mr Patten said it was his job to facilitate the meetings of  the "existing and very important" channels of communication  between the present and future sovereign powers of Hong Kong,  including the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the Land  Commission and the Airport Committee.    "While I welcome anybody who comes to meet in Hong Kong, it  is not for me to facilitate meetings that lie outside the usual  relationships between the sovereign powers and Hong Kong.    "So, I welcome meetings by the International Lions and I  welcome meetings by the International Rotary and I welcome  meetings by the Chamber of Commerce and I welcome the meeting of  the PWC, but I am not actually responsible for them," he said.</p>

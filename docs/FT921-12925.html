			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Three killed as Hindu 'unity tour' enters Punjab THREE members of an advance party of the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party's ekta yatra (unity tour) were killed yesterday in an attack by Sikh militants while they were going through Punjab en route to Srinagar, capital of Kashmir. Three people were killed and seven injured when the militants fired at them from cars. The ekta yatra is led by Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, the president of the BJP. It is made up of a caravan of buses and other vehicles that has been through 12 states in the last 45 days and has been stressing the dangers of terrorism and separatism and to promote what he calls the unity of India under its Hindu culture. Critics have called the march a provocation for India's minorities, and the government has expressed fears it could ignite religious riots in this volatile nation. The caravan is scheduled to reach Srinagar on Sunday, India's Republic Day, when the BJP plans to defy the Sikh militants demanding independence and hoist the national flag. Before he left New Delhi yesterday, Mr Joshi was warned by Mr S B Chavan, the minister for home affairs, that he would be travelling through territory in which militants both in Punjab and Kashmir are active. Mr Chavan asked him to reduce the size of the 210-vehicle caravan since he was unable to guarantee security. Sikh and Kashmiri militants, demanding independence for their respective states, have publicly vowed to attack the caravan and to kill Mr Joshi. Mr Joshi will be travelling through Punjab today and the militants' attack on an advance party of the caravan has raised fears that the BJP president and his party will also be attacked. Even more dangerous is the Jammu to Srinagar road which the caravan will negotiate in the next two or three days.</p>

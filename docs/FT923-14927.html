			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Food: The Robin Hoods of the ice cream world - Ben and Jerry's unusual recipe for success AMERICANS owe a debt of gratitude to Ben and Jerry, makers of Vermont's Finest All-Natural Ice Cream, for this singular feat: they have made eating ice cream virtuous. In this year BJ 14 - the company was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen, now chief executive of Ben and Jerry's, and Jerry Greenfield, vice-chairman  - Americans cannot help but know that, when they pick up a pint of Ben and Jerry's Fresh Georgia Peach, Chunky Monkey, or Cherry Garcia (named for Grateful Dead lead singer Jerry Garcia) they are buying a lot more than ice cream. They are buying an ethos. They are buying political correctness. As their success has grown - they sold Dollars 97m (Pounds 52.4m) worth of ice cream last year and are second only to Haagen Dazs in the US super-premium ice cream market - Ben and Jerry have graduated from America's corporate class clowns to national role models for corporate responsibility. Their company's goal: to make first-rate products while toeing a 'two-part bottom line,' as Ben puts it: 'How much do we benefit the community and how much money do we make?' The brownies in Chocolate Fudge Brownie are made at Greystone Bakery in Yonkers, New York, which reinvests profits in jobs and training for the homeless. The company buys the berries for Wild Maine Blueberry from the Passamaquoddy Indians to support traditional elements of their economy. The profit from the nut brickle candy in Rainforest Crunch go to rainforest and environmental preservation. Next year Ben and Jerry's will open a 'scoop shop' (ice cream parlour) in Harlem, New York, employing homeless people and residents of shelters. Feeling righteous yet? Try this: last year when cuts in federal support programs to dairy farmers caused milk prices to fall 25 per cent, Ben and Jerry's continued to pay premium prices to its supplier, St Alban's Cooperative Creamery, taking Dollars 500,000 'out of the company's profits, where it doesn't belong, and into farmers' pockets, where it does belong,' said Ben. 'We refuse to prop up our bottom line with bankrupt family farms.' Ben and Jerry met at school - they were the two fattest boys in gym class. Ben, a college drop out, and Jerry, twice rejected from medical school, only enrolled in a Dollars 5 correspondence course in ice cream-making when they could not afford the equipment to make their other favourite food - bagels. They set up shop in a converted garage in Burlington, Vermont, on Dollars 12,000, most of it borrowed, and started delivering throughout the state in a Volkswagen van. By 1981 Time magazine was calling Ben and Jerry's the best ice cream in the world, and the strain of success was starting to show. Jerry quit for three years, saying he would never return and, in 1984, Ben, 'having the horrible feeling . . . that I had become a businessman', almost sold up. He decided to keep Ben and Jerry's 'in trust for the community'. A whopping 7.5 per cent of the company's pre-tax profits goes to charity (compared to the average of less than 1 per cent for most US companies) through Ben and Jerry's Foundation. Their ice cream novelty, Peace Pops (ice cream bars dipped in chocolate and nuts), raises money and awareness for the '1 per cent for Peace' organisation, which seeks to redirect 1 per cent of the US defence budget to programmes that promote understanding between nations. Ben and Jerry's is a groovy place to work, too. Dads get paid paternity leave and there are baby changing tables in the men's rooms. The most publicised - and problematic - element of Ben and Jerry's employment policy is their limit on executive salaries: the highest-paid employee can only make seven times the lowest wage, which last year meant that the highest wage possible, including benefits, was about Dollars 130,000. While Ben and Jerry argue that the salary cap ensures executives join the company for the 'right' reasons, the policy is unpopular among higher-ups. It has been difficult to keep executives in place - early this year three top-level positions were available. Ben and Jerry's owns up to its mistakes almost to a fault - its 1991 annual report reads like a confessional. The introduction of Ben and Jerry's Light Ice Cream was a 'disaster' - it sold poorly and the company was nailed by the Food and Drug Administration for abusing the term 'light'; the line has been dropped. The report also admits that factory discharge caused severe waste water problems in one town. Two of America's leading business magazines, Fortune and Forbes, have criticised the inconsistency (as they see it) of Ben and Jerry's self-proclaimed social awareness while selling expensive ice cream: 'Inner city residents would have to take out a bridge loan to take home a pint', says Forbes. Ben and Jerry's certainly is expensive - pints cost Dollars 2.50 or more, and cones start at Dollars 1.75 - but then Ben and Jerry have never claimed theirs is an equal-opportunity ice cream. They seem content to be contemporary Robin Hoods, selling pricey products to yuppies and redistributing the proceeds to the less fortunate. Forbes is also responsible for the rumour that Ben's six-month sabbatical this year is a front - he is really quitting the company to live on a rice and beans in solidarity with the Third World, it says. The company says Ben will return in September, in time for the introduction of the newest flavour - Wavy Gravy - and that it will be business as usual at Ben and Jerry's.</p>

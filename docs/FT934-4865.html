			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US-Russian trade in manufactured products soaring US-Russian trade in manufactured products is soaring this year, while American trade agencies are being flooded with requests for export finance and insurance, according to Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US Commerce Department undersecretary of international trade. As co-chairman of the Business Development Council, a US-Russian Commission, Mr Garten was in Moscow yesterday helping to dismantle obstacles to US trade and investment. In the first eight months of this year, US exports to Russia rose by 165 per cent to Dollars 1bn. While Russia's exports to the rest of the world declined, its American exports leaped by 287 per cent to Dollars 729m. US enthusiasm for business ties to Russia, strong when the cold war was winding down, began to cool when the difficulties of doing business became apparent. However, encouraged by US government programmes, more than 400 American companies have set up shop in Russia, Mr Garten said. Applications for trade insurance to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation are 'off the charts', Mr Garden said. The same is true for financing from the US-Export Import Bank and the Trade and Development agency, which finances feasibility studies.</p>

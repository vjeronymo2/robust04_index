			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: US partnership to take Holmes stake Holmes Protection, the US security group which is quoted in the UK, has signed an agreement with HP Partners LP, under which HP will invest Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.5m) in Holmes. HP - a New York-based partnership formed specifically to make this investment - will receive in exchange 21.2m shares of common stock at 47.1 cents each and 9.6m warrants, each to purchase one share of common stock at 32.7 cents. The transaction will give HP a 34 per cent stake in the company. The proceeds will be used to meet liabilities and particularly to repay Holmes' Dollars 3m short term bank debt. Holmes has agreed to seek a listing on Nasdaq and intends to delist its shares from London once the US listing is effective and taking account of access of existing stockholders to a public trading market. In its results for the 1993 year, announced yesterday, Holmes reported a fall in pre-tax profit from Dollars 4.18m to Dollars 503,000 on turnover down from Dollars 56.2m to Dollars 53m. First quarter 1994 profits, however, were little changed at Dollars 338,000 (Dollars 345,000), on Dollars 12.9m (Dollars 13.7m) turnover.</p>

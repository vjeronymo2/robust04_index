Vasyl  Kukurichka has more details.    [Kukurichka] As is known, the Polish National Defense  Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk was on an official visit in Ukraine  from 6-8 April. At a joint news conference for Ukrainian and  foreign correspondents, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy  Radetskyy summed up the results of the visit by the high guest  from the neighboring state.    [Begin Radetskyy recording] Mr. Kolodziejczyk visited  Ukraine  for the first time ever in his capacity as leader of the  military department of the Republic of Poland. But contacts  between our defense ministries at such a level already have a  certain history. This is the best proof of the fact that  relations in the military sphere between Ukraine and Poland are  developing dynamically and fruitfully.    The two neighbors have much in common. They have a common  history and struggle for independence. Today, they share a  mutual understanding in approaches toward issues of security in  Europe and the world in general. This is the aspiration to  democracy, a balanced stand in relation to acceding to new  European structures, participation in peacemaking forces, and so  on.    A significant number of Poles reside in Ukraine and  Ukrainians in Poland, which, of course, is nearly the most  important factor, among others, of the mutual interest in  developing relations.    We regard the Republic of Poland in the new Europe as our  strategic partner. [word indistinct] that in Warsaw they have  similar views of Ukraine. For example, President Lech Walesa  declared that a free Poland is impossible without an independent  Ukraine. I am pleased to point out that military contacts  occupy one of the important places in the development of  relations between our states. They were initiated as far back  as last year, when the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the  Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Poland signed an  agreement on cooperation in the military sphere.    I believe that the current visit to Ukraine by my  counterpart  was fruitful. Throughout the three days the minister had useful  meetings: with Ukraine's President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk,  at the Cabinet of Ministers, at the Defense Ministry, at the  Foreign Affairs Ministry, and at the Ministry of  Machine-Building, Military-Industrial Complex, and Conversion.    There were a number of conversations equally important for  both our states. Also, the Polish defense minister familiarized  himself with certain aspects of military construction and  military personnel training during his visit to the Kiev  Military Institute of Control and Communication. Having looked  round the Antonov scientific and technical aviation center, my  counterpart had an opportunity to familiarize himself with the  scientific potential of our country.    During the visit, we considered quite a few important  issues,  from broadening and deepening bilateral military contacts, to  our states' participation in creating a European security  system. The latter is important because our states are situated  in the heart of Europe, therefore stability on the European  continent and in general depend in full measure on stability in  this region.    Poland and Ukraine were among the first to join the  Partnership for Peace program. This shows that we are striving  for sincere goodneighborly relations with all countries  participating in this project.    And the program proposed by the U.S. President makes it  possible to establish mutually advantageous relations between  independent states. The minister and I exchanged opinions on  the partnership program. And I want to emphasize that our views  regarding their significance and prospects for implementing them  on the whole coincide. This concerns such issues as joint  participation in peacemaking operations, standardization of  armaments, determining military measures and (?forces) with  regard to participation in this program, tactics, and so on.    In general, we are putting a considerably deeper content  into  the Partnership for Peace program and view it as a principle of  European security (?at levels of) mutual relations between  neighboring states, of regional security, for example in the  central-eastern part of the continent, and of general security  as a way of creating a new structure of European security. On  the whole, the implementation of the Partnership for Peace  program will, in our view, make it possible to create additional  conditions to achieve full disarmament and strengthen peace on  our planet.    As far as the prospects for cooperation between the military  departments of Ukraine and Poland are concerned, they encompasss  a number of issues. The cooperation plan for this year  envisages the exchange of delegations and of experience in  developing armed forces and training of military specialists.  Work in the field of military equipment is also envisaged. I  think that during the Kiev meetings with the minister we have  further deepened relations between our ministries and between  our countries as a whole. So if military bridges are being made  and strengthened, this testifies to the healthy and openhearted  relations between the states.    So, may I express my (?certainty) that friendly interest and  mutual respect will dominate in future relations between Ukraine  and the Poland. [end recording]    [Kukurichka] In his turn, Polish Defense Minister  Kolodziejczyk noted:    [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording, in Polish with superimposed  Ukrainian translation] I want to emphasize once again that the  fundamental principle of Poland's foreign policy is to have the  closest possible relations with neighboring states. Ukraine is  a very important neighbor for us, if only because our joint  border is over 500 kilometers long. Your state possesses huge  intellectual potential, the Ukrainian land contains the  inexhaustible wealth of useful minerals, and your industry has  mastered the most complex technologies. [end recording]    [Kukurichka] In the opinion of Poland's defense minister,  relations between our states our good. He confirmed that  cooperation with Ukraine in the field of modernizing military  equipment, repairing fighting vehicles and providing them with  spare parts is of special interest to Poland. Ukraine's and  Poland's defense ministers replied to a number of questions from  journalists. This is Vasyl Kukurichka, Radio Ukraine World  Service.</p>

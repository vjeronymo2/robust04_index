			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Prytula: "Nobody in Crimea Would Bet a </F> Penny on Yevhen Saburov"]    [Text] Though the new Crimean power is willing to keep all  its intrigues and conflicts a secret, echoes of palace rivalries  are spreading across the Crimea and stirring the Crimean  residents who are falling asleep due to an inert political life.  These rumors claim that the top officials from the Crimean  Government -- President Yuriy Meshkov and Vice Prime Minister  Yevgeniy Saburov, who comes from Moscow -- are at odds and a new  government will be soon established in the Crimea.    Moscow economist Yevgeniy Saburov, who was not recognized in  his own state, came to the Crimea at the recommendation of  Sergey Stankevich, a friend of Yuriy Meshkov. However, local  observers believe that Yuriy Meshkov chose Stankevich for his  friend only because he needed to create his own democratic  image. Meshkov also chose Saburov because the latter was born  in Yalta. When Saburov began working as prime minister, he felt  a strong opposition on the side of Meshkov's entourage;  especially, on the side of Valeriy Grishenkov who enviously and  watchfully protected the Crimean president from a "harmful"  influence from the vice prime minister. In addition, Yevgeniy  Saburov has repeatedly declared his loyalty to Kiev and stated  that despite his nationality, he is against the reconsideration  of border issues.    Given any opportunity, this Moscow expert demonstrated his  willingness to promote reforms. On the eve of the elections,  according to his reformer's inclinations, Yevgeniy Saburov  abolished state subsidies on bread and drafted a resolution, to  be signed by the Crimean president, to introduce a single legal  tender -- the karbovanets -- on the territory of the Crimea.  This, however, does not match the president's election promises  regarding the immediate introduction of rubles into circulation  on the peninsula. Rivalry and secret conflicts between the  Saburov team and the president's entourage, headed by Viktor  Grishenkov, a former KGB officer, ended by breaking up the  office and the dismissal of almost all of its officers.  Saburov's victory was absolute: Moscow resident Viktor Minin  was nominated to the post of minister for state service --  responsible for the government's and president's offices -- who,  when meeting with journalists, declared that his primary task is  to be a mediator between Meshkov and Saburov and smooth their  conflicts. The fact that Meshkov abolished the resolution,  which had already been signed by Saburov -- regarding the  increase in prices for bread and cereal products -- signals that  these contradictions are rather serious. Saburov has harshly  reacted to this presidential move: "Despite whatever political  motives populism is triggered by, it will bring no good."    Meanwhile, Yuriy Meshkov tolerates Yevgeniy Saburov because  he needs him. However, the Crimean leader feels more  comfortable when he meets and discusses various issues with Oleg  Rumyantsev, former Russian people's deputy and head of the  constitutional commission of the Russian Federation, who  promised to draft a concept on the state and legal building in  the Crimea. Commenting on these Meshkov contacts, Yevgeniy  Saburov said enviously to journalists that Oleg Rumyantsev does  not represent anything as a politician and nobody takes him  seriously in Moscow. Local observers have concluded that  Russian advisers to the Crimean president decided to move their  Moscow conflicts -- between liberals (Saburov) and  national-patriots (Rumyantsev) -- to the Crimea.    However, despite the disparity in positions of Saburov and  Meshkov, despite the loyalty of the Crimean vice prime minister  to official Kiev, which was publicly declared by him, we should  not make him such a devoted Ukrainophile. Simply put, he is  much smarter than Meshkov, Rumyantsev, and Grishenkov taken  together. Currently, the Crimea is in the epicenter of battles  which are being conducted by Russian clans to gain influence  over the peninsula and the key goal of Saburov is to provide for  the economic expansion and political administration of his clan  (Luzhkov -- Shokhin -- Stankevich). This goal demands, first of  all, that political stability be introduced in this autonomous  republic. The fact that Meshkov does not understand this causes  the differences between him and his deputy prime minister.  Rumors regarding the rapid end of these contradictions are  being spread in Simferopol. It seems to me that the half-Moscow  team of Yevgeniy Saburov is living through their last days.  First of all, this is due to the fact that anti-Saburov  sentiments prevail among the members of the ruling "Russia"  faction. So, who will change Saburov? Will this be Rumyantsev  or Baburin? Or Zhirinovskiy? At any rate, we have many such  persons here with us.</p>

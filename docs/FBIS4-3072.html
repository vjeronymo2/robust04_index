			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO Short Commentary: "The Alarm Bell Is Set Off </F> Again" -- date not given]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- RENMIN RIBAO Short  Commentary: "The Alarm Bell Is Set Off Again"    The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court has  already  passed judgment in accordance with the law on the case of Tian  Ye and Xi Yang, who are accused of stealing state secrets and  spying. Tian and Xi were sentenced to 15 and 12 years,  respectively, in jail. The judicial organs took facts as the  basis and the law as their criterion in reaching the judgment.  The sentencing standards used are proper and the two offenders  received their due punishment.    Xi Yang is a reporter of MING PAO based in Hong Kong who was  assigned by the newspaper to cover news in the inland [nei di  0355 0966]. He is welcome if he does the things a reporter is  supposed to do -- gathering news and writing news stories. He  is, however, not a law-abiding person, and he chose to engage  in illegal acts of stealing and spying on financial and economic  state secrets, which caused catastrophic consequences. These  kinds of illegal acts, if not punished according to the law,  will severely sabotage reform, opening up, and economic  construction and do great harm to the interest of the state. Xi  Yang's is a criminal case, pure and simple. The punishment of  criminals guilty of stealing secrets and the protection of  correspondents' freedom to gather news in accordance with the  law are two totally different things. There is a clear  distinction between legitimate news gathering and illegal  spying. Our government protects the freedom of news coverage  but not the freedom of stealing state secrets. Whoever steals  state secrets in violation of the law will be punished according  to the law.    As everybody knows, in the past decade or so, China, which  is  implementing the policy of reform and opening to the outside  world, has opened its door to and warmly welcomed correspondents  from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan as well as from foreign  countries to cover news in China, and offered, to the extent  possible, services to make things easier for them in their  legitimate reporting. This is the way we received the over  1,000 Hong Kong correspondents who came to the inland for news  coverage since last year. Most correspondents from overseas  abide by Chinese law, and only one case, Xi Yang's case, of  stealing state secrets and spying was discovered last year. The  law is sacred and no one is allowed to break it. No sovereign  country or responsible government will tolerate illegal acts of  spying on secrets in the name of news coverage.    As for Tian Ye, he is "a thief in the family" who wormed his  way into an important state department. As a deputy chief of  the General Office of the Bureau of Overseas Affairs of the  People's Bank of China, his acts of stealing, spying on, and  illegally supplying state secrets to others -- acts that have  caused great damage to the country and people -- are even more  intolerable under the law. The end he has come to is  educational to the people: under the new historical period,  reform and opening up indeed pose a severe test to the loyalty  of every cadre of the state. In the future, we must step up  ideological education among the cadres. We must also strictly  enforce law and discipline and implement effective measures to  prevent similar violations from happening again.    This case of stealing secrets and spying has set off the  alarm bell again. It reminds us to be alert in safeguarding  state secrets and also serves as a warning to those who divulge  or steal secrets. May the alarm bell ring forever!</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov and Aleksey Chelnokov: </F> "Visitors to the Capital From Ukraine and Belarus Offer Good  Bargains"]    [Text] Many of Moscow's streets and squares, especially  those near stations, markets, and subways, have been taken over  by citizens from Ukraine and Belarus. They trade in everything  they can manage to carry out of their "coupon-economy" and  "counter-economy" states. The Russian ruble, only recently  dubbed "the wooden currency," has suddenly become an object of  passionate desire for citizens of the former Union republics.  For the sake of acquiring the ruble thousands of people are  giving up their homes and families, going without sleep for days  on end, and standing for days in the winter mud of Moscow's  streets....  <H5>  A Cosy Breeding Ground for Crime... </H5>   The Tashinka market has its own laws which effectively  conform not at all to the generally accepted laws, and no one  here is worried about concepts such as licensing, quality  control, and health norms. Only Muscovites for whom prices at  central stores are too dear now come to the dilapidated market;  vendors are divided into two categories -- dealers in old rags  and nails and sellers of food.    The first category of trade "workers" are of interest to no  one except scrap metal merchants. But the second, dubbed "the  Belarusian trade mafia" in the neighboring homesteads, are of  interest to everyone. To exact a tribute from a Belarusian who  has arrived in Tashinka Square is as easy as picking up money  off the street -- only the lazy or very scrupulous do not do it.    The first to rush to the ranks of traders are  representatives  of the market administration -- the janitors. In return for  2,000 rubles [R] they give the vendors something like a little  table or market stall and an oral guarantee of freedom to trade  within the perimeter of Tashinka Square. There are no visiting  traders in the market itself -- their potential customers hardly  go there at all. But here they sell almost everything in which  fraternal Belarus abounds: soap, brassieres, milk, cottage  cheese, soda, cranberries, meat, cured fish, and even beer from  the bottle -- at R100 per glass. They can even pour you a drop  of vodka.    Prices on Tashinka Square are indeed low: Boiled ham goes  for R1,500-R2,000. Smoked meat sells for between R3,000 and  R4,000. Smoked ham goes for around R4,000, and lightly smoked  ham for R3,000 per kilogram. Cranberries and apples cost R1,200  and R1,300 respectively. Soda, which is not to be found in  Moscow, costs R250 a packet. Children's soap sells for R75,  whereas the state food store in the neighborhood sells only  "Camay" at 10 times the price.    Despite fears, no incidents of food poisoning from goods  from  Belarus or the pharmaceutical preparations which sell abundantly  here were recorded over the past year in Krasnopresnenskiy  Rayon. True, the traders here bring product quality to mind only  when the local health and epidemological monitoring service puts  in an appearance, but that is not more than once a month. Hence  to the question "Where does this meat or cheese come from?" the  traders usually answer: "From Brest." But this is only for  those who recall that half of Belarus' oblasts have been  contaminated by Chernobyl. For those who can only afford to buy  "poshekhonskiy" cheese [low-quality provincial cheese] here at  R2,500 instead of "Suluguni" -- R1,500 dearer in the state trade  network -- this is not a question of fundamental importance.    A different kind of quality control appear on Tashinka  Square from 1000 hours -- officers of the militia's 88th  department. The guardians of order walk in twos and regularly  check documents, something that is especially topical following  the restrictions introduced by the capital's mayor on foreigners  from the former republics entering and residing in the city.  The militia officers have trained eyes, and both sergeants  skirted past an old man dealing in cranberries; but they at once  became interested in two women selling walnuts. The brassiere  dealers did not escape their attention either. The militia  officer aptly dubbed the contents of the bags "Chernobyl  umbrellas." And for some reason he took R4,000. "That is their  tax," the traders explained to me. "They don't issue receipts."    The third set of "controllers" of the square's bazaar were  Azerbaijani kids who flocked from the market gates. "These kids  take money on a fair basis: How much each man can afford," the  old man with the cranberries says, whether in jest or in  earnest. Probably a sense of justice has indeed developed among  racketeers, because yet again nothing was taken from the old  man. "I got nothing," as the old man himself said in Ukrainian.  On the other hand the brassiere sellers once again had to cough  up "5 grand" and unhappily started to gather up their wares.    Traders from Belarus frequently come in order to buy cheap  audio and visual equipment in Russia with their hard-earned  rubles. They stay with friends and relatives. They are  convinced that "it is more profitable to work in Russia today  than in Poland."    The second group of traders are those for whom it is more  profitable to "work" in Poland, but more convenient to sell in  Russia. In their native Belarus they earn less from brassieres,  and the taxes there, it seems, are higher. And the third group  -- the largest -- are people stopping off in Moscow on their way  to visit relatives in the Russian heartlands, or in countries of  the former republics. For them Moscow is the place to convert  their native "counters" into a more stable currency. This kind  of trader finds out about Tashinka Square accidentally, from  friends, or even at Belorusskiy Station, where they spend the  night for free and live for several days.    On the whole, the militia's 88th department told me,  Tashinka  Square is "a cosy breeding ground for crime."  <H5>  Six Pay Packets for Four Trips </H5>   Every morning an avalanche of speculators with heavy bags  descends from the trains arriving at Moscow's Kiev Railway  Station. Having negotiated the barriers at the doors and  turnstiles they rapidly disperse among the capital's flea  markets. But the bulk of them stop in the immediate vicinity of  the station -- at the Dorogomilovskiy market.    Just as at Tashinka, the enterprising citizens from the  coupon-economy state are not allowed underneath the arched vault  of the market. Here citizens of Azerbaijan trading in tropical  fruits have long since firmly established themselves. Hence,  despite the rules on trade, for several hours a day Kievskaya  Ulitsa is transformed into a huge flea market.    The Christmas vacation, we discovered, does not extend to  the  private sector. Thousands of street traders, mixing Russian and  Ukrainian words, were vying with one another in extolling their  wares. Squeezing my way through the crowd with difficulty and,  so as to avoid trouble, clutching my bag closely, I looked over  the range of goods available. It was inexhaustible: women's  blouses embroidered with glass beads, large axes, peacock  feathers, bodices, sausage meat, pickles, preserves, and so on  and so forth. All this magnificence lay strewn not very  esthetically on bushes beside the road or was piled high in  dirty boxes. But still more amazing were the prices --  two-thirds to one-half the Moscow average.    The customer in this flea market also has his own character.  They are people who as a rule are poorly dressed; many are  elderly. "Aren't you afraid of being poisoned?" we asked a  woman for whom a guy in a greasy quilted jacket was fetching a  "stick" of sausage meat from his rucksack. "What do you mean,"  she replies, "I have been buying from him for a long time.  Excellent Ukrainian sausage meat, for which in a store you pay  not R2,000, like here, but R4,000-6,000."    The sausage meat seller is from near Chernigovo. He works in  a cooperative, but he makes up the bulk of his family budget, in  his own words, through shuttle trips to Russia.    "For four trips to Moscow I get six monthly pay packets,"  he says. "The coupon is now 35-40 times more `lightweight' than  the ruble. One trip -- 40 kilograms of lightly smoked sausage  meat. This is snatched up within three hours; I change the  rubles for coupons, or else I buy goods here to sell at home."    "But surely the goods are confiscated by Ukrainian customs  officials?"    "Of course not, pal -- we give them all a little extra to  keep them sweet! And if some crank takes the rucksack -- it's  no big loss: I return home for another consignment of sausage  meat."    The mechanics of the flea market are elementary: The dealer,  arriving in the capital at, say, 0800, has already gotten rid of  his wares by midday. Two-three hours are spend on the purchase  of consignments of imported cigarettes or chocolate from small  wholesalers (on the square by the station the wholesale market  is the cheapest in Moscow). And later on the same day the  evening train carries the breadwinner back to his native peasant  house.    "You force down prices on the Moscow markets" -- we are  talking to the same trader. "Haven't your competitors tried to  punish you for this?"    "There has been no such incident in my time. The problem  lies elsewhere: Often some boys `call round' and demand money  for the space. We pay them R4,000-5,000 a time. All the same  we do not go away with empty pockets."    The customer and the trader at the local flea market, all  the  indications suggest, are entirely happy with one another. But  at the 123d militia department they believe that the spontaneous  congregation of thousands of people in this area creates a  dangerous breeding ground for crime. Pickpockets, muggers, and  small-time racketeers gather here like flies around honey. It  is very difficult to combat them, because regulars to the  market, preferring "not to get involved," refuse to complain to  the militia.    "All we can do is curse under our breath," Oleg Sharov,  deputy chief of the militia's 123d department, says.  "Nevertheless, in the last six months we have caught 150  pickpockets and roughly the same number of muggers at the  market. But, of course, this is just a drop in the ocean."    Sharov calls his detectives "the paperwork brigade": They  barely have time to fill out their official reports. Some days  the number of detainees reaches hundreds! Yet aside from the  market, they have to watch over order on the square in the  station precincts. Four criminal groups keep tabs on the  commercial kiosks on this square, and they are repeatedly  organizing bloody affrays between one another.    Sooner or later the patience of the militia or the health  and  epidemological station will snap. The Ukrainian traders will be  arrested and fined, and then they will move to Tashinka Square  -- which is where we began this report....</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Parliament's 19 January session has been  aborted. For its first convening, the Chamber of Deputies could  not reach the necessary quorum for the debates planned  yesterday. Frantz Robert Monde, the new president of the Chamber  of Deputies, warned he would take sanctions against the  absentees or those who believe in an empty seat. Edner Jean  files a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] Several reasons can explain the  failure of this first session of the Chamber of Deputies under  the aegis of President Monde. First of all, the absence of  several legislators, most particularly those of the BP-FNCD  [Parliamentary Bloc for the National Front for Change and  Democracy] who stayed in the United States after the  international conference. The difficulties in obtaining fuel  allegedly also forced some deputies to stay home. However,  beyond those considerations, the postponement of this session is  mostly interpreted as a response from a group of deputies to the  election of Frantz Robert Monde. The new president of the  Chamber spoke about the boycott and is considering taking severe  measures against the absent deputies. Thus, Monde is giving his  first warning to the absent deputies:    [Monde] Obviously some sectors wish to boycott the work of  the Chamber. You can be sure that we are going to consider  immediate measures to stave off their efforts. However, it is  sad to note that some legislators, paid to attend debates, do  not have the courage to do so and prefer, for a question of  bureau, not present themselves at the Chamber. It is a shame for  those that they represent.    [Jean] What kind of solutions are you considering,  President?  Some deputies suggested seizing the checks of the absent  deputies.    [Monde] All the measures being considered will be taken with  the majority. [end recording]    [Jean] The former president of the Chamber considers that it  is too early to speak of a boycott. Antoine Joseph, who is back  to his status of a simple deputy, thinks that it falls upon the  new leader to search for the causes which provoked the absence  of the deputies in order to find a solution as soon as possible.  This is necessary because a session full of issues is awaiting  the deputies, he explains.    [Begin Joseph recording in Creole] It is too early to speak  of a boycott. Perhaps there are many problems. Maybe there is  a lack of contact with the presidents of the groups. The  mobilization is not going very well. There is also a problem of  gasoline. I think that the parliamentary bureau should take  things in hand and search for the causes with the deputies and  then take measures which would allow holding the session. We are  at a difficult juncture which should prompt us to hold sessions  to decide the important issues. There are economic problems;  there is the possibility of a new increase in the monetary  ceiling;, there is also the national conference; there is the  resignation of the Malval government. We have as many important  issues which the Parliament must make decisions on. Personally,  I think that the holding of sessions during these times is  urgent and necessary. Thus, the parliamentary bureau must take  measures in order to hold sessions.[end recording]    [Jean] Antoine Joseph, who just lost his post of president  to  the profit of Frantz Robert Monde, does not get discouraged. He  is about to constitute a new bloc in the lower chamber, a bloc  which should offset the powers of the Alliance in face of the  FNCD. [passage omitted] The socialists who have a representative  within the new parliamentary bureau, Mac-Ferl Morquette, the  vice president, did not give all that they could to obtain a  quorum. The socialists prefer to wait and hope, a wait and see  attitude.</p>

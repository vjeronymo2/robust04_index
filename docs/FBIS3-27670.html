			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb 25 (AFP)--Some 10,000 Chinese firms  were sold or merged last year, as local governments took  advantage of property rights reform to invigorate loss-making  state enterprises, a senior economic official said Friday [25  February]. Medium-sized and small state firms "with less than  desirable management and profits" were sold, transferred or  merged amid the introduction of new legislation aimed at  clarifying the murky issue of property rights, said Jia Hefing  of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring (SCER).    In China's 16 largest cities, 2,900 medium-sized and small  firms were sold or merged, and property rights worth six billion  yuan (700 million dollars) were effectively made productive, Jia  said. Recent reforms have seen an increasing number of firms  from different regions or sectors being merged, Jia said, citing  enterprises in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen which have taken  over others by buying their stock. According to Jia, the  growing number of pilot companies going public in China has  provided a major boost to property rights reform.    There are currently 3,800 pilot stock companies nationwide.  China recently promulgated a series of laws and regulations,  such as the bankruptcy law and corporate law which provide a  partial, legal framework for defining property rights.    However, according to a senior lawyer with a western law  firm  in Beijing, a comprehensive property rights law is still a long  way off. "The authorities have been considering it for some  time, but it's a complex and sensitive issue," the lawyer said.  "For the moment they seem content to muddle through with the  existing regulations, which are still far from adequate," he  added.    The SCER has pledged to clarify property rights which,  together with ending management interference by bureaucrats and  allowing firms to go bankrupt, are considered essential to the  reform of inefficient state enterprises in China, which continue  to be a major drain on government coffers.</p>

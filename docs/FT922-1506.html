			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Foreign companies 'hiring less' THE NUMBER of people employed in foreign-owned manufacturing companies slowed to a halt in the 1980s, according to a study of government figures by by Incomes Data Services, the pay research body, David Goodhart writes. In spite of claims by the government that deregulation during the 1980s has led to a large inflow of foreign capital and jobs, the percentage of employees working for foreign-owned manufacturers was static at 15 per cent between 1979 and 1989. The percentage rose from 11 per cent to 15 per cent between 1973 and 1979. The total working for foreign manufacturers declined from 974,000 in 1979 to 724,000 in 1989, at a time when private manufacturing employment as a whole was falling from 6.5m to 4.9m. The organisation says that part of the reason is that the growth in Japanese groups in the 1980s has been offset by reduced employment in the US multinationals such as Ford. The report concludes that the trend in employment by foreign-based manufacturers is likely to improve. Incomes Data Services, Report 619, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS</p>

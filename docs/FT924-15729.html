			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: Major and government should resign Sir, Never before has a UK government so blatantly misled its own people, world financial markets and, most horrifically, the European Community over which it presides, as during the build-up to the latest devaluation of sterling. John Major and his government should resign and call a general election. By its own admission, the Conservative party alone is the party that understands financial markets and believes in the unrestricted movement of capital and the merits of free trade. And, by that, it confesses to knowing how large a run on the pound could be. In case one were tempted to forgive the chancellor a certain amount of ignorance, one might care to remember that, a week prior to our voluntary suspension from the ERM, Finland, Sweden and, above all, Italy witnessed colossal currency flows that savaged their financial markets. So Messrs Major and Lamont knew exactly what they would be faced with and were not prepared to do everything necessary to defend the pound. If they had been prepared, they would have followed the Bundesbank in raising rates half a point earlier in the year. Failing that, they would have raised rates when their ERM Ecu divergence indicator went through the critical - 75 level. Finally, they would have hiked rates 50 basis points on the morning following the lira devaluation, when the Germans wrong-footed the markets by shaving the Lombard rate a mere quarter of a point. But the government never had any intention of raising rates for an indefinite period to protect the pound. Not once did Mr Major or Mr Lamont say he would raise rates. This government could not bear a painful rise in mortgage repayments and so a last-ditch 'we-tried-everything' strategy was hatched. The plan was to defend the pound with borrowed money and to jack up rates as a last resort, knowing full well that responsible home-loan lenders would not follow suit. Unfortunately, when faced with death, there is no distinction between bravery and fear. When this government realised that the final nail was about to be hammered into the coffin of its economic policy, it pretended to go down with a spirited fight. There has been much talk of speculators during this sad affair, but it is unlikely they played much part in the downfall of our currency. Aware of the government's lack of will power, fund managers, corporate treasurers and foreign investors lost faith in them and more crucially in the pound. The only speculators on the horizon were a beleaguered Bank of England and a humiliated UK government. John Major should now resign.

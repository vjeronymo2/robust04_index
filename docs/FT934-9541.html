			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / AT&amp;T reassures EC about expansion plans AMERICAN TELEPHONE &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group seeking to establish itself in Europe, moved to reassure potential EC partners yesterday by downplaying the likelihood of aggressive competition in their home markets before the end of the decade. Mr John Foster, AT&amp;T's Europe director, stressed that outside the UK, telecoms competition was set to be low key for 'years' after the European Commission's 1998 deadline for the liberalisation of internal EC voice telecommunications traffic. 'A lot of people assume that the world changes on 1 Jan 1998,' said Mr Foster. In fact, there would be an 'extended period' of transition. 'It will be a matter of years before competition is developed at all fully.' He drew a parallel with the position in the US, where MCI, now the second largest long-distance carrier, took nearly two decades to establish itself as a strong competitor to AT&amp;T. Mr Foster declined to comment on current negotiations, but AT&amp;T is known to be in talks with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom about a possible link-up to create an international network for multinational companies. The French and German state telecoms companies are believed to have drafted an agreement to merge their European and transatlantic business services, with a view to a possible partnership with AT&amp;T. The two companies already have a joint venture - Eunetcom - to serve the 'outsourcing' market among multinationals. A stronger Eunetcom, allied to AT&amp;T, would give their international ambitions greater credibility. Mr Foster said AT&amp;T's priority was to find a suitable European partner for its Worldsource venture in the next few months. Worldsource, launched in May with KDD of Japan and Singapore Telecom, is targeted at the market for one-stop telecoms services among the world's leading 2,500 transnational companies. Some of the Commission's advisers are concerned at the threat posed by AT&amp;T, and are keen to see European operators form closer ties. Editorial Comment, Page 21 Starry-eyed investors, Page 32</p>

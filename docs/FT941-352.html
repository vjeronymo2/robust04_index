			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Servomex Restructuring costs of Pounds 568,000 left Servomex, the maker of gas analysis and monitoring equipment, with 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.52m, against Pounds 2.11m. Earnings per share came out at 9.4p (14.1p) but the final proposed dividend is raised to 4.5p for a total of 6.4p (5.9p) reflecting the company's confidence in the future following its cost cutting. Turnover improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 19.7m). However volume growth was only 3 per cent with the rest being made up of price rises and exchange rate effects. Net debt rose slightly to Pounds 1.77m at the year end, against Pounds 1.54m, for gearing of 25 per cent (23 per cent). The company said that an inventory reduction programme had released Pounds 724,000 towards the cost of capital investment.</p>

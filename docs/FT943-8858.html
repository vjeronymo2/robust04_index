			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Observer: Unison on stage Britain's trade unions are not normally fertile sources for stories of sex, money and the media which is probably why Unison, the public services union, has decided to sponsor one instead. The union has given Pounds 15,000 to back Abducting Diana, a satirical play by Dario Fo about a woman millionairess media tycoon who has a penchant for picking up young men for afternoon sex. In the past Unison has concentrated more on sponsoring high-class 'agit prop' - that's agitational propaganda to you and me. However, it is keen to move away from 'overt socialist themes' and in March tried to sponsor a football game between Plymouth Argyle and Barnet. Abducting Diana, which opens at the Edinburgh festival tomorrow, seems assured of more success. But in case Unison members find it too heavy going they can reserve a place for themselves at the highlight of the summer season - the annual TUC conference, which starts a short run at Blackpool's Winter Gardens three weeks later.</p>

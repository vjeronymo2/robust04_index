			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unions will seek wage increases to counter 'damage' of Budget (1) Sir, I am glad that, amid all the theatrical oohs and aahs which have greeted the chancellor's magic deficit disappearing tricks, your leader ('Mr Clarke shows his skills', December 1) has reminded us that this is a tough Budget. It will be particularly tough for the low paid, the unemployed and those struggling to survive with the backing of the tattered remains of our welfare state. This has been no ordinary Budget to balance revenue and expenditure. It underlines the government's fundamental shift to indirect taxation aimed at allowing wealthier Tory supporters to enjoy a disproportionate share of the national cake. The message is: if the wealthy don't need it, let's scrap it. If they do need particular services, let's find a way of ensuring they pay less than they can afford while others pay proportionately more of their income. With three new taxes - insurance and airport taxes, and a threatened tax on motorway travel - combined with increased indirect taxation on petrol and cars, it is clear that living costs will rise in consequence. That means the poor will pay more, and for reduced services. This strategy represents a clear attack on the interests of ordinary working people. Until it becomes possible to change that strategy, trade unions will pursue their members' interests by seeking wage increases which take account of the damage the Budget will do to standards of living.

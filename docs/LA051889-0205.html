			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HUSSEIN REJECTS ISRAELI ELECTION PLAN  </P> <P> King Hussein today rejected an Israeli plan for elections in the  Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it is an attempt to buy time.  </P> <P> The Israeli blueprint avoids "facing increasing world pressures to solve the  (Palestinian) problem in a just and durable way," Hussein said.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership also  rejected the plan, which excludes participation by PLO members. Speaking at  Marka air base near Amman, Hussein said: "This (the PLO decision) is a  Palestinian move, and I believe it is my duty and the duty of all our Arab  brethren to support it."  </P></p>

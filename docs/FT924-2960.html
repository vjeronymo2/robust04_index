			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Threatened pits classed as efficient TWELVE PITS on British Coal's original closure list of 31 are capable of producing at internationally competitive rates within two years, a report said yesterday. Two of them, Trentham in Staffordshire and Betws in south Wales, are among 10 pits scheduled to shut at the end of January after a 90-day review. The report says the 12 are among BC's best 27 pits. All 27 could produce below the import price of Pounds 1.30 a gigajoule that the report considers internationally competitive. The combined output would be 50m to 66m tonnes a year. The report was written by Alan Oakes and Associates, a consultancy that has done work before for the government on British Coal's efficiency. McCloskey Coal Information Services, publisher of the report, said that suggested new technologies and working practices, if implemented, would displace 15m tonnes of imported coal in two years' time. The additional market for British coal would save up to 10 pits initially, it said. The efficiency measures would lead to significant job losses in existing pits and in those saved. Oakes estimated that the average number of miners in each would fall by half to achieve efficiencies. Oakes said productivity could triple if British Coal adopted the continuous mining and roof bolting techniques used abroad, increased shift hours, introduced team work and reduced supervisory staff. Mr Alan Oakes of the consultancy said British Coal had set a modest target for improving productivity, up from 1,500 tonnes of coal per worker per year to 2,500 in five years' time. The study says that recoverable deep mine reserves in all 50 pits would last 21 years. The nine pits from the 21 earmarked for possible closure but identified by Oakes as internationally competitive are Maltby, Hatfield, Prince of Wales, Rossington, Bentley, Point of Ayr, Wearmouth, Clipstone and Silverdale The report says British Coal's most modern pit, Asfordby in Leicestershire, is a good candidate for mothballing because it is unlikely to have lower operating costs than the corporation's best mines.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COSTS OF COAL-GENERATED POWER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Pithead coal cost per     Power cost                                  gigajoule (Pounds)         per KwH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Best five pits (12m-14m tonnes total per year)         1.00                 1.53p Next eight pits (16m-21m tonnes total per year)         1.10                 1.63p Next 14 pits (19m-27m tonnes total per year)         1.30                 1.83p  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: McCloskey Coal Information Services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

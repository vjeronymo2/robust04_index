The territorial administration head,  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, said specialists of the neighbouring  country will install two waste-processing facilities to treat  water used in nuclear submarine reactor.    Equipment of this kind has long been used in Japan and has  proved a reliable tool in reducing radioactivity in waste to  required level.    The first technological line will be installed in the Zvezda  factory which repairs nuclear submarines in the city Bolshoy  Kamen. Another installation will be attached to the Pacific  Fleet. Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who visited  Vladivostok on Monday, promised assistance in handling the  project.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Euro-babble Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European Union's culture and information commissioner, says Europe needs a flourishing film industry to encourage diversity in audio-visual entertainment. Few would disagree. However, his ideas for achieving that goal are so wide of the mark that he should tear up his script. He wants the EU to end a five-year exemption from competition law which allows big Hollywood studios to distribute films jointly in Europe. He also appears to favour stricter quotas on the broadcasting of foreign programmes. That, he says, will enable Europe's film and television industry to counter domination by Hollywood. When reviewing the distribution exemption, the Commission's overriding concern should be whether it benefits consumers. To champion the cause of local producers, as Mr Pinheiro suggests, would be to pervert competition law. Tightening broadcasting quotas, meanwhile, would further compromise free trade principles while extending an objectionable attempt at censorship. The danger is that Mr Pinheiro's approach would gratuitously provoke the US, which unsuccessfully sought to liberalise audio-visual services in the Uruguay Round trade talks, without helping European programme producers. As he admits, their problems stem largely from an inability to make material viewers want to watch. In any case, any protection quotas might provide would rapidly be undermined by communications technology. Unless Mr Pinheiro can offer a better answer than blaming Europe's failures on others' success, he should shut up.</p>

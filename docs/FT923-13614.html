			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / French promised corruption curbs NEW LEGISLATION to prevent political corruption will be put forward in the autumn, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, announced at the weekend at the Socialist party congress in Bordeaux. His move followed a newspaper report last Thursday that Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the Socialist president of the national assembly, was to be charged with political corruption, allegedly in connection with the long-running investigation into previous illicit financing methods of the Socialist party. The report, carried in Le Monde, has not been confirmed by any official source. But the story has acquired a political life of its own, and has caused alarm across the French political spectrum. Many politicians, from right as well as from left, have deplored a story which, if true, must be a damaging leak in the confidentiality of the judicial investigation system conducted by the juges d'instruction. Mr Jean Auroux, leader of the Socialist group in the national assembly, has called for urgent reform of the system. But there is also concern among some politicians, and not just Socialists, that the newspaper report may be an indication of something resembling a politically motivated campaign by part of the French magistracy against the Socialist party. Some Socialists have not hesitated to denounce the timing of the leak as a deliberate attempt to destabilise the party just before its congress and the long summer holidays. Mr Bernard Stasi, a leading member of the Centrist party, has commented: 'The judges must not engage in a vendetta with the politicians.' And Mr Andre Lajoinie, the Communist leader, has denounced the 'unhealthy climate' created by 'the threat of charges against politicians'. The Le Monde story was not specific on the nature of the charge, and indicated that Mr Emmanuelli's interview would not take place until next month. Mr Renaud van Ruymbeke, the investigating magistrate based in Rennes, has denied any political ulterior motive in the case. But he has also declined to confirm or deny the substance of the Le Monde report, and he has now gone on holiday for a month. The report did not make clear whether Mr Emmanuelli was supposed to be charged for illicit party financing or for personal corruption. It is widely believed that the Socialist party was in the past involved in illicit money-raising schemes, and Mr Emmanuelli makes no attempt to deny it; since he was treasurer of the party from July 1988 to January 1992, he must be formally responsible. But he might be covered by the political amnesty designed to clear the decks for new, tighter party financing laws. A charge of personal enrichment would be much more serious, and could lead to imprisonment. To counter any such innuendo, Mr Emmanuelli has written to the Justice Ministry asking for a preliminary inquiry into his personal finances. Many of his party colleagues have publicly declared their faith that Mr Emmanuelli could not be guilty of any personal enrichment.</p>

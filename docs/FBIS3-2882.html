Mr. Han, who left for the United States on Thursday, said he  finished the first edition of the China Labour Bulletin last  weekend. A "contact" was to take the first 1,000 copies to the  Chinese capital. From Beijing, the magazine would be  distributed to a network of workers throughout the mainland.  Another 1,000 copies in English would be sent to the 155  members of the International Federation of Free Trade Unions.    "We hope workers who see the magazine will learn what is  happening in the China labour movement," Mr. Han said. "We also  want the workers to think of themselves and the harsh conditions  they are working under."    The China Labour Bulletin is funded by the Hong Kong  Christian Council and its Christian Industrial Committee.  Legislator Lau Chin-shek, director of the committee, hired Mr.  Han to edit the bulletin last month. Initially, Mr. Han expects  to produce one edition each month. Eventually he hopes the  magazine will go bi-monthly.    Mr. Han said future editions would tell workers "how to  agitate for their rights". He said several dissidents in China  had also agreed to submit articles.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Patten and Zhou hold Hong Kong discussions MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday met Zhou Nan, Beijing's most senior official in Hong Kong, for talks that lasted almost twice as long as planned. A brief government statement after the nearly two-hour meeting said the discussions had been 'very useful' and had touched upon many of the main issues facing Hong Kong. It did not elaborate. Hong Kong officials said that both men presented their previously stated positions on the current wrangle over the colony's multi-billion dollar airport scheme, the pace of decision-making within the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Committee, and other issues. Disagreement over financing new airport continues to mar Sino-British ties despite a year-old agreement to clear remaining obstacles to the airport's construction. China so far has failed to approve the financing plan, holding up work on the project which is supposed to open by July 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule. Mr Patten is keen to establish a channel of communication with decision makers in Beijing. The length of this first meeting was taken as an encouraging sign that he might be able to do business with Zhou. Mr Patten said the meeting had been 'very friendly' and that he looked forward to regular and productive contacts with Zhou in the future. The New China News Agency, of which Zhou is director, released a statement saying that Zhou hoped to build a 'good working relationship' with the governor. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index yesterday fell 106.47 points, or 1.89 per cent, to 5,513.97. This was mostly attributed to foreign selling in a very thin market. Although the market has recently fallen over 6 per cent, it is still up about 35 per cent over the year. A spate of heavy selling late in the morning and early afternoon sent the index 243 lower before a wave of late buying and bargain hunting in the final 15 minutes of trading swung the market 100 points higher. Taiwan will draft a bill to govern relations with Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, Reuter reports from Taipei. The bill will provide a legal framework for Taiwan's policy on issues such as air, shipping and postal links, immigration from Hong Kong, and unofficial Taiwanese representative offices in the territory. Peng Shu-hung of the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council said the council was soliciting the views of scholars, officials and businessmen on the bill. He denied a newspaper report that it would be drafted within a year, saying there was no timetable.</p>

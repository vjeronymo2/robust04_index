			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that &sect;&sect;870.103(c)(2) and 890.104(c)(2) be changed to specify that the reconsideration review is an independent level of review. We are making this modification in the interest of clarity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asked how these regulations apply to agencies that have previously delegated initial decisions to another agency through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Such agencies may need to amend the MOU's to show which agency is to make the reconsideration decision. Currently the initial decision letters have been directing employees to ask OPM to reconsider the initial decision. Under the revised regulations the initial decision must tell the employee how to seek reconsideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expressed the concern that the term ``agency'' used in &sect;890.104 could restrict the agency's options about the role of the National Finance Center (NFC) in the reconsideration process for those agencies that have a MOU with NFC to administer their payroll or FEHB accounts for enrollees who make direct premium payments. Since NFC acts as an agent for the agency, these regulations in no way restrict NFC's role. However, agencies and NFC will need to decide which will perform the reconsideration function and then modify the MOU accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the comments we received indicated that agencies are uncertain about what reconsideration actually is. Therefore, we are adding a definition of the term ``reconsideration'' to clarify that it is the final part of the administrative review process and consists of a determination of whether the law and regulations were correctly applied when the initial decision was made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, there were several suggestions to correct real or perceived technical or typographical errors in the proposed regulations. We have made changes where appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely amends administrative procedures currently performed by OPM and Federal agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 870 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Hostages, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Life insurance, Retirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Parts 871, 872, and 873 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Life insurance, Retirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR 874 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government employees, Life insurance, Retirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 890 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Health facilities, Health insurance, Health professions, Hostages, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Retirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Personnel Management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James B.

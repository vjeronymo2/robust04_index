			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Small blessings welcomed - Charities CHARITY leaders were last night counting small Budget blessings while voicing disappointment that the government had not addressed the sector's bigger problems. The decision to reduce the level at which Gift Aid donations qualify for tax relief from Pounds 600 to Pounds 400 will be widely welcomed. Gift Aid, under which large one-off donations by individuals or companies qualify for tax relief, was introduced in October 1990. By the end of 1991 charities had claimed tax repayments of Pounds 50m on gifts of Pounds 150m. Many charities have pressed for a reduction in the minimum donation, and the chancellor's decision to set it at Pounds 400 will help to widen Gift Aid's appeal. However, charity directors were last night contrasting the sector's Pounds 50m gain in Gift Aid tax relief with its annual Pounds 250m losses in VAT. The increase in the basic VAT rate last year hit charities badly, and the voluntary sector has been lobbying the government throughout the past 12 months for remedial action. Although the sector had not expected a complete restructuring of its VAT regime this year, there had been hope that the Budget would bring greater relief. Mr Barry Gifford, chairman of the Charities Tax Reform Group, said he was disappointed' that substantial VAT reliefs had not been awarded. He warned that, by denying financial help to the voluntary sector, charities 'may be forced to reject requests from government to help in supplementing state provision'. More of this argument is likely to be heard in the election campaign.</p>

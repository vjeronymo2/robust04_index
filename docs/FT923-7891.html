			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Ceasefire offered to let foreigners leave Kabul MR Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the dissident hard-line Afghan Islamic leader, yesterday offered a one-day conditional ceasefire to allow foreigners to leave Kabul, as his fighters pounded the Afghan capital with rockets for the fourth consecutive day. The United Nations agency for refugees said yesterday that it was withdrawing its staff from the Afghan capital because of the non-stop rocket attacks. 'We just can't work there. There's another crisis every second,' said Ms Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman of the UN High Commission for Refugees. Mujahideen sources in Pakistan said at least 150 people had been killed in fighting yesterday, including 75 in a single cluster-bomb attack near the city's central post office. The Afghan news agency ANA, controlled by Mr Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami, yesterday reported that Mr Hekmatyar was willing to agree to a ceasefire on four conditions: the release of all Hezb-e-Islami prisoners in Kabul; foreigners should only be evacuated by road and not by air; an armed force should oversee the ceasefire; and that the Afghan government and militia forces should accept the ceasefire terms. The UN on Wednesday urged all sides to hold their fire to allow the evacuation of foreigners after two Russian embassy staff were killed by rockets and a third injured. The latest round of fighting is seen as the worst setback to peace hopes Afghanistan since President Najibullah's downfall in April. While government sources say Mr Hekmatyar's men have been driven out of Kabul, western diplomats say it is not clear how the balance of power has changed.</p>

"There is confirmation of Italy's production quotas for  milk,  but we are not satisfied with proposals on milk derivatives,  citrus fruit, tobacco, olive oil, beef and rice," said the  spokesman.    In an interview this morning with the Euronews TV channel,  Italy's Agriculture Minister Adriana Poli Bortone said "there is  a 50 percent chance that the issue will be brought up at the  Corfu European Council summit."    Italy has threatened to bring the issue up at the summit  should its demands not be met in the Luxembourg marathon.  Complicating today's talks, however, is a Greek demand to  triple its milk quota to 300,000 tonnes a year. The compromise  document approves Italy's request to hike its quota from nine  million tonnes to 9.9 million tonnes per year.    "We don't want to be perpetually subjected to the blackmail  of the milk quotas," Poli Bortone told her colleagues here.  "Italy has recognised the mistakes it made on the quotas, and  now it does not want to be judged for a sort of original sin,"  she said.    The minister described the situation as "unsustainable"  given  that Italy is only 60 percent self-sufficient in milk and  imports around 9 million metric tons each year.    Poli Bortone pointed out that "our requests on future prices  and measures to manage markets are all zero-cost," regarding  tobacco, rice, olive oil, beef, citrus fruits, and the famous  cheeses of the Po valley like parmigiano and grana.

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> MARCELA'S IN VAN NUYS COOKS TO THE BEAT OF THE TANGO;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: VALLEY EATING ESTABLISHMENT THAT'S QUIET BY DAY BECOMES AN  ARGENTINE HOT SPOT BY NIGHT.  </P> <P> It was a Tuesday night at Marcela's, an Argentine Italian Continental  restaurant in Van Nuys, and things were awfully quiet. The tables were all  dressed up in peach and gray linens, with accordioned napkins and fresh  flowers. The wooden dance floor was gleaming.  </P> <P> I was there with a friend and his 15-year-old son. There was also a table of  three women and one man -- their tango instructor, who periodically escorted  one of them to the dance floor. Two other men sat at a table, far from us.  </P> <P> The dining room looked as if it went on forever through white arches, but this  was an illusion. The people looking back at us in the next rooms all turned out  to be us -- as reflected in many large mirrors. We were it. A busboy brought us  some bread, hard little rounds cut from a baguette -- we didn't know if they  were toasted or dried out. The owner came over to take our order.  </P> <P> Usually, he told us, there's a professional waiter, but not tonight. We fought  flagging spirits, felt just a little out of sorts, not really sad, not really  lonely, but in touch with the peculiar out-of-the-way feeling that comes in a  restaurant that's been gussied up for a crowd that never arrives.  </P> <P> That night, the three of us had a good but not extraordinary dinner at a  reasonable price. We loved the hot, juicy chicken empanadas and agreed that my  skirt steak was the best entree. And the crepes, filled with dulce de leche, a  caramelized condensed milk-like substance, were wonderful. The cannelloni, the  scampi, the soups and salads were not remarkable.  </P> <P> "Come see us on a Friday or a Saturday night," said the owner, almost  apologetically. "We have the tango then. You should see it. People here in this  country are more serious about the tango than anybody I've ever met."  </P> <P> After 10 p.m. on a Saturday I returned to Marcela's with my friend Kate. A  major transformation had taken place within those white and mirrored walls. The  crowd had arrived. A very lively crowd. There was also a three-piece band,  "Tango Tres" and a cover charge ($5) for the entertainment. I will say right  now: That was one of the best $5 I have ever spent.  </P> <P> Tonight, I understood the reason behind all those mirrors: You could see what  was happening on the dance floor from several angles. And what was going on was  some of the most adept, alluring, fascinating tangoing I've ever seen. Couples  of all ages were out there, legs closely spaced, dragging their feet, traveling  in broad, fast parallel strides across the floor, kicking, feinting, dragging  heels slowly up calves, looking this way and that. We watched in amazement.  "Gosh," I said to Kate, "it's so controlled, and brazen, and complicated and  wanton."  </P> <P> "Yeah," she said, "and so technical, and brave, and amazing and sexy."  </P> <P> All told, we couldn't see enough of it, or come up with enough adjectives to  describe it.  </P> <P> When the dancers rested, the band and the singer kept us equally well  entertained. All four men wore suits and ties. The bass player, a young man  with a ponytail, played the stand-up bass sitting down. And the bandonion  player looked like a man who had had his heart irremediably broken and who was  now condemned to play this most heart-wrenching of instruments for the rest of  his life.  </P> <P> The singer, a well-coiffed, silken-voiced gentleman, sang intense, dramatic  songs in Spanish, songs that had some members of the audience groaning in  anguish and recognition. "Oh!" cried a woman near us. She beat her brow and  clutched at her head.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Kate and I had dinner. We started with chicken empanadas because I  couldn't resist ordering them again. Kate had a grilled trout that was stuffed  with celery and tomatoes. Juicy, delicate, perfectly cooked, it was one of the  best trouts I've ever had in a restaurant. My very garlicky garlic-marinated  chicken, however, was just OK. The accompanying vegetables were also heavily  doused in garlic -- too heavily for my taste. We ate at a leisurely pace. In  spite of all that was going on -- the dancing, the singing, the busy, social  crowd -- the service was attentive and prompt.  </P> <P> In a word, we were transported. We were as far away from our daily lives and  concerns, as distant from Van Nuys Boulevard as we might have been in a Buenos  Aires nightclub. Hours passed. We kept saying we would leave after the next  dance, after the next song. We ordered cappuccino.  </P> <P> A South American actress who had been the liveliest, the most notable tango  dancer, came up on the small stage and sang with the band. She sang jazz songs  in Spanish and English with such verve that Kate and I looked at each other and  agreed: one more song, and maybe one more after that. And then we went ahead  and ordered those good crepes.  </P> <P> They came out perfectly. The filling was soft and warm, the top coated with the  lightest, crispest film of caramelized sugar. One more tango. One more bite of  the little pancakes. The truth was, we were too happy to move.  </P> <P>  Marcela's, 14533 Gilmore St., Van Nuys. (818) 989-2581.

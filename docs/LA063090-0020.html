			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TELEVISION 'RING'  </P> <P> I watched that mess, even "Gotterdammerung," which lasted almost five hours.  </P> <P> I was waiting for the Rhine to rise and wash away Valhalla -- and those stupid  gods with it. That never happened.  </P> <P> And the ring itself -- it was supposed to give the owner power to rule the  world. But when push comes to shove, it can't even hold off Brunnhilde's  attacker. Some ring!  </P> <P> DALE RICHARDSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  Government today published regulations to speed up the official  responses when other countries make allegations of dumping  against Chinese exports.    The move comes at a time when more and more Chinese export  items are being put under anti-dumping investigation and having  anti- dumping taxes imposed on them.    A document signed by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and  economic cooperation (MOFTEC), says that when China's export  commodities are accused abroad of dumping, China's chambers of  commerce for imports and exports, or the association of  enterprises with foreign investment, will be responsible for  organizing the response to such allegations.    If entrusted by the defending party, they can retain  competent foreign lawyers, well-informed about China, to answer  the suits in the courts.    The new regulations, 24 articles long, are aimed at  protecting the lawful rights of Chinese production and  export-oriented enterprises, preserving the market for China's  export commodities, and suitably answering cases brought in  courts abroad accusing Chinese exports of dumping.    The regulations, stipulating in detail the procedures and  methods to answer such lawsuits, demand that the departments  concerned conduct better market investigations, and adopt  necessary means to avoid the occurrence of foreign anti-dumping  cases.    A MOFTEC official attributed the increase in anti-dumping  suits against Chinese commodities to the retrenchment of trade  protectionism in western countries and the discrimination  against Chinese export commodities, and to the disorder in  China's foreign trade in some areas or some enterprises.    Thus, the new regulations ask the enterprises to answer  suits  actively. Otherwise, all or part of their rights to apply for  export quotas and permits will be taken away.    In addition, part or all of their rights to conduct foreign  trade would be taken from them if circumstances of infringement  are serious, and they may also be fined.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc falls sharply in ERM THE French franc fell sharply against the D-Mark inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday amid increasing concern about the scale of the economic downturn in France, writes James Blitz. The franc has been the victim of mild selling pressure for most of this week. But many dealers were surprised yest-erday by the speed of the fall in the currency's exchange rate. After closing in London at FFr3.3832 against the German currency on Wednesday night, the franc tumbled yesterday morning, almost touching the FFr3.40 level. It finished in London at FFr3.395. Against its ERM divergence indicator, the currency was briefly seen at minus 70 percentage points. However, there were no reports of intervention by the Bank of France. A gloomy report from INSEE, the French economic information agency, was a trigger for the worsening sentiment towards the French franc. The group said that France's total GDP shrank by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year after a revised fall of 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 1992. The group also predicted that French unemployment could be as high as 12.5 per cent by the end of the year. Also a strong vehicle for the franc's decline yesterday was the continuing sell-off of French bonds. Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency strategist at UBS in London, said there had been much profit-taking by investors after French bond yields came close to their German counterparts. In his view, German short-term interest rates are low enough to encourage investor interest further along the yield curve. Mr Chertkow believes that the current pressure on the franc will dissipate because the Bundesbank will reduce interest rates by 125 basis points this year and 100 basis points next year. In his view, the French economy's fundamentally stronger position compared to Germany's will allow the Bank of France to push its interest rates well below German levels to a point where they can stimulate recovery. Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, is more pessimistic. 'This was not a one-off,' he said. 'We are at the beginning of some more pressure in the system.' The D-Mark was strong against most European currencies, partly helped by perceptions that the German recession may have bottomed out. Both the peseta and Italian lira were weaker against the D-Mark on the day. The German currency pushed sterling down at one stage, but it recovered to end  1/4 pfennig up on balance at DM2.5500. The Swedish krona has been particularly hard hit in recent days, following the news that the country's unemployment rate is at 10 per cent. This is very high by Swedish standards. The krona closed at around SKr4.65 per D-Mark yesterday, having been at SKr4.48 earlier in the week.</p>

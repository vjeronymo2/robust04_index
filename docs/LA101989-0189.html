			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> EAST CITY'S GROWTH TO BE HEARING TOPIC  </P> <P> The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing tonight on the future  development of the fast-growing east Orange area.  </P> <P> The area in question, mostly vacant hillsides now but the possible future home  of residential tracts, is bounded by Loma Ridge to the south, Irvine Park and a  residential development to the north and west, and unincorporated land to the  north and east. Irvine Lake sits in the middle of the area.  </P> <P> If the area is annexed to the city, the population of Orange would increase by  one-third.  </P> <P> City planners and the Irvine Co. have been working on the East Orange General  Plan for the last 3 1/2 years.  </P> <P> The plan calls for development over the next 20 years of 7,110 acres of Irvine  Co.-owned property. The planned community would include 12,350 housing units,  along with businesses, schools, parks and a golf course.  </P> <P> The hearing, set for 7 p.m., will be held in the community room at the main  library branch at 101 N. Center St. Another hearing will be held Oct. 30 in the  City Council chambers at City Hall.  </P> <P> After the Planning Commission hears public comment, it will make a  recommendation to the City Council, which will consider the development plan in  late November or early December, according to Vernon Jones, administrator of  the city's community development division.  </P> <P> Jones said construction will probably not begin for about two years.

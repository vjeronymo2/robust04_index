			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Safety executive to cut 230 jobs The Health and Safety Executive is cutting 230 jobs in the next two years because of a reduction in central government funding. Trade unions have linked the cuts to what they claim is a lower priority on health and safety laws. The GMB general union said: 'This confirms the government's real intention not to enforce effective health and safety laws. Between April 1986 and April 1992, 3,513 people were killed due to accidents at work. The government has the lives of future workers in their hands.' In latest public expenditure round, the HSE's funding falls from Pounds 195m in 1992-93 to Pounds 190m in 1994-95. The 1995-96 figure is Pounds 192m, Pounds 10m less than requested. Mr John Rimmington, director-general, has assured staff it should be possible to achieve the 100 job cuts this year and 130 next year through natural wastage. The GMB has been campaigning against any weakening of health and safety rules in the de-regulation bill to be published next week. A letter from Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, to Mr Frank Davies, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, suggests the government is backtracking from earlier plans after taking advice from the commission. Mr Forsyth appeared to concede that 'much of the perceived burden on employers is unnecessary in that it stems from a misunderstanding of the law'. He favoured 'clear and accessible guidance' for employers as the key to an effective health and safety system.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Fugard's 'Playland' - London Theatre Athol Fugard's Playland is the best play to arrive in London since Tony Kushner's Angels in America at the Royal National Theatre last year. The piece has a seriousness of purpose and a tautness of writing seldom seen on a European stage. It is not just that the subject matters, though of course it does: everything in the production lives up to it. Fugard, the South African playwright now in his early sixties, has a prolific output behind him. His last play at the National, My Children] My Africa] was a relative flop, partly because it was written before, but presented after, the release of Nelson Mandela. In Playland Fugard returns to being the dramatic chronicler of his times: the man who can present hope out of despair. The background is the war in what used to be called South West Africa - South Africa's Vietnam. It is new year's eve 1989: the war is over. Two characters come together outside a fairground. One is a white South African former corporal whose experience of killing has left him an emotional wreck, but also perhaps a wiser man. The other is the black nightwatchman, who has been guarding the fair for years. They talk: or rather at the start the white man talks almost to the point of monologue. He is not especially bitter. He accepts that blacks and whites will have to live together. Gradually, however, there is a role reversal: the watchman begins to talk. The ostensible subject is killing. The watchman believes the sixth commandment: 'Thou shalt not.' The white cannot get over seeing a record 27 members of SWAPO killed and buried by his unit on one day. But the black, too, has committed murder: he killed a white man for attempting to sleep with his woman. Moreover, despite his belief in the commandments, he is not sorry and would do it again. Fugard is now a master of dialogue. The facts about both characters slip out. Sometimes they revert to an atavistic past. The white claims there is nothing wrong with a white man taking a black woman against her will: 'That's how little white boys learn to do it. And you know something else: the women like it.' Sometimes the watchman simply wants the white to go away. Yet the antagonism that occasionally breaks out is not the whole theme. The underlying point is about mutual dependency, liking the same things, such as the freedom to watch the birds in the South African skies and to laugh not the 'laughter of lies'. Most impressive of all, none of this is piously done. There is no suggestion that all whites have learned the same lesson from the war. Indeed the white soldier now feels estranged from his own people. Here are simply two individuals talking. Fugard leaves no doubt, however, that they are both identifiably South Africans, and know it. The skill with which he does this is shown in the language. They have begun to share words and accents. This is almost the first time that I have found an Afrikaans accent on stage sympathetic. The acting by John Kani as the black and Sean Taylor as the white is impeccable. Fugard himself directs down to his fingertips and there should be a special prize for the lighting - note the coming of dawn - by Mannie Manim. The Donmar Warehouse, small like the Market Theatre in Johannesburg, is exactly the right place for Playland. Donmar Warehouse until April 17. (071) 867 1150</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Calculation for People" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The Tongil Street in  Pyongyang is lined with rows of superhigh apartment houses of  tower, folding screen and other styles for tens of thousands of  families and public welfare facilities along the bank of the  River Taedong. All the several-room flats of the street ensure  conditions for the living of the dwellers on the highest level.  The state has provided people gratis with these houses built at  a colossal cost. The DPRK does not count money, if it is for the  people.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said that national fund  must not be spared in providing people with a happy life,  stating: "This is my arithmetic and the calculating system of  the Workers' Party of Korea."    When the construction of factories, hospitals, recreation  facilities and other objects was projected, he acquainted  himself first of all with their usefulness for the people before  calculating its cost and, when he found them needed to the  people, he saw to it that they were built on the highest level  without delay.    It was in September 1979 when the Pyongyang maternity  hospital with a plottage of 43,000 square metres and a floor  space of over 60,000 square metres was under construction.  While acquainting himself with the progress of the project, he  learned that it was designed to cover some corridor floors with  artificial stones. He gave instructions to cover all the  corridor floors and indoor stairs with marbles, asking where  else marble should be used if not for the hospital which would  be a palace for the "kings" of the country. He earnestly said  jewels must be used for the designs, saying nothing must be  spared for the children, no matter how much it might cost. Thus,  the floor of the central entrance hall was covered with "a jewel  carpet". A total of 35 tons of natural jewels were used in this.    Under his benevolent care 20 years ago, a TV relay tower was  erected for a few families in a remote village of lumberjacks in  Chagang Province, a branch school built for two children on a  beacon islet and a railway station set up for a few school  children.    It was under the boundless care of Comrade Kim Chong-il for  the people that Pyongyang and local cities have taken on grand  looks and many monumental architectures including the Changgwang  health complex, the ice rink, the Chongnyu restaurant, the Grand  People's Study House and the Hamhung dental preventive hospital  have been built in the country.</p>

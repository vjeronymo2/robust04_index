			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Yeltsin heads for new clash with rival PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday invited parliamentary deputies to join his constitutional convention in an attempt to give it more legitimacy and head off opposition from Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. The deputies agreed to send Mr Khasbulatov, who is waging an increasingly desperate campaign to make parliament the centre of Russian political power, to the convention. But they set tough conditions for his participation, including a retraction by Mr Yeltsin of his statement that the old system of soviets (Bolshevik mini-parliaments at local level) was incompatible with democracy. The stage is now set for yet another confrontation between the two men. The rules of Russia's political jungle - which lacks a strong party structure or any sense of personal responsibility - mean individuals tend to follow whoever is stronger at any given moment. Hence the desertion of Mr Khasbulatov following Mr Yeltsin's referendum victory by some of his top lieutenants in parliament's praesidium. Leading this rebellion is Mr Nikolai Ryabov, a hardline Communist, who only recently, when the president appeared to be on the ropes, jeered at both Mr Yeltsin and his market reform plans. Mr Khasbulatov, however, shows no sign of abandoning his campaign even though his support is shrinking. His strategy centres on delaying as long as possible the convening of a Congress of People's Deputies, or full parliament, which he commands, to consider a new constitution. This will allow time for the country's economic troubles to worsen further and for Mr Yeltsin's referendum victory last month to be be forgotten. For the same reason, Mr Yeltsin wants to push through a new constitution as quickly as possible. In addition, both men are appealing to Russia's constitutent regions and republics for support. But in so doing they are only encouraging the country's disintegration by weaking the credibility of the federal institutions in Moscow. When all the constitutional complexities are set aside, the only really intractable issue is how powers should be divided between a previously bloated parliament and an over-weak executive. In an apocalyptic speech to parliament yesterday, Mr Khasbulatov warned of the dangers of bypassing the Congress in enacting a new constitution, accused the president of wanting to set up a dictatorship, and said a corrupt administration was destroying the economy. He has everything to lose from a dissolution of the Congress of People's Deputies if a new constitution is ushered in. A native of Chechnya, which has declared independence from Russia and declared him a persona non grata, Mr Khasbulatov will not even be able to stand for parliament at the next election.</p>

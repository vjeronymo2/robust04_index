			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Insurance crunch WHILE THE rest of the UK financial services industry has been subjected to painful structural change over the past decade, the life assurance sector has enjoyed a relatively trouble-free existence. Since the introduction of the 1986 Financial Services Act, the commissions it charges to policyholders have actually gone up, and the cost base of much of the industry has also risen against the wider financial services trend. There are now good grounds for thinking that the 1990s will see a profits crunch in life assurance. One pointer is the recent decision by the chancellor of the exchequer to call for a regulatory regime that demands improved disclosure of commissions, and thus a more effective form of competition. Another is the decision announced last week by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society to stop selling endowment mortgages and to sever its distribution link with Legal &amp; General. For Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, this represents a simultaneous retreat from financial conglomeration and from a commitment to a product with which the public is understandably disenchanted. A return to repayment and interest-only mortgages is only possible because the society has a sufficiently low cost base to do without commission fees from Legal &amp; General on endowment policies. For medium-sized players in the retail financial services business, the name of the game in future will be to focus on those products that will retain their appeal in an improved-disclosure environment and to do so on the basis of the lowest possible cost. The inefficient will be weeded out, though the shock will be made less severe by the fact that a large number of mutual insurers enjoy a protected form of ownership. But there will be no escape from competitive pressure in the product market itself. The more efficient practitioners will anticipate it by positioning themselves in advance.</p>

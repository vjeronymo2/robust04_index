			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "cpm": "Moderate Optimism About Economic </F> Development for 1994"]    [Text] Kassel, 9 Feb -- Helmut Hesse, president of the  Land Central Bank in Bremen, Lower Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt, is  "moderately optimistic about the economic development" in 1994,  which is based on the expectation of a perhaps increasing export  volume. Speaking to the Northern Hesse Marketing Club in  Kassel, Hesse paid tribute, however, to the intensity with which  in Germany -- as in no other European country -- the companies  and working people are successfully trying to overcome the cost  crisis. Working people are willing to accept lower wages to  preserve jobs. However, it is unclear whether this is going to  be enough to ensure traditional market shares, said Hesse, who  was a member of the expert council for assessing overall  economic development, the "Five Wise Men," from 1985 to 1988.    According to Hesse, private consumption, which contributes  57  percent to the overall national product, will decline by 0.9 to  1.5 percent this year compared with 1993. One cannot expect any  stimuli for demand from the state, either. State consumption  will change by minus to plus 1 percent compared with last year.  Because of low interest rates and high rents only building  investments will increase by 1 to 2 percent.    In the economist's view, the international economic  development has jump-started again. Even though the world trade  volume will increase by up to 5.5 percent, Germany will benefit  from that only at a below-average rate, because in Europe, the  main buyer of German exports, the economy will grow by only 1.5  percent. In addition, Germany primarily exports equipment,  which is not yet so much in demand.    For the coming years Hesse predicted rising and  consolidating  unemployment. This year the number of unemployed will grow by  about 0.5 million. If the forecasts of the Ifo Institute, which  predicts an economic growth of 1.8 percent over the next three  to five years in West Europe, become reality, "we will not have  any increase in employment worth mentioning over the next  years," because the number of employed increases only above a  growth of about 1.7 percent.    Even though this may be politically difficult to implement,  there is no way of avoiding major regional and sectoral wage  differentiations. The wages in the lower wage groups were  raised so much in the past that the respective jobs are no  longer competitive. In addition, stimuli must be given for  returning to employment, even if the new jobs offer worse  conditions than the old ones that have been lost.</p>

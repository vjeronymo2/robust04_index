			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Top Dutch general resigns A top Dutch general resigned yesterday in protest at defence spending cuts planned by the parties forming the country's next government, the defence ministry said. The Dutch chief-of-staff, Gen Arie van der Vlis, 53, quit over plans to cut almost Fl 1bn (Pounds 366.6m) from the defence budget over the next four years, which have been outlined by a tripartite left-right coalition of Labour, Liberals and reformist D66. A new cabinet is expected to be named by Labour leader Wim Kok later this week.</p>

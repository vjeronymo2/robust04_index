			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 22  March.    Francia de Sierra, director general of the Mineral Resources  Directorate at the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, revealed  the mining industry has invested $24 million this year, whereas  in 1993 the investment was $5 million. Sierra added that  production at the Santa Rosa mine, Canazas jurisdiction,  Veraguas Province, will begin in June; this is expected to  increase investments. Referring to the mining industry's  future, she said a geologic study and an infrastructure  inventory will be carried out in April. The study will cost  between $10 million and $15 million and the cost of its  feasibility study -- $450,000 -- will be paid with a donation  from the Inter-American Development Bank. (Panama City LA PRENSA  in Spanish 9 Mar 94 p 11A)    ``Delia de De Castro, director general of domestic trade,''  reported 556 licenses with an invested capital of $1,674,500  were issued in January. She added that this represents $20,401  in taxes. She said this is a 15 percent increase compared with  January 1993, when the Ministry issued 480 permits for an  invested capital of $1,909,650. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA  in Spanish 15 Mar 94 p 11A)    The Panamanian Government has approved Executive Decree No.  19 to confirm a 23 cent discount in the tariff for each box of  bananas exported in 1994. The report adds that 38,255,291 boxes  of bananas were exported in 1993, thus allowing the discount  anticipated in Article 1 of Law 16, dated 18 June 1993. (Panama  City LA PRENSA in Spanish 20 Mar 94 p 2)    Ricardo Duran, president of the Panamanian Chamber of  Commerce, Industries, and Agriculture, has stated that growth  levels will continue to rise although the country is engaged in  an electoral process.

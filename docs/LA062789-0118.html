			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH TUSTIN;  </P> <P> ARRAIGNMENT IN INFANT'S DROWNING IS DELAYED  </P> <P> The arraignment of two North Tustin women charged with failing to obtain a  day-care license after a pool accident left a toddler dead was delayed Monday  while the defendants sought to have the case against them dismissed.  </P> <P> Misdemeanor charges were lodged last month against Carol Brooks and her mother,  Diane Brooks, for the alleged violation of the state's health and safety code.  The complaint followed a March 30 accident at their home day-care center in  which 14-month-old Arthur M. Griese died and two other children were seriously  injured when they toppled into the pool. The Brookses were not licensed as  day-care providers.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Deborah Barnum said that before a new July 17  arraignment date, she plans to argue in a court motion that the drowning should  be best dealt with in civil litigation, rather than under criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> The Brookses' failure to obtain a day-care license "is not a crime in  California," Barnum said in an interview. "To take a bad situation, a tragic  accident, and make it into a crime is very sad."  </P> <P> The two women appeared in Municipal Court in Santa Ana for the scheduled  arraignment but declined to speak with reporters.  </P></p>

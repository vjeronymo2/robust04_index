			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Budapest picks advisers for gas privatisation Creditanstalt Securities of Austria and Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, have won a mandate to advise the City of Budapest on the privatisation of its gas supply company, the largest in Hungary. The decision is a blow for NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, which is advising the Hungarian government on the sale of the country's five regional gas supply companies and had also hoped to advise the City of Budapest. The decision to appoint advisers comes after last week's announcement of government plans to privatise most of its energy industry, including 100 per cent, less one golden share, of the regional gas supply companies, over the next three years. The City of Budapest, however, has yet to decide whether it will sell off a majority stake in its gas company, which serves the capital's more than 2m inhabitants. According to Mr Gabor Demszky, the mayor, the privatisation of the company will run in parallel with the sale of the state supply companies but the city will decide on how much to sell off after next week's local elections. International tenders offering majority stakes in the regional companies to strategic investors are due in the spring and have attracted strong interest from most of Europe's large gas companies. Budapest Gas Works had fixed assets of Ft31bn (Dollars 281m) and revenues of Ft26bn (Dollars 236m) in 1993. It supplied 2.5bn cubic metres of gas to more than 700,000 industrial and domestic consumers. The market price of the company, however, will depend on how much the government allows gas prices, which are presently below world levels, to rise. The government, which still controls energy prices, is due to announce a decision this week.</p>

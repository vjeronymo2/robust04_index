			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Car chiefs try to defuse opposition to merger RENAULT and Volvo said yesterday they would launch a concerted campaign to defuse mounting shareholder opposition to their proposed merger after the Swedish group was forced to postpone a vote to approve the deal. Renault expressed confidence that the merger would go ahead on schedule and said that Volvo's decision to postpone the vote from next week to December 7 would allow it to calm what it described as exaggerated concerns. 'Volvo has given itself time to show investors that the agreement is indispensable for both companies', Renault said. But Swedish investors continued to press for a clearer timetable for privatisation and increased information concerning the golden share which the French government plans to hold after the group is privatised. The strength of opposition could increase pressure on the French government to make concessions to Volvo shareholders to win approval for the deal. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, telephoned Mr Per Wersterberg, his Swedish counterpart, to emphasise his government's commitment to privatising the merged group as quickly as possible. He also said that the golden share would be used to protect the combined group from predators and not to ensure French control. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman, said his company remained fully committed to the plan to merge the two groups' car and truck operations. He said Volvo would examine all questions raised by critics of the merger. 'We take the criticism seriously and will try to deal with it in the best way.' Volvo officials said the company would consult further with its key institutional shareholders on their objections to the merger deal before deciding what demands it might make on Renault and the French government to help win over shareholder support. A spokesman said Volvo was not demanding renegotiation of the merger agreement but would keep open the possibility of making some changes. French industry ministry officials said there was no need to change the terms of the agreement. They blamed the opposition from Swedish shareholders on a lack of information and said that clarification of the disputed points should ease their concerns. The merger, regarded by the French government as a necessary precursor to privatisation, is one of the most important projects in the French industrial policy. The stakes are also high for Mr Gyllenhammar. He came under increased personal criticism for having mishandled the Renault deal, a charge he denied. But critics said that if the merger failed it would be the latest in a line of failed strategic initiatives in his two decades in charge at Volvo, and that he would not survive.

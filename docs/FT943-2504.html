			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Europe in the Pacific century: The west must show greater sensitivity in its dealings with east Asia Vancouver seems an ideal place to await the Pacific era in a spirit of optimism: a city of breathtaking ocean views and burgeoning Asian communities, where Chinese calligraphers play hockey and speak with purring Canadian accents. While the city may be forging an Asian-North American future with Confucian serenity, the scholars and policymakers who gathered there a week ago for a conference of the International Institute of Strategic Studies were not. Amid well-rehearsed observations on the rising economic importance of trans-Pacific links, the conference heard some rather more disturbing ideas. In their most extreme form, they spelt out a 21st century vision of Europe relegated to an exhausted backwater and America forced to seek partners on Asian terms. The economic case for the Pacific century is impressive. Last year, trans-Pacific trade amounted to Dollars 330bn, exceeding trade across the Atlantic by 50 per cent; in five years, the ratio could be 2 to 1 in the larger ocean's favour. The number of hours devoted by the American administration to political and, above all, commercial ties with Asian partners is correspondingly on the rise. But, as North Americans at the IISS either acknowledged themselves - or were told bluntly by their Asian counterparts - it looks increasingly likely that the Asians will be setting the pace for the new intercontinental love affair. Washington's recent decision to decouple trade with China from human rights was hailed as an overdue conversion to the Asian principle of non-interference. Similarly, America's swing from lofty interventionism to pure mercantilism in ties with east Asia was seen as a sign of 'open-mindedness' and 'flexibility' - a welcome reminder of America's freedom from the arrogance of Europe's former colonial powers, said one senior south-east Asian official. Europe, by contrast, was in bad odour all round. Chided as usual for its colonial past, protectionism and old-world snobbishness, the old continent faced a newer charge: it was hostile to Moslems. As the conference was reminded, the mainly Moslem nations of Malaysia and Indonesia are highly sensitive to Europe's attitudes to Islam. 'There is a perception in south-east Asia that Europe is hostile towards Islam,' said a Singapore-based analyst of the region. 'There has been little effort to put to rest Moslems' concerns that they are viewed as a threat to Christian civilisation.' Western Europe was attacked for its faint-heartedness over Bosnia, its reluctance to admit Turkey to the European Union, and connivance in the suppression of Islamic forces in Algeria. How can Europeans respond to this bewildering array of charges? They are not merely economic losers, swaggering imperialists with outsize egos and shrinking wallets, they are anti-Moslem to boot. Wherever the answer lies, it does not lie in trying to please everyone. Europe will not convert the fundamentalists of Algeria into partners and soul-mates by embracing them unconditionally; nor can it be sure of gaining merit in the eyes of south-east Asian, or other Moslems, by greater involvement in Bosnia. It is easy to imagine a scenario in which scores of British or French troops die in an unequal struggle to defend Bosnia's Moslem enclaves - and western embassies, from Ankara to Jakarta, are still surrounded by demonstrators denouncing the treachery of Christendom. But there are surely some lessons for Europeans to draw from the brick-bats flying in Vancouver's bracing sea breeze. Europeans must be more sensitive, in dealings with east Asia, to anti-colonial sentiment that is nearer the surface than most Britons, French or Dutchmen guess. Forgetting is easier for the coloniser than the colonised. Europeans also need to be absolutely clear, with themselves and others, about the limits of their influence: their ability to right wrongs and tilt regional balances. One of the most palpable legacies of colonialism in Europe is the instinctive tendency of many people to regard all the problems of the world, from Santiago to Cape Town to Sarajevo, as well within their own capacity to solve. Ironically, this imperialist mentality has a strong grip on the political left - both in Europe and the US. Whenever western Europe exaggerates its influence over the internal or external policies of third countries, it risks losing out both ways: lacking real influence but still seen as a handy scapegoat. That does not mean that either Europe or America should make a headlong rush from interventionism to pure commercialism. There are still important 'policing' tasks for the west, in Asia as elsewhere - particularly in arms proliferation. But in future, they will have to be carried out in partnership with the rising nations of the east, and with due regard to their sensitivities.</p>

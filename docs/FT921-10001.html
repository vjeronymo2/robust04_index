			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: News in Brief Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has trimmed the rate on its London postal share account from 11.15 per cent gross to 10.4 per cent. Other accounts have also seen rate cuts of 0.75 per cent, including the flexi-Tessa which now pays 11.25 per cent. Net annual rates on three Leeds Permanent savings accounts will be reduced by 0.38 and 0.45 per cent from Monday. Liquid Gold, the instant access account, pays 6.94 per cent net or 9.25 per cent gross on balances over Pounds 10,000. Full details of the new rates will be available in Leeds Permanent's branches from Monday. ***** In the wake of the recent fall in mortgage interest rates, lenders have offered a plethora of fixed rate mortgages. Most are still over 10 per cent. One exception is Nationwide building society which has a three year fixed rate at 9.95 per cent (11.8 per cent APR), but this is tied to the sale of a buildings and contents policy through the society and customers must also take out mortgage protection insurance through Nationwide. Norwich and Peterborough has launched two new fixed rate mortgages. Customers can chose between 10.25 per cent (APR 11.70 per cent) fixed for two years or 10.40 per cent (APR 11.70 per cent) for three years. There is a Pounds 50 non-refundable application fee and a further Pounds 145 payable on completion. The mortgages are portable. The Mortgage Corporation has a 10.55 per cent two year fixed rate mortgage with a guarantee that it will not rise above 12.99 per cent in the third year. Capital Home Loans, the French mortgage lender, has a 10.75 per cent (APR 11.0 per cent) fix for five years, subject to a Pounds 295 fee. Birmingham Midshires's two year fixed rate offer is 10.65 per cent (APR 12.1 per cent) till January 1994, but it is not available for repayment mortgages and on remortgages, it cannot be used for capital raising. The fee is Pounds 150. Almost all fixed mortgages carry some early redemption penalties - usually varying between three and six month's interest. But some lenders make their mortgages portable, meaning that it can be transferred to another property. ***** Balliol College, Oxford, might not seem the most needy of institutions, but BES tax relief is available on investments into it. This was one of the most interesting BES offers to be launched this week: Airways V will continue to buy accommodation to be let primarily to British Airways employees; Blue Horizon Developments is raising Pounds 750,000 for a film adaptation of Julian Barnes' novel Metroland - more speculative, but more fun; Celtic Tankers will buy and operate oil and product tankers - shipping companies, like assured tenancies, have an upper investment limit of Pounds 5m. First Residential Properties, a 'predator'-type company, will buy property in Greater London, Hunter, from Property Enterprise Managers, is also a 'predator'-type scheme, buying housing in the south east, Oxbridge Colleges Cash Backed High Growth, sponsored by Johnson Fry, offers the opportunity to invest in Balliol, Magdalen, Wolfson and New Colleges, Oxford and Girton College, Cambridge. There is a buy-back guarantee of 125p after five years for every Pounds 1.00 spent now.</p>

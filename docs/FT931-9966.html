			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium flood rings alarm bells in CIS - As exports have soared shortages have appeared at home MR KARL WOBBE admits he seriously underestimated the ability of the Russian aluminium industry to keep production going against all the odds. 'At the begining of 1992 I thought their industry would collapse because of raw materials shortages,' he recalls. Instead, the smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States are estimated to have produced about 3.1m tonnes of the metal last year, close to the industry's capacity of between 3.5m and 3.6m tonnes. Much of that aluminium poured into western Europe, the nearest big consuming market, where it was paid for in currencies much more stable and desirable than the rouble. That produced shortages in the CIS itself, even though the chaotic conditions there cut demand for aluminium substantially. For example, fish canning industries in Russia and the Ukraine were particularly vocal about aluminium shortages - among other things, the metal is used for canning caviar. So both the European industry and the CIS authorities have good cause for concern about the continuing high level of aluminium exports. Mr Wobbe, management board director responsible for aluminium production at VAW of Germany, says that during a recent visit to the CIS: 'We got the feeling that the Russian aluminium industry wants to contact the European industry to find ways of improving the situation. They understand that most (west European) smelters are not making money. I feel they are now more willing to take part in discussions'. The question remains, however, who will do the talking for the CIS industry? There is a great struggle going on about who should have control of the industry and take important decisions on its behalf. Much of CIS aluminium production has been controlled for the past two years by Concernalumini but that organisation now has a tarnished image, having failed to provide the hoped-for investment for modernisation. Now the power seems to be switching to a new Russian state organisation: the Committee for Metallurgy. This body has its own Committee for Aluminium with Mr Gregory Maslov at its head. Mr Maslov therefore seems likely to emerge as the most powerful individual in the CIS aluminium industry. However, the recent turmoil has given individual smelter managers much more power - simply because they have the metal and the money it produces. And smelter managers are already at odds with the new state organisation about the terms for privatising the aluminium industry. They want 51 per cent of the shares in each smelter to be distributed to employees, 25 per cent to the local authority and 24 per cent to the state body. Mr Maslov and his committee want 51 per cent, leaving 25 per cent for local authorities and only 24 per cent for employees. The Russian parliament will decide this contentious issue in April. Meanwhile, Russia has signalled that it wishes to cut aluminium exports by raising tariffs steeply this year. Compared with tariffs of Ecu50 (Pounds 41) a tonne in place at the end of 1992, the tariff for exports of primary aluminium has been lifted to Ecu130 a tonne and that for metal used in barter deals is up to Ecu205. To close a loophole that has allowed large quantities of metal - not just aluminium - to be exported under the guise of 'scrap', the tariff on aluminium scrap has been bumped up to Ecu460 a tonne. More aluminium is being shipped out to the US and Asia instead of Europe but, even though US import duties have been removed and the metal attracts a 6 per cent duty when entering the European Community area, the Russians say it is still cheaper to deliver to Europe and the London Metal Exchange. In spite of the Russian efforts, European aluminium producers seem to have lost patience and are urging the European Commission to take action soon. Mr Dick Dermer, president of the European Aluminium Association, says that the market is being seriously distorted by CIS exports, which are 'endangering the viability of the European aluminium industry. 'The European Community primary aluminium industry has for the past two years been operating at a loss as a direct result of the distortion in the aluminium market created by the dramatic and unexpected increase in exports from the CIS since 1990,' he suggests. His association started monitoring imports at the begining of 1992 and estimates that 600,000 tonnes of CIS aluminium reached the EC last year, up from 450,000 tonnes in 1991 and an average of about 82,000 tonnes a year before 1990. The European producers say CIS imports have depressed aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange - the most widely-used guide to world prices - and forced the European industry to make expensive production cuts. Europe accounts for about 25 per cent of world aluminium supply but is making a disproportionately large sacrifice as the industry cuts back because of low prices - 80 per cent of the 1.1m tonnes of world capacity that has been shut down is in Europe. Mr Dermer says 'the industry has no other option than to demand that the European Commission installs a transitional period of safeguard measures with regard to aluminium from the CIS'. He will give no details but other European executives say the industry wants the commission to limit CIS imports to 82,000 tonnes a year, the 'normal' level before the surge in 1990, and it wants those quotas to include secondary (scrap) metal. Once that protection is in place, the EC authorities should jointly discuss how CIS producers could be helped 'to adjust their sales and pricing policy to the market economy rules and mechanisms,' says Mr Dermer The EC should help the CIS to stimulate a revival of its domestic aluminium consumption, to rationalise and modernise existing facilities and to develop a workable legal system. 'The community's primary aluminium industry is willing to assist in that process,' he adds. However, these proposals do not go unchallenged. Mr Tony Bird of the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy group, suggests that, not only would a quota system probably be illegal (Russia cannot be accused of dumping because its production costs are the lowest in the world and it is not selling aluminium at a higher price in its domestic market than in the west) neither would it work. Mr Bird says: 'Aluminium is a commodity. Russian aluminium is almost the same as anybody else's aluminium. The market for aluminium does not work in the same way as the market for cars or photocopiers. If it is displaced from one market, it can flow easily into another. So, if CIS metal is not allowed to enter the EC, it can instead be sold in a third country, which will then ship its own metal to the EC to compensate.' VAW's Mr Wobbe says CIS producers are keen to modernise their smelters but they want to pay back loans with the aluminium produced and banks are very reluctant to provide any cash while aluminium prices are as low as they are today. VAW is working on a feasibility study for the modernisation of the Novokuznetsk smelter in Siberia. A new facility would be built alongside the existing smelter, which would be closed only once the new one was ready. This would boost output from 180,000 to 250,000 tonnes. The Russians want VAW to consider similar schemes at other smelters. Mr Wobbe says the Novokuznetsk feasibility study (which the Russians are paying for) will be completed in May. 'The problem then is to finance the project. The smelter is looking for a financial partner. I believe we can find the finance, but at present aluminium prices of Dollars 1,200 to Dollars 1,250 a tonne the profit would not be high. A higher aluminium price would certainly help. 'The (Russian metallurgy) committee understands the effect exports are having on prices and that's why it wants to strengthen its grip on aluminium  -and all other raw material industries.'</p>

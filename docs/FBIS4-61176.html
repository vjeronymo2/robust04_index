			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy]    [Text] Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma stands the best  chance in the presidential race.    According to the Socis-Gallup service, 18 percent of the  electorate were prepared to vote for him in March, a significant  increase on the 16.6 percent in December 1993.    A poll in all parts of Ukraine in which 1200 people older  than 15 were questioned showed that Vyacheslav Chornovil (9.1  percent in March and 10 percent in March) and President Leonid  Kravchuk (16.5 and 11 percent, respectively) were also fairly  popular figures.    At its latest congress the Popular Rukh decided not to field  its own presidential candidate.    Kravchuk agreed to register as a possible candidate. Nikolay  Mikhalchenko, his domestic policy aide, told Interfax that  Kravchuk had thus shown that he was not afraid of elections.    On the other hand, Mikhalchenko said that Kravchuk would ask  the new parliament to postpone the elections which are scheduled  for June 26.    As reported earlier, 120 members of the new parliament are  prepared to back this proposal.    Kuchma thought that a postponement would be useful for  implementing a specific economic reform program but he rejected  Kravchuk's argument that the postponement was needed to change  the power structure and to have the duties of the new president  specified in the Constitution.    Numerous parties and trade unions agree with Kravchuk that a  new constitution had to be adopted before the elections. This  view is shared, in particular, by the "greens" who called on  Kravchuk to put off the presidential and local elections until  the end of the year. They say that the presidential race must be  resumed following the adoption of a Constitution by a  Constitutional Assembly.    Levko Lukyanenko, leader of the Ukraine democratic league,  told Interfax that the presidential elections had to be  postponed until the end of 1994 or early 1995. He thought that  presidential elections had not to be held before a Constitution  was adopted which would define whether Ukraine would be a  presidential or a parliamentary republic or a cross between them  or before the power of the president were defined or legislation  on local administration was in place.    Donetsk coalfield trade unions are prepared to negotiate a  postponement of the elections with Kravchuk, Igor Dyatlov, who  chairs the inter-regional league of strike committees, told  Interfax.    Meanwhile, Mikhail Volynets, chairman of the Inter-Regional  Union of the Independent Miners' Union, told Interfax-Ukraine  that the miners were kept in the dark about the presidential  race and showed no interest in it. In his view, of all the  presidential nominees Kravchuk alone could run the country. He  thought that Kuchma was responsible for the falling living  standards of the miners.</p>

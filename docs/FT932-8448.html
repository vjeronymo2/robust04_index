			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Patten eases governors' quandary MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday gave school governors a chance to avoid damaging confrontations with teachers and head teachers over national curriculum tests. Governors in England and Wales have a legal duty to implement the tests, in spite of three teachers' unions boycotting them. Mr Patten has not heeded calls by the National Association of Governors and Managers for the tests to be made voluntary, but in a letter to governors yesterday he said they were not expected to implement the tests if their teachers refused to administer them. He said governors will have performed their legal duties if they 'give a clear lead that the professional course is to administer the tests', and 'satisfy themselves that teachers have been reminded of their duty to administer the tests'. Where boycotts do take place, governors are expected to 'consider carefully' whether the tests can still be administered 'given the circumstances of the school'. Finally, if any tests do take place, heads and governors are asked to send the results to the department. The Department for Education ruled out any attempt to impose sanctions on governors, and said: 'We hope that as many people as possible will do the tests. How governors, head teachers and local education authorities go about doing it is a matter for them.' Head teachers made it clear that the tests would not take place. Mr John Sutton, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: 'The simple fact is that our responsibility has been frustrated by the boycott of the three unions.' Secondary school head teachers in Hertfordshire yesterday told Mr Patten it would be impossible to conduct tests for 14-year-olds this summer.</p>

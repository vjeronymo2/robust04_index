			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Surge of late buying restores Dow Wall Street ANOTHER big rise in bond yields initially pushed US share prices lower yesterday, but a surge of late buying related to the expiration of stock options and futures contracts helped blue-chip stocks end the day on an upbeat note, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 8.67 at 3,694.01, more than 30 points above its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.02 lower at 462.60, while the Amex composite finished down 1.56 at 467.98, and the Nasdaq composite off 2.78 at 751.56. Trading volume on the NYSE was 300m shares. US stock markets ended a difficult week in mixed form. Although fear that the House of Representatives would reject Nafta gave way to relief at its comfortable passage on Wednesday night, the steady rise in long-term interest rates meant that any celebration was short-lived. Once again bond prices were in retreat. This time it was a combination of economic news - rising imports and exports in September widened the monthly trade deficit to Dollars 10.9bn - and heavy selling of Treasury-bond futures that undermined bonds. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 1/4 points, and the yield was up to 6.33 per cent, the highest level since mid-August. The rise in bond yields upset stocks, which posted steady declines throughout the morning. At one stage the Dow was down almost 30 points. Prices gradually recovered, however, and thanks to heavy late buying related to the expiration of stock and stock index futures and options, the leading average finished in positive territory. Several leading Dow constituents posted declines, although most recovered some of their losses late in the day. United Technologies fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 7/8 , Caterpillar dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 85, and IBM gave up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 51 7/8 . Bank stocks were under pressure because of rising long-term interest rates. Citicorp eased Dollars 1 to Dollars 34, JP Morgan gave up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 69 1/2 , Chemical fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 7/8 and Wells Fargo slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 115 1/8 . Chevron, which fell sharply on Thursday on the news that Pennzoil had sold almost half its stake in the company, rebounded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 89 7/8 . General Mills fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 after the broking house, Dean Witter Reynolds, cut its earnings estimate, citing the intense competitive environment in the food business. In spite of the markets' weakness, retailer Talbots made a successful debut. Floated at Dollars 19.50 a share, the stock ended at Dollars 22 5/8 in volume of 6.8m shares. On the Nasdaq market, Ornda Healthcorp fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 after the company said it would merge with American Healthcare Management in a deal valued at Dollars 400m. Canada TORONTO share prices posted a small gain in moderate trading. The composite index was up 3.43 points, or 0.08%, to close at 4238.17, a loss on the week of about 65 points.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] If the Russian farming sector does not have nearly  nine trillion rubles credits, much of the next harvest would be  lost, Aleksandr Nazarchuk, State Duma Agricultural Committee  chairman, told Interfax Sunday.    The credits, he said, must be granted on easy terms rather  than at the unbearable discount rate of 210 percent. He  complained that the agricultural sector was neglected as far as  financing was concerned.    The updated draft budget that was supported by the Agrarian  Party in the Duma would appropriate over 10.8 trillion rubles,  of which over four trillion as support of most important  industries, for agricultural needs. As of mid-June, however, as  little as 9.26 and 1.94 pct of these amounts, respectively, have  been made available, Nazarchuk said.    He added that the Finance Ministry had promised to make as  much money available to the farming sector as the budget had  appropriated.    Even if it does, however, the Agrarian Party cannot rule out  the possibility of protest actions undertaken by the Russian  peasants. The national convention of peasants may have a  significant role to play in such actions. The date of the  convention will be set by the Agricultural Workers Collective  Action Council which will meet on June 24.</p>

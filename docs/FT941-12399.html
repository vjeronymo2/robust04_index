			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / UK air engine power record challenges US The multi-million dollar race to build the most powerful commercial jet engine was intensified this weekend by the announcement that Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer, has set a world record by running its Trent 800 engine at 106,000 lbs of thrust. By topping the record of 105,400 lbs, set last year by General Electric of the US with its new GE 90 engine, the UK company has challenged its bigger US rival in the fierce competition to develop very large engines to power the new generation of twin-engine wide-body airliners. GE, which said its new engine had been designed to reach eventual thrusts of as much as 115,000 lbs, is likely to respond by running its new engine above Rolls-Royce's latest level. There is at present no market demand for engines of 100,000 lbs thrust or more but GE and Rolls-Royce appear anxious to show airline customers that their new large commercial engine programmes can meet potential demand for bigger and heavier derivatives of the new Boeing 777 twin-engine wide-body airliner and super jumbo 600-800-seat aircraft now under study. Pratt and Whitney, the other big US aero-engine maker, is working on a more powerful derivative of its PW4000 engine to equip this new generation of big airliners, but it has yet to run its engine at above 100,000 lbs of thrust. The stakes are high because of the huge cost of developing these engines. GE  -with its French, Japanese and Italian risk-sharing partners - is spending Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 2bn (Pounds 800m-Pounds 1.3bn) on the GE 90 programme. Rolls-Royce is investing about Pounds 400m to develop its Trent engines, derived from its RB211 engine. The competition is all the more fierce because there is in prospect only one market application for these new engines - the Boeing 777, due to be rolled out for the first time in April. All three manufacturers are also in combat over a Dollars 400m engine order from Japan Airlines (JAL), which is expected to choose next month the engine for the 777s it has ordered. JAL has placed firm orders for ten 777s and options for ten more. The JAL deal would boost the winning maker because large orders continue to be rare in the depressed commercial aircraft market even while makers are having to invest heavily in developing new engines. However, they expect demand for bigger engines to grow in the longer term. GE estimates a potential market of up to 2,000 wide-bodied aircraft between now and 2012. Boeing has indicated it requires at this stage thrust ratings of no more than 76,000 lbs and 84,000 lbs for the first two versions of its 312-400 seater 777s, but the engine makers are anticipating demand for heavier versions of the aircraft as well as development of other new large aircraft. 'Aircraft always get heavier, and the heavier versions have traditionally sold best,' said Mr Russ Sparks, GE 90 programme manager. Rolls-Royce announced this month its intention to certify its Trent 800 engine for the Boeing 777 at 90,000 lbs thrust, instead of the originally planned 84,000 lbs, to demonstrate the growth potential of the engine. GE said it could offer customers 92,000 lbs of thrust very quickly with the first engine it is to certify at 84,000 lbs thrust in November. While flexing their technological muscle, the engine makers are also in a race to cut costs. In the absence of an immediate market recovery and amid fierce competition, Mr Brian Rowe, chairman of GE's aircraft engine division, said the priority remained to drive down costs. GE, which has set the pace in industry restructuring, expects to drop another 2,000 people from its aircraft engine business this year. This will bring its world-wide aircraft engine workforce down to 22,000 by the end of the year, from 26,000 at the end of last year and 40,000 in 1986. Rolls-Royce is also shedding jobs. It announced last year it was dropping 6,000 jobs between 1993 and 1994, to bring down its aero-engine workforce to about 24,000 by the end of this year.</p>

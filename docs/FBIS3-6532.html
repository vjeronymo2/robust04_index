Japan will send the monitors in response to a request by the  South African Government, recognizing the historical importance  of the April 26-28 election for the international community,  spokesman Terusuke Terada said.    The election observers to be dispatched by the Japanese  Government will be joined by 10 U.N. volunteers and several  people from the private sector, he said.    A special assistant of the permanent mission of Japan to the  United Nations will also be dispatched as a liaison officer to  the U.N. Observer Mission to South Africa (UNOMSA), he said.    Japan has so far extended a total of about 34.8 million yen  in aid to nongovernmental organizations working in South Africa  to help voter education and provide vehicles for election  observation, he said.    In a related move, a private Japanese aid organization, the  Japan International Volunteer Center, also plans to carry out a  project in connection with the U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) to offer vocational training to assist the  resettlement of returnees to South Africa, he said.    The project is aimed at giving training in woodworking,  welding, plumbing and computer operation, he said.</p>

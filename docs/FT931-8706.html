			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Harsh realities for Labour - Political Notebook THE RANK and file of the Conservative party were described by Mr John Smith this week as unsettled, uncertain and potentially rebellious. Fresh from his latest man-oeuvring over Maastricht, it is a judgment with which Mr John Major would find it hard to disagree. Mr Smith's problem is that the prime minister could apply the same description to MPs on the Labour benches. The Tories have emerged battered and bewildered from the horrors of the past few months. Their opponents appear equally unsettled by their failure to reap the political rewards. For what they are worth, the opinion polls confirm that popular disenchantment with the government has yet to translate into solid enthusiasm for the official opposition. Ten months in to the new parliament many Labour MPs - particularly among the newcomers - are beginning to learn that the fun of political point-scoring provides a strictly temporary diversion from the harsher realities of opposition. The party's so-called modernisers and their traditionalist enemies have abandoned for now the synthetic dispute over what should be learnt from Mr Bill Clinton's election victory. Mr Clinton's decision to renege on his pre-election tax pledges should dim the adolescent enthusiasm of those who imagined the Democrats had rediscovered the holy grail of centre-left politics. The group reviewing Labour's links with the unions has come up with a classic fudge worthy of the infamous smoke-filled rooms in which policy was made in the 1960s. Its list of options should pave the way for one-member-one-vote elections for party leader and for parliamentary candidates. But the unions will retain a powerful and visible presence at annual conference. Neither development has lifted the party's MPs. Between the advocates of radical change and the defenders of a romanticised past is a broad swathe who have lost past certainties but found nothing to replace them. Mr Smith has yet to fill the vacuum. The party lacks any sense of excitement. The inevitable tensions between opportunism and the more arduous task of framing credible alternative policies re-emerged during yesterday's debate in the PLP on Maastricht. Mr Smith was decisive. Yet the episode reinforced the demands of those who want his leadership to be consistently stronger. The modernisers - represented notably by Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown but joined recently by Mr Jack Straw - believe that Mr Smith took a step in that direction in his Bournemouth speech earlier this month. The speech, dismissing the theological disputes over ownership which have dogged Labour since Mr Hugh Gaitskell's abortive attempt more than 30 years ago to abolish Clause 4 of the constitution, was over-hyped. But its importance was that, after months of wavering, Mr Smith put himself on the side of those who believe that Labour must change before it can win. On one level he provided a framework for the party to replace reflex interventionism with the concept of a state which supports rather than frustrates personal ambition. Mr Blair has been adamant that Labour can move nowhere until it projects with clarity an ideology in which the community is seen as a buttress to individual aspiration. More practically, commitments on taxation, public spending, nationalisation can now be rewritten or dropped. Mr Brown moved further along that road yesterday with his disavowal of tax increases for the middle classes. Mr Smith though is more cautious than his lieutenants; and his caution is obscuring the process of change. He is resiting calls for the decisive break with the unions sought by Mr Blair. His aides say they cannot risk offending the paymasters. Nor will he seek to abolish Clause 4, arguing that its importance is symbolic. But symbolism may be more powerful than Mr Smith is prepared to admit. The changes being wrought by Messrs Blair and Brown are important. But a sceptical electorate is unlikely to be convinced by statements of philosophical intent. It may continue to judge Labour on the television images of trades unions casting millions of votes at party conference.</p>

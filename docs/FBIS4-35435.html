			<p>BFN     [Text] Environmental Affairs Minister Yosi Sarid says all  Palestinian autonomy offices must be in Jericho or the Gaza  Strip. He also said that any PLO presence in Jerusalem must be  authorized by Israel. David Ze'ev reports from the Knesset:    [Begin Ze'ev recording] Cabinet Minister Yosi Sarid  presented the following statement in the name of the government  before the Knesset plenum: One, that institutions of the  Palestinian self-rule authority will be in the Gaza Strip or the  Jericho area, and only there. Two, any organizational activity  that is diplomatic or resembles diplomatic activity that relates  to Palestinian rule or resembles it in Jerusalem will require  the endorsement of Israeli authorities, and each case will be  examined by Israel based on the accord with the PLO. And three,  there is only one police force in Jerusalem -- Israeli, not  Palestinian, and security and public order in Jerusalem is the  responsibility of the Israeli police force, no other. That  would be forbidden and will not be permitted, in Sarid's words.  Minister Sarid said he has spoken out against the statements of  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the past and is repeating that  'Arafat will have to renew his commitment to the accord in  words; more importantly, in actions. But, said Sarid, the  situation on the ground is a positive surprise. The  Palestinians, he says, are doing their job under the toughest  conditions. [end recording].    Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert says he will do everything in  his  power to close Orient House. He was speaking in London at a  gathering sponsored by the JEWISH QUARTERLY JOURNAL. Jerry  Lewis has details:    [Begin recording] [Lewis] Ehud Olmert said that Orient  House was the headquarters of what originally was the Society  for Arab Studies, sponsored by Faysal al-Husayni. However,  lately it turned out to be the headquarters of what he says  Faysal al-Husayni thought was the future government of the  Palestinian state in Jerusalem.    [Olmert] My personal position and my official position as  mayor of Jerusalem is that Orient House ought to be closed, and  I will do everything I can in my power to close it. The Orient  House is acting against the laws of the State of Israel. When  it acts to divide the city it is an outright violation of the  criminal law of Israel that forbids any action that may  jeopardize the status of Jerusalem as the exclusive united  capital of the state of Israel.

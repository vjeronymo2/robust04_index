			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Perot edging towards campaign decision MR ROSS PEROT may decide next week whether or not to revive his abandoned campaign for the US presidency, and on what basis. The Texas billionaire, who said on Tuesday that he had made a mistake by withdrawing from the race in July, has tentatively scheduled a meeting next week with the heads of his volunteer movement in the various states. He says he will take their advice. Several of them have publicly urged him to get back into the contest. Mr Perot also met privately on Tuesday Mr James Baker, who runs President George Bush's campaign, and Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic national committee. No report of either meeting has been forthcoming. Perhaps the best insight into Mr Perot's thinking was provided in an interview yesterday with the Washington Post by Mr James Squires, the former Chicago newspaper editor who served as press secretary to Mr Perot's earlier effort and is still on his payroll. Mr Squires, who said he had spoken to Mr Perot several times over the weekend, repeated that the latter wanted to continue to put pressure on Mr Bush and on Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, to come up with credible plans to cut the US budget deficit. But, Mr Squires added: 'I don't think there is a chance in hell that Ross Perot could ever endorse George Bush.' He could back Mr Clinton, if the Democrat were to adopt some of Mr Perot's budget-cutting ideas, and he could launch a limited campaign, confining himself to such states as Texas and Florida, 'just to help Clinton,' Mr Squires believes. Mr Perot insists he does not want to re-enter the race as 'a spoiler', and he denies, as many suspect, that this renewed teasing of the political process is mostly designed to satisfy his own ego. Opinions are divided over the impact of his return, if any. It might initially hurt Mr Clinton, because he was the principal beneficiary of the July withdrawal, but hard-core Perot support is beyond dispute mostly Republican. In Florida and Texas, that support could, if energised, work to Mr Clinton's favour; in the industrial Midwest, now leaning towards the Democrats, it might cut the other way. In California, where Mr Perot was popular, Mr Clinton now seems too far ahead to be threatened. If he does return to the race, Mr Perot might claim a place at the televised debates between the main candidates, assuming at least one takes place. The Clinton and Bush campaigns continued yesterday to accuse each other of conspiracy to prevent this confrontation. But, if Mr Clinton's lead (21 points in the latest Washington Post/ABC opinion poll) continues to hold up, the president may have no choice but to accede to a debate. However, the president's campaign, reflecting Mr Baker's thinking, continues to maintain that Mr Clinton has most to gain by appearing on the same platform as the president in a debate. It therefore rejected the latest proposal by the independent commission in charge of the debates that one be held at Louisville, Kentucky, next Tuesday with a single moderator rather than a panel of questioners, as the Bush campaign wants. The movement behind Mr Perot has at its hub the Perot Relations Committee, constituted to put his name on all state ballots. According to the federal election commission, Mr Perot has spent about Dollars 16m of his own money on this effort - nearly Dollars 7m of that after his official withdrawal from the race. There is an almost complete absence of professional political advice and polling in this volunteer organisation.</p>

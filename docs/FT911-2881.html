			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Fall to loss and rights at Porth AT THE same time that it announced a fall into loss in 1990, Porth Group unveiled plans for a rights issue to raise about Pounds 3.5m, net of expenses, and made public the appointment of Sir Michael Edwardes as non-executive chairman. In the year to December 31 this consumer products company dropped into losses of Pounds 853,000 (profits Pounds 925,000) on turnover down slightly at Pounds 21.17m (Pounds 21.3m). The company is omitting its final dividend, leaving the total for the year at 0.5p (4.5p). Interest payable rose to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 890,000) and, after a higher tax charge of Pounds 227,000 (Pounds 15,000), losses per share came out at 7p (earnings 5.9p). The company said that although it kept within its overdraft limits 'during this difficult period', its principal bankers were unwilling to to agree renewed facilities unless the group had an injection of capital. Consequently Porth is issuing 61.41m new ordinary shares on a 4-for-1 basis to raise Pounds 2.5m to reduce bank borrowings and Pounds 1m to provide extra working capital.</p>

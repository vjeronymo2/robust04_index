			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta, 6 Apr -- Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of  the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Indonesia  should not consider the people's Republic of China (PRC) as a  competitor in the fields of trade and investment. This is  because the two countries can play an equally important role in  supporting economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region.    Aburizal Bakrie was speaking to newsmen during a break in a  seminar on Trade and Investment Relations between Indonesia and  China held in Jakarta on 5 April.    He said that it is impossible for the Asia-pacific economy  to  grow without higher economic growth in Indonesia and China, the  two most populous countries in the region. Therefore, if the two  countries are competing with each other, let it be a healthy  competition that is mutually complementary. [Passage omitted]    In his written message to the seminar, Minister of Trade  Satrio Budiarjo Judono, expressed the hope that traders from  Indonesia and PRC would forge closer cooperation and take  advantage of the vast opportunities available in the two  countries.    He said that Indonesian businessmen should increase their  volume of exports to the PRC. In 1993, the value of Indonesia's  exports to the PRC totaled $1.249 billion. The receipt from oil  and gas exports was US$554.3 million, along with US$ 695.2  million from exports of nonoil and nongas commodities.    Continuing, he said Indonesia's imports from PRC in the same  period totaled US$936 million, and this included imports of oil  and gas, which stood at US$39.5 million; while imports of nonoil  and nongas commodities stood at US$896.5 million.    Indonesia's major import from PRC was textiles fiber, which  reached US$92.9 million; while Indonesia's main export to PRC  was plywood, which totaled US$481.05 million. [Passage omitted]</p>

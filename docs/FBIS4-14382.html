			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza -- The repatriated deportee Jamal Zaqqut,  member of the executive bureau of FIDA [Palestinian Democratic  Union], said yesterday that the agreement between Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] and Fatah in the Gaza Strip is a step in  the right direction and that FIDA welcomes this step, because it  has come at a time when everyone is sensing the great  significance of enhancing national unity and when meetings are  being held among various national and Islamic forces.    Zaqqut called on all forces to consolidate dialogue and  harmony in order to confront the tasks of the coming stage. He  said that the inception of a national and Islamic authority in  the Gaza Strip, on the basis of plurality and mutual respect of  opinions, will lead to the establishment of a democratic  foundation based on popular participation.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Zil lays off 60,000 workers Russia's Zil car plant, famous for making the black limousines used by the Kremlin, is laying off more than 60,000 workers for a week because of a financial crisis. Zil said non-payment by customers had forced the suspension of the main production line at Zil, which also produces lorries. Production fell to 100,000 units in 1993, from around 150,000 in 1992, and the plant was forced to introduce a four-day week in January. Officials said Zil, which sold part of its shares to the public in May 1993, needed an immediate cash injection of at least Rbs30bn to stay afloat.</p>

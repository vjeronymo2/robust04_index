			<p>BFN     [Text] Slobodan Milosevic, president of the Republic of  Serbia, is in our country for a one-day visit. About one hour  ago, the first round of talks between Presidents Slobodan  Milosevic and Ion Iliescu, which was attended by members of the  two delegations, ended at Cotroceni Palace [presidential  headquarters].    They approached various aspects of bilateral relations, the  current stage of the peace negotiations on former Yugoslavia,  and aspects of their finalization. They emphasized the good  relations between Romania and Serbia and the two countries'  actions toward instilling a climate of peace and security in the  Balkans and achieving multilateral cooperation after the  peaceful settlement of the conflicts in the region.    Our correspondent reported that the talks between the two  presidents are to continue through a working lunch and in the  afternoon at Cotroceni Palace.    About 40 minutes ago, President Slobodan Milosevic laid a  wreath at the monument to the unknown hero in Carol Park, after  which he held talks with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    President Milosevic's schedule also includes a meeting with  representatives of the ethnic Serbs living in Romania and a  joint news conference to be held with the Romanian president.    At 1600 Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu is to  hold  separate talks with his Yugoslav counterpart, Vladislav  Jovanovic.</p>

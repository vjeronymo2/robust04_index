The government will cut back the number of  co-productions with foreign firms, ban the creation of joint  ventures as well as independent Chinese productions, the  official publication of the Ministry of Culture said.    The Chinese press on Monday had still failed to report a  breakthrough by a Chinese film in the United States -- the  winning of a Golden Globe Award in Los Angeles on Saturday by  "Farewell My Concubine," by director Chen Kaige.    The film, partly financed by Taiwanese capital, received the  Golden Palm award at last year's Cannes festival. But, under  China's censorship laws, it was only screened rarely in China  and often in a truncated version.    "Last year, certain Chinese films were produced with (the  participation of) Hong Kong and Taiwanese firms which did not  respect the rules," China Culture News reported. "These films  do not allow the Chinese cinema to occupy the place it deserves  on the national market," it said.    "This year, we will reduce cooperation abroad and limit the  number of co-produced films to 26. And we shall ban the  creation of joint ventures for the production and distribution  of films."    The move comes after two years of relative independence for  Chinese studios, whose management has gained some financial  autonomy. The liberalisation has fuelled co-productions with  foreign companies and also weakened the government's scrutiny  over content. These developments have helped young, ambitious  directors to bring their works to the screen but have also drawn  the wrath of the authorities, who have reacted by censoring the  movie or hampering its distribution or filming.    The government has set a production quota this year of 150  films for Chinese studios, of which 60 percent must be works of  contemporary fiction. "The conditions for lifting the  restraints are not yet right," the ministry of film and  radio-television, quoted by the China Culture News, said.    "The ministry will give production authorisation to 16 state  studios, no others," it said.</p>

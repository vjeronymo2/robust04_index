			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: WMX Technologies slides on static sales WMX Technologies, the US waste management and environmental group, yesterday reported a decline in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 162.6m, or 34 cents a share, from Dollars 199.2m, or 41 cents, in the same 1993 quarter. Sales were little changed at Dollars 2.3bn, against Dollars 2.1bn a year ago. The group continued to suffer from the negative effects of weakness in the hazardous waste disposal industry, the company said. WMX is the parent company of Chemical Waste Management, Rust International, Wheelabrator Technologies and Waste Management International. Chemical Waste Management saw first-quarter earnings drop substantially to Dollars 9.8m, from Dollars 21.3m in the first quarter of 1993. 'Conditions in the hazardous waste industry remain difficult. However, the company is on schedule with its restructuring programme and continues its efforts to lower costs,' said Mr Dean Buntrock, WMX chairman. He said first-quarter earnings in all subsidiaries were hit by severe winter weather. However, Mr Buntrock was confident of better trading during the rest of this year.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Positive debut from Polish Citibank unit CITIBANK'S wholly-owned Polish subsidiary has reported a 131.5bn zloty (Dollars 8.3m) profit for 1992, its first full year of operation, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The bank has concentrated on providing wholesale services to multinational clients in Poland as well as locally-owned companies. The balance sheet at the end of last year runs to 2,015bn zlotys with term deposits of 898.9bn zlotys and current accounts valued at 774.7bn zlotys. The bank, which is capitalised at 157.7bn zlotys has pursued a conservative policy, preferring to deposit 1,105.4bn zlotys worth of its assets with local state-owned banks and investing another 412.2bn zlotys in Treasury bills. Loans accounted at the end of the year for a mere 461bn zlotys worth of the bank's funds. Bank officials explain that lending limits have restrained its ability to provide loans and that it has been active in helping develop Poland's capital market. However, Mr Allan Hirst, Citibank Poland general manager, cautions that interest rates are falling and profits are likely to be squeezed this year as spreads narrow.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK urged to set up another tier of research institution BRITAIN should promote a new tier of technological research institutions, modelled on German lines, to act as a bridge between universities and industry, an independent report says. As part of a bold attempt to improve industry's use of technical expertise, the interim report prepared by the Working Group on Innovation, an independent initiative set up last year, also proposes a Faraday City award, similar to the European City of Culture label. The report, to be sent to party leaders this week, was written by Sir John Fairclough, former chief scientific adviser to the Cabinet Office and now chairman of the Engineering Council, an umbrella body for 46 professional institutions. It says that existing independent research and development companies, which pay their way by doing contract work for industry, should be given a higher public profile, copying the German Fraunhofer Institutes. They would then receive some public funding and be encouraged to take on higher degree students. The idea is that this would bridge the gap between industry, which rarely sees academia as a source of fruitful new ideas, and scientists who fail to exploit fully their ideas in the private sector. The Association of Independent Research and Technology Organisations represents many companies that could fall into this category. Its members employ 10,000 staff, more than half of them scientists or engineers. They turn over more than Pounds 300m a year, representing more contract research than UK universities and polytechnics combined. By upgrading these companies, the expense of building new institutions from scratch would be avoided. At a local level, the Faraday City tag would concentrate advice and facilities for industrial research and development on one city for a year or two. The models for this plan, the Fraunhofer Institutes, are permanent bodies. Their success is measured by revenues they generate from industrial contracts. They also have close links with universities. The managing director of a Fraunhofer Institute usually has a chair at a university and the laboratories are on campus. Institute employees often regard themselves in transition from academia to industry. Such a bridge does not exist in the UK, says the Centre for the Exploitation of Science and Technology, a UK industry and state-funded research organisation also chaired by Sir John Fairclough.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Many people get upset if you say that Rowan Atkinson is wasting himself on the prize twerp he plays in Mr Bean Rides Again. If you go further and assert that his Blackadder series were better they ask what you mean by 'better' and point out that Mr Bean is hugely popular and wins international awards. The same is true of Macdonald's hamburgers, and all you can say to anybody who cannot see the superiority of Blackadder is that they may as well watch the lesser series. Another comedy which seems to me second rate is Evening Shade, an American import which began last week on Channel 4 (8.30) with Burt Reynolds playing a failed football coach. To call it syrupy would be an insult to Tate And Lyle. Horizon considers the studies of the sun that became possible during the eclipse on July 11 last year (8.10 BBC2). Coast Of Dreams (9.00 C4) is the first of a pair of documentaries dealing with life among expatriate Britons on the Costa del Sol, today from the British pov and next week as the Spanish see it. In Panorama (9.30 BBC1) David Dimbleby chairs a debate about Scottish independence, a subject which is going to bore the English to tears before the Scots are happy.</p>

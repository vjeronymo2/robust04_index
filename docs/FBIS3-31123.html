			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, plenipotentiary of the </F> Government of the Polish Republic for European integration:  "Warsaw's European Option"]    [Text] Poland remains committed to the vision of European  construction extended to Central Europe which, over the last  four years, has constituted the central idea of its foreign  policy. Its principal objectives have been clearly identified:  Poland's accession to Western security structures as well as  those concerned with European economic and political  integration. This aim is being fulfilled by developing close  relations with the European Community, now the European Union,  and with EFTA [European Free Trade Association], as well as by  establishing special links with the Visegrad countries and  consolidating very good relations with Poland's neighbors.    Poland's integration into the European Union remains of  vital  national interest. Poland needs a Union that is open to its  neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe. The absence of such  openness would signify the continuation of old divisions or the  creation of new ones. We in Poland are expecting the  intensification of trade links, the extension of political  dialogue, an intensification of our participation in the  mechanisms of European political cooperation, an adjustment in  the level of support given to our efforts at transforming and  modernizing our country, and the completion of the integration  of Central Europe in the interests of both Western Europe and  Poland itself.    Following the fall of Communism in 1989, Europe entered into  a period of essential structural transformation, a complex,  long-term process. In the eyes of the postcommunist countries,  this process goes hand in hand with the task of defining their  place within the new European structure. We are seeing an  entirely unique opportunity presenting itself in Europe.  Throughout its history, Europe has rarely been at peace and has  never been unified. Now, the opportunity for a unification of  this kind would appear to be emerging. This conjunction of new  European realities, the awareness of new needs, and the  possibility of creating a unique opportunity constitute a major  challenge for the political architects of Europe.    In Central and Eastern Europe we are experiencing a rapid  differentiation of the pace of political and economic  transformation in its various parts. Poland and its partners in  the Visegrad group (Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia)  are already operating on the basis of principles identical to  those of their Western partners. However, the general division  of Europe is partially persisting: The Iron Curtain has turned  into a line demarcating prosperity.  <H5>  Tradesmen's Europe </H5>   Although Europe has always been divided along the lines of  the prosperity of its societies, this division is currently  making itself most keenly felt as a result of the cessation of  antagonism between the Western and Eastern blocs. It would be  impossible to neglect this division. Such a socioeconomic  variant of the old politico-military division of the continent  is, in the longer term, exerting a destabilizing effect on  Europe. The consequences of the illegal arms traffic, of  organized crime, of uncontrolled migratory movements, of  ecological catastrophes, and of the phenomena associated with  economic crisis will not merely affect the eastern part of the  continent. The appearance of a new wall would put an end, in  the political sphere, to all that Europe has achieved since the  changes of 1989-90 and that it has quite rightly raised to the  rank of something of common value.    At present, we are witnessing three parallel phenomena in  Europe: integration, the reemergence of nationalism, and  intranational divisions. The process of Western European  integration within the context of the European Union, initiated  by the founding fathers of Europe--Robert Schumann, Jean Monnet,  De Gasperi, Spaak, Adenauer--is currently undergoing a crisis in  the eyes of the majority of elites in the countries belonging to  the European Community. Integration still remains the primary  objective, but sometimes we have the feeling that the notion of  European construction, as it existed after World War II, has  been lost sight of, and that we are moving toward a "tradesmen's  Europe" rather than a "politically planned Europe."    Security policy in Europe is faced with new intellectual  and structural challenges. The concepts of security that  existed before 1989 boasted military significance, above all.  Today, ecological and socioeconomic factors also have to be  taken into account, and security is no longer viewed as a  principle of conduct. Today, faced with the requirements to  bring about systemic changes in the East as quickly as possible,  and to accelerate the integration processes in the West,  security is acquiring a new dimension, which is above all more  dynamic. In Poland, help in achieving these transformations  must be treated as an essential component of security policy,  which takes nonmilitary factors into account in equal measure.    Unfortunately, the positive transformations which are being  accomplished in Central and Eastern Europe have also brought to  light the weaknesses of the countries involved, as well as the  risks to which they are exposed. Neither the East nor the West  were prepared for the emergence of new phenomena on such a large  scale. It could even be said that we were all surprised,  especially with regard to the pace and extent of these  transformations.    So far, in international politics, no effective instruments  have been devised for solving the nascent problems. Moreover,  no system has been perfected for achieving harmonious links  between the various countries' rights to self-determination and  national sovereignty, on the one hand, while respecting ethnic  and cultural peculiarities and reconciling the trends running  counter to regional and global integration with the centrifugal  mechanisms driven by ethnic and cultural imperatives, on the  other. Consequently, during this crucial period, it is  extremely important that we continue to be tireless in our  search for the appropriate means to resolve the new, interlinked  problems that are continually arising. It is important that all  the parties concerned participate in this search.    The orientation toward the West and European integration  have  become the strategic linchpins of Polish foreign policy. The  essential aim of this policy is to lend a durable and  indissociable character to Poland's political, economic,  cultural, and civilization-related ties with the Western world.  We must ensure that the Polish presence becomes a durable  feature of the institutions and system of European integration,  so that our country becomes an indispensable constituent of this  system. That would constitute the best guarantee of Polish  development within the context of European construction, with  which we identify.</p>

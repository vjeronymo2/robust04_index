			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / White House rebuffs EC on Gatt talks timetable: Blow to Brittan's hopes of early decision THE CLINTON administration has rebuffed European Community overtures seeking agreement on a timetable for reaching an early conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, made the soundings in advance of this Thursday's opening round of bilateral trade talks in Washington with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Mr Kantor's response was non-committal, on the grounds that the new administration is still formulating policy, and therefore a blow to Sir Leon's attempts to convey a sense of urgency towards concluding the six-year-old Gatt talks. Last week, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, further dampened prospects for a rapid Gatt deal when he said that a breakthrough was unlikely to occur before March 1, the deadline for the US 'fast track' negotiating authority. Brussels officials say Sir Leon was looking for a commitment that Mr Clinton would seek, if necessary, a three-to-six-month extension to the 'fast track' negotiating authority, allowing the administration to offer Congress a Gatt deal for approval or rejection without amendment. Without such a tight negotiating framework, the risks increase of an agreement being delayed until next year or later, an EC official familiar with Sir Leon's thinking said. After the initial rebuff, EC officials have now downgraded expectations of what can be achieved at the first meeting between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor, beyond 'getting the chemistry right' and ensuring that the administration makes a Gatt agreement a top priority. Beyond talks with Mr Kantor, Sir Leon is to meet Mr Robert Rubin, an old Yale colleague who is special assistant to the president on economic policy, as well as members of Congress, and possibly Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury Secretary. The two sides must also address two separate trade disputes which, while inherited from the Bush administration, have again flared up since Mr Clinton took office. Relations soured after the Clinton administration's preliminary decision to impose new anti-dumping duties on steel exports from the EC and other countries.  Last week, the administration said the federal government would stop buying goods and services from EC countries unless the EC ended discrimination in public procurement contracts. EC officials fear these bilateral disputes are best contained in the Gatt framework, but without early agreement, they could spin out of control.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Gestetner sells camera distribution side GESTETNER HOLDINGS, the office products and photographic film and equipment distributor, has found a buyer for its camera distribution business, which has been hit by the recession. Concord Camera of the US is to purchase the Vivitar and Hanimex camera distribution business, excluding Hanimex Australasia, for Dollars 40m (Pounds 20.3m) in cash and 1.3m Concord shares, with an option to convert the shares to Pounds 12.5m in cash in 12 months' time. Mr Basil Sellers, Gestetner chairman, said the sale reflected the realisation that camera distribution 'was not a core business for us.' The group had been seeking a buyer for nine months. The camera business has net tangible assets of about Dollars 31m. Its main market is North America. Trading profits were Pounds 2m on world-wide sales of Pounds 90m in the year to October 31, but dipped to a Pounds 1.3m trading loss on sales of Pounds 37m for the six months to April 30. Gestetner will retain its film and processing operations based in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, together with the right to the Hanimex name in Australia. These operations mainly comprise distribution and processing of Fuji film in Australia and Fuji graphic arts products in the UK. Trading profits from this source were Pounds 7.2m on sales of Pounds 90m in the full year, and Pounds 1.7m on sales of Pounds 44m in the latest half year. The cash proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce bank borrowings. The UK group has been focusing on its core office equipment business following its 1990 acquisition of the non-US operations of Nashua Office Systems and its recent alliance with Ricoh of Japan. Ricoh and AFP, the Australian investment company, hold nearly 25 per cent each of Gestetner, on a fully diluted basis.</p>

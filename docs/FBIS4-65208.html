			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Caledonia -- Edouard Balladur </F> Meets With Neaoutyne"]    [Text] The prime minister yesterday met with Paul  Neaoutyne, president of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation  Front (FLNKS -- separatist), with whom he discussed the  territory's future. At the end of this meeting, Mr. Neaoutyne,  who decided not to participate in the follow-up committee on the  Matignon agreement last year, discussed with Mr. Balladur the  "FLNKS' desire to see the partnership" between the [French]  state and the [overseas] territory "returning to something  concrete." "The prime minister," Mr. Neaoutyne added, "said  that the government's position was to pursue" the action taken  and make sure that "the state plays its role in ensuring that  the partnership initiated is maintained so that over the next  four years the discussions go beyond the current disputes and  disagreements, so that choices are freely made in the 1995 and  1998 elections."    The FLNKS president also emphasized the "disagreements"  which  exist in the sphere of air transport and nickel.  <H5>  Return to Calm </H5>   In this connection, he reaffirmed that his party wanted air  transport to be opened up to competition to bring to the  territory a clientele likely to "revive tourism."    On the subject of nickel, which recently sparked off  disturbances in Noumea, he reaffirmed his demand for "raising  the nickel quota on over a renewable annual period so as to  enable the mining companies to regain market shares compared  with Indonesia and Malaysia." Calm has been restored on the  spot, with the "truckers" having agreed to withdraw their  vehicles from the southern province following the agreement to  take account of their demands.    Max Foucher, president of the trucker's trade union said,  "there are no winners or losers, but we are still vigilant."    Reason has prevailed following 18 days of a conflict marked  by the plundering of the area surrounding the Southern Province  Administrative Headquarters and the High Commission. A  timetable has been drawn up for an emergency procedure. As of  this week, several meetings will be held to prepare the work of  the standing commission which is responsible for deciding on the  proposals which will be submitted to the Congress.</p>

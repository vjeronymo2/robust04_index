			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa al-Basyuni and 'Adil 'Abd-al-Karim: </F> "Open Importation Greatest Danger"]    [Text] Businessmen stated that opening wide the door to  importation without controls greatly threatens Egyptian industry.    They indicated that credits must be given and duties eased  on  production requisites. The Egyptian producer must be granted the  privileges that his foreign counterpart enjoys.    They demanded that the Egyptian product be improved and that  the relative advantage of the human factor be exploited.    Dr. Samir Tubar, chairman of the NDP's [National Democratic  Party] economic committee, indicated that the main directions of  the economic reform program focus on appealing to market  mechanisms and interfering with pricing only in fortuitous  circumstances such as dumping and attempts to harm national  industry by unfair means.  <H5>  Competition Desirable </H5>   He said that the government might intervene to protect  products in the first years, but it was improper for the state  to keep interfering, or it would harm the national interest. One  must therefore work efficiently to produce goods that can  compete with foreign goods, increase the efficiency of  industrial establishments, promote training, benefit from the  area in which Egypt enjoys a relative advantage, improve  quality, and reduce costs so as to confront foreign products.  Production units should be refurbished and sound standards  followed.    He indicated that Egypt must compete with foreign  industries.  All units must make every effort to develop themselves, because  a closed-door policy is no longer viable, given the stage of  economic liberalization in the world as a whole.  <H5>  Many Burdens </H5>   On the other hand, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Kabti, president of the  General Weaving and Knitting Association, thought that opening  wide the door to importation would have an impact on Egyptian  products because the unequal competition would be to the  advantage of the foreign product.    The local producer has many burdens to bear, such as high  taxes, electricity, and high interest rates. Foreign producers,  on the other hand, are highly subsidized in order to harm  national industry.    'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Ghazzali, vice president of the  Engineering  Industries Union, said that opening wide the door to importation  certainly would have an impact on national industry. It would  shift the competitive balance in favor of the foreign country  that heavily subsidizes its industry, at a time when Egyptian  industry is suffering from many obstacles.    One must therefore impose regulations to raise customs  duties  on goods that are cheaper than Egyptian products and monitor the  quality of the foreign product. No product should be allowed in  until its quality and suitability are fully verified.  <H5>  Threat </H5>   Engineer 'Ala Zahran, owner and director of the Tifal-Zahran  factories, explained how opening the door to importation had  come to constitute a threat to national industry due to the lack  of strict surveillance and full tests on various imported goods.    The customs duty on such imported products does not exceed 5  percent. Furthermore, the products are subsidized overseas,  which influences the price of the local product.    He indicated that importing spare parts for large factories  could be considered another very serious problem, first because  the price of the parts was very high and then because taxes were  collected on them even though we import them not for sale, but  for installation and operation in machinery.    Some parts are not available in the market; and if they are,  the price is exorbitant. Thus we are forced to import them from  abroad to reduce the price difference as much as possible.    Muhammad Abu-Khatwah, the owner and director of tractor and  agricultural machinery factories, said that opening the door to  importation certainly was backing national industry into a tight  corner because of high requisite prices and production costs  here.  <H5>  Suggestions </H5>   He suggested that banks be designated to fund factory owners  at reasonable interest rates in order to stimulate production.    Fahmi 'Abd-al-Maqsud, an exporter, thinks the coming period  will require lowering the price of electricity and water,  reducing customs duties on production requisites, and lowering  taxes on manufacturing companies so that they can reduce the  prices of their products and thus compete with imported products.    Muhammad Fu'ad Ahmad, an importer of food products, believes  that high raw material prices in the domestic market cause high  production costs. This always places the prices of Egyptian  products in an uncompetitive position compared with the prices  of the corresponding foreign goods imported from abroad.    Engineer 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Jamal, owner of a furniture  factory, thinks that high interest rates and taxes do not favor  Egyptian production compared with imports. He suggests reducing  bank interest rates to finance factory purchases of modern tools  and equipment so that our industry can keep pace with continuous  development in the world.    He declared that his factories had surged ahead in exporting  furniture parts and office furniture covered with thin layers of  fire-resistant plastic.    Ibrahim Mansi, an importer of food products, thinks it is  difficult for national industry to compete with foreign  industry. He suggests lowering the interest rates of banks that  finance national export industry to 6 percent, instead of 14 and  16 percent.  <H5>  Regulations </H5>   Sami 'Abd-al-Maqsud, secretary of the importers' section of  the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce, holds that  opening the door to importation does not mean abandoning  national industry. Many regulations can be kept, such as  increased tariffs on certain goods, and committees can be  established to monitor standards closely and set the price.    He indicated that full opening of the doors to importation  must be accompanied by many measures to develop Egyptian  industry and ease taxes and customs duties on production  requisites.    Sulayman Muhammad Sulayman, president of the Sadat City  Investors' Association, said: "I am for opening wide the door to  importation, provided that local industry is supported and bank  interest rates for investors are lowered. The investor's time  should not be wasted in obtaining approvals and resolving  bureaucratic problems in customs."    Muhammad Ghanim, former general secretary of the  Businessmen's Association and an investor, said: "Opening the  door wide to importation is something normal, given the period  of economic liberalization through which Egypt is passing. We  cannot isolate ourselves from the world. But this trend must be  accompanied by encouragements for Egyptian industry, because  Egypt is at the beginning of the road and the industrial  countries are stages ahead of us. Thus, the obstacles that face  the Egyptian investor and involve him in administrative mazes  that prevent him from concentrating on production must be  resolved. We must give economic thinking greater weight than  administrative thinking."  <H5>  Future Benefit </H5>   Dr. Salah al-Jundi, professor of economics at al-Mansurah  University, believes that the entry of imported goods into Egypt  will create competition with domestic production. In the medium  and long term this will lead to lower prices for the consumer  and to an attempt to improve quality. Local companies will  review production costs and profit margins until they arrive at  attractive prices by which they can compete with imports.    Dr. Salah noted the need to increase the quality of Egyptian  products and raise productivity to achieve competitive  advantage. This will reduce the effect and danger of  international variables.    He also stressed the need to strengthen the government's  oversight role, so that liberalization does not turn into  commercial anarchy that damages many infant industries still in  the start-up phase. Opening the door to importation must not be  a way to import products that do not conform to specifications,  and no monopolies of any kind should appear.    Regulations must also be established to prevent dumping,  subsidization, and falsification of documents. One should lower  duties on production raw materials and requisites, intermediate  and capital goods, and production equipment. One should instill  the slogan Made in Egypt and evoke Egyptians' zeal  and sense of identity so that they prefer buying the well-made  Egyptian product and show it partiality, just as happens in all  countries of the world. This requires that the Egyptian producer  attain a high level of quality and conform to international  specifications.    He stressed the need to pass a law against monopoly and  commercial fraud and to combat dumping. Smuggling to evade  customs duties should be combatted by giving every importer a  customs number to tighten control on the payment of customs  duties.</p>

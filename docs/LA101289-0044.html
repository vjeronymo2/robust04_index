			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MONTCLAIR PREP TO FACE MARSHALL FUNDAMENTAL  </P> <P> After five weeks of dominating nonleague opponents, Montclair Prep (5-0) will  begin Alpha League play against winless Marshall Fundamental (0-5) at 7:30  tonight at La Canada High.  </P> <P> Montclair Prep has outscored opponents, 202-20, and gained 1,050 yards more  than the opposition (1,657 to 607). The Mounties lead Valley Southern Section  schools in total offense, averaging 331.4 yards a game, and rank second in  total defense, yielding 121.4 yards.  </P> <P> Marshall Fundamental Coach Lew Underwood, whose Eagles tied Montclair Prep last  year for the Alpha League title, says that this is a "trying year" in Pasadena.  The Eagle roster has been reduced to 15 players because of injuries and  eligibility problems.  </P> <P> Montclair Prep's touted backfield of senior Michael Jones and junior Derek  Sparks might be running on only one cylinder again this week. Jones' playing  status is questionable after missing last week's game because of a bruised  knee.  </P> <P> Sparks moved from fullback to tailback and gained 215 yards in 11 carries and  scored six touchdowns, five on consecutive carries. Sparks leads Valley rushers  with 879 yards in 85 carries and has scored 17 touchdowns. BRIAN MURPHY  </P></p>

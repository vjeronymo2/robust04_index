			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Observer moves to prepare the ground for changes SPECULATION at the end of last week that Lonrho, the international conglomerate, was about to sell the Observer Sunday newspaper to The Independent, continued yester-day. This was in spite of a vigorous denial of such a possible sale in the Observer's editorial column yesterday. The editorial dismissed as 'mischievous and irresponsible' reports last Friday that Lonrho, owner of the title for 12 years, has decided to sell it to Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and its sister Sunday title. The Observer's editorial confirmed what had long been suspected - that Lonrho has 'received a number of offers' for the newspaper, which was first established in 1791 and is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper. Nor did the editorial sound completely convinced that, were the Observer sold to Newspaper Publishing, it would not be merged with the Independent on Sunday and cease publication as a separate title. The editorial said: 'If Lonrho were to sell the Observer - and the if must be stressed - we do not believe that they would do so without safeguarding the newspaper's future and ensuring that its most precious asset, its distinctive voice and values forged over two centuries of publication, were maintained.' The editorial seemed to be attempting to prepare the ground for a sale by spelling out the advantages of joining forces with a daily newspaper. It claimed that the Observer's financial difficulties were mainly due to it being a one-day-a-week publication while having to bear seven-day overheads. Observer journalists have written to Mr Tiny Rowland, joint Lonrho chief executive with Mr Dieter Bock, asking him not to sell to Newspaper Publishing but to The Guardian, which, the letter said, 'would be a more effective guarantor of the paper's identity and character than any other bidder'. The letter to Mr Rowland added: 'Since Lonrho took over the Observer in 1981 you have frequently expressed your affection for the paper, and we thank you for the investment that has enabled us to survive in a highly competitive environment. We hope that you will not mark your relinquishing of control by closing us down. Britain cannot afford to lose a newspaper with the Observer's distinctive voice and history.' The Independent on Sunday yesterday made no mention of the subject. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may face pressure to make a Commons statement today on the Observer's future. Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, called on Mr Heseltine to make a statement. The Observer's annual losses are running at about Pounds 8m, compared with a Pounds 14.9m deficit last year. When Mr Bock, Lonrho's biggest shareholder with 18.8 per cent, took his seat on the board in February he set up a team to work on the newspaper's sale. The Observer is printed by the Financial Times under a contract which runs to January 1995.</p>

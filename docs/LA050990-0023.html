			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTO DONATION  </P> <P> I was amazed and gratified to read about Chilton Alphonse's donation of part of  his $185,000 lottery winnings to his anti-gang agency, Community Youth Sports  and Arts Foundation, based in South-Central Los Angeles (Metro, April 20). He  is truly a good and unselfish man. Isn't it sad that while we live in the  richest state in the richest country in the world, he cannot get state or  federal funds? He will sacrifice what most of us would keep for ourselves,  while others would spend $10 million to buy themselves a painting that few  would ever see.  </P> <P> EDWARD P.

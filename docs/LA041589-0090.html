			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ SOCIETY SPECIALIZATION  </P> <P> Asking a Dixieland society to play modern jazz is like demanding that a Bach  society play some Sousa marches. Feather should know that to impose such a  switch on people who joined a society for a particular style would cause them  to leave the concert hall or cancel their memberships. You must sell tickets  and memberships to have a successful jazz society.  </P> <P> HAROLD GRAY  </P> <P> Past President  </P> <P> Potomac River Jazz Club  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

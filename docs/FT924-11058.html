			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Yeltsin to ban extremist front RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin responded to increasingly vociferous threats to his authority by deciding yesterday to ban a coalition of communists and fascists and warn the west of the 'terrible danger' posed by Russian extremists. His latest statements foreshadow a possible crackdown at home and, on the eve of debt negotiations and a conference on aid for Russia, a last-ditch attempt to persuade the west to throw its political and economic weight behind his reforms - even if they are watered down. Russian officials suggested that the country's relationship with the International Monetary Fund could become a casualty of the political instability there, which they cited as a reason for not being able to set a date for talks on a full standby agreement. Mr Yeltsin said he had ordered the preparation of a decree banning the National Salvation Front - which wants his removal and an end to western-style market reforms - because the organisation called 'for the overthrow of legally constituted authorities'. A manifesto produced by the Front leadership said it would stick to constitutional methods to achieve its aims, but some participants at the Front's founding congress on Saturday hinted that violence and conspiracy were part of the scenario. It is not clear what the ban will mean, as the Front includes several deputies who are due to attend a December 1 meeting of the Russian super-parliament that will seek to unseat the government. However Mr Yeltsin ordered Russian diplomats to explain the dangers of such organisations to the west, where they 'do not yet understand this'. Mr Yeltsin's authority faced a further challenge when the chairman of the Russian parliament used a self-styled parliamentary security force to 'guard' the Izvestia newspaper in violation of a presidential decree which establishes its independence. The newspaper's editor, Mr Igor Golembiovsky, said he had received assurances that the parliament's media committee would ask the Constitutional Court to challenge parliament's decision last week claiming control over the Izvestia publishing complex. But some of his colleagues feared the arrival of armed officers was a prelude to a forcible takeover. The political uncertainty in Moscow may already be pushing the president into the arms of the so-called centrist Civic Union movement, which wants the removal of key radical reformers in his cabinet, a law and order crackdown, and more leniency for inefficient state enterprises. But Mr Yeltsin also said he would 'not sacrifice' either Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister who launched Polish-style shock therapy reforms in January, or Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the pro-western foreign minister. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister with responsibility for foreign economic relations, said yesterday that presidential rule - a euphemism for a more authoritarian regime - was still premature.

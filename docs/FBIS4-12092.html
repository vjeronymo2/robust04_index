			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Caroline Faraj in Amman] </F>   [Text] An expanded meeting will be held tomorrow Wednesday  [6 April] comprising representatives of U.S. Government  departments and bodies concerned with foreign affairs to discuss  available options concerning the U.S. Navy's inspection of ships  bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah.    Well-informed sources have said that a number of concerned  U.S. departments and institutions are trying to obstruct the  holding of this meeting. However, the U.S. State Department  intends to make a final decision during Wednesday's meeting.    A political observer believes that the U.S. State  Department's inclination toward making a decision should lead to  a positive one in Jordan's favor. This expected decision will  be the result of the clear and frank stand expressed by His  Majesty King Husayn during his meeting with ambassadors of the  five permanent members of the UN Security Council last week.    The previous meeting scheduled for last Thursday was  postponed for reasons the U.S. State Department spokesman said  were connected with fixing an appropriate date and time among  the bodies concerned with foreign affairs.    It is worth noting that three months ago Jordan proposed the  appointment of a third technical and neutral party such as  Lloyd's Register to inspect ships at the Port of al-'Aqabah  rather than by the U.S. Navy in the Straits of Tiran as the  situation is now.</p>

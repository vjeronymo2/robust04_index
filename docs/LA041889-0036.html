			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FORMER OPPONENT BACKS BERNARDI IN COUNCIL RUNOFF RACE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, facing a June 6 runoff against  firefighter Lyle Hall, announced Monday that he has picked up the key  endorsement of Al Dib, the third-place finisher in last week's primary in the  northeast San Fernando Valley's 7th District.  </P> <P> The 77-year-old Bernardi, a 28-year council veteran, also said at a City Hall  news conference that, if reelected, his next term would be his last.  </P> <P> "I just happen to think this next term ought to be enough," he said.  </P> <P> Bernardi finished first in the April 11 primary with 42% of the vote but fell  short of the 50%-plus-one vote required to avoid a runoff against Hall, who  finished second with 26%. Dib, past president of the Arleta Chamber of  Commerce, received 12% of the vote.  </P> <P> "He said he is not running again after this term, which tells me he will not  owe developers and special interest groups anything," Dib said of Bernardi.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Business, GOP Support  </P> <P> Dib, who was the only Republican in the nonpartisan race, is expected to bring  business and GOP support to the veteran councilman. Bernardi and Hall are  Democrats, as are most of the district's voters. But Republican support could  be critical in a close race.  </P> <P> Bernardi and Hall have been aggressively courting another also-ran -- Irene  Tovar, a Latino activist who has strong roots in the district's increasingly  Latino community. Tovar, a former head of the Hispanic Caucus of the state  Democratic Party, finished fourth in the field of eight candidates with 10% of  the vote.  </P> <P> Those who hope to elect a Latino to the seat someday are urging Tovar to back  Bernardi because the councilman probably would vacate the office sooner than  would the 49-year-old Hall.  </P> <P> Dib, who met privately with Bernardi and Hall last week, said he chose the  councilman because Bernardi has "love, feeling and care for our community." He  said Bernardi has been working to reduce crime and to control growth in the  district since he inherited much of the area in the 1986 council redistricting.  </P> <P> "In all my years working in this community, I have never seen Lyle Hall in our  community," Dib said. "Just looking into his eyes. . . . They just look cold  and icy.  </P> <P> "I must endorse the one who I believe will do the most for our community," Dib  added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Disappointed' By Endorsement  </P> <P> When told about Dib's reading of his eyes, Hall laughed.  </P> <P> 'I'm disappointed," the challenger said of Dib's endorsement of Bernardi. "But  while it is disappointing on a personal level, the bottom line is that 60% of  the people voted against the incumbent."  </P> <P> Bernardi said he has not committed to support any of the also-rans should they  run for the seat in 1993. Dib said he will not be a candidate in 1993.  </P> <P> Bernardi, meanwhile, criticized Hall for failing to identify the employers and  occupations of many of his contributors in his last campaign fund-raising  report.  </P> <P> City elections officials have asked the Hall campaign to provide the additional  information. Hall said contributors have been slow in providing the  information, but he is making every effort to obtain it.  </P></p>

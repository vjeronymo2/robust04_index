The government of President Soglo  yesterday announced that it was offering a huge financial reward  in exchange for information leading to the recovery of military  weapons stolen from an Army base near the main city, Cotonou.  From there, our reporter Karim Okanla takes up the story.    [Begin recording] In an interview broadcast on the national  radio, the minister of defense, Mr. Desire Vieyra, said that the  government was offering a 2.5-million-CFA-franc reward to anyone  who will provide information on last week's theft of weapons  from the military base in Ouidah, located about 40 km north of  Cotonou. Seven rocket launchers, assault rifles, and a large  quantity of ammunition went missing from the base, and so far  security forces have failed to track down the thieves.    The minister of defense says that a special phone line is  being made available at the Ministry of Interior so as to allow  people to call in. This is an unusual situation and it requires  a special solution, the minister of defense added. Mr. Vieyra  also disclosed that a French military delegation is expected in  Cotonou today to discuss security matters.    For four years now, the Soglo government has had to cope  with  apparently unsurmountable security problems. Weapons have been  stolen several times from different ammunition depots across the  country, and according to Mr. Florentin Feliho, a former  minister of defense, the Soglo government lacks the authority to  enforce the law. Reliable reports also indicate that there is  growing discontent within the Army ranks since the reshuffle of  the military hierarchy last year. Now (?groups) like the  military here are about to undergo a major reform program. [end  recording]</p>

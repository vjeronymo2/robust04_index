			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Slovakia's new  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said on Wednesday [16 March] that  stabilizing macroeconomic as well as microeconomic indicators  was the chief task of the finance ministry.    Speaking to reporters shortly after being appointed to the  post, Filkus said no miracles could be expected of the new  government.    "Slovakia must reach a market economy as quickly as  possible," he said and added "we must stop indulging in reveries  about the existence of some third way (of economic development)".    Filkus said it would be necessary to de-politicize the  privatization process which, he said, had become a tool for the  political concentration of power. The law on large  privatization ought therefore to be amended, he said.    Referring to the state budget deficit, Filkus said that  budget revenues had considerable reserves in the form of unpaid  taxes, duties and in the area of financial control.    Filkus said he expected soon "to visit all necessary  ministers and friends in the Czech government".</p>

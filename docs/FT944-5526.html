			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Walesa rebuffed on taxes The Polish parliament yesterday overrode President Lech Walesa's veto and refused to cut next year's tax rates. The president, who is running for re-election at the end of next year, argued that the original tax rates of 20, 30 and 40 per cent should be restored in 1995 as they were pushed up to 21, 33 and 45 per cent this year as a temporary measure. The tax cut would have cost the government 12,000bn zlotys in budget revenues next year and widened the planned 87,800bn zlotys deficit - 3.3 per cent of GDP - already agreed with the International Monetary Fund.</p>

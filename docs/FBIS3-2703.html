They have turned to insurance.    By the end of 1993 retirement insurance schemes had spread  throughout the province, with over 1.85 million people paying  premiums totalling 900 million yuan.    So far, nearly 75,000 rural residents are drawing old-age  pensions worth 30 yuan to 250 yuan a month.    The insurance categories have been greatly expanded since  the  provincial insurance company started to offer services for the  elderly in 1985.    Now people can take out insurance policies for injury, crop  failure and illness.    Zhejiang farmers' income is on the top list in the country's  rural areas. Their annual income averaged 1,746 yuan at the end  of last year.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Smith concedes point on voting MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday confirmed that he is prepared to accept individual trade union members continuing to have a say in the election of future party leaders. However, in spite of a fresh attack from Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB union, Mr Smith refused to back down on the central point of his confrontation with union leaders - that Labour parliamentary candidates should be selected on the principle of one member one vote. Mr Smith rebuffed suggestions that his concession on the election of the leader and deputy leader amounted to a climbdown. He said on BBC television: 'It is not a case of giving way on anything, it is a case of finding the best system for doing it.' Labour party officials also played down the importance of Mr Smith's comments, saying any Labour leadership contest was a long way off. But by agreeing to union members voting for the party leader Mr Smith risked encouraging union leaders to believe he would also make concessions on the selection of parliamentary candidates. With his stand against the unions regarded in the Labour movement as an increasingly important test of leadership credentials, Mr Smith argued that the dispute over candidate selection was different because union members would be 'part of a team' in a local constituency association. Labour's national executive will decide next Monday on proposals to reform the party's links with unions which will be presented to the Labour conference in the autumn. On Wednesday the party's union links committee will consider the results of consultation on the planned reforms. To the irritation of the Labour leader's aides, Mr Edmonds said that Mr Smith was taking bad advice from members of the shadow cabinet and complained about 'patronising' letters sent to constituency parties by senior Labour MPs about the future of the block vote.</p>

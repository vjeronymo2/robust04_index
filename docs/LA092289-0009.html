			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. RIVER FREEWAY  </P> <P> In response to "Riverbed Freeway Proposal Receives Qualified Backing," Metro,  Sept. 9:  </P> <P> The Los Angeles River is neither an oasis of beauty nor an extended corridor  connecting our diverse city, but it could be. We have plenty of freeways, but  precious few rivers.  </P> <P> An optimistic vision of our future includes reduced dependency on personal  automobile transportation, not further freeway construction.  </P> <P> A portion of our valuable imported water gives the river a year-round flow of  relatively clean effluent as it cascades from Sierra snow to aqueduct, to lawn  sprinklers, car washes and gutter runoff. Why let this evaporate in an  elongated concrete flash pan? Portions of the riverbed should be broken up and  planted in willows or other flood-tolerant plants. This would create a series  of ponds which would foster wildlife, and recharge the subterranean water  table. In addition, this would create a green corridor for people, bicycles and  surface-routed metro trains.  </P> <P> MARTIN K. GELBARD  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Technology: Buildings that take quakes in their stride - Despite the scenes of destruction, Los Angeles could have fared much worse Considering the forces involved, the density of population and the large number of buildings in the area, Monday's earthquake in Los Angeles could have been a lot more devastating. This will not comfort those who lost loved ones or their homes or who were seriously injured, but the death toll would have been much higher if more buildings and structures had collapsed. Richard Hough, who runs a 60-strong office for British consulting engineers Ove Arup in Los Angeles, says: 'My first impression is that the city's buildings came through it pretty well.' There is serious concern at the collapse of some freeway bridges and elevated motorway sections which would have been disastrous if this had occurred during rush-hour. The damage has caused serious disruption to the city's traffic but is still small compared with the size of the city's total road network. Ove Arup compares Monday's quake with a similar-sized one at Spitak in Armenia in 1988 which killed 25,000 people and left a greater tide of damage in its wake. The US west coast has some of the most stringent building regulations in the world outside Japan which suffers from an even more unstable geology. International construction techniques to combat the severe stresses unleashed by quakes have improved significantly during the last 25 years as computers have allowed engineers to master the complex mathematics needed to calculate how a building will respond to violent ground movements. Demand to improve building standards in California rose sharply after a hospital collapsed during the 1971 San Fernando quake which killed 65 people, says Edmund Booth, a senior seismic engineer at Ove Arup. Structures must be pliable as well as strong, he says. If they are 'too stiff' they will be unable to flex with the movement of the ground, and collapse. Designers, he says, must be careful that the natural frequency of a building does not closely match that of possible ground movements. This could cause the structure 'to hum like a tuning fork' and shake itself to bits. This occurred during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake where an essentially harmless earth movement was amplified by the soft soils of the dried-up lake bed on which the city stands. This had a devasting effect on buildings of 12 to 20 storeys, says Booth. The horizontal forces produced by quakes are substantial, yet buildings are designed mainly to withstand vertical forces from the weight of floors, furniture, people, office and industrial equipment they contain. An office block in London, for example, might be designed to withstand a horizontal force of of just 1 1/2 per cent of its vertical load to combat high winds. In Los Angeles, this ratio might rise to 10-15 per cent and by as much as 20-30 per cent in Tokyo. A multi-storey building in Los Angeles carrying a vertical load of 25,000 tonnes, therefore, might be designed to withstand a horizontal force of 2,500 tonnes, which is quite a punch, says Ove Arup. Typically, the cross section of a column supporting the frame of a Californian office block would be up to 50 per cent larger than that of a building in a stable seismic area. Reinforcement for columns also would be several times stronger. Joints connecting upright columns and horizontal beams need to be strong to prevent shearing, and sufficiently flexible to allow the building frame to respond to ground movement. A large number of deaths in the Armenian quake were caused by floors breaking free from the frame and collapsing one on top of the other like a pack of cards. More recently, buildings have been mounted on bearings such as large rubber pads designed to 'detune the structure from some of the underlying earthquake movement'. Ove Arup estimates that about 10 buildings and a similar number of bridges have been built this way in Los Angeles. 'It will be interesting to see how these have performed compared with other designs,' it says. More recently, Japanese engineers have incorporated computer-controlled hydraulic jacks which are used to brace buildings but can also allow the frame to move depending upon the scale and frequency of the ground movement. Designers also have to take into account the effect of building movement on cladding and internal fittings. It is not enough to keep the building standing and floors intact if large amounts of decorative cladding and glass break free, killing and maiming crowds in the streets below. Large pieces of equipment and furniture need to be fastened so that they do not topple over and hurt staff. A telephone exchange at Erzincan in Turkey, which wasthought to be fully prepared for a quake, suffered in 1992 when batteries stored to provide emergency power spilt sulphuric acid on the floor. 'The primary objective,' says Booth, 'is that a structure should be designed so that its occupants can safely leave it even if some damage has occurred.' Tragically this does not always happen.</p>

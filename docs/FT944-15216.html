			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: US banks battle to maintain pace The headline on a recent report from Paine-Webber banking analyst Mr Lawrence Cohn said it all: 'This is about as good as it gets.' With bad-debt charges lower than at any time for years and lending margins still only slightly below their cyclical peaks, US commercial banks' profits are surging. But the concern for share prices in the sector is that it is difficult to see how the momentum can be maintained. Each of the three biggest New York-based banks - Citicorp, Chemical and Chase Manhattan - comfortably exceeded market expectations with third-quarter earnings reported yesterday. While Citicorp's 22 per cent return on capital in the period made it the star of the pack, both Chemical and Chase beat earnings per share forecasts by more than 15 per cent. Among other banks reporting yesterday, net earnings at Wells Fargo jumped 32 per cent on a sharply lower provisions for bad debts, while BancOne's earnings fell due to its sensitivity to rising US interest rates. Chemical's revenues were unchanged from a year before, at Dollars 2.16bn, while operating costs were 4.5 per cent higher (excluding a one-off charge in the 1993 quarter). However, profits were buoyed by a fall in the loan-loss provision to Dollars 100m in the current quarter from Dollars 298m a year ago. The bank's net interest margin, meanwhile, fell by five basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) to 3.68 per cent. The decline was was held in check by a shift in the mix of loans from a year earlier: US commercial lending fell to Dollars 30.2bn from Dollars 34.7bn, while consumer lending, where margins are generally higher, rose to Dollars 26.5bn from Dollars 24bn. Net income was lower than a year before, when profits had been boosted by a tax credit. Leaving aside this factor, after-tax income rose 24 per cent over the year-ago quarter. Chase Manhattan also benefited from a lower loan-loss provision, which fell from Dollars 215m in the 1993 period to Dollars 100m. Total revenues remained steady at Dollars 1.64bn, while operating costs rose 4 per cent. The net interest margin, meanwhile, slipped 18 basis points from a year ago, to 3.81 per cent. Mr William Maletz, head of investor relations, said the decline reflected the growth of lower-yielding, liquid trading account assets held by the bank. The pressure on margins in part reflects growing competition in the credit card and residential mortgage businesses. Chase said it expected margins on these products to increase next year, as it launches new credit card products to compete with the growing array of non-bank co-branded cards in the US market and as the residential mortgage business recovers from this year's low level of refinancing activity. While total loans remained steady with a year before, consumer lending increased by Dollars 4.4bn to Dollars 37.4bn, commercial lending fell Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 20.5bn and the bank's real estate portfolio fell Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 1.2bn. Wells Fargo's earnings were supported by a Dollars 36m gain from changes made to its portfolio of premises. Otherwise, total revenues were largely unchanged. Loan-loss provision fell to Dollars 50m, from Dollars 120m in the third quarter of 1993. While loans grew 4 per cent, the net interest margin fell 12 basis points, to 5.53 per cent. BancOne, meanwhile, saw after-tax earnings fall by 14 per cent, in part the result of the interest-rate management policy it adopted before the turn in US rates this year. The bank had already reported a Dollars 13m loss from the sale of Dollars 2bn of US government bonds during the quarter. Mr John McCoy, chairman, said yesterday: 'We remain committed to reduce (our) exposure to rising interest rates.' The earlier interest-rate policy was part of the reason behind the fall in the bank's net interest margin, from 6.11 a year ago to 5.27 per cent in the latest period. The bank blamed this fall in the margin on higher interest rates and 'increased competition in loan pricing'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    US BANKS - THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Net income          EPS                                1994       1993    1994    1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Citicorp                        894        528    1.67    0.97 Chemical*                       439        502    1.60    1.84 Chase Manhattan                 305        267    1.49    1.25 Wells Fargo                     217        165    3.86    2.74 BancOne                         283        296    0.68    0.73 Mellon**                         78        139    0.64    1.25  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Chemical: net income Dollars 355m and earnings per share Dollars 1.26 a year ago, excluding one-off tax benefit and merger-related charge.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Mellon: excluding expenses related to takeover of Dreyfus; net income would have been Dollars 167m and earnings per share Dollars 1.53 in the latest period.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

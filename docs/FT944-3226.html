			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Coats' carpets disposal Coats Viyella, Britain's largest textiles company, yesterday cleared the way for an expansion of its thread, clothing and fashion retailing businesses by agreeing to sell its carpets division to Shaw Industries of the US, one of the world's largest carpet manufacturers. The move is expected to be followed shortly by the disposal of its yarns and fabrics business, enabling the group to devote more resources to its core activities. Mr Neville Bain, chief executive, said the group had been hoping to sell the carpets business for some time but Shaw had only emerged as a bidder in the past three weeks. 'This deal will give us more focus and enable us to invest more in both established and emerging textile markets,' he said. For Shaw, which last year reported after-tax profits of Dollars 129.2m (Pounds 78.7m) on sales of Dollars 2.63bn, the acquisition brings with it four yarn spinning mills and two tufted carpet plants. It declined, however, to disclose the size of the cash offer for the Coats' business, which made profits of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 58.8m in the six months to June 30 1994.</p>

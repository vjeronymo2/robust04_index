			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'LES MISERABLES' RAGS TRASHED  </P> <P> cast of "Les Miserables" got caught with its pants down when costumes from one  scene in the musical were accidentally thrown in the trash.  </P> <P> The costumes were placed in plastic trash bags Sunday to be taken to the  cleaners.  </P> <P> But an employee of the Benedum Center for Performing Arts, where the touring  show of the Broadway musical is being performed, mistakenly added those bags to  the theater's garbage, and all of it was taken to the dump on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Actors wear raggedy outfits typical of clothing worn by street rebels of the  French Revolution. The wardrobe director, Jerry Wolf, confirmed Wednesday that  the costumes -- worth about $50,000 -- were discarded inadvertently.  </P> <P> The show went on as scheduled without the costumes, and replacement clothing  has been sent from New York.  </P></p>

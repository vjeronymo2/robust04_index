			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Black diamond prize for director behind coal buy-out It looked like any other pile of coal to the uninitiated but Mr Brian Riddleston, British Coal's opencast director in Wales, thought differently. 'They are black diamonds,' he said, explaining that they were a naturally smokeless coal which, in the UK, is only found in Wales. 'This is what everyone wants to get their hands on at privatisation.' How right he has been proved in the year since he made his comments to visitors. The south Wales region of British Coal attracted more bidders  - eight - than any of the other four on offer. That makes Mr Riddleston's achievement in winning the government's backing as preferred bidder all the more notable. Assuming final negotiations are successful, Celtic Energy, the management buy-out company he has formed along with other executives, will have fended off competition from consortia including Mitsubishi, the Japanese conglomerate, Powell Duffryn, the engineering company, and RJB Mining, the coal company which is taking over all of British Coal's English mines. Neither Mr Riddleston nor the government will say how much Celtic bid but NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government, said it was the highest tender received. Other companies are thought to have offered at least Pounds 85m. The prize for Celtic is a region that produces some of the highest-quality coal in the UK and a contract to sell 1m tonnes a year to National Power, the electricity generator, until 1998. The eventual success of the bid will turn on how successful Celtic is in securing contracts after that. The opportunity for securing long-term contracts has been demonstrated recently by National Power signing a 10-year deal with Ryan Group, another south Wales coal company, to buy 1.5m tonnes a year. That deal was conditional on Ryan winning the south Wales bid. Celtic will not necessarily be able to pick up a similar contract, however. Ryan itself is stepping up production from its existing drift pits. There will also be competition from an employee buy-out team which is negotiating with the government to take over the Tower pit, the last deep mine in South Wales, closed earlier this year. Mr Riddleston will give no details of the contracts or the size of market he expects in Wales. But he has no doubts about making a success. 'This is a very well-researched bid,' he says. Mr Riddleston, 46, has worked for 24 years for British Coal, which he joined as a trainee after graduating in chemistry from Wadham College, Oxford. After spells in research and accounting, he joined the opencast division in 1982 and started his present job in 1988. Celtic's selection as preferred candidate this week was not greeted with universal joy by the people who work for him. Some of British Coal's employees say he is too remote from them and has yet to prove himself as a businessman. 'He can supervise getting the coal out of the ground,' said one. 'But, like the rest of us, he has not had to worry too much about finances.' But among senior British Coal executives Mr Riddleston is given some of the credit for the doubling of production from the regions' opencast operations to about 3m tonnes in the period he has headed it. One executive said: 'With opencast mining the key to success is not so much getting the coal out of the ground but developing new sites. He has established good relations with local authorities and kept the environmental lobby at bay. He deserves his success.'</p>

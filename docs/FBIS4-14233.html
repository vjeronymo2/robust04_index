			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman, has received Arthur Hughes, the  U.S. ambassador to our country. They discussed various issues  of interest to bilateral relations. They also discussed  developments in the situation in our country in light of the  regrettable events at the 'Imran camp.    The brother chairman expressed profound regret and sorrow  for  the chaste Yemeni blood spilled as result of the reckless  practices of some irresponsible elements. He said these  practices aim to implement hostile designs to push the situation  toward a military explosion, to circumvent the pledge and accord  document, and to drive the people and their Armed Forces into  the furnace of bloody fighting in order to destroy unity. He  stressed there is no alternative to unity, democracy, security,  and stability, no matter what the price. He expressed  appreciation for the U.S. friends' interest in our country's  security and stability and for their support for unity and  democracy.    The brother chairman of the Presidential Council also  received French Ambassador (Marcel Levin). They reviewed  bilateral relations and the efforts being exerted to contain the  crisis in light of the regrettable military developments and  incidents in 'Imran yesterday.    The brother chairman stressed his eagerness to contain the  situation and thwart all designs to stir up sedition and  infighting among the children of the same homeland. He said  dialogue and resorting to reason and wisdom are the only way to  tackle all issues and problems. He expressed appreciation for  France's efforts to support our country and its unity and  democratization.</p>

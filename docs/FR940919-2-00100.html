			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Treating Source Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SSA will give primary emphasis to obtaining medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information from treating sources that provides brief, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific, diagnostic information regarding an individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medically determinable impairments and the functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of those impairments. Treating source statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will include diagnostic information about a claimant's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairments, the clinical and laboratory findings which provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis for the diagnosis, onset and duration, response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment, and the functional limitations that can reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> linked to the clinical and laboratory findings. Depending on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature and extent of an individual's impairments and treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources, statements from multiple medical sources may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Once the standardized measurement criteria described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier are widely available, a standardized functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment available from a treating source will be accepted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probative evidence. Treating sources or another examining source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may perform the standardized functional assessment at SSA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Standardized Request Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SSA will develop a standardized form which effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tailors a request for evidence to the specific diagnostic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional assessment information necessary to make a disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision. Such information includes but is not limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic information about a claimant's impairments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clinical and laboratory findings which provide the basis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnosis, onset and duration, response to treatment, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional limitations that can reasonably be linked to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clinical and laboratory findings. Treating sources will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraged to submit such information electronically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardizing requests for evidence in this manner will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate the participation of claimants, representatives and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third parties in the evidence collection process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The form will permit treating sources to provide necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic and functional assessment information in summary form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a single document. In appropriate circumstances, SSA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accept a treating source's statements on the standardized form as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to history and diagnosis, the clinical and laboratory findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provide the basis for the diagnosis, onset and duration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to treatment, and the functional limitations that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably be linked to the clinical and laboratory findings,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without resorting to the traditional, wholesale procurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual medical records. In completing standardized forms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating sources will certify that they have in their possession  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the medical documentation referred to in the statement and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> said documentation will be promptly submitted at the request of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA. The certification approach does not relieve treating sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from providing objective evidence in support of their diagnoses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and opinions; rather it is designed to streamline the collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of necessary evidence. The approach is also consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence collection methods used by private disability insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers, which request specific medical records in individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims, when necessary and appropriate to the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, or at random as part of a quality assurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treating source completion of the standardized forms will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored to prevent fraud. Decisionmakers will verify treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source statements by obtaining underlying medical records when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. The automated claim processing system will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate effective monitoring of the evidence submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices of individual treating sources by permitting random  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or targeted selection of claim files involving that treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source for quality assurance and program integrity reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Treating Source Incentives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As in the current process, SSA will pay for the reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of providing existing medical evidence. SSA will acknowledge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of treating source information by establishing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national fee reimbursement schedule for medical evidence. The fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement schedule will utilize a sliding-scale mechanism to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reward the early submission of medical information; additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sliding scale will be adjusted to reflect the quality of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence received. A national, sliding-scale fee schedule will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide incentives for treating sources to cooperate in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidentiary development process and invest quality time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide medical certifications on behalf of their patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will provide resources to focus professional educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts and medical relations outreach at the local and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional level to ensure that treating sources are given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up-to-date information on program requirements and made aware of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific evidentiary needs or problems as they arise in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudication process. SSA will conduct educational outreach on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the national level on an ongoing basis with the medical community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide a better understanding of the SSA disability programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the medical and functional requirements for eligibility, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> best ways to provide medical information needed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Consultative Examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> If a claimant has no treating source, or a treating source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary evidence, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is conflict in the evidence that can not be resolved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through evidence from treating sources, the decisionmaker will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refer the claimant for an appropriate consultative examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the standardized measurement criteria for assessing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function will be widely available, consulting sources will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to perform functional assessments that, in the absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate treating source information or where there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unresolved conflicts in the evidence, will be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probative evidence. Depending on the service area, SSA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider contracting with large health care providers to furnish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultative examinations for a specified geographic location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of an ongoing training and medical relations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, SSA will ensure that providers of consultative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations are provided adequate training on disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Those medical providers who conduct consultative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations for SSA will also need ongoing training regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the disability program. SSA will prepare training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs for this audience which will utilize written, audiotape,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> videotape, and computerized training methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative Appeals Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Simple, Accessible Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> To eliminate the public perception that multiple, mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal steps are obstacles to receiving timely, fair, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate decisions, SSA will reduce the number of mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals steps in the administrative process. Streamlining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals process will not only promote more timely decisions but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also ensure that claimants do not inappropriately withdraw from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim process based on a perception that it is too difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or time-consuming to pursue their appeal rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

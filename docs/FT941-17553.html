			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Japanese business in plea on economy Business organisations in Japan yesterday called for financial reforms to ensure the long-term health of the economy, while a survey of executives found most expected economic recovery late this year or early next year. The Japan Association of Corporate Executives called for more competition among financial institutions, echoing the Bank of Japan's advice that stronger commercial banks should be prepared to break from the policy of walking in line with weaker institutions. Business leaders have complained that the lack of distinction between strong and weak banks means companies lack choice in raising finance and industry standards are set by the weaker institutions. Meanwhile, the Federation of Economic Organisations said stability in the financial system would be a necessary part of an economic recovery. The federation was reflecting widespread concern about the mounting bad loans of commercial banks, which helped to fuel the speculative property bubble of the late 1980s. A survey of executives at 100 leading companies found 61 expected recovery late this year, while 22 others were looking for an upturn early next year. Just over half the respondents to the survey by Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, expected economic growth of between zero and 1 per cent in the financial year beginning in April, though 13 predicted that there would be no growth.</p>

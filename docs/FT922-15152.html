			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Lamont optimism on recovery finds glimmer of support MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, said yesterday Britain's economic recovery may be under way. He was rewarded by tentative evidence of improved business conditions from parts of industry. Mr Lamont said on the BBC's Today programme: 'It may be that when the statistics are compiled that we will see that recovery has already started.' Hours later his claim gained some support from a survey of UK purchasing managers and signs of greater optimism in the lighting industry. A report from 3i, the venture capital group, and Cranfield School of Management said smaller UK businesses were more hopeful than their continental counterparts that profits would improve this year. The Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported that its purchasing managers' index rose to 54.1 per cent last month from 50.8 per cent in February and 48.1 per cent in December last year. It said that suggested 'significant economic growth is under way in the manufacturing economy'. The Lighting Industry Federation, which represents companies with total annual turnover of Pounds 650m and 17,000 employees, said its latest monthly trends inquiry pointed to a recovery in orders since January with nearly half the companies polled expecting to increase output in the next four months. Neither of these indicators has a known track record, however, although one economist said they might be 'straws in the wind'. The purchasing managers' survey, which is based on techniques developed in the US, started in July last year. The latest Treasury survey of independent economic forecasts, published yesterday, found that the average expectation of growth this year fell to 1 per cent in March from 1.2 per cent in February. Meanwhile, a bleak analysis of economic developments from Mr Peter Warburton, the monetarist chief economist of Robert Fleming Securities, warned that there is little chance of growth without a fall in interest rates and a devaluation of sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Malaysia's top brokers post improved turnovers RASHID HUSSAIN and TA Enterprise, Malaysia's two largest stockbrokers, have posted higher turnovers, but their operating profit margins narrowed, reflecting substantial increases in interest payments. The higher turnovers partly reflected acquisitions - in banking and property by Rashid Hussain and in insurance by TA Enterprise - following a government-imposed capital restructuring of brokerages in the past two years. TA Enterprise reported a 28 per cent rise in turnover to MDollars 96m for the year to October, from MDollars 75m a year earlier. Pre-tax operating profits rose 6 per cent to MDollars 42.5m (USDollars 15.6m), after interest payments soared 221 per cent to MDollars 13.3m. Net profits slipped marginally to MDollars 25.6m or 21.3 cents a share compared with 21.5 cents. Rashid Hussain recorded a 33 per cent rise in turnover to MDollars 56m for the six months to November, from MDollars 42m a year earlier. Operating profits rose 5 per cent to MDollars 22.1m. Net profits rose 40 per cent to MDollars 17.5m, or 10.4 cents a share, from MDollars 12.5m or 7.4 cents.</p>

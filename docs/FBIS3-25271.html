Several thousand Liberians are said to be  heading toward the port of Buchanan in the Grand Bassa County,  trying to escape skirmishes between Charles Taylor's NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the organization  calling itself the Liberian Peace Council. These skirmishes  between the NPFL and the Liberian Peace Council have reportedly  been going on for nearly three months in southeastern Liberia.  This is in the midst of the stalled peace process and the  continued ineffectiveness of the Transitional Council. From  Monrovia, Nii Anartey Allison telexed this report.    Cecil Gillaume, a medical coordinator of the French charity  Medecin Sans Frontieres at Compound No. 2 in eastern Grand Bassa  County, said the displaced were without food and safe drinking  water. She added: Many die each day from diarrhea, malaria,  and other diseases. She said that several thousand others were  trapped in riverside villages by landmines planted west of the  St. John River which crosses Grand Bassa County. Ms. Guillaume  added that it was difficult to reach them with any aid though  some of them are managing to arrive at Compound No. 2.    Several thousand others fleeing fighting in Liberia  Agricultural Company area have been trickling into Buchanan for  fear of imminent fighting two weeks after the Liberia Peace  Council overrun the area. More than 2,000 people have entered  the port city of Buchanan in the past week. The city is already  sheltering at least 10,000 displaced people. The refugees said  they had to leave behind them several dozen others, mostly the  sick and elderly as bullets whisked passed them. They said they  had seen bullet-riddled bodies littering the bushes during their  escape to Buchanan. People are very frightened, and one man  told me that, on seeing an unused bullet near to his tent, he  shouted, bullet, bullet, and other refugees rushed to the scene  and used a shovel to dispose of it.    Another refugee described the situation in the rebels'  enclave as appalling and added that the two rebel sides were  subjecting the people to harassment, flogging, and forced  conscription. He added: Anyone who speaks good English or looks  clean is a target. I was afraid to fight back because they  would kill me, another panic- stricken refugee said, explaining  how NPFL rebels had taken away his 13-year-old son. A local aid  agency, Medical Emergency Relief Cooperative International, or  MERCI, has posted emergency mobile teams at all seven refugee  entry points to deal with the influx of refugees into Buchanan.  We are now treating per day two to 300 cases of diarrhea,  malnutrition, and bullet wounds. This was told to me by Dr.  Mohamed Sylla, head of MERCI's Buchanan operations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mihail Mihailescu: "The Dukedom of Bessarabia"] </F>   [Text] Ruining the favorable moment for the country's  reunification -- something that could even mean losing  Bessarabia for good -- is subtly and indirectly blamed by the  government on the empire in the east that desires restoration  and that cannot be stopped by the West. Indeed, Russia has  economic and strategic interests in Bessarabia and certainly  wants to preserve its former assets in spheres of influence.  Similarly, the West does not have a clear idea of the identity  of Bessarabia as Romanian soil. The West knows that Russia has  to be protected to avoid a large-scale explosion. These things,  however, are not the explanation for the fact that nothing has  come of our country's reintegration.    It was simply the stubbornness of Snegur [Moldovan  president]  and that of the communist oligarchy to preserve their  privileges, or to be more than they were after the collapse of  the Soviet empire. In 1991, under Snegur's leadership,  Bessarabia proclaimed its independence and called itself the  Republic of Moldova. The Romanian Government acclaimed it.  Since the situation was not yet clear, Mircea Snegur was talking  about the development, over a short period, of the Republic of  Moldova, after which the problem would be posed of returning to  the mother country, "as would be normal."    Snegur and the others began their game. First, one by one,  they rid themselves of the patriotic intellectuals, who demand  unification. Then they accepted assistance from Romania on the  grounds of a brother in despair, only to turn to the Russians,  from where they get their fuel. In this way they are able to  maintain a minimum standard of living, which, however, offers a  certain stability and the possibility not to begin the reform  process.    It never crossed their mind to open the border with Romania.  All this time, Bessarabia is conducting fierce propaganda for  the independence of the great republic. The war in the Dniester  region was a break during which it consolidated its popularity  -- there is someone who earnestly concerns himself with the  country during hard times. In actual fact, however, Snegur lost  the Dniester region.    Then came the climax -- the 27 February elections and 6  March  referendum. Snegur gathered around himself all former communist  nomenklatura members. He turned definitively toward Russia,  promising that he would stay in its sphere of influence. He  lashes out at Romania because it is the only one that can take  away his power -- by annexing Bessarabia. In Mircea Snegur's  view, the Romanians and Bessarabians are not only not the same  people, but not even brothers. And soon the Romanian language  will probably be prohibited in Bessarabia.    All this was possible with the help of a good friend from  Romania -- President Ion Iliescu. Both have studied in  Muscovite schools. The similarity in the way Snegur and Iliescu  developed is striking. Iliescu organized a referendum and the  Constitution was adopted -- Romania became a semi-presidential  republic. Through the elections in 1992, Iliescu has a  parliament, which he controls. Snegur has a puppet parliament  and, through the referendum on independence, he became the great  communist duke of the Dukedom of Bessarabia. Iliescu tramples on  the fallen heroes of December 1989. Snegur tramples on the  heroes fallen in the Dniester war. Iliescu loses Bessarabia,  Snegur loses Dniester. Both are sending out signals of love to  Moscow.    Terrible times are in store for Bessarabia -- it is much  easier to install an absolute dictatorship in a small dukedom.  And, as long as the Iliescu bloc is in power, not much can be  done for Bessarabia. History can no longer be falsified -- the  monarchy brought Bessarabia back to the country, the Iliescu  bloc lost it.    And a question -- if Romania were to claim Bessarabia, would  Snegur call the Russians and would he shoot at the Romanians?</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Technology (Software At Work): Insurance taken against lost calls - Sun Alliance strengthened its relationship with brokers through E-Mail The insurance business may be conservative, even perceived as boring, but it is highly competitive. It has to be - 1990 was the worst year this century for insurers. Information technology has become a weapon with which to outwit the opposition and defeat the in-house enemy of administrative cost. This message is at the forefront of Sun Alliance International's (SAI) readiness to discuss its use of electronic mail. It is guarded about details  -arising from a belief that its electronic mail project gives it a strong edge over competitors in building relationships with its brokers. Cost studies made it clear that something had to be done to control the increasing expense of conducting insurance business, for both insurers and brokers. Most commercial insurance is supplied through insurance brokers, such as Sedgwicks, which channels business through local offices to SAI's 10 regional offices. The traditional method of placing business is based on paper form-filling. Typically, a broker will approach a number of insurance companies with the details of a piece of business, then send the details to a selected few. It can take a minimum of a week, and as long as two weeks to gather the replies and progress the business. SAI's aim was to speed up the process to make doing business with the company more attractive for brokers. 'Our use of IT in the relationship with key customers is part of business development partnerships,' explains Alan Waring, electronic marketing manager. After 12 years in various parts of the Sun Alliance group, Waring joined the marketing and sales department in January 1990, specifically to speed the development of the E-Mail project. Its aims had been defined by a steering group on electronic marketing, a sort of senior management forum which derived its 'business' view of the international company from Peter Webster, corporate services manager, and its IT view from Sun Alliance Management Services. Verimation's Memo electronic mail product had been introduced at SAI in 1987. Initially used for internal messaging, its use had spread throughout the information systems division, and thereafter to the rest of the group. 'Telephone tag curses most people's working day,' comments Waring. 'The joy of using electronic mail is that you are not restricted to office hours, nor limited to the secretary's hours.' He gives an example of one SAI manager who answered an E-Mail message at 1.30 in the morning - from the US. 'I wasn't here at the time but the response was waiting for me in the morning.' There were very few rules about how to implement electronic mail at the time that SAI decided to use it to develop closer links with its brokers. But there was a keen awareness of the potential of electronic data interchange, electronic mail, and networking in the industry at large. Much of the initiative came from the brokers themselves. So, after detailed discussions with brokers, SAI was quick to pick up on the potential of 'screen forms' for its marketing project, and agreed to try out the idea with a couple of big customers. The Verimation Memo forms facility allows each broker to adapt a basic screen format to his own design. The advantage of screen-filling rather than form-filling is speed. According to Waring, it gives the brokers the opportunity to bulk-process routine tasks, such as claims notification, without the usual phone call or posting of forms. 'Using E-Mail, they can easily send in all the claims notifications for that day.' At the time of the prototype project, there was a variety of applications on offer from competitors, all aimed at solving the same problem of the increasing cost of handling business. SAI's initial efforts were primarily directed at small premium, high-volume business, controlled by the large brokers who were trying to streamline their operations. Waring's discussions soon broadened to include a bigger section of customers. A steering committee of 10 people, a mixture of business and senior IT managers, laid down the philosophy and plans of the wider project, and defined that the responsibility for the E-Mail project belonged firmly in marketing. E-Mail was one of a number of applications considered to make dealings more cost-efficient. The benefits of free-format E-Mail - whereby people send one another notes - are obvious. Such messages are free of postal and typing delays, more reliable, and legible, than fax, and have the facility of making a paper copy, or even 'archiving' for records. Used properly, E-Mail can result in a reduction of telephone and postal charges. With the pre-formatted facilities, the benefits are similar, but there are further time-savings. The technique of filling-in-the-blanks in pre-formatted screens saves time in typing, and makes sure that nothing essential gets missed when filling in details. No one was interested in throwing away technology already in place. Initially SAI put its own 3,270 terminals into the brokers' offices. But, as Waring points out, the last thing brokers want is banks of terminals in their offices. There are three big software packages in the commercial insurance marketplace - MCS, Misys and Policymaster. They run on Digital VMS, Unix, Xenix and Aix respectively. SAI identified its target hardware hosts, and negotiated with the software houses supplying the main packages to make their systems 'interoperable' with Verimation Memo. These third-party relationships were important in achieving a smooth and relatively swift programme to spread the usage of E-mail. It made implementation much easier and cheaper, also more attractive to the brokers, but implementation costs and the solving of communications difficulties have represented a large proportion of the costs. The tailored screens, closely aligned to the paper, make the changeover less traumatic for staff. A broker can now send details, particularly of complex risks, to a dedicated person at SAI. The 'human factor' - one of the aspects of the project about which some users had reservations - is still critical in getting a swift response. 'There was no way we wanted to take the personal relationships out of the way we do business,' says Waring. He admits there was fear that IT would detract from the relationships built up over years, 'but what we've found is that the way we've delivered the systems, personal relationships actually strengthen'. Access to mainframe records at SAI was another incentive to the brokers. Some, with their own E-Mail systems, have linked the Verimation system to Wang Office, Office Vision, Mail Exchange and other proprietary systems. Now there is a strong dialogue between SAI and its brokers, reviewing ideas, and continuing education and awareness. For competitive reasons, comments from the brokers have to be kept anonymous, but their enthusiasm has grown as the paperwork has shrunk. Typical are: 'A failsafe method of communication . . . extremely easy and quick to use . . . saves time . . . saves money on telephone and postal charges' and 'you can avoid a protracted phone call with a short message . . . involve a chain of people with one message at the same time.' Waring stresses that the decision-making was all made from a business angle. He could draw on the expertise of IT people, but it was up to him to decide on the business problems and discuss the possible solutions. The result of this step-by-step approach was that E-Mail quickly became an integral part of the business operations for SAI's business partners. 'There was wide interest in the customer base once there was a recognition that it wasn't a here-today, gone-tomorrow feature of the industry, but here to stay and develop. It's a matter of IT support for business relationships, part of making SAI a more attractive partner,' he says. The series will continue on the Technology page in April. The Quarterly Review of Software at Work will appear on March 19. BUZZWORDS E-Mail, the common abbreviation for electronic mail, is a software product usually run on networked PCs or mainframe systems, where the user can communicate with anyone on the system though defined groups and often on pre-formatted screen layouts. Interoperability denotes the integration of information from disparate systems. Unlike open systems, it entails exhanging data structures between incompatible operating environments.</p>

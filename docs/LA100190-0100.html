			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> MACY'S MAY NEED THE HELP OF KRIS KRINGLE  </P> <P> If you're a master merchant trying to sell goods that are a little tattered,  what do you do? Just what Edward Finkelstein, the master merchant who runs R.  H. Macy &amp; Co., is trying to do.  </P> <P> You mark the merchandise up sharply, act as if you're selling the crown jewels,  then wait for buyers to break down the door. Maybe even lower the ridiculously  high price a bit to make a buyer happy. Only Finkelstein isn't peddling  sweaters or upscale kitchen utensils. Instead, he's selling Macy's itself.  </P> <P> Macy's, you see, could really use some new capital to help pay down some of the  debt it incurred when it went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986 and when it  bought part of Federated Department Stores in 1988.  </P> <P> Macy's asking price -- $15 million for each 1%, which values the company's  stock at $1.5 billion -- is such a joke that it's amazing that the company can  quote it with a straight face. That's five times the value placed on Macy's  three months ago by Michael Price, one of its directors, who has a legal  obligation to value the stock fairly.  </P> <P> If Finkelstein can pull off this sale at his price, he will be enshrined in the  Merchants Hall of Fame. If he can't, Macy's will continue to limp along  financially -- if things go well. If things go badly -- if, say, this year's  Christmas selling season is as bad as last year's -- look out below.  </P> <P> What happens to Macy's is important. It's one of the world's leading retailers,  whose properties besides the flagship chain include the Bullock's and I. Magnin  department stores and the Aeropostale, Charter Club and Fantasies by Morgan  Taylor specialty chains. If Macy's goes under, it will make an already gloomy  retail climate even gloomier.  </P> <P> Selling new shares, as Macy's hopes to do, would reduce the percentage of the  company held by current stockholders but would greatly increase the value (if  any) of their shares. The $285 million that Finkelstein is asking for a 19%  stake in Macy's would give the company enough money to buy up about $700  million of its junk bonds, which are trading at far below face value. Getting  rid of those bonds would cut Macy's interest payments enough to give the  company breathing room.  </P> <P> The junk bond market, though, is acting as if Macy's is a goner. The bonds  trade at prices that are usually seen only for securities of companies that  have a good chance of going bankrupt and reneging on their debts. For instance,  Macy's senior bonds were trading at about 52% of face value late last week. The  junior bonds traded for less than 25% of their adjusted face value. And that  was before the chaotic pounding they took Friday.  </P> <P> If you bought the senior bonds at Thursday's price, and they continue to pay  interest and Macy's actually pays them off when they mature, you would make a  hefty 31% a year on your money. Or, as the bond boys say, you would get a 31%  yield to maturity. The intermediate bonds were trading at an astronomical 42%  yield to maturity and the junior bonds a loan-sharkish 84% yield. By contrast,  a U.S. Treasury bond yields about 9% and an AT&amp;T bond about 10%.  </P> <P> Even Macy's bank debt, which ranks ahead of the bonds when it comes to getting  paid, is distressed. Loan Pricing Corp., a New York-based financial news and  data company, says Macy's bank debt would fetch less than 85% of face value if  buyers could be found and would have a yield to maturity "in the 20s."  </P> <P> Even though the junk bond market is more than a tad irrational these days, as  Myron (Mike) Ullman III, Macy's chief financial officer, points out, these  prices are scary. Very scary. The kind usually seen when a company is about to  renege on its debts -- which Ullman insists is not the case.  </P> <P> If the bond prices are even remotely rational, Macy's stock -- for which  investors paid $300 million when the company went private in 1986 -- is worth  little or nothing. Closer to nothing.  </P> <P> So how can Macy's say that its stock is worth $1.5 billion -- five times the  1986 price? Ullman says that's based on today's value of the cash that Macy's  will generate in the future. The only problem, of course, is that no one knows  how Macy's will fare this Christmas, let alone how it will do years from now.  </P> <P> If you take the $1.5 billion seriously, I've got a bridge to sell you.  </P> <P> Ullman says the $1.5-billion valuation is shared by a sophisticated buyer,  Corporate Properties Inc., which paid $15 million for a 1% stake in August. CPI  happens to be one of Macy's landlords. I don't know what CPI was up to -- CPI  won't talk -- but I'll bet it had more to do with enhancing a relationship with  Macy's than with looking for the best use for $15 million. When Macy's bonds  are yielding up to 84% and have a far better claim on the company's assets than  the stock does, the bonds are a far more rational investment than the stock.  </P> <P> Macy's stock doesn't trade, so there is no price quote on it. But the  aforementioned Michael Price manages mutual funds -- the best known of which is  Mutual Shares -- that own Macy's Acquiring Corp. stock. Price has a legal  obligation to make his best estimate of Macy's value, because investors in his  funds buy stock at the funds' net asset value and redeem at net asset value. To  be fair to everyone, he has to value the funds' assets as accurately as  possible.  </P> <P> Guess what? Price has been marking down his Macy's stock. Sharply. He's dropped  it from three times his cost, as of June 30, 1989, to a mere one time his cost  as of June 30, 1990. In other words, Price values Macy's stock at its original  $300 million.  </P> <P> Why is Price's June 30 valuation just one-fifth of Macy's number? Has he marked  the stock down lower now than it was on June 30? Ask him. He wouldn't take my  call.  </P> <P> Price is only one of a number of sophisticated investors -- GE Capital Corp.,  Laurence Tisch's Loews Corp., Michigan shopping center mogul A. Alfred Taubman  are among the others -- that invested in the Macy's LBO. The idea was to have  merchant Finkelstein run the show, with more than 300 Macy's employees getting  a chance to buy into the company.  </P> <P> But there was just too much debt. The But there was just too much debt. The  company isn't doing badly; it's just not doing well enough to climb out of the  hole that it dug itself into. If Finkelstein can get his $285 million, things  will probably be OK. If he doesn't get it, Macy's may need another "Miracle on  34th Street."  </P></p>

Ministry officials said the two countries agreed at  bilateral  talks held in Tokyo that Air Canada will operate four Boeing 747  flights weekly between Canada and the new airport.    Air Canada thus follows Canadian Airlines International,  which already serves routes between Japan and Canada.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A venture into white - Appetisers Drinking at a first-growth chateau can be a mite limited - all that dry red. No wonder then that more of Bordeaux's superstars are venturing into white wine territory. Pavillon Blanc de Chateau Margaux was followed by Ch Mouton-Rothschild's Aile d'Argent dry white (the second vintage, 1992, much less oaky than the first) and now Mouton announces a close working relationship with the Sauternes property Ch Coutet. Not to be outdone, Ch Latour has launched its own dry white, Blanc de Pauillac 1992, yours for Pounds 300 a dozen from Farr Vintners of London SW1 (071-828-1960). Those who cook at Pauillac's smartest addresses should be thrilled by the chance to experiment with dishes that go with something other than claret. Jancis Robinson                            *       *      * An historical success story from South Africa was the famous Constantia wine which was loved by just about everyone before the vineyards were wiped out by phylloxera at the end of the 19th century. For the best part of a century the secrets of Constantia were lost, but in 1980 Klein Constantia replanted Muscadel vines with the intention of recreating the famous wine. The first new vintage was made in 1986. The current, 1989, is therefore the fourth. You might be put off by the pseudo-18th century 500ml bottles, but the wine inside is superb; a rather delicate brew considering its 15 or so degrees with a lasting orange and peach flavour. Klein Constantia's 'vin de Constance' is available from Averys of Bristol (tel: 0272-214141). The price is Pounds 10.66 a bottle, Pounds 126.20 a case. Giles MacDonogh                            *       *      * For top quality Sauvignon Blanc, an obvious - if apparently expensive - candidate is Mulderbosch Sauvignon Blanc from South Africa. At Pounds 86 a case from John Armit Wines of London W11 (071-727-6846) it is first-class wine: full-bodied, serious, and intriguingly - but certainly not offensively  -aromatic. Perfectly agreeable is the Hungarian Sauvignon Blanc 1993 that is Pounds 2.99 at Safeway. That same year has produced other fine Hungarian Sauvignons. Gyongyos Estate enjoys wide distribution in the chains for around Pounds 3.49 and this is the best vintage to date. Marks &amp; Spencer has another lively example at Pounds 3.49 under the defiantly non-ethnic Deer Valley label. JR                            *       *      * Good news for diners from four of London's top hotels. The Causerie at Claridge's has introduced a two-course dinner menu for Pounds 12 per person, including VAT. A main course can be taken from the Smorgasbord or the hot dish of the day and followed by pudding or cheese. For reservations phone 071-629-8860. At The Dorchester there is a new menu in the Grill Room. A three-course set lunch costs Pounds 23.50 including coffee, service and VAT and, as usual, chef Willi Elsener will be concentrating on British food. From May 1, The Terrace will be serving a Pounds 38 dine and dance package on Friday and Saturday nights. Ring 071-629-8888. The Ritz, too, is offering Friday and Saturday night dinner and dancing, to big band sounds of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, from Pounds 33 a head. It is also introducing a light lunch menu at the Palm Court. Prices start at Pounds 12 per person and a glass of wine will be included in the lunch price. Tel: 071-493-2687. The Connaught is opening its Grill Room for dinner only on Saturdays and Sundays. In addition to the a la carte menu a table d'hote will be served at Pounds 35 a head plus 15 per cent service but including VAT. Tel: 071-466-7070. Jill James                            *       *      * More than 1,000 corkscrews from a single owner are to be auctioned at Christie's South Kensington, London, on May 10 at 2pm. Collected over 30 years by Gianni Gachin, who died last year, the collection traces the history of the corkscrew from the mid-18th century to the present day. Oldest in the collection is a mid-18th century pocket folding corkscrew with a seal bearing an effigy of Queen Anne. The first English corkscrew ever patented, in 1795, designed by a London clergyman called Samuel Henshall, is expected to fetch between Pounds 400 and Pounds 600. Viewing starts on May 3 at 9am. Tel: 071-321-3120/3121/3122 or fax: 071-581-3679. JJ</p>

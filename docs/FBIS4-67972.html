			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has  persistently tried to attract competent Russian rocket engineers  since 1990, with more than 20 Russian scientists having made  their way to the Stalinist country via China to work in  Pyongyang, a vernacular Russian newspaper reported Friday.    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (Communist Youth's Truth) said it  believed some scientists were assisting Pyongyang's nuclear  development by computer mail from home since the Russian  Government has barred them from traveling to North Korea, adding  that controlling the scientists was impossible at present.    North Korea signed a contract with the defunct Soviet Union  in August 1990 to import 200 rocket experts, but it was  nullified with Seoul and Moscow's normalization of diplomatic  ties and Seoul's promise of a loan, it reported.    Anatoly Rubtsov, a Russian solid state physicist and now a  member of North Korea's Science Academy, told the paper that  Pyongyang approached him at a Beijing seminar in April 1991  after its original plan failed.    After accepting Pyongyang's offer, he bribed the Russian  Foreign Ministry with U.S. dollars and obtained 200 blank  passports. He was paid by the North Korean Embassy in Moscow.    Rubtosov said he was able to lure 36 Russian engineers, many  of them experts in the rocket field. They told security  officers they ``wanted to use their knowledge anywhere  regardless of politics'' when they and their families were  detained at Moscow's Sheremetievo Airport in October 1992 while  trying to get to Pyongyang.    A reliable document shows that despite the government ban,  more than 20 Russian scientists have made their way to North  Korea via China, the paper said. Living under pseudonyms, they  are reportedly paid 3,000-4,000 dollars per month. But some,  preferring not to take the risk, instead provide information by  computer mail from their homes in Russia, the paper said.</p>

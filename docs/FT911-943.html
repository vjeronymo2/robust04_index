			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Benefits sought from Canadian rail link AIR CANADA and Canadian Pacific are studying how they could both benefit from a proposed USDollars 6bn high-speed rail system between Quebec City and Montreal and Toronto-Windsor. They are jointly exploring business and leisure travel patterns that would emerge in the so-called Quebec City-Windsor corridor, where nearly half of Canada's 26m population lives. The Montreal-Toronto air route is the only profitable domestic run in current conditions, and Air Canada has more than half the traffic. Canadian Pacific, through its CP Rail freight subsidiary, owns one of the two rights-of-way in the corridor. Some of its track might be used for the high-speed system, and although it has long moved out of long-distance passenger services, it manages commuter rail systems in Toronto and Montreal. The CDollars 500,000 study is aimed at identifying business opportunities for both companies if and when the high-speed link is built. 'We specialise in high-speed transportation,' said Mr Claude Taylor, Air Canada chairman. 'We have a sophisticated computerised reservations system and well-developed routes and connections. Our frequent flier programme is a strong marketing tool.' Air Canada believes connector services for the high-speed rail system could be provided jointly with CP, using Toronto and Montreal, the country's two largest cities, as hubs. Bombardier and GEC-Alsthom are proposing to use an adapted French high speed train for the corridor and Asea Brown Boveri wants to use Swedish or German equipment. However, opponents argue that population density in the corridor is still insufficient to make a high-speed rail link economic.</p>

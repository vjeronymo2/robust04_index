			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / France counts cost of peace THE cost to France of deploying some 10,000 soldiers in the service of the United Nations and of other emergency military missions abroad will rise from FFr3.2bn (Pounds 400m) last year to FFr4bn this year, Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister, forecast yesterday. Clearly regarding as a dubious privilege France's provision of more troops to the UN than any other country, Mr Joxe told the newspaper Les Echos that he had asked the government to bear the cost of bonuses for soldiers serving overseas out of its general budget. Otherwise, the defence equipment budget would suffer, he warned. Pay bonuses account for two-thirds of special military operations abroad, the minister said. Conscripts, for instance, who volunteer to serve in Yugoslavia receive FFr5,000 a month, or 10 times their normal stipend at home. The Socialists strongly oppose the phasing out of conscription, proposed by some leading members of the RPR Gaullists who are expected to form part of the new government after next month's election. The army general staff yesterday published a study claiming that the French army of 250,000 men was not only 'no worse equipped' than Britain's purely professional force of 130,000, but 20 per cent cheaper. Meanwhile, Mr Joxe has said more arms sales like last month's deal to supply the United Arab Emirates with Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.46bn) worth of tanks could be in the offing. He cited Oman as a potential buyer.</p>

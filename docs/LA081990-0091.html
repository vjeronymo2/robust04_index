			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ICE CHEST POLICE?  </P> <P> This is what you advocated with your editorial on the alcohol ban at La Jolla  Shores beach. ("Need for Drinking Ban Is Sign of Times," June 10.)  </P> <P> Do you really want the authorities checking the contents of people's coolers?  Is this the kind of society you want to live in?  </P> <P> You can't legislate away every social ill. Neither can you sanitize the beach  of all obnoxious people.  </P> <P> I can enjoy the beach without a beer. Probably you can, too. So can the people  pushing the alcohol ban. We all have nice back yards and patio furniture.  </P> <P> We are the people that the City Council responds to. The public domain is being  tailored for us.  </P> <P> And the schlemiels who live in apartment buildings? Let them drink beer on the  steps.  </P> <P> BRAE CANLEN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

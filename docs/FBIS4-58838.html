			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "official spokesman" at the Ministry of </F> Defense and the General Staff Command; date not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] Supported by God the almighty, and our dignified  Yemeni people's cohesion with their leadership and Armed Forces,  and with the heroism of the brave and faithful men in the Armed  and Security Forces, the daily and decisive successes of the  free popular will are continuing to defend unity and democracy  and safeguard the Republic of Yemen by confronting the forces of  apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party. Fierce  battles are going on in the governorates of Lahij and Aden,  close to the economic capital. At the same time, heroic  resistance is taking place against the aggression on land, by  sea, and in the air in the Abyan Governorate, where the Armed  Forces secured absolute control the day before yesterday.    In the Aden Governorate, the al-'Amaliqah Brigade and the 2d  Armored Brigade, along with the 2d al-Sa'iqah Brigade and the  56th Brigade, are continuing their advance and confronting the  remnants of the forces of the secessionist, rebellious gangs  entrenched in the east and north of the governorate, engaging  them capably and bravely, positively absorbing all attacks and  wearing out the aggression forces.    The 2d Armored Brigade also managed to storm the defenses of  the first and second lines of the forces deployed in the  al-Dali' District, held by the forces of apostasy and secession,  and seized large quantities of their weapons and military  equipment, which were [word indistinct] by the secessionist  forces that held sway in the Yemeni Socialist Party in secret  depots and hideouts in this district to guard against their  implementing their aggressive goals and their special designs.  A large number of the forces that were positioned in that  district joined the forces of Yemeni unity and constitutional  legitimacy. A substantial amount of the ammunition and combat  equipment was also destroyed. The land-based anti- aircraft  guns managed to down an aircraft of the secessionist gang in the  al-Dali' district this morning.    In the meantime, the Air Force of Yemeni unity and  constitutional legitimacy continues its attacks on the dens of  apostasy and secession, completing its combat missions and [word  instinct] the secessionist gang with complete collapse. Our  aircraft returned safely to base, having accomplished their set  missions. The fighters of the units stationed in the southern  sector succeeded in storming the defenses of the first line of  the [name indistinct] Brigade, that was misguided by the  mutinous secessionist gang, inflicting on it heavy losses. The  heroes of the brigades of al- Wahdah, the infantry, the  artillery, and the armory executed the missions to which they  had been entrusted with efficiency and high combat ability in  the [name indistinct] district.    The source described as baseless the reports propagated by  the false separatist media and certain radio stations that Sanaa  was the target of air raids this morning, adding that the  objective of the statements and reports of the separatist  rebellious gang on this and other nonexistent battles waged by  units that were destroyed, units that surrendered, and units  that joined the legitimacy and announced their loyalty to this  legitimacy is to obscure the facts. These units are today  receiving instructions from the higher political and military  leadership represented by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and  supreme commander of the Armed Forces.    All the lies of the forces of apostasy and secession are  aimed at deluding external public opinion into believing that  they still exist in order to repeat their falsehood and lies,  which are rejected by the facts on the ground and by the  victories [words indistinct] the epic of great victory for  unity, democracy, and entrenching constitutional legitimacy.  There is also the victory of wellbeing and justice in the  battle of life in which every citizen is participating with his  heart, mind, and solidarity. For the officers and  noncommissioned officers, this battle is greater than all else  because it is the battle of the sacred defense of life,  principles, doctrine, and the gains of homeland and people. In  this battle, they are confronting all challenges of conspiracy,  death, and fragmentation that the despotic elements of apostasy  are [word indistinct] until they were defeated, or will be  defeated soon.    What affirms their frustration and failure is the fact that  -- thanks to God's care -- all the [name of missiles indistinct]  and Scud missiles, which these criminal forces fired last  Thursday [5 May] on [words indistinct] vital and strategic  facilities, failed (?to reach their targets) or to inflict any  losses in the areas in which they fell. Some of them were even  damaged in the air.    We reiterate the appeal to the brother officers,  noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in the military units  under the control of the separatist clique to wake up and to  free themselves from the dictatorship of the dominating elements  in the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] to save their lives, because  they will not be above the law or stronger than the anger of the  people against their enemies [words indistinct] the enemies of  unity, freedom, and democracy, because our valiant Armed Forces,  which offered severe sacrifices, are determined to destroy all  dens of treason and separatists one after another. Success  comes from God.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you  will aid the cause of God, he will aid you and plant your feet  firmly.</p>

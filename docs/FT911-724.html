			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Radio City agrees to Pounds 10.6m bid from Emap EMAP, the magazine and newspaper publisher, is buying Radio City (Sound of Merseyside), the USM-quoted commercial radio company, for about Pounds 10.6m. Radio City's A shares leapt from 285p to 377p yesterday on the recommended cash bid of 385p per share, or an all-share offer equivalent to 395p. For the 400,000 non-voting ordinary shares, the cash offer is 460p. This will be the first whole radio station that Emap has bought, although the group, which has a market value of Pounds 311m, has stakes in London's Kiss FM, East Anglia Radio and Trans World Communications, which includes Piccadilly Radio in Manchester. Mr Tim Schoonmaker, Emap's managing director of radio, said that deregulation had increased the number of stations and that radio's share of UK advertising revenue was set to grow substantially from about 2.4 per cent last year. Outside the East Anglia/east Midlands area, where the group had local newspapers, there were few restrictions on its entry into the commercial radio field. It was also likely to apply for the new radio licence for York. However, it was losing its keenness to bid for the first national independent radio station because of the restrictions set on the type of music that could be broadcast. Its early plans for a rock or easy listening music station had been thwarted by the 'non-pop' stipulations. The 385p offer is 18 times Radio City's earnings per share in the year to September 1990 when it was already being affected by the national advertising recession. The launch costs of City Talk, on an AM frequency, drained the company of cash. The station has now been converted into a 'gold' rock and pop music format. The paper offer for the A shares is 345 for 200; for the ordinary shares, it is 206 for 100. Emap's closing price was 229p. Radio City was the first commercial radio station to come to the market. It floated at 77p in 1982 and the share price has fluctuated between 18p early in 1986 and 577p in September 1989. Since January this year it has recovered from 165p, helped by bid speculation. Emap is also part of a consortium bidding for the Anglia television franchise.</p>

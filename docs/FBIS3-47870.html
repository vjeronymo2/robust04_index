			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of 18 January, the Communications Industry  Association of Japan [CIAJ] (with Tadashi Sekizawa, president of  Fujitsu Ltd., as chairman) submitted to the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications written statements concerning the Japan-U.S.  framework trade talks. In the statements, the CIAJ -- which is  made up of communications equipment manufacturers and other  related businesses -- requested the Japanese Government reject  U.S. demands for setting numerical targets. The industry trade  group also strongly requested that Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone (NTT) Corporation be exempt from trade agreements.    The statements were submitted together with supplementary  data which included actual import-export figures between Japan  and the United States for telecommunications equipment as well  as the current situation regarding procurement of communications  equipment by the governments of both nations. Among requests  listed in the statements were: 1) that Japan and the United  States conduct trade talks on a two-way basis; 2) that objective  criteria which could become numerical targets should be  eliminated in the talks; 3) that trade agreements should be made  in the spirit of the GATT accords on government procurement; and  4) that NTT be exempt from trade agreements.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Tracking of vehicle failures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Compliance with the liability thresholds will be determined on a model year/engine family basis (i.e., I/M test results will be segregated by engine family and model year). EPA proposes to segregate tracking by model year to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M test results of more recent model year vehicles within a given engine family from diluting the test results of earlier model year vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While EPA will receive actual I/M 240 emission results from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the performers of enhanced I/M testing, only pass or fail results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be tallied against the 5 and 10 percent thresholds. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle will enter the tracking system when it receives its first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced I/M test. As long as it passes that and any subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced I/M test, it will be considered a ``pass'' vehicle. Once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it fails any of the three HC related tests (i.e., the enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use I/M standard for exhaust HC or the pressure or purge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests), it will be considered an HC failure. Once it fails the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use I/M NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard, it will be considered a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure. If a failure occurred while the vehicle is within its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first half life (e.g., for a LDV, 5.0 years old and 50,001 miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or less), the failure will be included in the failure tally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against both the 5 percent half-life and the 10 percent full-life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thresholds. If the failure occurred while the vehicle is within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its second half life (e.g., for a LDV, more than 5.0 years old  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 50,000 miles but no more than 10.0 years old and 100,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> miles), the failure will only be included in the failure tally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the 10 percent full-life threshold. The failure rate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each model year/engine family combination will consist of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of vehicles failing the enhanced in-use I/M HC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards divided by the number of vehicles which have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested in an enhanced I/M program. The I/M test results would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cease to be counted after individual vehicles exceeded an age of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 years or 100,000 miles (120,000 miles for MDVs), respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, if 2.0 percent of an engine family's vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (from a single model year) fail the enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a given pollutant over its first two years (i.e., a biennial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program) and an additional 2.0 percent (i.e., different vehicles)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail over the next two years, the failure rate after 4 years is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.0 percent. Comments are requested on the use of only pass/fail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and the calculation procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once a specific model year/engine family combination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded a liability threshold, EPA proposes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer become liable for the selective recall and repair of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles not only from that model year, but for the repair of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles which are part of that engine family. While this could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly increase the potential liability faced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, it will more equitably protect the consumer by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating all vehicles with essentially the same emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design (and thus, performance) the same. EPA requests comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this approach, as well as the option whereby manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were only held liable for the repairs of vehicles from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific model year which caused the exceedance of the enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use I/M liability threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If exceedance of the liability threshold appears likely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical failure modes could be determined and efficient repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods developed. A manufacturer could even go so far as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take preventative action (e.g., a voluntary recall) to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of I/M failures (and the triggering of the liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold) and avoid the negative publicity or market response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may otherwise result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also proposes to exclude the I/M test results of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles if they have been obviously abused or tampered. (More  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion on what might constitute obvious abuse or tampering is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in Section A.(3) above addressing enhanced in-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance recall requirements.) EPA proposes to limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of such abuse or tampering for the purpose of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced in-use I/M program to a missing catalyst or evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canister. Tampering can be discouraged by the vehicle's design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and performance. While EPA is aware that manufacturers cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent all forms of less obvious tampering problems, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wants to create incentives for manufacturers to design vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as tamper-resistant as is reasonable. EPA requests comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appropriate inclusion of specific determinations of obvious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse and tampering which would be practical by I/M test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel in an enhanced I/M test, while maintaining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity and purpose of the enhanced in-use I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Repair responsibility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   Under conventional enhanced I/M, individual vehicle owners are responsible for repairs based on failures of either the enhanced I/M 240 cutpoints and the pressure/purge functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests. Motorists are required to spend a maximum of $450 on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repairs within a biennial test cycle related to the emission test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure before being eligible for a waiver of the requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / International Press Review:  David v Goliath over new trade HQ - WTO If the volume of press coverage were the deciding factor, Geneva would be the victor in the struggle with Bonn to host the new World Trade Organisation. A final decision on the site for the WTO headquarters is due to be made by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade tomorrow. The Geneva press, stridently vaunting the city's case, is portraying Switzerland as a penurious David battling valiantly against the superior political and economic might of the German Goliath. The Journal de Geneve last week quoted accusations by Swiss officials of unfair German tactics, including rumoured promises of extra banana and coffee imports in return for votes. Sniffily decrying such a brazen appeal to economic self-interest, the Swiss press argued that this bodes ill for the independence of a Bonn-based WTO. 'You don't choose the headquarters of an international organisation like you would the venue for the Olympic Games.' Most people could be forgiven for being fooled. To tempt the WTO, both Bonn and Geneva have put up multi-million-dollar packages of office accommodation and diplomatic privileges for the WTO, its 450-500 staff and the associated diplomatic missions. But, while Bonn has allegedly wooed with trade promises, Switzerland has appealed to the heart. Its offer allows Moslem diplomats to register two wives (Islamic law permits up to four), the only ploy so far to arouse international press attention. The Germans refused to rise to the bait, preferring figures to frills. 'Diplomats with several wives will be particularly well-sited in Bonn where the cost of living is one-third less than in Geneva,' was the deadpan German response last week. It was also calculated to raise Swiss hackles. The cost of living in Geneva is no more than 10-15 per cent higher than in Bonn, say Swiss officials crossly, citing United Nations statistics in support. And if there were any further hesitation on cost grounds 'states should know that, in Geneva's services sector, the rate of absenteeism for qualified personnel is 35 per cent less than in Germany and productivity is 16 per cent higher,' according to the same Swiss officials reported by the Journal de Geneve. The German press has paid little attention to the duelling between the two cities. What little coverage there has been supported the government's view that an important trading nation such as Germany needed an international institution such as the WTO but otherwise focused almost entirely on what Geneva had to offer. Even Bonn's own newspaper, the General-Anzeiger, which has campaigned relentlessly to keep the federal government on the banks of the Rhine, could do no better than a worthy article comparing the two offers in terms of free parking spaces, available office accommodation and tax-free perks. The Swiss have taken more interest in the wider political backdrop. While Geneva has been assured of the support of France and other francophone countries, the position of the US is causing some concern. To push Washington in the right direction, the Tribune de Geneve reported, US citizens in Switzerland have written to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, to put Geneva's case. Evoking nearly 200 years of US-Swiss friendship, the letter reminds Mr Kantor of 1801 when a Swiss, Albert Balatin, became US treasury secretary and negotiated the purchase of Louisiana. If this does not impress him, there is the more recent role of President Woodrow Wilson in choosing Geneva for the headquarters of the pre-war League of Nations. Yet, having urged the Berne government to fight for the WTO, some Swiss newspapers are beginning to wonder whether it has been too generous. 'Are we on course to create a class apart of international organisations whose privileges are disproportionate to the costs involved,' asks Le Nouveau Quotidien, echoing the Zurich-based Neue Zurcher Zeitung a few days earlier. It says officials in the Swiss finance ministry are grinding their teeth at the VAT exemptions, duty-free booze and petrol, tax-free pensions and the like being offered to diplomats in Geneva, concessions which will apply to all UN organisations as well as to the WTO. The NQ quotes figures showing that the international organisations already cost the canton of Geneva SFr500m (Pounds 245m) a year. In return, however, the organisations spend SFr3bn a year, provide some 23,000 jobs (8 per cent of total employment in the city) and fill 40 per cent of hotel space. As for the little town on the Rhine, which is groping for a new identity after the federal government moves to Berlin, it is left with no concrete prospects if the WTO bid fails. 'Then we will have a new situation and have to take new decisions,' sagely remarks Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior civil servant in the economics ministry, which is leading Bonn's campaign.</p>

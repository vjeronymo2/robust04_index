			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART BEATS QUARTZ HILL, 23-20, ON LONG FIELD GOAL BY VILENSKY  </P> <P> With a strong wind at his back, Hart High's Brady Vilensky boomed a 45-yard  field goal with 1 minute 51 seconds remaining Friday night to propel the  Indians to a dramatic 23-20 nonleague win over Quartz Hill.  </P> <P> The kick completed a drive that started with 6:21 left and followed Quartz  Hill's touchdown and tying two-point conversion with 6:22 left.  </P> <P> In the drive, quarterback Ryan Connors completed three passes for 38 yards and  Hart (3-2) converted two key third-down plays. Finally, after a personal foul  on Hart moved the ball back from the 14 to the 29, Vilensky came through.  </P> <P> "Oh, man, you wouldn't believe (what I was thinking)," Vilensky said between  postgame hugs. "I had complete concentration on the ball. But when we were  moving it back, I was like, 'Hey, where are we going?' "  </P> <P> It didn't matter. His kick cleared the crossbar with plenty to spare and two  plays later Davis Delmatoff picked off Jake Haro's desperation pass to end the  game.  </P> <P> Connors completed 11 of 19 for 208 yards, with Brian Bernier catching six for  110 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> Hart took a 20-12 lead on Tucker Setterberg's three-yard run after a botched  Quartz Hill punt gave the Indians the ball at the Rebel 31-yard line. Quartz  Hill (3-2) answered with a Selves Smith one-yard scoring run and a two-point  pass from Haro to Jake Patterson.  </P> <P> Haro led Quartz Hill rushers with 60 yards.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the wind dictated the first-half scoring. Quartz Hill, with  the wind at its back for its initial drive, marched 58 yards in 10 plays, the  clincher being a 23-yard touchdown pass from Haro to David Nelson. Attila  Rethi's point-after attempt was blocked. The Hart offense, while waiting for  the second quarter to get the wind at its back, managed to churn out a  touchdown when Setterberg plunged from one yard in the first period.  </P></p>

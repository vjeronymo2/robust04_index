			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Wunsdorf May 23 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev arrived in Wunsdorf on Monday where he will visit  the headquarters of Russian Western troops which are being  withdrawn from Germany.    Commenting on the situation on the Crimean peninsula,  Grachev  told journalists that although hazardous developments in the  Crimea are Ukraine's internal affair, the situation on the  peninsula is extremely complex and the political turmoil is  becoming worse. At the same time, Grachev expressed the hope  that the developments in the Crimea will not turn into major and  serious conflicts.    In Wunsdorf, the Russian defence minister will meet  commanders of Russia Western troops and later in Berlin, will  have talks with representatives of the Deutsche Bank to discuss  financial aspects of the troops' withdrawal.    Grachev attaches great importance to his talks with German  financiers since this credit and financial organisation  successfully cooperates with Russia in terms of financing the  troops' withdrawal. According to Grachev, there are no problems  in this respect. Besides, he intends to discuss with German  bankers problems of the final stage of the troops pullout and  outline prospects for further cooperation, including in the  field of training Russian specialists who will work in  structures of the Armed Forces in line of the banking business.    On Tuesday, the Russian defence minister will fly to  Brussels. On Tuesday evening he expected to make a report to  NATO commanders and heads of defence departments of NATO  member-states, outlining basic principles of the Russian  military doctrine.    On May 25, Grachev will have a series of bilateral talks  with  NATO defence ministers, and in particular, with the U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry. Grachev will take part in a joint  session of defence ministers of NATO member-states to discuss  problems of ensuring European security and prospects for NATO's  cooperation with countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the  CIS in military and political fields. During the session  Grachev is expected to outline Russia's stance on the  Partnership for Peace Programme.    "Russia has thoroughly prepared for this session," Grachev  told journalists on Monday. He pointed out that Russia's  position on the matter had been fully approved by President  Boris Yeltsin and coordinated with the Russian Foreign Ministry.    On board the plane carrying Grachev to Brussels there will  be  defence ministers of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,  Belarus, Armenia and Georgia who had been given an opportunity  to fly to Brussels on board the Russian plane. During the  flight to Wunsdorf Grachev had no contacts with his CIS  counterparts and was reported to have been studying documents.  However, it is not ruled out that he will have such contacts in  Brussels.    Upon completion of the NATO part of the programme, Grachev  will begin an official two-day visit to Brussels on May 26  during which he will meet the Belgian defence minister and  familiarize himself with every-day life of Belgian servicemen.</p>

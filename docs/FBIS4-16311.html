			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [A. Yevgenyev "Commentary": "Fighting Monopolies: Act Two"] </F>   [Text] Someone has already made the following somewhat  sarcastic comment about the "State Program for the  Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of  Competition on the Russian Federation Markets": It will outlive  the people who produced it. I must admit that the cavalry  charge on Russian monopolies came to nothing. Attempts to put  the 2,000 enterprises which dominate the national market on a  separate register and change their economic behavior by means of  state regulation have not worked as expected. No one was  particularly frightened by the barrier in the form of  profitability threshold. Enterprises learned easily to bypass  it, generally by artificially inflating costs. It is time to  adjust tactics.    The main purpose of the program that has been formulated is  to change the actual monopolized structure of our market which  developed during the reign of the administrative edict system.  The Antimonopoly Committee alone is not up to the job. The  territories and sectors need to take part, and the legislative  base must be broadened. The new program makes provision for all  that. It does not duplicate but supplements the well-known Law  "On Competition and on Restricting Monopolist Activity on  Commodity Markets." The plan is to draft a whole package of  legislative acts that will promote the development of  competition in various spheres of economic life. And it is  proposed to start with the Law "On Monopolies."    As for so-called temporary monopolies, the intention is to  bring pressure to bear upon them -- not by restrictions or fines  (the well-known register ceased to exist 1 January) but by  creating a competitive environment, taking each individual case  on its merits. Sectors and territories formulating and  coordinating their demonopolization programs are to decide how  specifically this is to be done. If there is a metalworking  plant in an oblast, for instance, which meets the oblast's  needs, this does not mean that another one should immediately be  built in the neighborhood. It may be more advisable to convert  a former "secret institution" and create sound competition. But  representatives of sectors and regions must decide what is  better and more effective by coming face to face at a  "roundtable." An Interdepartmental Commission for Competition  Policy led by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets has been set up  to coordinate their interests.    There is another reason for such extensive representation,  Izabella Fomina, head of the State Committee for Anti-Monopoly  Policy and Support of the New Economic Structures Scientific and  Technical Administration, thinks. Imagine the Ministry of  Communications and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy examining a  plan for the demonopolization of their sectors, while their  customers sit alongside and are able to evaluate all this  because they deal with these highly monopolized departments'  prices every day.    Of course, you cannot tackle everything. That is why, along  with general targets and recommendations, the program highlights  the priorities -- transport (apart from railroad transport),  communications, machine building, and construction.</p>

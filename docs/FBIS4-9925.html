			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mario Contreras] </F>   [Text] For centuries there have been discussions over which  is a better learning method: Is it that which goes from the  general to the specific, that is, the deductive method; or that  which goes from the specific to the general, the inductive  method?    A few days ago a specific issue led to the discussion of a  very important subject for Chile: the definition of a national  defense policy.    During the academic meeting held last week at the University  of Chile Political Sciences Institute to discuss the possible  purchase of Mirage combat planes from Belgium, one of the  participants stated -- and the other agreed -- that Chile lacks  a defined national defense policy. He added that national  objectives have not been established and that this is essential  for a united community of interests that intends to stay united  in the future.    A nation state is organized on the basis of a human group  with homogeneous characteristics, having similar principles,  values, and believes that will be projected into the future.  Otherwise, there is no sense in having a true contract between  the state and citizens with reciprocal duties and rights.  Moreover, a political community is established to achieve these  goals and to project them into the future.    One of the relevant issues on this subject is the  establishment of a national defense policy. It can be said that  the prevailing situation during the current times, the so-called  age of post-modernism, is different and that the possibilities  for armed conflicts have diminished. This may be so. In  addition, it also can be alleged that the world powers are  downsizing their armed forces. This is also true. Nevertheless,  everyone is aware that international ties are measured by  influence of power and in no other way. Moreover, only a few  developed countries have implemented a downsizing of their armed  forces.    Chile, which holds a privileged position in Latin American  because of its economic process, has emerged with a flourishing  economy and a stable political system. In general, this  situation is usually accompanied by a well-structured dissuasive  policy. To do this, it is necessary to start at the basic  level, that is, to establish national objectives and on this  basis design an overall national defense policy.    This issue, which was raised again last week at the  University of Chile Political Sciences Institute, is a cause of  concern for current defense officials.</p>

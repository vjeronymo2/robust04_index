			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / A boost in EC spending 'The EC Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, issued an impassioned plea to the Twelve yesterday to accept his plan for a boost in EC spending over the next five years, (AP-DJ) reports from Luxembourg. Mr Delors addressed EC foreign ministers for half an hour, trying to persuade them his package was essential for the goals of political union. Wealthier nations, notably Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands, feel Mr Delors' proposed budget increase is too large, while the poorer member states generally approve of the plan. The proposed budget calls for a more than 50 per cent increase in aid to the four poorest EC countries, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKENDS: SLOW, STEADY KOONTZ IS SUDDENLY ON TOP  </P> <P> Now that he's made it to the top of the nation's premiere best seller list,  Dean R. Koontz can think about retiring his reputation for being "the  least-known best-selling author in America."  </P> <P> On Sunday Koontz's new novel, "Midnight," soared to the No. 1 spot on the New  York Times best seller list. The mainstream thriller had entered the list only  the week before -- and that was based on just 3 days of sales.  </P> <P> "We were astonished," said Koontz, 43, who lives with his wife, Gerda, in the  hills east of Orange. "I've been jumping up and down so much my ankle joints  are beginning to give out, but it's a lot of fun."  </P> <P> "Midnight" has also hit the No. 1 spots on the Los Angeles Times and  Publisher's Weekly best seller lists and, according to Koontz, just about every  other list in the country. The highest position Koontz had ever reached on the  New York Times list came in 1988 when his thriller "Lightning" rose to No. 6.  </P> <P> Koontz said his phone hasn't stopped ringing since Sunday's New York Times hit  the streets.  </P> <P> "It seems like I've heard from everyone I ever worked with in publishing all  these years," said Koontz, who began publishing in 1969. "When someone has been  around a long time and makes it to this degree, it seems to please people in  the industry because current wisdom is that you have to make it quick and fast  with a lot of hype. Making it slow by writing better books and improving your  skills over a lot of years is an old-fashioned approach and it gives editors  who love books the feeling that the book itself actually matters, not just the  hype."  </P> <P> As has been his policy in the past, Koontz said he has been avoiding doing  publicity for "Midnight."  </P> <P> "I told Putnam I couldn't do anything for this book because I'm desperately  trying to finish the next one. I have no time for it," he said.  </P> <P> In fact, despite his best seller status since 1981, the author of "Whispers"  and "Strangers" has never done an author tour and has largely avoided the  national media, particularly television, to promote his books.  </P> <P> "No. 1, I'm always working on something else, and that's more exciting to me  than going out and pitching books," he said, adding that he'd also like to  retain as much anonymity as possible. A writer, he said, "is an observer, and  if you're aware of other people watching you, it's harder to watch them."  </P> <P> The best-selling "master of menace" is, after all, one low-key kind of guy.  </P> <P> The day he and Gerda heard "Midnight" had gone to top of the New York Times  best seller list, Koontz decided to celebrate by doing something  "self-indulgent" and going out for a celebratory dinner afterward.  </P> <P> "All I ended up buying was a sport coat," he said with a laugh. "And we went  out and had salad for dinner. We're going to have to work real hard on being  self-indulgent and celebrating."  </P> <P> Mystery Writer: Elizabeth George of Huntington Beach said she was thrilled to  learn last week that her 1988 British detective novel, "A Great Deliverance,"  has been nominated by Mystery Writers of America for its "best first novel"  award. The novel, published by Bantam Books, was among five books nominated  nationally. The winner will be announced at an awards dinner in New York on May  11.  </P> <P> Opera Star: Dame Joan Sutherland will sign copies of her record albums at  Rizzoli's Book Store in South Coast Plaza from 2 to 3 p.m. Sunday. Sutherland,  who is appearing in Opera Pacific's production of "Norma" at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, will be accompanied by her husband, maestro Richard  Bonynge.  </P> <P> Readers Theater: Steve Mellow's Readers' Theater will be presented at 3 p.m.  Sunday at the Elan Gallery in Laguna Beach, 1145 S. Coast Highway. In the  spirit of the opening of a new one-man exhibition by French satirist Francis  Meyrier, the readings will be from French and English satirical writings.  </P> <P> Mellow's Readers' Theater also will be presented at 7:30 p.m. Friday at  Scribner Book Store in Crystal Court at South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. The  readings will be from modern story tellers: Jeffrey Archer, T.C. Boyle, Harlan  Ellison, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Barry Yourgrau. pichar  </P> <P> Humbug Witch: Lorna Balian, author of "Humbug Witch" and "Humbug Rabbit" will  sign copies of her books from 10 a.m. to noon Tuesday at the Children's  Bookshoppe, 1831 Westcliff Drive, Newport Beach.

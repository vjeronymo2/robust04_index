			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany moves to end gold VAT DEUTSCHE BANK'S vice-president of precious metals Mr Fritz Plass yesterday called for taxes to be lifted on gold in all major European Community countries, including the large British market, as Germany moved to scrap value added tax on the metal, reports Reuter. 'We want a level playing field and are not looking for any competitive advantage over London, we are seeking the London bullion market's support in negotiations with the EC,' he said. On Friday the Bundesrat is expected to pass a law freeing all gold bars, granules, legal tender coins, paper-gold and derivatives from VAT.</p>

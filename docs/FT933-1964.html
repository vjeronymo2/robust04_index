			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets had an erratic session in London as traders dealt on the back of an equally uncertain stock market, writes Terry Byland. Trading in the futures was divided between the locals, or independent traders, and the big trading houses, as they came to grips with the first full day led by the December dated contract on the FT-SE 100 Index; volume was on the low side at 7,404 contracts. Trading at its Fair Value premium of around 24 points, the December contract moved between an early low of 3,006 and the day's high of 3,34 before closing at 3025, an effective one point premium to the cash market. Traders professed themselves satisfied with the first day of trading in the December contract but agreed that the next three months could prove very difficult. Only one London trading house managed to arbitrage between cash and futures yesterday. For the rest of the UK based houses, it was a trading day rather than a day of excitements. Volume in traded options fell sharply to 19,504 contracts from Friday's 36,413. The FT-SE Index traded 7,803 against 16,548. Glaxo headed the list of individual stock contracts, trading 1,733 contracts as the underlying stock market resoponded to the group's legal victory in the US. The Euro FT-SE contract also attracted buyers, recording business of 12,442 contracts.</p>

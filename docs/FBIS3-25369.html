			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Libreville, 15 Feb (AFP) -- Father Paul Mba  Abessole, Gabon's main opposition leader, today called on his  followers to "refuse to pay" local taxes and "disobey all  government directives."    In a statement to the press, Father Mba Abessole, who placed  second in the 5 December presidential elections and contested  President Omar Bongo's reelection, also reaffirmed the  determination of his party, the National Lumberjacks Rally, not  "to participate in any other local or national election"  organized by the government, since the ballot paper has no value  at present in Gabon."    In this regard, the Lumberjacks leader sees yesterday's  announcement, that local elections slated for March 27 have been  postponed to 28 August, as a "retreat imposed" by the  government. Father Mba Abessole also invited opposition members  who have rallied round him in the Convention of the Forces of  Change "to reject any form of participation in a government of  national union or large consensus," which President Bongo has  called for several times since his reelection. Those who "join  such a government would by that very fact be excluded from our  ranks," he warned.</p>

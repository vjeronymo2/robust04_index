			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Gillette to post offer for Parker Pen GILLETTE, the Boston-based toiletries and shaving products group, will post its offer to acquire Parker Pen to shareholders of the UK company today, after a US federal judge denied the US Justice Department's request for a temporary restraining order. The Justice Department announced on Monday that it was filing an anti-trust suit, preventing Gillette from purchasing Parker Pen, on the grounds that the deal would have an anti-competitive effect on the market for premium fountain pens. However, in spite of yesterday's ruling that Gillette can go ahead with the posting of its Dollars 560m offer, a US court must still rule on the Justice Department's request for a preliminary injunction barring the deal. In the meantime, the US bidder - which is making its offer under UK takeover rules, which incorporate a strict timetable for bids - will be unable to buy shares in, or acquire control of, Parker Pen.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Jordan 'needs help to ease burden of debt' Jordan needs relief from its heavy foreign debt burden if it is to reach the kind of growth rates necessary to bring a real peace dividend to its population, the World Bank has warned in a new study of the impact of peace on the Jordanian economy. Jordan's economic reform programme could bring growth of up to 4 per cent a year, but the World Bank calculates the country needs to achieve a higher growth rate. 'To really make a difference to high unemployment rates, to really cement the peace, Jordan needs around 6 per cent growth per year,' says Mr Caio Koch-Weser, the World Bank's vice-president in charge of the Middle East and North Africa. That would require private investment rates of about 20 per cent of gross domestic product, the report says, a rate which will be impossible to achieve so long as Jordan is struggling under the burden of more than Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn) of foreign debt, roughly 1.5 times its GDP. 'For the man in the street, the question is what has peace done for me, and that is where you see the urgency of doing something about the debt to make the leap from 4 to 6 per cent growth,' Mr John Page, the World Bank's chief economist for the region, says. To reduce Jordan's debt burden to about 75 per cent of GDP by 1998, the World Bank calculates that about Dollars 1.7bn of debt reduction would be needed. Full debt forgiveness of about Dollars 3.3bn in 1994 would greatly improve Jordan's macroeconomic outlook and 'significantly enhance the prospects of strong popular support for the peace process,' the report says. The report warns that the economic impact of peace will probably be felt more slowly than many hope. Among the most important longer-term gains will be improved co-operation on water issues. Mr Koch-Weser warns that without action, all the countries of the region face water shortages in the next 15-20 years, but Jordan's water crisis is perhaps the most imminent.

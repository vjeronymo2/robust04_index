			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HAMMOND, IRVINE SUITOR AGREE ON STANDSTILL  </P> <P> The Hammond Co., trying since May to shake the advances of an unwanted suitor,  on Friday reached another temporary standstill agreement with a potential  buyer.  </P> <P> Hammond said Fidelity National Financial Inc. of Irvine has agreed not to  purchase any more of Hammond's stock for six months.  </P> <P> In return, Hammond will provide Fidelity with information about its business  and finances.  </P> <P> The information will enable Fidelity National, a real estate title insurance  company, to decide whether to make a formal offer for Hammond. Fidelity owns  23.6% of Hammond's common stock.  </P> <P> Hammond is one of a handful of publicly traded mortgage brokers in the nation.  Fidelity bought a 16.3% stake in the company in May and said then that it was  doing so for investment purposes only.  </P> <P> But in late September, after increasing its holdings to 23.6%, Fidelity filed a  statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which the company said  it was considering launching a tender offer for control of Hammond.  </P> <P> When Fidelity first started buying Hammond's stock, the shares were trading at  or below the company's June 30 book value of $4.49 and Fidelity officials said  they were only interested in acquiring stock if the price stayed at that level.  </P> <P> On Oct. 2, when Fidelity's SEC filing was made public, Hammond's stock price  jumped $1.50 a share to close the day at $5.88.  </P> <P> Since then, the stock has inched steadily upward, closing Friday at $7.50 a  share, an increase of 12 1/2 cents for the day.  </P> <P> Fidelity has entered four standstill agreements with Hammond since  mid-September, promising each time not to buy more of the company's shares for  a specified period.  </P></p>

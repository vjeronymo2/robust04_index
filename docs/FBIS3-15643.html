			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleh Olenyuk: "Candidates Are Assuming Their </F> Natural Role: Everybody Fights Everybody"]    [Text] The current electoral battles for the 23 seats  assigned for Lvov Oblast have revealed a rather sad trend --  parochial interests prevail over national ones. Attempts by  national democrats, whose standing in the region is higher than  that of other parties to form electoral blocs with their  opponents, have remained an unattainable dream in the oblast.  As a result of this, about 10 different parties have registered  for the elections, including communists and national socialists.  The motley candidate lists and democrats' tactics of creating  artificial competition within their own ranks, may produce  unexpected results and grant unwanted people participation in  the second round of elections. Although the probability of such  an outcome is quite problematic given the majority electoral  system, it cannot be disregarded.    Speaking of different political blocs' chances in the  current  electoral marathon, those of the Rukh and the New Wave  association seem more preferable. These two affiliated  organizations (most New Wave nominees enjoy Rukh's support) can  count on 60-70 percent of the seats granted for Lvov Oblast.  The only people capable of changing this proportion are the new  nomenklatura from the presidential administration and local  councils. Some of these people have nothing against acting  under the Rukh's umbrella. The unquestionable leaders of this  bilateral (or tripartite) union are Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk,  Kosiv, Lavrynovych, Kendzior, Boychyshyn, and Oblast Council  Chairman Mykola Horyn.    Only one member of the Congress of National Democratic  Forces  has a chance of winning a legislative seat, namely Mykhaylo  Horyn's former deputy Oleh Pavlyshyn. Mykhaylo Horyn himself is  going to face a fierce political showdown with his one-time  partner Stepan Khmara. However, if the congress formed a bloc  with Larysa Skoryk's Nationwide Movement and the anti-Chornovil  democratic nomenklatura, such a right-center coalition could win  as many as 30 percent of the seats. Democratic nationalists  from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists can count on two or  three seats in rural districts. The situation of the  Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists is similar. The  followers of Melnyk [nationalist leader of 1940's] can win one  or two seats.    The dramatic increase in the popularity of the ultraright  National Independence of Ukraine [DSU], the Ukrainian National  Assembly [UNA], and the national socialists is one of the  unexpected phenomena of recent weeks. Promises to restore order  and make Ukraine rich could grant them and the Conservative  Republican Party victories in 30 percent of the districts.  However under the current circumstances, this group can only  expect two to four seats. If the rightist parties manage to  discredit the democrats by accusing them of accepting bribes and  noting the semitic origin of their capital and their readiness  to betray Ukraine's national interests, their claims on  legislative seats might become much more substantiated. However  this camp too, has not rid itself of the democrats' disease of  infighting. National Self-Defense candidate Vitovych has been  nominated candidate in one district with DSU member  Shcherbatyuk; national socialists Hodysh and Tyahnybok are going  to fight against UNA's Shkil and Ostap Kozak respectively.    Only the extreme left parties -- communists and socialists  led by Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee member Adam  Martynyuk, are not experiencing any of these problems. Their  chances to win the elections in at least one urban district are  miserable. Yet, these people could receive some votes from  naturalized immigrants in urban districts with a high percentage  of Russian-speaking voters, and thus make it to the second round  of elections. However this is everything they can dream of.  The so-called independent candidates are in a similar situation  and can count either on votes from their relatives and friends,  or on their own capital.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Treuhand announces record sales in June MRS Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhand agency, yesterday announced that a record 562 former east German state companies were privatised in June, but admitted the agency's debts had mounted to more than DM200bn (Pounds 68.9bn). The German Finance Ministry recently estimated that by the time the federal government and states assumed the Treuhand's debts, at the end of 1994, they will have risen to DM250bn. This estimate now appears on the low side as the Treuhand increasingly turns to costly restructuring of unsaleable companies which it nonetheless believes are viable. Mrs Breuel said that in addition to the debts, there were substantial charges arising from extensive ecological damage by east German companies. By the end of June, 8,175 companies had been privatised, while 4,340 companies under the Treuhand umbrella remained unsold. Proceeds from the privatisation amounted to DM30.7bn and the buyers had pledged to invest DM144bn and guarantee 1.2m jobs. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said after conferring with Mrs Breuel yesterday, that one of the main issues was the serious effect the collapse of orders from the Soviet Union was having on struggling east German companies. He blamed 'internal Russian conditions' for the lack of concrete orders despite the German government's recent approval of DM5bn in Hermes export credit guarantees this year for east German companies exporting to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Mr Waigel said Germany had done everything possible to facilitate east German deliveries to the CIS. The Russians, however, were neither signing contracts nor giving state guarantees for payment. Mr Heinrich Hornef, the board member of the Treuhand responsible for finance, said the Russians were seeking to obtain 'special arrangements' from the Germans, which diverged from international practice. 'They are also trying to set an unrealistic exchange rate for the rouble,' he said. The haggling over conditions is taking place even though Russian and Ukrainian industrial companies are desperately in need of east German spare parts, plant and equipment. Seventeen ships ordered by former Soviet shipping lines and worth DM850m are still at east German shipyards awaiting payment.</p>

Nonetheless, we have yet to eradicate  leaks within public security organs or related to their  operations, and problems in other areas remain severe. From the  incomplete information available, we can roughly group these  problems into five categories.    The first involves intentionally giving criminals secret  information about public security work, including divulging  plans of action, means of gathering intelligence, clues,  evidence, and the identities of informants and witnesses. These  crimes directly undermine the very purpose of public security  organs and some even endanger informants. In July 1990, Li Rujie  [2621 3067 4634], secretarial section chief of the Shangli  Precinct of Pingxiang, Jiangxi gave a letter sent in by Liu Kun  [2692 0981], a driver for a certain company, detailing crimes  committed by the head of that company to that same head. The  informant was murdered early the following December by someone  hired for big money by that very head. This sort of leak  typifies the exchange of authority for money and collusion  between isolated crooks within public security ranks and  criminals in society and is a manifestation of public security  corruption.    The second category entails leaks resulting from  disappearance or loss of secret documents or goods due to  improper handling. This leakage occurs most often in leadership  organs at various levels, especially in document use and in  administrative departments. Failure strictly to follow  registration procedures and handling rules causes documents to  get lost during transmission, makes it hard to determine the  principal perpetrators or nature of leakage, and the  ramifications rarely appear in the short term. The operations  office of a certain city's public security department discovered  during inventory early this year that two sets of fairly highly  classified documents had vanished. Since they had gone out long  before and the checkout procedures were sloppy, the people  responsible could not recall where the documents went, so the  case remains unsolved. This kind of leak demonstrates that  problems exist in the way public security organs handle their  documents.    The third category is leaks occurring in radio  communications. Because some public security cadres and police  lack common sense when it comes to maintaining secrecy or  familiarity with communications equipment, confusion of open and  secret communications and exchange of unencrypted secret  information in wired and wireless communications occur  frequently, such that transmissions containing state secrets are  sent openly and thus are easy for crooks or external  intelligence agencies to intercept, thereby seriously  threatening the security of state secrets, including codes. In  February 1992, a border guard operator repeatedly transmitted  unencrypted the contents of secret documents over shortwave  radio, resulting in interception thereof. A certain city's  traffic control department openly radioed deployment orders for  a vehicle inspection operation that were overheard by a trucking  firm, thereby affecting the success of the effort.    Fourth are publication leaks. This most often occurs in  public reports or news accounts of successful criminal  investigations and in instructional, scientific, and  technological works. The vast majority of these leaks occur  because the people who commit them do not understand what  constitutes a state secret in public security work and or stem  from absence of strict clearance procedures. Then there is that  extremely rare individual who, for fame and fortune,  deliberately evades review by appropriate agencies and publishes  materials involving secrets without authorization. A public  security academy openly issued instructional materials compiled  for internal use only that contained data relating to secret  party work during the revolutionary war and to public security  work after the founding of the PRC. Although remedy was  immediately effected, some of the materials had been sold to the  public, with some ending up abroad and irretrievable.  Publication leaks are serious due to breadth of dissemination,  inability to determine where the leaked information destinates,  and the frequent tendency of ignorant news media to pass the  information on. Therefore, the serious threat posed by this kind  of leak cannot be underestimated.    The fifth category involves leaks occurring from office  automation equipment, including copying machines, typewriters,  and personal computers. Owing to a lack of strict control  systems or to failure to enforce such, copying machine use is  unrestricted in many units, so people reproduce things at will.  Some personal computers holding sensitive information lack  security measures, diskettes and ribbons are deposited or  disposed of indiscriminately, and so on. While public security  organs have yet to discover a single instance in which such  situations have led to leaks of secrets, potential peril  remains, trouble could occur at any time, so careful attention  is warranted.</p>

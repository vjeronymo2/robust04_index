			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Swart] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- African National  Congress PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] leader Tokyo  Sexwale on Tuesday [19 April] strongly criticised the National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] commander in Thokoza, Col Quinton  Painter.    Addressing journalists at the NPKF's Thokoza base camp,  after  a day of raging gun battles between hostel dwellers and  residents in the East Rand township, Mr Sexwale said Col Painter  was restraining the unit from effectively keeping the peace.  "He is restricting them to patrols and when they are shot at  they are not allowed to return fire."    Officers and troops were frustrated, he said. They disarmed  many township residents and wished to do the same in the hostels  but were prevented from doing so by their commanding officer,  who was operating under the direction of someone above him in  the NPKF. NPKF spokesman Col Connie van Rensburg said he would  respond to Mr Sexwale's allegations when he had gained more  information about the matter.    Both the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the NPKF  were  deployed on Tuesday in an attempt to quell the latest violence  on the East Rand. "We came here to look at the situation, to  talk to the people and to find out from the NPKF what the  essence of the problem was. We learned from their officers they  are operating under extreme difficulties which makes it very  difficult for them to execute their tasks," said Mr Sexwale.    The force had not been deployed in the same numbers as its  SADF counterpart, he said. The army had operated in Thokoza  with 2,500 men, while the NPKF had only 1,000 in the area. Two  battalions at De Brug, the NPKF base in Bloemfontein, were  supposed to be in Thokoza. Mr Sexwale said the peacekeeping  force's equipment was of an inferior standard and it had fewer  vehicles.    The SADF had pulled out of Thokoza without providing the  NPKF  with information about flashpoints and areas that needed  patrolling. "They have had to learn as they go along," said Mr  Sexwale.    The controversial SA Police Internal Stability Unit had been  redeployed in Thokoza without the NPKF being informed and "a  very volatile atmosphere exists between the various security  forces".    Mr Sexwale said a structure had been established for contact  between the NPKF and the community to build up confidence in the  force.    Asked whether the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] late entry  into the election race would help defuse the tension in Thokoza,  Mr Sexwale said: "We want the elections to take place on the  East Rand and we are very happy (IFP leader) Mr (Mangosuthu)  Buthelezi capitulated from his stubborn position of not letting  people vote. But he has left a terrible legacy of hate between  residents and hostel dwellers."    The ANC would be working closely with the IFP to pacify the  situation so that "our members and their members can vote". He  urged Thokoza residents to support the NPKF as its job was to  ensure the election took place.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Hopes rise for steady recovery: Unemployment falls for fourth month and inflation stays at 1.3% A FURTHER surprise drop in unemployment and subdued price pressures in May yesterday raised hopes that Britain might be on the way to achieving a sustained, non-inflationary economic recovery. Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 26,100 to 2.914m between April and May, confounding City expectations of a rise and cheering Tory backbenchers in the Commons. The fourth monthly fall in unemployment cut the seasonally adjusted jobless rate to 10.4 per cent last month from 10.5 per cent in April and its winter peak of 10.6 per cent. The unadjusted total of unemployed people claiming benefit recorded its biggest monthly decline since October 1988. It dropped last month by 84,000 to 2.917m, well below the politically important 3m level. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he was 'delighted at the fall' and that unemployment had 'fallen in Scotland, fallen in Wales and fallen in every single English region'. The government received other good economic news yesterday, which helped dispel fears that the recovery might be faltering. UK car production jumped by 23.8 per cent in May to reach the highest total for the month for 16 years. While commercial vehicle production has remained weak, car output has risen by 9.1 per cent to 608,169 in the first five months of the year in contrast to the steep fall in continental Europe. The year-on-year increase in the retail prices index last month was 1.3 per cent, the same as in April and the lowest 12-month rate since February 1964. The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, the government's chosen measure of underlying inflation, rose 2.8 per cent in the year to May after a 2.9 per cent rise in April. Retail price inflation excluding food fell to a 33-year low last month. Yesterday's figures pushed up prices of government gilt edged securities and boosted sterling, which closed 1.5 pfennigs higher in London at DM2.51 and up 1.15 cents at Dollars 1.5155. The pound firmed in New York to DM2.51735, but was little changed at Dollars 1.515. Equities in the UK slipped back, however, as investors took the view that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was now less likely to cut interest rates. The FT-SE 100 index closed at 2,875.7, down 7.3 points. The employment department reacted with caution, saying only that unemployment had flattened out. However, Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist of James Capel, the London stockbroker, said the jobless and inflation figures were 'an indication of the recovery being relatively well sustained and robust'. Other labour market indicators were positive. The number of people leaving the claimant count totalled 385,800 last month, some 38,200 more than in May 1992. Unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres reached their highest level for two years. Average earnings, up 4 per cent in the year to April, recorded their lowest annual increase for 25 years. Manufacturing output per head rose 8 per cent in the year to April. Unit wage costs in manufacturing fell by 2.6 per cent in the year to April. However, manufacturing employment fell by 13,000 in the month to April, reversing first quarter growth and reviving fears that jobs in manufacturing will resume their long-term downward trend. The workforce in employment fell by 17,000 in the first quarter, the smallest decline for 2 1/2 years and well below the record 397,000 drop in the third quarter of last year.

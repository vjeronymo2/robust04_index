			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mahmud 'Abbas, member of the PLO </F> Executive Committee and of Fatah's Central Committee, by  Khayrallah Khayrallah; place and date not given]    [Text] [Khayrallah] What is the significance of the  agreement reached in Cairo?    ['Abbas] What took place in Cairo was an important initial  step toward the implementation of the Declaration of Principles  signed in Washington on 13 September. It also solved the most  important problems which had been left to the negotiators to  find solutions for. I believe that the Cairo agreement has  opened and paved the way for the practical implementation (of  the Declaration of Principles agreement), for [Palestinian]  entry into Gaza and Jericho, and for the immediate and direct  assumption of authority in these two regions, plus the immediate  and direct assumption of responsibility for five authorities in  the rest of the West Bank cities. (The five authorities are:  education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation,  and tourism.)    [Khayrallah] How do you interpret the text of the new  agreement?    ['Abbas] Everyone knows the issues negotiated. They are:  The security issues, the area of the settlements in Gaza, the  crossings, and the size of the Jericho area. The agreement  covered most of these points although some minor points were  left to be resolved later. There are very many details we need  to immediately begin to confirm on paper but they are not  crucial or serious issues requiring the kind of negotiations  held in Cairo or before. We can say that the Cairo agreement  covered 80 percent of the fundamental issues and only 10 percent  of the paper issues which will be discussed by the Taba and  Paris committees.    [Khayrallah] Could the new agreement be regarded as a  completion of what took place in Cairo, Granada, and Davos  earlier?    ['Abbas] What has now taken place in Cairo is a continuation  of what we started in the second Oslo meeting, Davos, Cairo, and  Granada. The same issues were discussed within the same  framework and in the same spirit.    The reason we achieved what we did in Cairo was that there  was closer common understanding of the agreement. That  facilitated the result achieved.    [Khayrallah] What will be the formal position at the  crossings?    ['Abbas] There will be a special situation at the crossings  for the people of the Gaza and Jericho areas in that the Israeli  control will be invisible. What the agreement tries to  guarantee is preservation of Palestinian dignity at entry and  exit points, speedy procedures, and elimination of many  formalities and obstacles people used to face at the crossing  points where they had to wait hours or even days sometimes.    [Khayrallah] Why was Shim'on Peres reluctant to answer a  question about the area of Jericho?    ['Abbas] A confirmed area of Jericho has not yet been  finally agreed upon. Efforts are being made to increase that  area and fulfill the Palestinian and Israeli concepts of that  area in a way that would ensure distancing it from the  settlements. I believe that the issue of the area of Jericho  will not be a problem in the future.    [Khayrallah] Are you optimistic about this being a step  toward the implementation of the Declaration of Principles?    ['Abbas] I believe that what took place in Cairo was an  important step toward the implementation of the agreement. I am  very hopeful that the implementation will begin and end before  13 April so that we would be able to fulfill the sequence of the  other dates which were stipulated in the agreement and which  should be honored.</p>

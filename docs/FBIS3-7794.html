			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Polish Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy; place and </F> date not given; from the "Caliber" Military Program--recorded]    [Text] Speaking in terms of strategic perspective, my view  is that Poland is not safe, and everyone should become aware of  that fact soon, and also implement the necessary measures in  order to increase the feeling of safety. Second, there is the  issue of financial means for the very urgent needs of the Army,  in order to secure the Army's efficiency and  effectiveness--there have been debates going on regarding that  issue for some time now. The state budget presents an  opportunity in that regard. I think that if additional revenues  for the state budget emerge this year--there are people hoping  that this will happen--then the Army's needs must definitely be  taken into account. Third, I also think that there is no social  awareness of the deteriorating security in the country and the  resultant need to strengthen the Army's role so that the role  can be played well in the future.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Matif aims to win forex business from OTC rivals The Matif, the French futures exchange, hopes to wrest business from the over-the-counter foreign exchange markets when it opens options contracts on price movements between the US dollar and two European currencies on May 20. In launching the forex options the exchange will be defying the overwhelming sentiment of the world's foreign exchange traders: that exchange-listed currency hedging vehicles are redundant. With a daily global net turnover in excess of Dollars 880bn, forex dealers have deep and liquid markets in which to transact both spot business and contracts for forward delivery. These unregulated markets allow a flexibility in transaction size and delivery terms that other exchanges have been unable to imitate. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange was the first to attempt to divert some of the lucrative forex turnover on to its trading floor in 1972. It added options on its currency futures in 1984, and in 1993 had currency-related turnover of 5.9m contracts. The growth has been respectable, exchange officials say, but has not kept pace with the overall expansion in global forex dealings. London's Liffe listed options on spot foreign exchange rates in 1985, but abandoned the effort in 1990, unable to compete with deeply liquid and highly standardised OTC markets. The Chicago Board Options Exchange tried similar products, but volume was so low that they transfered the business to the tiny Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Matif's options contracts - one reflecting dollar/D-Mark exchange rates and the second dollar/French franc movements - most closely resemble those traded in Philadelphia. Franc and D-Mark options are the Philadelphia markets' most active currency products. In January, Philadelphia's average daily volume in spot D- Mark options was 15,000 contracts, and in its French franc options, 12,200 contracts. Matif officials reason that Philadelphia is an unlikely centre for foreign exchange derivatives. They also have discovered that a good portion of Philadelphia's currency options business originates in Paris, and they would like to recapture it, however small. The Matif's options contracts, to be sized in Dollars 100,000 increments, will be traded on Matif's floor during regular business hours, and on its old THS telephone trading system after hours.</p>

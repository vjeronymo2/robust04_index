			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Technology: Working in harmony - Saving time, money and arguments is the aim of technology partnerships On the wall of William Chatman's office at Foster Wheeler is a picture of an apparently unremarkable petrochemical plant built for a big UK client by the Reading-based process plant contractor. The plant was completed on time and within budget. But it was not a happy experience for either the client or the contractor. 'It was a good example of a project that succeeded even though the two teams were at daggers drawn,' says the burly chairman and chief executive at US-owned Foster Wheeler. Increasingly, the chemical industry is realising that the traditional, adversarial approach to getting plants built is just as likely to produce acrimony and lawsuits as results. It can be time-wasting, creates large amounts of tension and diverts attention from what the joint goals of the client and contractor should be, says Chatman. A new type of relationship, involving 'technology partnerships' or 'preferred contractors', is now taking root in the process plant industry. One benefit, but by no means the only one or the main one, is to remove the 'us-and-them' approach which can bedevil relations between client and contractor. With a large, complex, chemical plant, technical problems can lead to protracted, and often pointless, arguments. 'With the traditional relationship, you could have spent 10 days arguing about whose fault it was, now the problem can be solved in 10 days,' says Brian Osborne, managing director of Portsmouth-based John Brown Engineers &amp; Constructors. John Brown and Foster Wheeler have been at the centre of the technology partnership trend - which, at least in the process plant industry, began in the US in the 1980s. In March the two companies signed a deal with ICI which makes them the preferred contractors for all jobs worth between Pounds 1m and Pounds 30m designed and engineered in the UK - wherever in the world the plant is to be built. Partnering is a well-established idea outside the process plant industry - food retailers have been using preferred contractors for their supermarkets for many years to save time and money by eliminating the tendering stage and giving all or most of their work to one builder. But process plant contracting is not only in a different league technologically, it also involves a huge range of technologies that very few contractors have the ability to handle in their entirety. Often, big chemical companies such as ICI develop a process technology which is licensed to only a few contractors capable of handling it. Alternatively, the contractors develop their own proprietary techniques. This makes it much harder for the chemical industry to give all its work to a small number of contractors - the ICI deal, for example, excludes larger contracts where a particular proprietary technology may be critical. Even so, the increasingly competitive environment in the chemicals industry is encouraging large companies to develop more open, long-term relationships with the contractors to avoid wasting energy in areas where others specialise. Bryan Smith, ICI's director of engineering, sees the arrangements as dovetailing the respective and different skills of client and contractor - with ICI Engineering concentrating on technology development and 'front-end definition work,' and the two contractors carrying out the execution of projects. 'ICI Engineering provides an engineering service to about 20 distinct business entities,' he says, 'and in many cases engineering has the potential to transform the business. Our need is to transform the way we look at our task, adding value rather than looking at the mechanics of the project.' Consequently, the new approach is producing cultural change at ICI, and that, says Smith, is probably more important than the direct benefits of a non-adversarial method for handling contracts. 'A collaborative approach has been proven to work better,' he says. 'It's common sense that it should do, so long as you do not get too cosy or sloppy.' At first glance, it is the 'cosiness' or otherwise of technology partnerships that raises eyebrows. Aren't the clients and contractors getting a little too close for comfort? Not so, say the three companies involved. ICI ran the equivalent of a year-long beauty contest on about 19 contractors - an exercise which Chatman had not seen in 40 years in the industry. The 19 were asked what technologies they had covered. 'With our wide range, there were precious few that covered half the spectrum,' says Smith. This reduced the list to seven contractors, each of which was interviewed by a team of ICI project managers for a day to a day and a half. That only reduced the list to six, but then ICI really went to town - sending in functional specialists to assess the contractors in 19 different categories, and using a marking grid for the results. ICI had originally intended to have three preferred contractors, but with recession looming it decided it would be unfair to include a third company which matched its needs less well, as it would not get any work. The two winners were announced last year, leaving a handful of very disappointed contractors. 'In at least one case they were devastated,' says Smith. 'But when they realised the process had been done objectively, it took some of the pain away. And most said it was the best feedback they'd ever had.' In a sense, the technology partnership process mirrors the trend in manufacturing industry towards a reduced number of suppliers. Without mutual trust and understanding, normally built up over years of contact between client and contractor, the system will not work. The arrangement also helps the client manage computer-based design and procurement data in a way which is very difficult when projects are being handled by many different contractors. ICI and the two contractors are working jointly on linking the three computer systems into a common network  -although John Brown and Foster Wheeler will not share information. But the checks and balances of a client-contractor relationship still remain. The ICI teams that carried out the original tests can check whether the contractors can really do what they claimed, and the agreements are not absolutely exclusive. Ultimately, ICI could even terminate the agreement, but that would be a 'devastating' indictment of the contractor's reputation, says Smith. 'We have every confidence in the contractors, and they've got a lot of trust in us,' he adds. ICI is carrying out independent benchmarking to assess the benefits of the deal, but precedents in the US, which were the subject of a study three years ago, suggest savings of 5 per cent on overall project costs and an average 5 per cent reduction in project schedules. Eliminating the tendering process for each project could save two to three months, says Ian Robinson, chief executive of John Brown's engineering and construction business, but the client could spend that time thinking further about the project to ensure it is making the right investment decisions. Overall costs should also be reduced, particularly when contractors are working for the second or third time on a similar project. 'I am quite convinced we will be able to tackle successfully the issue of reducing the total installed cost of the plant,' says Robinson. Technology partnership deals bring the contractor a solid 'baseload' of work  -at Foster Wheeler the agreement with ICI already generates 10-15 per cent of its business, says Chatman. The profits are not necessarily as high as on a large, tendered contract, but in an uncertain market the partnership arrangement has a stabilising effect on the contractor's workforce. Both John Brown and Foster Wheeler have already won three or four big contracts from the partnership deals, and more are in the pipeline, says Smith. But relations have also been transformed on ongoing contracts. 'We now have joint teams on most projects, and you can't tell who's who,' says Smith.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] With the participation of Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak the government is holding its proceedings in Lansk. The  main subject of the two-day meeting is a socioeconomic program  for Poland for the next three years. Before flying to Lansk,  the prime minister said: We have decided to hold this meeting  out of town, so that everyday problems do not affect a calm  exchange of views.    [Begin recording] [Pawlak] The purpose of this meeting,  today  and tomorrow, is to discuss the fundamental components of  strategy for Poland. We want to do this in a peaceful  atmosphere, so that everyday pressures do not interfere with our  examination of these long-term processes. I think that, as a  result of the circumstances and the situation, Poland has  tremendous opportunities to become a country that counts and is  significant in the east-central region of Europe, and we want to  seek action opportunities that will make it possible to realize  this objective.    [Correspondent Koziol] Mr. Prime Minister, will the current  situation in the country, which is so heated, also be a subject  of discussion at Lansk?    [Pawlak] We intend to focus on long-term issues. As far as  immediate issues are concerned, as you very well know, ladies  and gentlemen, Minister Miller and Minister Pol have been  speaking about this. I think we should leave them room for  maneuver here. [end recording]    Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance  minister,  who accompanied the prime minister on his way to Lansk,  emphasized the need to extend the perspective within which the  government is going to pursue its economic policy. Often this  perspective gets shortened under pressure from severe social  problems, Grzegorz Kolodko added.    [Begin Kolodko recording] The Polish economy has good  opportunities, and Polish society has good prospects, also as  far as increased income is concerned. Admittedly we would like  most of this income growth to be directed toward investment,  with future generations, with the future in mind.    The main line of this strategy is stable growth, with a  fairer division of the national income than hitherto, but this  too requires some tidying up of the system, a continuation of  work started earlier, and the establishment of some kind of  sequence. That is why we would like to take some time thinking  about this.    It is clear, of course, that we are not going to return from  Lansk with some sort of final conception of government economic  policy. In the immediate future its individual elements are  going to be presented for public evaluation and for  parliamentary debate. But we do have a conception of this kind  and I would like to emphasize once again that the Polish economy  has good prospects. [end recording]    Of the three scenarios for Polish economic development  prepared by the Central Planning Office, the so-called  fundamental scenario is going to be adopted. Deputy Prime  Minister Kolodko:    [Begin Kolodko recording] Of course we have chosen the  optimistic scenario, and through our program and our activities,  together with other social and political forces, we want to  implement the optimism which follows from this scenario. This  scenario assumes a fairly significant national income growth,  and this is going to require appropriate changes in the field of  public finance and in the field of restructuring the economy,  including property status changes, and its elements will  gradually be implemented. This requires a tremendous  legislative effort and, I repeat, peaceful and hard work, and  sensible government policy. The government is open to criticism  and is going to monitor and adjust this conception. [end  recording]</p>

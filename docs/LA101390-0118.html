			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW OWNER OF BALLY SAYS HE'LL SELL ASSETS  </P> <P> Investor Arthur Goldberg took charge of Bally Manufacturing Corp. Friday and  announced that he will sell assets -- which range from casinos to health clubs  -- to cut the company's staggering debt.  </P> <P> Bally also said its Nevada casino unit would miss an $18.4-million interest  payment due Oct. 15, prompting Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investor  Service to lower the company's debt rating.  </P> <P> Stock in Chicago-based Bally fell 12.5 cents to $3 on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Goldberg, named interim chief executive to succeed the retiring Robert Mullane,  said he will begin a major review of all Bally businesses to decide what to  sell.  </P> <P> "Those companies not identified as core companies will be sold," he said. "It's  a full-scale, ground-zero examination."  </P> <P> In addition to its four casinos in Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City, N.J.,  Bally operates 315 health and tennis clubs and makes gaming devices, lottery  ticket machines and exercise equipment.  </P></p>

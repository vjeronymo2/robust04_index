			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Italian to chair key body in banking MR TOMMASO Padoa Schioppa, deputy director general of the Bank of Italy, has been appointed chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision. Mr Schioppa replaces Mr Gerald Corrigan, who stepped down after leaving his post as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The announcement was made late on Monday night by the Bank for International Settlements at Basle, where central bankers from the G10 countries were meeting. Mr Schioppa, the third most senior official at the Bank of Italy, has been deputy governor since 1984 and spent time at the European Commission in Brussels dealing with monetary affairs. He had been considered as a possible contender for the post of governor, but the job was given to Mr Antonio Fazio in May. Also at the G10 meeting yesterday, the Basle committee said a recent review confirmed that by the end of 1992 all internationally-active G10 banks had capital ratios exceeding 8 per cent, as defined by the Basle capital accord The committee, which conducted the review of the effects of the accord agreed in 1988, said this showed that the banks had met the minimum capital requirement laid down in the agreement. Average ratios for each national category of bank ranged between 8.8 per cent and 11 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E. V. Sobotovich, Geochemistry, Mineralogy and </F> Ore Formation Institute, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev;  UDC [550.4:621.039.7]:504.064.36(477.41)]    [Abstract] The characteristics of the physicochemical state  of the radionuclides discharged in the Chernobyl accident are  examined. The reasons for variations in the forms of presence of  radioactive fallout over the territory of the Ukraine are  discussed, as well as the mechanisms causing a change in  mobility of radionuclides with time under different  landscape-geochemical conditions. The processes of natural  self-purification of territories from radioactive pollutants are  evaluated, followed by a prediction of radiation conditions over  the polluted territories for a period from 5 to 1000 years. The  following are among the phenomena observed in the considered  area. There is a multisided dynamics of the vertical migration  of radionuclides in ground and soil horizons related to changes  in the mobility of radionuclides. There is a considerable  nonuniformity in the distribution of radioactivity in samples of  soils, plants, water, bottom deposits and hydrobionts. There is  fractionation of radionuclides in the fluvial network caused by  the forms of entry of nuclides and their different  physicochemical properties. There is active destruction of fuel  particles and conversion of radionuclides into migratory forms.  There is a nonuniformity in the distribution of radionuclides  expressed in a difference in the dose loads by an order of  magnitude for biosystems even in small test areas within the  30-km critical zone and beyond its limits. Under conditions of  explosive discharge of radionuclides there is a great difference  in the accumulation factors for the very same plants in  different regions. Considerable redistributions of radionuclides  are found in the system of Dnepr reservoirs and the Black Sea.  Mathematical simulation made it possible to organize a databank  for predicting the dynamics of radionuclide pollution of soils,  water and bottom deposits. Dynamic models were constructed for  estimating the formation of radionuclide pollution doses for the  people living in regions with an increased content of  radionuclides. The accumulated experience shows that the results  of geochemical research are fundamental in solving technical,  agroindustrial and biomedical problems. On the basis of these  and other findings a list of problems in the field of  geochemistry of radionuclides which must solved in the near  future is given.</p>

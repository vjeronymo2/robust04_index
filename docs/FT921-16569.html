			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Battles mark Tbilisi's new year FIGHTING erupted again in Tbilisi yesterday after a lull the previous night. As Georgians tried to celebrate New Year's day the capital echoed with the sound of sporadic gunfire and explosions. The clashes coincided with a warning from Mr Tenghiz Kitovani, commander of the rebel national guard in the city, that the storming of the parliament building by opposition troops was inevitable. 'We will all celebrate the old New Year (this was marked on January 13 prior to the 1917 revolution) at home,' he said. 'Many people will die if there is an attack on the parliament, but we cannot afford to wait a long time for Gamsakhurdia (the Georgian president) to surrender.' A prolonged siege would mean more deaths, Mr Kitovani added. He claimed 100 people had died, with 400 wounded, in the conflict so far. However, the Health Ministry says at least 53 people have been killed and about 300 wounded. An extended siege could also give time for provincial prefects, appointed by Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, to organise support and reinforcements for the president, the commander said. As he spoke, opposition leaders met to try to form a temporary government. This would take the shape of a unity coalition of all parties excluding only President Gamsakhurdia, said Mr Dzhaba Ioseliani, leader of the Mhedrioni parliamentary group. Mr Gamsakhurdia, accused by his opponents of setting up a dictatorship, has been trapped in the basement of the government building in central Tbilisi for 11 days. With him, the opposition claims, are up to 1,500 people, although other reports suggest a figure of only 500. Among those in the parliament are women and children as young as 12 who had been demonstrating in front of the building when violence began. The opposition accuses Mr Gamsakhurdia of using them as hostages. The roof of the parliament building has been badly damaged by opposition shelling. Nearby buildings - including the former state art gallery, the hotel Tbilisi, initially the opposition's headquarters, and Interior Ministry buildings - were burnt-out shells. Many, however, doubt the ability of the opposition to mount a full-scale assault; it appeared yesterday to lack purpose and organisation. Earlier it had surrounded the government building at one end of Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi's main street, but was driven back, leaving behind a howitzer. The opposition was forced to use another Soviet-made 122mm howitzer to destroy the gun and prevent it falling into enemy hands. The avenue has become a battlefield, blocked at intervals by barricades of buses and lorries, together with opposition armoured personnel carriers and Soviet T55 tanks. The two sides continue to shoot at each other along the length of the street, with snipers stalking rooftops. Residents of surrounding streets, fearing a bomb attack on the parliament, streamed out on foot yesterday, many bowed under huge bundles of possessions. Elsewhere, small knots of Georgians stood debating the fighting. The streets were, however, largely deserted. There have been reports of looting and armed robbery, with criminals taking advantage of the availability of weapons and a lack of a police force. The conflict in Tbilisi has added to the misery of a republic already beset by spiralling prices and chronic fuel shortages.</p>

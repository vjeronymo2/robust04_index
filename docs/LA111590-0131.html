			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NURSING YOUNG AMBITIONS  </P> <P> Nearly two dozen fifth- and sixth-graders from Los Feliz Elementary School got  a chance to act the part of surgical nurses at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center  in Hollywood Wednesday during the hospital's observance of National Operating  Room Nurse Day.  </P> <P> Dressed in surgical "scrubs," they washed their hands and arms in antiseptic  solution and then were taken on a tour of the surgical wing. They were even  given a peek at a minor surgery in progress, said Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman  Linda Quon. The tour was meant to be fun, but it also had serious purposes --  to encourage youngsters to consider nursing as a career.  </P></p>

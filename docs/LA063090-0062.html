			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OBITUARIES ;  </P> <P> SONNY JONES; STUNTMAN, ACTOR, MUSICIAN  </P> <P> Sonny Jones, a musician turned stuntman who performed in television shows and  films, has died in Granada Hills. He was 60.  </P> <P> Jones spent more than 20 years in show business, doubling for Charles Bronson  in "From Noon Till Three" and Roddy McDowall in "Planet of the Apes" and  performing stunts in television's "The Mod Squad" and "Hill Street Blues,"  among dozens of other credits.  </P> <P> Jones, a Chatsworth resident, died Wednesday of lung disease, said his wife,  Susan Jones.  </P> <P> He was born John A. Jones on May 8, 1930, in Shreveport, La., where he was  raised on a ranch. A singer and guitar player, Jones toured in bands with  Johnny Horton and Hank Williams Sr., playing in Nashville, Las Vegas and Los  Angeles, his wife said. Both men were his brothers-in-law.  </P> <P> A few years after moving to Los Angeles in the late 1950s, he met stuntmen Hal  Needham and Tony Epper while playing at a club on San Fernando Road, Needham  said. Jones practiced Western stunts, including fights and high falls, in  Needham's back yard under the supervision of both stuntmen. In exchange, Jones  gave them guitar lessons, Needham said.  </P> <P> Jones' knowledge of horsemanship helped land him stunt work and small acting  roles in TV's "Bonanza" and "The Wild Wild West." In 1987, Louisiana Gov. Edwin  W. Edwards acknowledged his accomplishments with the Governor's Award.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife of 30 years; daughters Shawn, Sheryl and Kimberly  Jones, all of Chatsworth; mother, Mary L. Jones of Shreveport, La. ; a brother,  Al Jones of Woodland Hills, and a sister, Billie Jean Horton of Shreveport.  </P> <P> A service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at J.T. Oswald Mortuary Chapel, 6944  Reseda Blvd., in Reseda, which is handling the arrangements. Burial will follow  at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth.  </P></p>

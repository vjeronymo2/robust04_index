Our Foreign Ministry's statement clarifies that the United  States and the other mentors of Zionism who were the ringleaders  in pushing the issuance of such a resolution have all remained  silent on the massacre of fasting Muslims in the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron and have even prevented the issuance of a  resolution condemning the Zionist regime by the UN Security  Council. Therefore, under the current conditions the Islamic  Republic of Iran considers this resolution to be a manifestation  of the spite of the Western-Zionist circles vis-a-vis the  Islamic Republic of Iran's independent policies, its defiance of  superpower domination, and especially its refusal to assist in  imposing humiliation on the Palestinian nation.    It has now been proven to the world that the Western  countries who support such resolutions have been hypocritically  assisting in the inhuman crimes and flagrant violations of human  rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the heart of Europe for a long  time.    The statement also refers to the political and social rights  of the minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran and to the  fact that penal codes in Iran are based on the judicial system  of Islam accepted and respected by more than 1 billion Muslims  throughout the world, and emphasizes that the issuance of such  resolutions mars the credibility of such forums.</p>

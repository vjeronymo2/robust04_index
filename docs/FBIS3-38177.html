			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Who Says People Won't Vote for </F> Refah?"]    [Text] On Sunday [23 January], Prime Minister Tansu Ciller  met for a "chat" with some of the TV stations and newspaper  representatives who have been supporting her since the very day  she was elected prime minister by the True Path Party (DYP)  convention last June. Ciller's remarks, carried by the press,  once again confirm that this lady does not understand the  cybernetics of her own country and that we will all have to  endure this unfortunate period in Turkish political history for  the time being until she is forced out of power one way or  another.    Ciller told her journalist friends that the people of  Istanbul would not vote for the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (Refah  Partisi-RP). If she is really sincere in this belief then we can  only shudder at this revelation of her ignorance of the  realities of Turkey.    Is Ciller aware that those people she said would not vote  for  the Welfare Party actually elected four pro-Islamic mayors in  districts of Istanbul in the local elections held in only six  districts in 1992? Is Ciller aware that public opinion polls  show the RP running neck and neck with the Motherland Party and  her own DYP in the public opinions polls for Istanbul? Is  Ciller also aware that her gross mistakes and incompetence have  disenchanted the masses and people are turning their backs on  the DYP? Many conservative people who used to vote for the DYP  are now voicing deep disappointment and say they will neither  vote for this party nor for the Motherland. Some say they are  undecided on who else to vote for, while some openly say they  will vote for the RP.    Did Ciller ever stop to think when the successful DYP  Istanbul district Mayor Gulay Atig quit the party and joined the  rival Motherland?    The RP is being promoted as a "clean and honest" party in  the  midst of all the corruption and adversities displayed by the DYP  and Motherland, but it seems Ciller, living in her own dream  world, hardly realizes this. People are still talking about  rumors of the windfall profits made by some people close to  Ciller during the recent foreign currency crisis... Is the prime  minister aware that while her top aides are trying to put on a  brave face in public, they are all privately saying Ciller and  the government is now in a hopeless state and that things are  getting worse?    Ciller may be in a daydream, but we feel it is time the  administrators of the DYP distanced themselves from her  hallucinations and started taking measures to avoid a disaster  in the upcoming local elections.</p>

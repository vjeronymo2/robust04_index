That there is lot of  catching up to be done is beyond any doubt. So, on his first  stop, the Western alliance is to be attended to, it is to be  rejuvenated internally, and there is to be at least some opening  up eastward. In addition, there is the declared intention of  bolstering the United States transatlantic commitment. The  second stop, Prague, involves constructively pacifying the four  states that would like to join NATO: Poland, Slovakia, the  Czech Republic, and Hungary. In Moscow, support for President  Yeltsin and Russia's reform policies is at the forefront. Then,  in Minsk, a "nuclear-free" Belarus -- and perhaps Ukraine's  President Kravchuk at the very last moment -- will be rewarded  with courteous recognition. After that, there is to be a final  trip to Geneva, where Syria's President Assad is to be once  again admitted to the community of international politicians  with whom talks can be held.    Clinton's first European trip since assuming office last  January follows a period -- one recently heavily criticized in  Washington -- of neglect and rapt disinterest. This has  entailed a mixture of basic, but diffuse good intentions on the  part on the new government (toward Germany for example) along  with ominous statements such as those made by Foreign Minister  Christopher on how the Americans' "Eurocentric" conduct was over  and that Asia had now become "the most important region" for  them. This was then modified in connection with Clinton's  travel preparations and was most recently expressed by Vice  President Gore in the terms: "If Europe is at war, we suffer.  If Europe is secure and free, we prosper."    However, something of an aftertaste has remained and has  been  strengthened even more by the escalation of the war in the  Balkans. Frustrated by European disagreement and manacled by  Congress, Clinton does not even want to touch this particular  conflict with a barge pole. Every shell that hits Sarajevo can  prompt questions in Brussels about the practical value of a  Partnership for Peace with an Alliance that has done so little  in Southeastern Europe over such a long time. As the WASHINGTON  POST assessed the issue at the weekend, Bosnia is the "skunk at  the garden party" NATO is staging. It is true that the French  let the Americans know that they wanted the question to appear  at the top of the agenda, but how little that has to do with the  wishes of the Washington administration was apparent at the last  joint press conference staged by Secretary of State Christopher  and [former] Secretary of Defense Aspin before the visit. They  themselves said nothing about the Balkans; when asked, they  evaded the issue, using meaningless formulas.    Apart from domestic policy, which interests him and led to  his election, Clinton primarily concerned himself with  international economic policy issues during his first year in  office. The exception was the sudden "summit" with the  beleaguered Yeltsin in Vancouver last February. There, he made  personal and political support for the "security partner" in  Moscow a constant element in his foreign policy. Then, in July,  he traveled to the meeting of the "big seven" in Tokyo and  afterward visited America's Asian ally, South Korea. In  November, he hosted the first Asian-Pacific Economic Conference  (APEC) in Seattle. He also campaigned successfully for the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), attended to  relations with neighboring Mexico and Canada, and helped bring  about a worthy end to the GATT negotiations on an international  agreement on tariffs and trade.    This year, he wants to visit "the Old World" on four  occasions. After the talks this week, he will visit Normandy in  May on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the World War II  allied invasion, and that will be followed by a visit to Great  Britain. In July, following the "G-7" summit in Naples, he  wants to go to Germany, and then in the fall he wants to take  part in the CSCE conference in Hungary. In the meantime, there  will be no end to the flow of visitors to Washington.  Chancellor Kohl will be the first guest Clinton will receive in  Washington at the end of the month, after he has returned from  Geneva and has delivered his State of the Union address to  Congress (25 January).    It would seem that the leaders with whom Clinton has the  closest contacts in Europe and the ones in which he places the  greatest trust are Kohl and Yeltsin. In his dealings with them,  he even appears to equal his predecessor, the tireless  "telephone diplomat" Bush. By contrast, the "chemistry" between  Clinton and British Prime Minister Major -- the White House has  not forgotten that he assisted Bush in the elections -- leaves  something to be desired. French President Mitterrand has, in  Washington's eyes, lost importance, because of his weak position  in domestic politics.    In Brussels, Clinton will still be accompanied by outgoing  Defense Secretary Aspin and then -- for the second time -- by  Treasury Secretary Bentsen to a meeting with Yeltsin. He will  be accompanied by Secretary of State Christopher as well as his  newly appointed deputy, the "Russia czar" Talbott, who with new  Defense Secretary Inman, will play a key role in the changed  security policy team. It was above all on the advice of his  friend from his days as a student that Clinton decided not to  offer the Visegrad states full NATO membership, because of  consideration for Russia and Ukraine. On Talbott's advice and  because of consideration for Yeltsin, when Clinton is in Moscow  he will avoid the Russian ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy, who has  told Clinton that it would be better for him to stay at home and  "play the saxophone."    Over the past few weeks, Clinton has devoted more time to  foreign policy than ever before and diligently studied his  colleagues' "scripts." With his natural American openness, he  will not find it difficult to leave behind the impression of a  well-meaning partner in Brussels, Prague, and Moscow. Regarding  his role as the president of the "last world power," however,  the question that remains is about his desire to provide  leadership, about his "vision of the time after the Cold War,"  which has only been outlined so far, and the reliability of his  commitment to security policy, which now only involves the  presence of about 100,000 U.S. soldiers on the continent  (compared to almost 400,000 in the past).    Regarding the Europeans' "defense identity," Clinton takes a  more relaxed approach than his predecessors Bush and Reagan.  Without flinching, he can accept the Franco-German Eurocorps as  well as a possible strengthening of the WEU, which some NATO  purists see as a "rival" organization. What is still not that  obvious, however, is whether this relaxed approach is based on  respectful confidence in the Europeans or has more to do with a  lack of interest.    This week, Clinton has an opportunity to bolster his image,  to strengthen America's claim to leadership, which is no longer  seen that unfavorably in Europe, and in doing so, give the  jubilant communists and cryptofascists from Belgrade to Moscow  something to think about. If he has a plausible concept and can  formulate a credible leitmotif out of it, he does not need to  become bogged down in details. In 1973, Richard Nixon, the last  president to declare a "European year," was also only concerned  about general directions. Thanks to the Watergate tapes, one  knows how little importance he attached to minor continental  matters. Thus, at the time he said -- in a linguistically  cleaned up form -- that "the lira is of no darned interest to  me."</p>

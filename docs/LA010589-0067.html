			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENTER TESTS EFFECTIVENESS OF IN-HOME HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center is testing a theory  proved in Europe but untried in the United States: that taking preventive  health care to senior citizens in their homes is more effective than waiting  for them to go to doctors for treatment.  </P> <P> The center has received a $657,143 grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation of  Battle Creek, Mich., to launch a project that involves contacting hundreds of  senior citizens in Santa Monica, providing free physical examinations and  overall health assessments in their homes, helping them to get the medical care  they need and following up on their progress for at least two years.  </P> <P> If the project is successful, organizers believe it could send a message to  health maintenance organizations and government health-care policy-makers that  an ounce of prevention is not only better but also less costly than a pound of  cure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Independence Is Goal  </P> <P> "We're trying to show that by visiting people in-home we can prevent early  institutionalization and frequent visits to emergency rooms or hospitals," said  Marcia Rossman, the center's community relations director. "Our goal is to keep  them independent for as long as possible."  </P> <P> Modeled after a similar study conducted in Copenhagen, the Kellogg project was  conceived by two professors at UCLA's Multicampus Division of Geriatric  Medicine -- John Beck and Laurence Rubenstein -- and by Bernice Bratter,  director of the Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center.  </P> <P> The Copenhagen project found that a group of senior citizens who received  in-home preventive health care had a significantly lower rate of  hospitalization and death than a group that was not given any care, Rubenstein  said.  </P> <P> Similar studies based in hospitals have been conducted in the United States, he  said, but a program of in-home care is unusual in this country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expects 600 to Enroll  </P> <P> To get names, addresses and telephone numbers of elderly Santa Monica  residents, researchers at the Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center checked  voter registration records and found 2,700 Santa Monica residents 75 and older.  They plan to send letters to all 2,700, explaining the project, then plan to  follow up with phone calls asking if they are interested in participating.  </P> <P> So far, workers have mailed 250 letters and made about 100 phone calls, and  about half of those contacted have agreed to participate, said Harriet Aronow,  project director. She expects to enroll a minimum of 600 people in the program.  </P> <P> An agreement to participate, however, does not guarantee respondents that they  will be directly involved. Half of those who agree to participate, about 300,  will be a control group for which no services are provided. Their medical  progress will be compared to the half of the group given in-home preventive  health care.  </P> <P> At first, participants will be split into the two groups at random, but the  process may later become more selective if too many of those chosen for in-home  assessment are white, under 85 or in good health. Project coordinators want a  large cross section of minorities who are over 85 and in fair or poor health.  </P> <P> A 1985 census found that 6,186 people 75 or older lived in Santa Monica, Aronow  said. If that number is still accurate, the study will involve about 10% of the  Santa Monicans in that age group, with 5% actually receiving preventive care.  </P> <P> By mid-January, those selected for in-home assessment will be visited by nurse  practitioners -- registered nurses with additional education and training in  physical assessment, diagnosis and treatment.  </P> <P> Diane Israel, one of two gerontological nurse practitioners involved in the  project, said participants will be given a complete physical examination and  will be interviewed to determine whether they have mental or emotional  problems, whether they are lonely and need friends, and whether they have a  usual source of medical care. The nurses will also assess each participant's  home environment for any health hazards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weekly Reviews  </P> <P> If the nurses spot potential problems, they will suggest solutions and provide  referrals if necessary. Once a week the nurse practitioners will meet with Beck  and Rubenstein, who will review each case and make additional recommendations.  </P> <P> "One goal is to identify needs before they have to be treated professionally,"  Aronow said. "If they do need professional care, we have a large network of  services identified locally. For those people who have a usual source of care,  we might just need to help them get an appointment."  </P> <P> "The odds are that we'll pick up on things at earlier stages," said Kathyrne  Barnoski, the other nurse practitioner on the project.  </P> <P> A case history on each participant will be compiled, along with a "problem  list" and recommendations for each problem, Israel said.  </P> <P> After the first visit, volunteer workers will check back with each participant  by phone as often as necessary, depending on the person's health. After three  months, participants will be visited by the nurses again.  </P> <P> If the project is a success, it will probably become one of the center's  permanent programs, Aronow said. Success would be measured by reduced  mortality, reduced emergency room use, increased use of community social  services and improved health and well-being among those seen by the nurses.  </P> <P> More significantly, success could mean changes in health care that reach beyond  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Revolutionary Effect'  </P> <P> If the project validates the theory that paying for prevention is more  economical than paying for treatment, Rubenstein said, health maintenance  organizations could begin hiring nurse practitioners to do in-home assessment.  And government programs like Medicare could recognize that preventive health  care for the elderly pays for itself in the long run, he said.  </P> <P> "I think it could have a revolutionary effect in terms of a push to provide  better services for older people in the community," Rubenstein said. "Older  people have not been getting the kind of care they need to optimize their  health outcome. For a long time, that's been brushed aside because there has  been a lack of data showing that they definitely would benefit from better  services.  </P> <P> "If studies come out showing that, without a doubt, older people live longer .  . . as a result of some kind of inexpensive intervention program like this, it  could have really revolutionary consequences."  </P></p>

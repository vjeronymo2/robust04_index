			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Tring is sued over music copies Tring International, the recording group which is to be listed on the stock exchange, is being sued by a US company which alleges that unauthorised copies of its recordings appear on more than 10 per cent of Tring's albums. In correspondence last year with the US company, K-Tel International, Tring said it based its rights to the recordings on an agreement in the US between Mr William Carr and Mr Stan Shulman. A Texas court ruled last month, in a case to which Tring was not a party, that the purported Carr/Shulman agreement was a forgery. Tring said yesterday that the correspondence was written before it had precise details of K-Tel's allegations. Tring faces legal action from several music groups, including PolyGram and MCA. Last month it agreed to pay Pounds 20,000 to EMI Music, which had sued it for breach of copyright. Trading in Tring's shares is set to begin on February 23. It says the legal claims will not have a significant financial impact. K-Tel wrote to Tring last year alleging copyright infringement. In September and October Simon Olswang, Tring's solicitors, wrote to Denton Hall, K-Tel's UK lawyers, saying Tring's right to exploit the recordings depended on the validity of the Carr/Shulman agreement. Mr Shulman, who died in 1985, had a joint venture with K-Tel. On October 25, Tring issued a writ in the UK against K-Tel, asking for a declaration that Tring was not infringing its copyright. Last November, K-Tel issued a writ against Tring, alleging 48 of its songs - by such artists as Little Richard and Percy Sledge - appeared on Tring albums. K-Tel alleges that 88 of Tring's albums contain one or more of its songs. Tring's catalogue contains 800 albums. The US District Court in Texas last month ordered Mr Carr and two other US defendants to pay K-Tel Dollars 616,300 damages. Tring said yesterday that when its solicitors wrote to K-Tel last year, it did not know which recordings were the subject of the allegations. Subsequent investigations showed that the 48 recordings did not depend on the Carr/Shulman agreement. Even if the titles appeared in K-Tel's catalogue, Tring believed it was selling different recordings.</p>

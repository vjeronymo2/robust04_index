			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: House of Fraser loss deepens Flotation costs of Pounds 8.5m pushed House of Fraser, the department store group, deeper into the red at the halfway stage. The pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of July grew from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 4.5m, on total sales 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 325.6m (Pounds 304.7m). On a like-for-like basis, operating profits were 11 per cent higher at Pounds 3.4m on a 10 per cent sales increase. Mr Andrew Jennings, managing director, said the store refurbishment programme was on schedule, and he was facing the crucial last four months of the year 'with enthusiasm and confidence'. The shares, 180p at the April flotation, closed up 4p at 211p. Operating profits almost doubled to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 3.6m), boosted by business rate refunds of Pounds 3.7m. The group expects a further Pounds 2m of rate refunds this year. Mr Richard Scott, finance director, said the like-for-like improvement reflected aggressive marketing and better focusing on more profitable markets. He described the 10 per cent sales rise as a 'good achievement when you consider there has been practically no inflation'. The four stores opened since 1990 had shown a 23 per cent rise in sales, while the Lakeside Thurrock store was 29 per cent ahead. A 14 per cent rise in sales of ladies' and men's fashion - a key part of the group's strategy - was balanced by slow growth in furniture. The group spent Pounds 3.5m promoting its in-house credit card, lifting the number of active cardholders from 475,000 to 641,000. Cardholders now account for 30 per cent of sales, and spent 25 per cent more than the average customer. The figures included an Pounds 800,000 gain on a property disposal and interest payments of Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.6m). A maiden interim dividend of 1.7p has been declared. The loss per share before exceptional items was 1.2p (0.2p), but excluding exceptionals, earnings per share were 1.3p (0.1p). COMMENT Stripping out exceptionals leaves House of Fraser with a loss of Pounds 500,000 - a flat result, reflected in the level of the dividend which the City had hoped would be nearer 2.4p. Sales were down in August but started to improve this month, and the benefit of the refurbishments will show through in the run-up to Christmas. However, a 1.2 percentage point improvement in bought-in margins has disappeared in mark downs, mainly on fashion items, while a discount of 10 per cent on the first purchase with a Frasercard has cost Pounds 3.5m. The move to maturity of the four stores opened since 1990 is a big factor behind the improved like-for-like figures. Forecast profits of Pounds 45m for the full year, rising to Pounds 52m for 1995-96, give forward multiples of 16.5 and just under 14 - a 9 per cent premium to the sector which is high enough.</p>

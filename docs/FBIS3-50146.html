The British warship Sir Geraint,  anchored in the Split port on 21 January, and completed customs  procedures in possession of valid documents. However, during  the regular customs inspection, the customs officers discovered  an irregularity -- namely, one of the eight registered  containers, declared as dangerous cargo, contained, instead of  registered gas and petrol, a large amount of ammunition of  various calibres, military equipment, hand grenades, and 43  boxes with 14 kg of explosives each.    As is the regular procedure according to Croatian  regulations, which are in line with international laws, a  commission will be formed to estimate the value of the illegal  cargo. Criminal charges will be brought against the ship  commander, while the illegally imported container, already been  stored in the customs warehouse in Split, will be confiscated.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY 4-A BASEBALL PLAYOFFS CANCELED BECAUSE OF BOYCOTT BY COACHES  </P> <P> City Section officials Tuesday canceled their 4-A Division high school baseball  playoffs, scheduled to start today, because of a coaches' boycott stemming from  the teachers' strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> The 3-A Division playoffs will start today as scheduled, Commissioner Hal  Harkness said.  </P> <P> Harkness announced the cancellation after a poll of the 16 schools whose teams  had qualified revealed that only six were willing to field teams without the  coach of record. Harkness declined to name the schools. District rules dictate  that the school official coaching a team must be a credentialed employee.  </P> <P> Despite a recommendation by the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn. that teachers  honoring picket lines continue to coach their teams, a group of 18 4-A coaches  voted last week to boycott the season until the strike ends.  </P> <P> Playoffs have continued in all other spring sports -- golf, gymnastics,  softball, swimming, track and volleyball.

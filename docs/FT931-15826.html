			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / BBC to confirm choice of deputy MR Bob Phillis, chief executive of Independent Television News, will be confirmed today as the new deputy director-general of the BBC. Mr Phillis, a former managing director of Central Independent Television and former group managing director of Carlton Communications, is the most important of the new appointments to be announced by Mr John Birt, who took over as director-general on January 4. The new deputy director-general, who is 47, will have the title of managing director of resources. He will have control over the entire operational and financial structure of the BBC and will be responsible for overseeing, at least for some time, the corporation's international activities, including BBC World Service and World Service Television. Mr Phillis is not expected to join the BBC until the present restructuring of ITN is complete. A seven-company consortium, led by Carlton Communications, is due to take over from the existing 15 companies which own the news organisation. Ms Liz Forgan, the director of programmes at Channel 4 who has a reputation as an independent-minded defender of broadcasting freedom, will join the BBC as a managing director. Until now it had been assumed that she would become managing director of BBC Television in succession to Mr Will Wyatt. There were growing reports in the corporation last night that Ms Forgan would become managing director of BBC Radio in succession to Mr David Hatch. The managerial changes do not imply a big structural reorganisation at the BBC, at least not immediately. Reports that the corporation was to become a single-structure organisation covering both radio and television seem wide of the mark. Mr Phillis, who introduced tighter financial controls at ITN, will have the task of improving financial disciplines at the much larger BBC. One of his first tasks will be to get to the bottom of the admitted Pounds 38m overspend at BBC Television in 1991-92 and the potential overspend of at least Pounds 20m in 1992-93 The new managing director of resources will also be responsible for overseeing the implementation of producer choice throughout BBC Television. This is the policy that enables programme makers to buy services from the outside market if it is more efficient.</p>

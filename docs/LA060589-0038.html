			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS;  </P> <P> ADVERTISING, CONTENT CAN CLASH IN LOCAL NEWS SPECIALS  </P> <P> When KNSD-TV (Channel 39) was developing its recent "Third Thursday" segment on  the proposed San Diego Gas &amp; Electric merger with Southern California  Edison, someone in the sales department thought it might be a good idea to  approach SDG&amp;E about sponsoring the program.  </P> <P> It was slowly explained to the salesman that such a deal might appear to be,  well . . . a little bit of a conflict of interest. I see, the salesman said.  The idea was quickly dropped.  </P> <P> In the growing business of locally produced news specials, such moral  quandaries involving the editorial and sales staffs are not unusual.  </P> <P> The promotional spots for this month's edition of "Third Thursday," due to air  June 15, announce that the show is sponsored by the San Diego County Teachers  Credit Union. The topic of the show is education.  </P> <P> Although there is no direct conflict -- certainly the advertiser won't affect  the content of the show, nor is it directly related to the topic -- the  appearance is enough to bother some staffers.  </P> <P> "People on the editorial side don't like the concept one bit," one station  employee said.  </P> <P> Some newsroom employees don't like anything that blurs the separation between  the advertising and editorial departments.  </P> <P> "I'm more concerned about the editorials" aired at the end of each "Third  Thursday," another staffer said. "Ninety percent of the viewers don't know one  department does one thing and another department does another."  </P> <P> Channel 39 employees have been assured that the situation with the teachers  credit union is a one-shot deal, a problem that won't be repeated. However, the  topic of interaction between the sales and editorial departments at Channel 39  was raised a few months ago by the direct sponsorship of segments during the  news programs, such as "Project Lifeplanning."  </P> <P> It is not a topic unique to Channel 39. For KGTV's (Channel 10) upcoming  "Signature Series" special on San Diego's trauma care system, "Trauma!"  scheduled to air Thursday, the Channel 10 sales department raised the idea of  approaching a local ambulance company about sponsoring the show. The idea was  quickly squashed when it was learned that the ambulance company was part of the  special.  </P> <P> The question of appropriate advertising is being raised more often simply  because stations are doing more of these types of shows, as local affiliates  continue to stake out their territory independent of the networks. Instead of  being simply afterthoughts, or a way to do a little community service, public  information programming is becoming an integral part of affiliates' program  schedules.  </P> <P> Shows like "Third Thursday," which produced a decent 5.0 rating in the last  ratings period, and the "Signature Series" are not exactly gold mines for the  stations, but they are revenue producers. When the network supplies a show to  an affiliate, the two split the number of advertising spots. But for locally  produced shows, the affiliate can keep the revenue from all the spots.  </P> <P> There is a "growing interest" in advertising on "Signature Series" shows, said  Darrell Brown, Channel 10's general sales manager. "They target upscale people,  people concerned about their community."  </P> <P> The ability to offer advertisers direct sponsorship of the program, so-called  "billboards" that tell viewers the show is "sponsored by . . ." make the shows  particularly attractive to some advertisers.  </P> <P> "It puts a bow on the package for them," Brown said.  </P> <P> "A lot of people get me mixed up with Samantha Fox, porno movie queen," bimbo  rocker Samantha Fox said in an article in the  </P> <P> San Diego Union. Sure enough, in the May 25 issue of the Reader, critic Stephen  Esmedina wrote of Fox, "It is her sordid past as a porn starlet that inspires  crude, lascivious remarks. . . . Having seen a number of Samantha Fox classics,  I can only say that her dimensions have blossomed since some porn rag voted her  'the most skillful porno actress in films.' . . . Porno films are her turf.  It's where she belongs." Fox may have bared her breasts as one of England's  leading "Page 3 girls," but she wasn't the porno star Esmedina ogled. . . .  </P> <P> XTRA-AM's Mark Williams is scheduled to go to Boston this week to participate  in a convention of talk show hosts, but he no longer has a show. Looking to  boost its anemic morning ratings, XTRA (690) has dropped Williams, who has been  valiantly trying to boost his exposure lately by attacking his competition at  KSDO-AM (1130). XTRA is a classy operation, said Williams, who will remain with  XTRA, albeit off the air, through July 1. "They handled it the right way. They  made a decision and they had to do what is right for XTRA." Larry Roberts takes  over the morning show on a temporary basis, beginning this morning. XTRA is  expected to announce the hiring of former Padre Steve Garvey later this week.  Management won't say yet what Garvey will do.  </P> <P> With "Star Trek XXI," "Karate Kid, Part IX: The Kid Buys a Gun" and "Fright  Night IX: The Bob Uecker Story" set to be the foundation of the summer movie  season, Landmark Theaters, operators of the Ken, Cove, Guild and Park, have  adopted a new theme for the summer: "Just say no to sequels." It has purposely  left all sequels off the summer rosters for its theaters. . . .  </P> <P> Responding to letters from readers, this month's issue of San Diego magazine  includes an apology for running an ad for a water company with the slogan, "A  few good reasons to get your jugs removed." A note from the publisher reads,  "The advertisement came in after our deadline, ready to run, and was published  without review. We didn't see it until the March issue came out." . . .  </P> <P> Noble Broadcasting President John Lynch wasn't happy that his station, XTRA-AM,  didn't get the contract to broadcast Padres games. But he could take  satisfaction in knowing KKLQ (Q106) didn't get the contract, either. (Incumbent  KFMB retained the rights.) "I didn't want to see Q106 get it," Lynch said. "If  Q106 got it, they would have been another competitive factor on the AM. I  wanted to beat them out more than anything else." . . .  </P> <P> Escondido-based KOW is now simulcasting mainstream country music on both AM and  FM, dropping the traditional country music on the AM station. As part of the  economizing move, the station laid off announcer Clip Helps, who had been with  the station for more than 20 years. Helps, who has been doing weekend and  fill-in work with KJQY-FM (103.7) since December, said he had made it clear to  KOW management that he was looking for a change anyway. The station also has a  new general manager, consultant David Moore, who replaces Al Gordon. . . .  </P> <P> Artie Ojeda has turned down a gig with KABC-TV's (Channel 7) Orange County  bureau to be the No. 2 sports guy at KFMB-TV (Channel 8). He moved into the  spot vacated by Jim Laslavic, who is moving to Channel 39. Laslavic's last day  with Channel 8 was Saturday. . . . Lee (Hacksaw) Hamilton's show with Channel  39 is set to begin June 17. The live phone-in show will follow NBC baseball  games on Saturday afternoons. . . . Channel 39 had a problem with the  prime-time show on entrepreneurs scheduled to air June 21. After looking at the  first edits of the interviews with the entrepreneurs, it was, well . . .  boring. So the script was changed to include more dramatic tales, such as  stories about those who have been unsuccessful in their attempts to develop  businesses.  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Pension fund in trade credit link THE US Export-Import Bank and the New York City Police Pension Fund have agreed on a novel course of export financing which will make available trade credits to help small and medium-sized companies sell abroad. The pension fund is to finance a Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m) line of credit, to be administered by the two-year-old New York State Export Finance Programme, for working capital loans of Dollars 25,000-Dollars 2.5m for proposed export projects. The loans will be approved and guaranteed by Eximbank. Mr Alfred Daibock, director of the New York programme, said the scheme 'addresses the real need (for export finance) right smack in the middle'. The need was for an agency which would work with exporters and banks and conduct the labour intensive work, which banks found insufficiently profitable. The export finance programme does not need to make a profit, but it expects to give good returns to the pension fund investors and break even itself in the next 12-18 months. Efforts have been under way for some time to utilise pension funds in trade development schemes. Ms Elizabeth Holtzman, New York City Comptroller and adviser to the city's Dollars 47bn pension funds, said that it was the first use of such funds to revitalise New York's manufacturing sector and create new jobs. Mr Ken Brody, Eximbank's chairman and a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs, said the programme, which was initiated before he joined Eximbank, would serve as a model for other federal and city efforts. 'It increases the amount of financing available for exporters, helps the local economy and allows pension funds to obtain a good rate of return on their investments at minimal risk,' he said. The Dollars 30m in financing may ultimately underwrite as much as Dollars 100m in overseas sales.</p>

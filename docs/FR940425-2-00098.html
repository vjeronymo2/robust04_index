			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the above, GSCC hereby requests that its authorization to implement the executing firm feature be made permanent. In the alternative, if the Commission determines that the granting of such permanent authorization is not appropriate at this time, GSCC requests that it be granted a renewal of its temporary authorization to implement the executing firm feature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSCC also proposes to amend GSCC Rule 2, Section 10 and GSCC Rule 11, Section 4 to permit GSCC to accept trades of a member after voluntary termination or insolvency in order to ensure an orderly settlement of the member's net settlement position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The proposed rule change would allow GSCC to further improve its comparison rate and to provide the benefits of its comparison and netting processes to more transactions and more market participants. Thus, GSCC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

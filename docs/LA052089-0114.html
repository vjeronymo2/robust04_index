			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Stock Exchange Charges Rival: The Philadelphia Stock Exchange filed a lawsuit  accusing the American Stock Exchange of pirating its blueprint for a  controversial new financial instrument that combines aspects of stocks and  futures. The Philadelphia exchange demanded that the New York-based Amex stop  trading the new financial product, known as stock baskets or index  participations, under rules allegedly copied from Philadelphia. The Amex said  there was no basis to the charge. Philadelphia and the Amex started trading the  stock baskets a week ago after a stay was lifted by the Securities and Exchange  Commission. The product is based on various stock indexes and pays quarterly  dividends, although its holders do not own the underlying stock.  </P></p>

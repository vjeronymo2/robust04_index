			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 5 Feb (AFP) -- "Subcommander Marcos,"  the military strategist of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] rebels who took up arms on 1 January, warned during an  interview published today by the local daily LA JORNADA that if  the Mexican Government isolates the guerrillas politically,  there will be "carnage."    At a meeting with a group of journalists in an unidentified  region of the Lacandona Jungle, in southern Mexico, Marcos spoke  about the reasons for the uprising, the imminent dialogue with  the government, and the issues on which there is no agreement.  Marcos said that "there is the risk of the government  politically isolating us at the national level. Obviously, this  would lead to a renewal of the military option." He noted that  "the next time there will be a great deal of carnage because we  are not going to perish alone, and we are not going to move to  another place."    Marcos said that the EZLN has agreed to negotiations (that  could begin in the next few hours) because "we owe it not to the  government or Manuel Camacho (commissioner for peace and  reconciliation) but to the civilian society. We want to sit  down and talk with civilian society."    Recalling a passage of the Mexican conquest, he insisted  that  "if the government succeeds in isolating us," the guerrillas  "prefer to jump into the river than to surrender their weapons."  The subcommander, who approached reporters escorted by armed  Indians and wearing a military uniform, his already traditional  "sky mask," and a black poncho, noted that "the total  annihilation of our forces is improbable. It is in fact  impossible."    Regarding the dialogue, for which no date or place has been  set, Marcos said: "We are thinking about holding it in the  city." He added that "we don't want to hold it in the jungle"  because "here we cannot guarantee the security" of Camacho or  guerrilla mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz.    Marcos said that the negotiations must take place "in a  place  where they (the government) will feel obligated to act  properly." He did not discard the possibility of holding talks  in the Mexican capital.    Regarding the dialogue, Marcos said that the EZLN "has  forced" the government to engage in negotiations. However,  commenting on the official refusal to discuss national political  issues, Marcos said he has doubts about the possibility of the  government complying with an agreement. Marcos said that "it is  not right for Camacho to say that he is not going to negotiate  national policies with an armed group. The government is  washing its hands before reaching an agreement, and if there is  an agreement, it would not comply with it."    Marcos noted that the government "does not want to discuss  issues over which there is consensus." He added that there is  no "democratic room in the nation" in which the Indians  participate. He explained that "it is wrong to think that our  problems will be resolved at the state (Chiapas) level." He  added that "we know that this can only be fixed if there are  changes higher up. Now," he analogized, "they are changing the  tree's leaves, but the tree's roots are rotten."    He went on to say that "the predicament is not whether to  have peace with democracy. As we see it, the matter is to  either have peace or war with dignity."    Marcos criticized the official decision to recognize the  EZLN  as "a political force in formation," and not as a belligerent  force, as his organization had demanded. He said that "it now  happens that the Indians are no longer children but adults in  formation," although "they will continue treating us like little  children."</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUTO SLUMP BLAMED FOR RETAIL SALES DROP  </P> <P> Another month of sluggish automotive sales caused retail sales to fall by 0.9%  in February to $146.5 billion, the Commerce Department reported today.  </P> <P> The decline was the biggest since a drop of 1.3% in October.  </P> <P> Some analysts were pleased by the report, but Irwin Kellner, chief economist  for Manufacturers Hanover in New York, said the 0.9% decline "shows an  underlying weakness in the economy that should not be ignored."  </P> <P> If the 6% drop in automotive sales -- the biggest since a 26.5% plunge in  January, 1987 -- was not figured in, total sales of all other goods to  consumers would have increased by only 0.5% in February, officials said.  </P> <P> "It's a sign that we are teetering on the edge of a recession," Kellner said.  "What makes it even more alarming are the markets have talked about the need  for higher interest rates.  </P> <P> "This report suggests the recipe for continued economic growth is lower  interest rates."  </P> <P> But Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust in Chicago, was much  more optimistic.  </P> <P> "It's a strong report," Dederick said. "There doesn't seem to be any sign that  the consumer believes there is going to be a recession, and consequently that  reduces the risks there will be a recession."  </P> <P> Added forecaster William MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: "True,  automobile sales fell, but almost all other sectors experienced nice  increases."  </P> <P> Auto dealers have been hit hard by sluggish sales over the past several months,  and they turned to rebates and other discounts to clear their lots in December  and January.  </P> <P> Sales of durable goods, items made to last three or more years, were down by  0.3% last month to $54.8 billion, while the sales of non-durable goods were up  by 0.4% to $91.7 billion, the department's Census Bureau said in its monthly  report.  </P> <P> The 0.9% decline in total retail sales for February compared with a surge of  2.8% in January after a decline of 0.3% in December.  </P> <P> In other categories during February, retail sales of building materials,  hardware and garden supplies increased by 1.4%, and sales of furniture and home  furnishings were up 0.5%. Sales at department stores increased by 2%, while  sales at food stores were up 0.5%.  </P> <P> Gasoline stations, meanwhile, saw sales decline by 0.8% in February, and drug  stores also reported a 0.8% decline in business, the department said.  </P> <P> But February retail sales increased by 1.6% at clothing stores, while  restaurants and bars reported a 1.4% advance in sales.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A bulletin on environmental conditions in Fujian  Province in 1993 issued yesterday by the provincial  environmental protection bureau shows that during the past year,  although the growth of our province's GDP was faster than in  1992, environmental pollution had not deteriorated despite rapid  economic development and that further ecological damage has been  basically curbed, or eased. Our environmental protection work  has been strengthened.    However, data in the bulletin shows that current  environmental protection in our province is still far from  meeting the demands of economic development. In some  localities, problems caused by effluent, exhaust fumes, waste  residues, and noise still spread unchecked. Environmental  pollution, mainly seen in cities and towns across the province,  is becoming serious and is spreading very fast. The scope of  ecological damage has widened and has become more acute. In a  small number of localities, environmental pollution and  ecological damage have become factors constraining sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the local economy.</p>

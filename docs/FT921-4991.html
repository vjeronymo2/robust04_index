			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: More O'Ferrall tumbles to Pounds 5.8m MORE O'FERRALL, the billboard and bus shelter advertising contractor, suffered 'extremely weak' trading conditions in 1991 and saw pre-tax profits fall by 40 per cent from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 5.8m. However, Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said that after a 60 per cent drop in first-half profits to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 2m) second-half trading was 'substantially better'. The shares rose 5p to close at 244p. The outlook would largely depend on a recovery in the UK market, he said. So far the first quarter was weaker than last year and there was a hesitancy by advertisers to commit themselves ahead of the election. Group turnover fell 3.5 per cent to Pounds 61.7m, but the relatively high operational gearing in the business meant operating profits fell by 29 per cent to Pounds 9.2m. Mr Brian Turnbull, finance director, said the group had cut costs where it could and capital expenditure had been reduced from Pounds 10m in 1990 to Pounds 5.8m in 1991, although this was still greater than the Pounds 4.8m depreciation charge. The interest charge rose slightly to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.3m) as borrowings increased over the course of the year. In mid-December the group received the Pounds 13.3m net proceeds of its 1-for-4 rights issue in October, and at the year-end the group's borrowings had fallen by Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 8.6m, Mr Turnbull said. This repre-sents a fall in net gearing from 126 per cent to 26 per cent. A lower tax rate of 29.7 per cent, compared to 33.9 per cent, was achieved by using tax losses overseas. Mr Turnbull said this would continue in 1992 and beyond. Earnings per share were 14.9p against 24.3p for 1990 after adjusting for the rights issue. Mr Gore-Andrews said the group had been confident of keeping its promise of a final dividend of 10p on the enlarged capital ensuing from the rights issue, although this left retained profits of only Pounds 16,000 (Pounds 3m). That gives a total pay-out for the year of 13.2p, unchanged in money terms but slightly up from the rights-adjusted level of 12.8p. Operating profits in the UK and Ireland fell 36 per cent to Pounds 7.1m on sales 8.4 per cent lower at Pounds 38.9m. In Belgium profits were 8.8 per cent down at Pounds 1.4m, although this hid a good recovery in the second half after the integration of Visibility, the business acquired in 1990. A strong performance in France, despite a weak market, lifted profits to Pounds 855,000 (Pounds 364,000). Losses in the Californian subsidiary more than offset a recovery in profits from Taiwan in the second half, to give a loss of Pounds 158,000 (Pounds 42,000 profit) from 'other' areas. COMMENT It is hard to get enthusiastic about More O'Ferrall's short-term prospects after two successive years of 9 per cent falls in UK advertising expenditure, and a couple of false dawns last year. Media forecasters' predictions of 10 per cent growth in the advertising market this year may well prove over-optimistic. And there is also the prospect of a European ban on tobacco advertising. Tobacco advertisements represent 5 to 7 per cent of the group's UK turnover and 8 per cent of its Belgian business. Once business does recover the high operational gearing will mean profits rising sharply, but this makes forecasting difficult. Assuming some pick up in the second half of the current year and with the rights money cutting the interest charge, pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 9m, giving a prospective p/e of about 12.3. An historic yield of 7.2 per cent sustains interest in the shares until the expected profit bounce arrives.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / British Gas feels pain of regulation The steady erosion of British Gas's profitability through growing competition and regulatory pressure was underlined yesterday when the company reported first-quarter historical cost profits of Pounds 634m, down from Pounds 650m. Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, repeated a warning that full-year results were likely to be below 1993. He added that uncertainty over the regulatory environment made it 'inappropriate to comment on dividend prospects.' British Gas shares, however, closed up 4 1/2 p at 284p. First-quarter earnings per share were 14.6p, against 15.1p. The drop in earnings would have been steeper without particularly cold weather in what is the company's most important quarter. Increased volumes were reflected in higher turnover of Pounds 3.67bn (Pounds 3.61bn) and a Pounds 30m rise in operating profits from UK gas supply to Pounds 773m. But Mr Giordano said the 'underlying trend of profits in that business remains downwards due to regulatory pressure on prices in the tariff sector and loss of market share, mainly in the firm contract market'. Ofgas, the industry regulator, yesterday published a consultation paper that could lead to the removal of some of that pressure. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director general, said it was time to decide whether it was still 'appropriate' to maintain constraints imposed on British Gas as part of the government's efforts to open up the firm contract market, mainly for industrial and large commercial users. These require British Gas to sell gas only on the basis of published and non-discriminatory tariffs. It must also reduce its share of the market above 2,500 therms a year to 55 per cent by 1995, a level which British Gas says was reached at the end of last month. 'Unless the constraints on our ability to compete are lifted soon, our market share will continue to fall,' Mr Giordano said yesterday. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, welcomed the Ofgas proposal, which he said was 'long overdue.' But even if the restrictions were lifted, there would be little positive impact on the company's performance this year. Mr Brown noted that there was still 'massive uncertainty' over the impact of future regulations. Consultation on how the domestic market will be opened to competition is taking place. And an Ofgas document is due shortly on the pricing formula for use of British Gas's transportation and storage network.</p>

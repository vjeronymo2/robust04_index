			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER VIEW OF POMONA URGED  </P> <P> I protest the demeaning of Pomona as a crime-ridden and poverty-stricken city  (Times, Oct. 29).  </P> <P> You only glorify the crime. Your staff writers need to give both views of  Pomona and not constantly state that minorities are always the cause of crime  and violence.  </P> <P> The middle class still lives in Pomona maintaining nice homes and careers.  Write something for once about Pomona that is positive.  </P> <P> VERLAIN ROY  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

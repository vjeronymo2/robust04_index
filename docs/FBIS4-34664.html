			<p>BFN     [Text] On 22 June, GRANMA reported that producing 60  million cigarettes a day satisfies the demand for regulated and  extra quotas, as well as unregulated sales of cigarettes. The  article cites the Agriculture Ministry's tobacco enterprise  union as saying that the eight cigarettes factories are at full  production capacity. The article points out that 14,468,900  packs of cigarettes were distributed to the population between 1  June -- when cigarette sales were deregulated -- and 16 June.  The demand for unregulated cigarettes on the national market,  initially high, has decreased. This has helped market stability.</p>

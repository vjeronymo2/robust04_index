			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of the </F> Democratic Left Alliance, by Ewa Rosolak; place and date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Rosolak] A week before the self-government  elections, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] claimed that it  would be satisfied with a result in the vicinity of 20 percent.  On the Friday before the elections, you said: "We will not  lose these elections." How does the party evaluate the results  today?    [Kwasniewski] We are satisfied. Our forecasts proved  correct and so did my statement that we will not lose these  elections. One can even say that we won them. I am also  talking about Warsaw, which really makes me happy, and about the  very good result in Krakow. We are the grouping that has major  structures and support in large and medium-sized towns and  cities; we are also present in the countryside. Thus, we are  unique, in a way.    [Rosolak] You also suggested that the elections would  confirm the political trends shaped in September...    [Kwasniewski] And they did confirm them. The main groupings  are the SLD and, in the countryside, the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL] and the Union of Freedom [UW]. The right wing, which has  drawn conclusions from the September elections and united, is  another force in this configuration.    The SLD has reasons to consider these results satisfactory.  Still, the low turnout is undoubtedly sad. This means that the  ideas of self-government and the civic society still remain more  in the sphere of slogans than reality.    [Rosolak] The SLD has obtained influence in towns. However,  does this mean that it will also share power?    [Kwasniewski] These are two different things. In the  previous term of office, we had approximately 800 members of  municipal councils; today we think there will be 10 times as  many. Thus, our position in municipal and gmina [smallest  administrative units] councils is certainly increasing. This is  our first try at self-government because so far we have been  present first and foremost in the parliament. This is going to  be a great test for my colleagues. In such towns as Sosnowiec,  Wloclawek, Czeladz, and Stargard Szczecinski, we are obliged to  take over all of the issues.    In other places, we will hold talks on coalitions. We are  open to all kinds of configurations; however, I will now be  quite frank and say that we will neither throw ourselves about  or fall into despair if it turns out that we are merely a strong  opposition. I even believe that the role of a homogeneous,  constructive opposition might turn out to be important and  useful for our members of municipal councils; it might help them  gain new experience.    If UW definitely goes in the direction of a coalition with  the right wing, then, as Marek Borowski correctly pointed out,  it will not be the first case of such a union. They usually did  not gain much as a result, but, after all, it is their own  decision.    I also think that this will clearly define the  responsibility  of these groupings for everything that is going on there; so,  there is really nothing to envy... As the opposition, we will  control these authorities and suggest better solutions. I also  think that we will be getting ready for the next elections.    [Rosolak] Do you not fear the so-called anti-SLD coalition?    [Kwasniewski] No, I do not. It may be formed, but it is  just as likely as a coalition with the participation of the SLD.  We are talking about politics. I am amused by evaluations that  are supposed to belittle our results, as well as by opinions  that we did not receive 50 percent of votes everywhere... In  the parliamentary elections, we obtained 20 percent, so we are  not a majority in the Sejm, either. Thus, it would be difficult  to expect that we will all of a sudden win the majority of votes  in the self-governmental elections. [passage omitted]    [Rosolak] You have established numerous coalitions with the  PSL in the regions. What separates coalition members in  regions, and what brings them together?    [Kwasniewski] Generally speaking, the characteristic thing  about self-governmental elections is that there are more issues  that bring people together than issues that separate them. It  is difficult to expect that great disputes or passions will be  related to the communal infrastructure or other issues that are  within the powers of self-governments.    The analysis of the results of the elections showed that  the PSL is not an all-national party but a party that is really  strongly linked to the rural electorate. The results that the  PSL received in towns are poor. This is the problem when you  want to transfer the coalition with the PSL to towns. In towns,  we are, in fact, alone and must fight against UW alone or fight  along with UW against the right wing.    [Rosolak] The coalition with the PSL comprises the  government. One can continually hear the following statements:  "The left has blurred its image through the coalition with the  PSL; its ability to reach a compromise is greater than that of  its peasant partner." What is the price of the coalition? What  is the limit of compromise?    [Kwasniewski] Every decision has its price. I believe that  we have confirmed that we are solvent. It is worth recalling  that it was predicted before the elections that many misfortunes  would befall us. The right wing said that we would lose; others  kept saying that our alliance with the PSL would yield us  negative results; still others feared that our rational economic  program was not very leftist, and, therefore, we would obtain  fewer votes.    I believe that many of these accusations have been proved  false. I believe that our voters will understand that the SLD's  compromises result from the feeling of responsibility: from the  fact that we think in terms of responsibility for the state, not  in terms of disputes over our own positions, ministerial posts,  and so on.    I am also happy with the fact that the statements that our  electorate expected miracles have proved false. It turned out  that our electorate is very conscious; the people know and  understand that successes are not achieved overnight and that  they call for hard work.    I believe--please do not think I am boasting--that,  generally, it is becoming increasingly clear that we are number  one on the left side. It is also obvious that, if the  social-democratic left wing is crystallized anywhere, it should  be crystallized around us--with our significant participation.  I am convinced about that. Thanks to our openness, which you  have criticized, we will be able to count on cooperation and the  presence of others who want to join us.    The Polish political system is shifting toward a four-party  system: the left; the right, with very strong Catholic and  national views; the center, including UW; and the peasant party,  the PSL, which, because of its structure, will be an important  grouping in our country for many years to come. [passage  omitted]    [Rosolak] The Constitutional Committee of the National  Assembly has already familiarized itself with six draft  constitutions. You say that the differences concern 20 percent  of the issues that are found in the Basic Law. Among the  controversial issues, you list relations between church and  state, the political system of the country, and social rights.  How do you see the possibility of reaching a consensus in a  situation in which the dispute concerns the most vital problems?    [Kwasniewski] Eighty percent are articles on which a  consensus can be easily reached; 20 percent involve key  disputes. The discussion will be finally ended through a vote.  There is no other possibility. We will seek a compromise  wherever it can be reached. The National Assembly will settle  the issue, which will be finally decided in a nationwide  referendum.    [Rosolak] As chairman of the Constitutional Committee of the  National Assembly, you said that we would have a new  constitution by last spring. If the statements by Minister  Falandysz are also the opinions of the president, the first  citizen does not really look forward to the constitution's being  passed anytime soon.    [Kwasniewski] I think that the president is supporting the  schedule that has been accepted by parliament. It is an  ambitious and logical schedule because it is reasonable to elect  the president when the conditions of the contract are already  known. It would be really bad if the president were elected in  line with the regulations that are binding today but that may  change later on. This might gave rise to the following question:  Does the newly elected president have to accept the conditions  created after he was elected? I think that the proposed  sequence of events is more natural. [passage omitted]</p>

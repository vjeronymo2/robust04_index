			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / SIB bans Levitt from securities Mr Roger Levitt, disgraced former chairman of the Levitt Group which collapsed with Pounds 34m in debts, is the first person to be indefinitely banned from the investment business in Britain. The Securities and Investments Board said yesterday that, for the first time, it has exercised its powers under section 59 of the Financial Services Act. SIB said its powers under the act do not actually allow it to publicise the names of individuals who are banned but anyone reading the register kept under section 102 of the act will be able to keep track of such actions. Although an appeals process is available, Mr Levitt did not use it. Mr Levitt, who was convicted of deceiving the self-regulating body Fimbra about the financial condition of his company, will not be able to re-enter the business without the express permission of the SIB. That means he is not allowed to hold a controlling interest in a company in the securities industry, although he may be allowed to own a few shares in an authorised business. Outrage followed the sentencing of Mr Levitt to perform only 180 hours community service, especially after photos of him celebrating his sentence showed him sipping expensive champagne in a well-appointed north London home. Mr Levitt has since said in press interviews that he intends to leave the securities industry, concentrating instead on becoming a sports management consultant through his contacts with Home Box Office television in the US. He has also said he is interested in selling a new kind of steam cleaner. The Serious Fraud Office had been criticisd for allowing Mr Levitt to be tried on a single charge of deceiving the regulator rather than broader charges of fraudulent trading. In addition to wealthy individuals, leading insurance companies lost millions investing in his company.</p>

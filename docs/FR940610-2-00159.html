Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule G&hyph;20 is intended to prevent commercial bribery. The rule has three basic parts. First, rule G&hyph;20(a) prohibits dealers from, directly or indirectly, giving or permitting to be given any thing or service of value in excess of $100 per year to any person, other than to an employee or partner of the dealer, in relation to municipal securities activities of the person's employer. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  All gifts given by a dealer and its associated persons are used to compute the $100 limitation. The $100 limitation applies to gifts and gratuities to customers, individuals associated with issuers, and employees of other dealers. In addition, based on the rule's ``directly or indirectly'' language, if a third party (e.g., a consultant hired by a dealer) gives a gift to any such person at the request of the dealer, the value of the gift would be included in the $100 limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Person'' has been interpreted by the Board in the context of rule G&hyph;20 to apply only to natural persons because the intent of the rule is to discourage dealers from inducing individual employees to act in a manner inconsistent with their obligations to, or contrary to the interests of, their employers. MSRB Interpretation of March 19, 1980. MSRB Manual (CCH) &para;3571.24.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, rule G&hyph;20(b) exempts certain payments from the $100 annual limit set forth in paragraph (a). These payments are termed ``normal business dealings'' and are defined as occasional gifts of meals or tickets to theatrical, sporting, and other entertainments, as well as the sponsoring of legitimate business functions that are recognized by the IRS as deductible business expenses, and gifts or reminder advertising. However, the rule also provides that such gifts cannot be so frequent or so expensive as to raise a suggestion of unethical conduct. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, rule G&hyph;20(c) provides that contracts of employment with or compensation for services rendered are not considered gifts or gratuities subject to the $100 limitation. Such arrangements, however, must be in writing and must include the nature of the proposed services, the amount of the proposed compensation, and the written consent of such person's employer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

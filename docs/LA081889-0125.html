			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> FIRST-BORNS LIKELY TO BE SPOILED BRATS, NEW STUDY SHOWS  </P> <P> First-borns have long enjoyed reputations as leaders, but a new study suggests  they are also likely to grow up to be spoiled brats.  </P> <P> Charles E. Joubert, a professor of psychology at the University of North  Alabama who studied 29 first-borns, 33 middle-borns and 43 last-borns, found  that first-borns scored higher on a narcissism test. The test measured such  attributes as self-absorption, lack of empathy and a grandiose sense of  self-importance. Sex was a factor too. First-born men scored higher than  first-born women.  </P> <P> Parental pampering may be to blame for first-borns' narcissism. "For a few  years, they are often the little kings or queens of the house," Joubert says.  "They could grow up with the idea that the world revolves around them."  </P> <P> Although other researchers have suggested a link between being born first in  the family and a lack of empathy, UCLA psychologist Frederick Frankel thinks  calling first-borns narcissistic is taking it too far. "Narcissism implies a  pathological condition," he says. First-borns may tend to be self-centered, he  says, "but it doesn't necessarily mean you can't be sympathetic. Being  self-centered is a quality, I think, necessary for leadership."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, what is the best way to deal with a spouse or friend who displays  narcissistic qualities? "Point out that others have needs and demands too,"  Joubert says. "In some cases, it might be a real revelation to them, and they  won't take offense."  </P> <P> For the record, Frankel and Joubert are both first-borns. KATHLEEN DOHENY  </P></p>

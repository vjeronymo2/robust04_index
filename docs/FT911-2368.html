			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Marks and Spencer adopts a harsh diet: Reasons for the retailer's cuts Just one month into his tenure at the helm of Marks and Spencer, Mr Rick Greenbury has made it abundantly clear that a new regime reigns at Britain's best-known retailer. Although the review of head office staff was begun six months ago under Mr David Sieff, the director of corporate affairs, few analysts in the City were in much doubt yesterday about who was the driving force behind the changes. 'What we are seeing is the transition from a safe, jobs-for-life type organisation into a meritocracy,' said Mr Mark Husson, retail analyst at Warburg Securities. 'A lot of dead wood is now to be thrown overboard. Mr Greenbury is a very hard and very commercial man who is quite prepared to take the tough decisions.' Marks and Spencer presented the decision to shed 850 jobs as just an exercise in good housekeeping; but there is little doubt that its hand has to some extent been forced by the severity of the recession sweeping the UK's high streets. 'We are determined to keep a strong hold on our cost base,' a spokesman for M and S said yesterday. In the early days of the recession, M and S appeared to be weathering the storm well and a quiet optimism suffused the company at a time when all around were screaming. Customers remained loyal to the company and, if anything, seemed to be attracted to the M and S reputation for dependable products and conservative styles - virtues criticised as dull in the previous decade. The company also benefited from its financial prudence during the 1980s. It had retained the freeholds on most of its properties rather than indulge in the fashionable sale-and-leasebacks which enabled other companies to fund their great expansion drives. A big investment in information technology - estimated at Pounds 300m during the last three-and-a-half years - has also enabled the company to increase its productivity levels and trim its cost structure. Its total payroll costs as a percentage of sales - at 9.9 per cent - is second only to Argos in the retailing sector and way ahead of such competitors as Burton at 14.3 per cent and Boots at 15.1 per cent. But despite these undoubted strengths, the company cannot expect to combat the general industrial trends indefinitely. As Mrs Joan D'Olier, retailing analyst at County NatWest, says: 'Although M and S is well-placed to cope with the recession, that does not mean that it is immune from it.' Analysts' forecasts reflect that view. Since the beginning of the year, they have been trimming profits expectations. County NatWest, for example, has pencilled in Pounds 620m for the company's pre-tax profits  - to be announced on May 14 - representing only a modest advance on last year's Pounds 604.2m. Uncertainty about the economic climate has also had an effect on the company's staff. They are not so keen to take a chance by leaving to join other less solid companies. A spokesman for M and S said yesterday: 'We have had exceptionally low turnover in junior management over the last 18 months which has led to over-staffing and meant that we cannot progress these people through to a meaningful management position.' This low turnover had already forced the company to postpone the entry of 100 of the 150 graduate trainees it was due to take on this September. It is not yet clear what other areas may be affected by the reappraisal of the M and S business structure. But one possibility is a review of staff benefits. Ever since the establishment of the company's welfare department in 1934, for example, M and S has set the gold standard in occupational healthcare. The seventh floor of the Baker Street head office houses a gym, a dentist, doctors, nurses, an osteopath, physiotherapists and health administrators. Breast and cervical screening are available to female staff and also to wives of male employees. Even ex-employees may, some years after they have ceased to work for the company, be entitled to follow-up healthcare. Exhibitions, videos and health literature form part of the extensive preventative programme: a video and leaflet, for example, on testicular self-examination were designed to make sure male employees did not feel excluded. Most of this provision is an act of faith. When asked why the company spends so lavishly on the health of its employees, managers reply that it 'feels right' to do so. There is no doubt that occupational healthcare of such a high standard cuts down on absenteeism and increases productivity. But there is unlikely to be much hard financial evidence of this within the organisation, due to the long-term nature of the provision. At least some pruning of healthcare would, therefore, not be unexpected. The same could be the case for other staff benefits, where a trend away from paternalism is already in evidence: hairdressing and chiropody, for example, are less popular perks than they once were, particularly among younger staff. 'To a certain extent, M and S has always been carrying a lot of fat and it is the first time that it has gone on a diet,' says Mr Husson of Warburg Securities. The new dietary regime may be overdue; but under Mr Greenbury's direction, it seems likely to prove a rigorous one.</p>

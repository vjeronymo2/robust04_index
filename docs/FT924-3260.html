			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / World Trade News: France targets third world FRANCE is planning to increase its development aid budget to help stimulate third world markets, Mr Michel Sapin, its finance minister, said yesterday. By the end of the decade annual aid spending would be raised from last year's 0.56 per cent of gross domestic product, or FFr30bn (Pounds 3.64bn), to 0.7 per cent, he told a meeting of advisers from the Direction des Relations Economiques Exterieures, the state foreign trade board. Its current aid budget, which has risen by 6 per cent a year over the past decade, is already well above the 0.31 per cent average for the Group of Seven richest industrialised nations. 'We are aiming to ensure durable development in these countries,' he said. At the same time Mr Sapin recognised that budget constraints would oblige France to be more selective in channelling aid. Concessional finance would be limited to the poorest countries. Sales to other markets would be offered export credit insurance through the Coface state organisation according to those countries' risk premiums. Mr Sapin was speaking on the second of a five-day gathering of the trade board's 172 foreign-based economic councillors, called as part of a campaign to improve its sensitivity to the needs of French exporters and companies planning foreign investments.</p>

And as far as Finland is concerned it hit the jackpot  with regard to Aland. The EU [European Union] accepts all the  opt-outs that Finland has demanded for Aland.    This means that the Alanders can continue to limit the right  to buy property and to set up businesses to citizens of Aland.  Aland will also be able to keep tax-free sales on its ferries  after 1999, which means that in this respect Aland will be  regarded as a third country in relation to the EU.    "This is something very positive. This means that the  Lagting [Aland legislative assembly] can accept the protocol and  that Aland can also become a member of the EU," said department  chief Peter Lindback who represented Aland in the negotiations  with the EU.    Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen also said that  Finland has given a guarantee that Aland will not become a tax  haven, despite its special status.    Yesterday morning the 12 member countries reached agreement  on a common line on support funds for the northern regions. In  the past, the member countries have been unwilling to classify  the northern regions as as poor and backward as the poorest  regions in the EU that are classified as Objective 1 regions. A  simple name change for the fund cut through the Gordian knot.    Some ECU170 million from the EU's joint coffers -- that is,  in part from the candidate nations themselves -- are included in  the projected Objective 6 fund. This is around 10 percent less  than the proposal of the Commission, which in its first proposal  classified these same regions as Objective 1 regions -- that is,  regions with backward development and with an average income  below 75 percent of the average income in the EU.    Instead of calling these regions Objective 1 regions, the EU  wants to put them in a completely new category -- Objective 6.  Isolation is the single criterion for entitlement to money from  this fund that covers the eastern parts of Finland, the inland  areas of Norrland in Sweden, and the four northernmost Norwegian  provinces. There must be less than eight inhabitants per square  kilometer for regions to qualify for these funds. Only  Burgenland in applicant country Austria is classified as an  Objective 1 region.    The other funds cover northern agriculture. Here member  countries have agreed on the following criteria for approving  national support -- that is, money that will come from the  Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish taxpayers: The agricultural  region must lie north of the 62d parallel, it must be sparsely  populated (less than 10 inhabitants per square kilometer, the  area cultivated must be less than 10 percent of the region, and  of this 10 percent a maximum of 20 percent can be devoted to the  cultivation of grain.    French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said that  regional support must be formulated in such a way that a  precedent is not set for other regions in the EU. The  agricultural support for the northern regions must also be  structured in such a way that it does not give an unfair  advantage over the farmers in member nations.    When the discussions were in difficulty on Monday [21  February] evening the Spaniards put forward a list of possible  names for the new funds -- a list that helped to lighten the  atmosphere: THOR, ODIN, VIKING, AMIGOS, and FIORD. These  abbreviations are to be read as Territorial Help for Overfrozen  Regions, One-Off Donation to the Icy North, Very Important Kitty  for Implementing Nordic Goals, Arctic Most Isolated Genuinely  Overfrozen System, and finally Financial Instrument for  Overfrozen Regions' Demands.    Agreement was reached instead on the less flamboyant  Objective 6. The reactions from Swedish circles were positive:    "This is an indication of an opening," Agriculture Minister  Karl-Erik Olsson said, "but a lot still remains to be done."    European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel also said that he  was very satisfied after the round of negotiations, but he also  noted that Sweden's demand for a phasing-in of payments to the  EU's coffers was given an icy reception.    "This is something that is bound to be resolved at the very  end," a well-briefed source at the Council of Ministers said.    After yesterday's discussions Finland and Sweden are in a  very good position on the eve of the final spurt in the  negotiations. The major problems lie with Austria, which is  demanding that it be allowed to keep the agreement on transit  traffic that already exists between the EU and Austria.  However, the EU takes the view that this agreement is a barrier  to trade since it makes transit through the Alpine country more  difficult.    "But the Swiss referendum last Sunday [20 February] changed  the situation somewhat," Lamassoure said at a news briefing.    The Swiss voted to stop all foreign transit traffic through  the country -- which will mean large increases in costs  especially for Germany and Italy, which are used to transporting  their goods through Switzerland.    The Austrians pointed to the position of the Swiss as an  argument for their country's position.    The other very difficult question is to do with Norway's  position in the fisheries negotiations. The Norwegians want  full market access -- something to which the French and the  British are opposed, out of a fear of dumping. At the same time  the Norwegians do not want to give away any fishing waters --  something that is unacceptable to Spain.</p>

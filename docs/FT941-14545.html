			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Mexican uprising dents Colosio's image: The sudden emergence of an old rival puts the presidential favourite under pressure Three weeks ago Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, was preparing for an electoral campaign which many assumed would be little more than a formality. Like all his party's previous candidates, he was overwhelming favourite to become Mexico's next head of state. Today such complacency has been dented. The New Year's uprising in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas, in which more than 100 people have died, and sudden re-emergence of Mr Manuel Camacho, his main rival for the party nomination, have fuelled old doubts about Mr Colosio's credentials for the job, and raised new ones about unity in the PRI. The uprising in Chiapas, although confined to a few thousand guerrillas, has given fresh weight to criticisms of the economic and political model followed by President Carlos Salinas. As the hand-picked successor to Mr Salinas, and self-styled candidate of continuity, Mr Colosio and his programme have been wounded by such attacks. While the Chiapas uprising has focused attention on poverty and under-development in Mexico, the main beneficiary may not be the leftist opposition, headed by Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, says Mr Federico Estevez, a professor at the Itam university. The uprising, he says, will make voters more worried about personal safety and political stability, and thus wary of supporting a party that calls for a radical overhaul of the existing political establishment. Instead Mr Camacho may emerge as the main winner. After his appointment to the high-profile job of restoring peace to Chiapas, Mexico's newspaper columnists immediately speculated that Mr Camacho would use his position to challenge for the presidency, either from inside or outside the ruling party. The speculation was fuelled in part by the announcement that Mr Camacho had asked not to receive a salary in his new role and would not form part of the government, freeing him, should he wish, to become a candidate. Mr Camacho was mayor of Mexico City and a possible presidential candidate until November, when Mr Colosio was unveiled as the PRI presidential candidate. In an unusually frank resignation speech, Mr Camacho promised to continue in politics and fight for advances in democracy. He pledged loyalty to to the government of President Salinas, but not to the PRI. The possibility of a Camacho candidacy is still extremely remote. He is not popular in the PRI, partly because of his desire to introduce more democratic reforms, nor with the economist technocrats who have risen to power in the past decade and suspect him of populist tendencies. He would stand little if any chance of winning as an independent candidate, given the PRI's huge advantages in organisation and money over other parties. 'Mr Camacho is ambitious but not mad,' says Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, an editor at El Financiero newspaper who dismisses speculation of a candidacy this year. There is little doubt that Mr Colosio has been damaged by his old rival's new prominence. The appointment of the ambitious Mr Camacho has made Mr Colosio look weak. Mr Salinas announced the appointment on the very day Mr Colosio's election campaign started, suggesting to some a calculated snub. Mr Colosio has decided to respond to the threat of Mr Camacho by saying next to nothing - exposing him to further criticism of being weak and ineffectual. An influential columnist in El Universal described his campaign as all but invisible. Mr Colosio's supporters say that there is plenty of time before the August elections to recover from the poor start, and that any attempt to benefit from the crisis in Chiapas would backfire. Such views reinforce long-held criticism that Mr Colosio is too passive and lacks independent ideas to make a good president. Mr Colosio's platform will be modified by events in Chiapas. The candidate will focus more on anti-poverty and regional development aspects of his programme than hitherto, supporters say. He is also likely to emphasise further his promise of free and fair elections, in answer to those who argue that the Chiapas uprising occurred as a result of a lack of democracy in the country.

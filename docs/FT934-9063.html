			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Anti-Maastricht fight goes on THE anti-federalists who laid treason charges against Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, because of the government's signing of the Maastricht treaty have vowed to fight on, in spite of a Crown Prosecution Service ruling against further action. Mr Rodney Atkinson, a business executive and brother of the comedian Rowan Atkinson, said yesterday he and Mr Norris McWhirter, chairman of the Freedom Association, had written to the CPS challenging its interpretation of the law. If this does not force a rethink, said Mr Atkinson, he and Mr McWhirter intend to submit their case to the judicial committee of the Privy Council.</p>

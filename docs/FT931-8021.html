			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Dollar at new low The US dollar opened at a low of Y117.62 in Tokyo today. It was continuing a slide begun after US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen called on Friday for a stronger yen to cut Japan's trade surplus with Washington. The dollar closed at Y118.315 in New York on Friday. Currency dealers also believe that a meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in London later this month may push for a stronger yen and urge Japan to boost its sluggish economy.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Argument on economic targets is back to front Sir, In his column, 'Beware Ivy League central bankers' (June 13), Sir Samuel Brittan criticises the dependence of central bankers on academic economists 'of the mainstream US Ivy League variety'. As an example of the errors of Ivy League thinking, he cites the argument in a paper I presented at the Bank of England's tercentenary conference, that an inflation target is preferable to a price level target. He exhorted readers and central bankers to treat mainstream economics sceptically. Sir Samuel is right that mainstream economics should be treated with a large dose of scepticism, almost as big a dose as is required for the arguments of economics columnists. And since MIT is not in the Ivy League, I could be persuaded of his views on Ivy League economists if his other arguments made sense. Unfortunately, though, Sir Samuel's column reveals a serious misunderstanding of the issues about which he wrote. To simplify the discussion, suppose that a central bank faces the choice between aiming for a constant price level, or a zero inflation rate. At first glance, these targets seem to be the same. The difference between them is that a central bank with a price level target tries to make up for past failures to hit the target. Thus, if an inflationary shock in a given period raises prices above the target level, the central bank has to aim to reduce prices to get back to the target level. Or if a favourable price shock reduces prices in such a period, the central bank has to compensate by producing inflation in some future period. With a zero inflation target, the central bank lets bygones be bygones, and aims to keep the price level constant at today's level. Thus Sir Samuel gets it precisely backwards when he characterises a price stability regime as one in which prices are as likely to fall as rise, with the best bet being that prices in the distant future will be the same as they are today. That is true with a zero inflation target. It is not true with a price level target: under that regime, when the price level is below target, the future price level is most likely to be above today's level, and vice versa. I discuss the choice between the two approaches in more detail in my paper. The choice of a price level target brings the benefit of greater certainty about the price level in the long run at the cost of greater variability of inflation in the short run. The greater inflation variability under a price level target results from the fact that every shock to inflation has to be followed by an offsetting change in the price level in the opposite direction. I argue for the inflation rate target because I fear the consequences of having to aim to deflate the economy half the time, which is what the price level approach requires. Sir Samuel grandly dismisses this concern by describing my fear of deflation as extreme. This is armchair theorising of the worst sort. All economists know that it is theoretically possible to reduce prices through a pre-announced monetary policy, at no cost in terms of output. But that has not been done successfully in the post-second world war period; rather deflations and disinflations produce recessions. That has been so even for the most credible central bank, the Bundesbank, as the experience of the last few years confirms. That basic fact underlies my reluctance to advocate a policy that requires periods of negative inflation  -even though I recognise the theoretical possibility that eventually, perhaps, people will be willing to accept nominal wage cuts rather than fight them as they do now. Lest all this sound academic, consider the example of Germany. The Bundesbank has a target inflation rate of 2 per cent. Over the past four years, German inflation has averaged 4 per cent, implying that German prices have risen by 8 per cent more than targeted during that period. The Bundesbank fought the inflation with tight money, and now, at the cost of recession, German inflation is close to its target range. That is regarded as a success; it is that success that permits Europe to begin growing again. But under Sir Samuel's prescription, the Bundesbank would be only half done: it would still have to reduce the price level by an extra 8 per cent. That would be deflationary overkill, causing social costs to little positive purpose. Sir Samuel's argument does not make sense.

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / S African budget must address conflicting aims: The harsh constraints on Derek Keys as he presents his plans today MR Derek Keys, an accomplished bridge player and a self-acknowledged 'deal-maker', will be hard pressed to pull any tricks from the dog-eared fiscal hand he has been dealt when presenting South Africa's budget to parliament this afternoon. Expectations of the country's finance minister are high. It is a measure of the importance of today's budget that it has managed to overshadow, in recent days, the country's normal political preoccupations. And while taxation changes will enjoy the normal close scrutiny, the focus of attention will be on the bigger picture. Observers are hoping Mr Keys's first budget, and probably the National party's last, will mark a new era in the management of government finances. In this sense, it is the second instalment in a two-part package. Last week saw the long awaited release of the government's economic restructuring plan  -a 305-page document which details the dramatic changes required if South Africa is to achieve the sort of economic growth necessary to finance the developmental challenges it faces. Mr Keys, former chairman of the mining house Gencor, needs to breathe some life into an economy moribund after four years of recession, and start the long-term task of economic restructuring. The past months, however, have seen the minister also place considerable stress on two other goals - reducing the deficit and stimulating growth - which are not only in conflict with each other but, at least in the case of stimulating growth, clash with the longer-term restructuring aims. Reconciling these goals, stimulatory against contractionary, would be difficult at the best of times. These, however, are not the best of times and Mr Keys faces constraints which will severely limit his room for manoeuvre. Chief among these are the weak state of the economy - showing no signs of an upturn after four years of recession - and a budget deficit for fiscal 1992-93 likely to be in the order of 9 per cent of gross domestic product. Perhaps the best that Mr Keys can hope for is that he presents a budget which enjoys credibility. First, and most obvious, he will have to come up with a credible set of numbers. Revenue and spending estimates made by the government in recent years have been woefully inept. The challenge this time will be to produce a deficit reduction plan which is not premised on heroic and unachievable cuts in government spending, and pie-in-the-sky estimates of economic growth. Best estimates suggest the budget deficit target is likely to be R25bn (Pounds 5.6bn), or 6.5 per cent of GDP. Less than that would not only stretch the credulity of the bond markets, but would also risk aggravating the current recession. The reduction is most likely to be achieved through a real decline in government spending - cert-ainly in the consumption component - and an increase in the VAT rate, probably to 13 per cent from 10 per cent now. Second, he will be required to prove the government's commitment to restructuring, as outlined last week, by making a serious attempt to implement these goals. A good start has already been made with the government standing firm in its refusal to offer civil servants - whose wage bill is more than half of all state spending - a wage increase of more than 5 per cent. Finally, and perhaps most important, his budget will have to enjoy credibility with the African National Congress, the main black political grouping, and its trade union ally Cosatu. Without their support - or, at least, the absence of outright opposition - sane economic management in South Africa is impossible. Mr Keys has acknowledged this, so it can be expected that he will go to some lengths to put a 'human face' on the budget, stressing its developmental as well as its growth features. With unsurprising rhetoric, both the ANC and Cosatu have branded the budget an 'apartheid budget'. But they have come closer to putting their finger on a matter of real public concern in focusing on the expenditure side of the budget. To a large extent Mr Keys has been a supply-side minister, his efforts devoted to improving the growth capacity of the economy. In recent months, however, a flood of revelations about government corruption and maladministration have given South Africans the impression of a 'gravy train' for those in state service. Most businessmen and taxpayers would endorse the ANC's calls for performance auditing and greater transparency in the spending of public money. The public mood demands that Mr Keys try to show that the government is getting value for money from its spending. For business and consumers, while he will not shirk delivering some tough messages, he will also be doing his utmost to stimulate confidence. Finding this trump card, though, will test even Mr Keys's ingenuity.</p>

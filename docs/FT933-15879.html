			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: 'Lack of leadership' hits Uruguay Round hopes THE chances of concluding a Uruguay Round world trade reform deal are slipping away because 'nobody is exerting the leadership to force this thing through,' according to Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau, the US agricultural lobby. Mr Kleckner, in Europe for talks with the EC Commission, French farm organisations and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade officials in Geneva, said he had arrived with 'a little better than 50/50' prognosis for the Round, but was leaving Brussels feeling the odds were now against a deal. If the Round failed, he warned, 'we are going to enter a period of trade wars, Gatt (dispute) panels. . . and more regional and bilateral trade deals,' in which the US would turn its back on Europe. Mr Kleckner had been a strenuous lobbyist in the 18 months of negotiations leading up to last year's EC-US deal on farm trade and oilseeds subsidies, reached at Blair House in Washington and one of the foundation stones of any eventual Uruguay Round success. The oilseeds agreement was ratified by the EC last month, but French opposition to curbs on subsidised food exports has called into question the rest of the package, which is part of the Uruguay Round proper. Mr Kleckner said he won assurances from senior Commission officials that the EC regarded the deal as indivisible. But he warned that if the Uruguay Round part of Blair House 'is going to be renegotiated, oilseeds has to be renegotiated too. We didn't think that was a very good agreement at all.'</p>

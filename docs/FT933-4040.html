			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Observer: Stage fright Superstitious thespians always take care to refer to Shakespeare's Macbeth as 'the Scottish play', since a direct reference to it is supposed to risk incurring bad luck. Could it be that Glasgow's Forte Crest hotel has an ex-actor for its manager? Observer's contacts within the Confederation of British Industry say it decided temporarily to rename the Lamont Suite as the Scottish Suite, during Kenneth Clarke's sojourn last night after his address to the annual dinner of the Scottish Confederation of British Industry. But it was clearly a joke; the duty manager at the hotel said Clarke stayed in the Buchanan Suite and that there were no plans to rename the aforementioned suite.</p>

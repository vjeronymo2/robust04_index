Sellasamy, general secretary  of the Ceylon Workers Congress and state minister, has appealed  to President D.B. Wijetunge and A.S. Senaviratne, inspector  general of the police in Colombo, to take immediate steps to  stop these arrests.    During the harvest festival of Pongal, Tamil people go to  temples, visit their relatives, and participate in festivals.  State Minister Sellasamy told VIRAKESARI that he appealed to  the president to issue orders halting arrests over those days,  and that the president had accepted the appeal and given  assurances that he would issue orders to that effect.    On Thursday [13 January] alone, 97 people were arrested in  seven police station areas. The minister said that he asked  Inspector General of Police Seneviratne to release all of these  Tamils before the Pongal festival, and that Seneviratne informed  him that he would take action to release them.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Abstracts from the 6th Fall Meeting of the Ceramic Society </F> of Japan, 1993 held 6-8 Oct 93 in Kitakyushu, Japan, sponsored  by the Ceramic Society of Japan]    [Text]    Novel Characterization for Powder Particles in Ceramic Green  Body. K. Uematsu (Nagaoka University of Technology)    A novel method was developed to characterize powder  particles  in alumina powder compact. This method consists of the liquid  immersion technique coupled with polarized microscopy. New  features found in the green body include huge particles and  orientation of particles. The significance of these features on  the subsequent processing and properties of final ceramic is  discussed.    Effect of Pressing Pattern on Deformation of Granule During  Compaction Process. Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, and K. Uematsu (Nagaoka  University of Technology)    Internal structures of green bodies compacted with spray  dried alumina powder were examined by a liquid immersion  technique and SEM. The samples were prepared by uniaxial  pressing at various pressures and subsequent isostatical  pressing at 100 MPa. The voids between granules in the green  body decreased with increasing uniaxial pressure.    Temperature Change of Viscosity Characteristics of Silicon  Nitride Slurry. A. Umino, Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, K. Uematsu  (Nagaoka University of Technology), and T. Ogata (Toray)    The effect of temperature on viscosity of slurry was  examined  in this study at various dispersant concentrations. The  viscosity of slurry decreased with increasing temperature. At  all temperatures, the minimum viscosities were found in the  dispersant concentration range of 2.6 to 2.8 wt%.    Synthesis of _b_+_b_-Alumina by Reaction Sintering. H.  Shinya  and Y. Hirata (Kagoshima U.)    Effects of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] addition on phase compositions  and electrical properties were investigated on  _b_+_b_-alumina  prepared by reaction sintering of  Na[.sub]2[/]O-MgO-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] at  1600-1620C. Addition of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] of 0.1-1  mol% based on the amount of _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  was effective to produce monolithic _b_ phase without  decreasing  significantly the bulk density of _b_-phase. Electrical  conductivity was lowered by the addition of BaTiO[.sub]3[/].    Control of Pore Diameter of Anatase Porous Ceramics by  Hydrothermal Hot-Pressing. K. Yanagisawa, M. Sasaki, M.  Nishioka, K. Ioku, and N. Yamasaki (Fac. Sci., Kochi Univ.)    Anatase porous ceramics were prepared from the spherical  particles of amorphous titania by hydrothermal hot-pressing.  Pores in the ceramics consisted of large ones corresponding to  interstices in secondary spherical particles, and small ones to  those in anatase fine crystals. The large pores vanished at high  temperature and pressure. The pore diameter distribution was  controlled by hydrothermal hot-pressing conditions.    Preparation of Silica Porous Ceramics by Hydrothermal  Hot-Pressing -- Microstructure Control and Compressive Strength.  K. Yanagisawa, M. Nishioka, K. Ioku, and N. Yamasaki (Fac. Sci.,  Kochi Univ.)    Porous ceramics were prepared from the commercial silica gel  consisted of fine spherical particles (diameter: 18 nm) by  hydrothermal hot-pressing at low temperatures below 300C.  The pore diameter distribution was controlled by hydrothermal  hot-pressing conditions. The relation between the pore diameter  distribution and the compressive strength is described.    Sintering Behavior of SiC During Hot Pressing. T. Shiroya,  H.  Yonezawa, K. Kijima, and T. Tanaka (Kyoto IT)    Silicon carbide powders containing 1 wt% carbon and  0-1 wt%  boron as additives were hot pressed at 1800-2200C under  20-40 MPa for 1 h in argon atmosphere. Effects of amount of  additives, sintering temperature, and pressure on sintered  density were investigated. In this study, only 0.15 wt%  boron  additive can promote densification of SiC powder compacts.    Fabrication of SiC/C Composite Materials by Employing COPNA  Resin as a Carbon Source. M. Iio, T. Maekawa, Y. Takao, Y.  Shimizu, and M. Egashira (Nagasaki University)    SiC/C composite materials were fabricated by firing  SiC/COPNA  resin or SiC/SiO[.sub]2[/]/COPNA resin mixtures in  N[.sub]2[/] or Ar atmosphere at temperatures in the range of  1000 to 2000C for 2 h. In the latter system, the  SiO[.sub]2[/] content in the composite materials decreased  with increasing firing temperature, and formation of whiskers  was observed when they were fired at 1300-1500C. On the  other hand, no whiskers were found in the composite materials  fired above 1800C, suggesting the formation of SiC  particles by the reaction of SiO[.sub]2[/] with COPNA resin,  and also the potential advantage of COPNA resin in promoting the  reaction sintering of SiC ceramics.    Preparation of Ceramic Fiber/Alumina/Metal Composites by  Reactive Infiltration Process. K. Inoue, T. Watari, T. Torikai,  and O. Matsuda (Faculty of Science and Engineering, Saga  University)    Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al and ceramic  fiber/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al composites were prepared  by the infiltration of Al metal into  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] or  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/fiber compacts accompanying the  oxidation of Al metal. It needs the aid of glass to proceed this  process. The effects of infiltration conditions such as  temperature, atmosphere, the kinds of glass and porous body, on  oxidation growth of composite were examined. According to this  process, a dense ZrO[.sub]2[/]  fiber/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al composites could be  obtained without shrinkage.    Synthesis of Zirconia Dried Gel by Metal Alkoxide. Y.  Shimizu, K. Kobayashi, and M. Koizumi (The University of Ryukoku)    Isopropanol solution of zirconium n-butoxide was prepared by  adding diethanolamine. The prepared solution was hydrolysised to  form wet gel. Through syneresis process, monolithic zirconia  dried gel were obtained by the careful heat-treatment.    Study of Phases in Rare-Earth Modified Zirconia Synthesized  by Coprecipitation Process. M. Ozawa and S. Suzuki (Nagoya  Institute of Technology), C.-K. Loong and J. W. Richardson  (Argonne National Laboratory, U.S.A.)    The crystal structure of rare-earth modified zirconia from  coprecipitation process were studied by neutron and X-ray  diffraction technique. A Rietveld analysis of neutron-ray powder  patterns revealed a tetragonal phase with relaxation of oxygen  in Zr[.sub]0.9[/]La[.sub]0.1[/]O[.sub]1.95[/] and  Zr[.sub]0.9[/]Nd[.sub]0.1[/]O[.sub]1.95[/].    Effect of Al-Alkoxide Addition on Sinterability and Strength  of Zirconia. M. Inaba, Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, K. Uematsu (Nagaoka  Univ. of Tech.), K. Mori, M. Sumi (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,  Ltd.)    This study presents the effect of Al-alkoxide addition on  sinterability and strength of YSZ. The addition of 1-3  mol%  Al-alkoxide reduced the sintering temperature by about 100C  and increased the strength by about 80%.    Surface Area of CeO[.sub]2[/] Powder Fabricated by Various  Methods. N. Okumura, A. Akiyama, and Y. Ikuma (Kanagawa I.T.)    Cerium oxide powder was fabricated from  Ce(SO[.sub]4[/])[.sub]2[/] or  Ce(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/] solution to which various kinds  of organic acids were added. After calcination at 850C, the  powders were characterized by SEM and BET. It was found that for  Ce(SO[.sub]4[/])[.sub]2[/], dicarboxylic acid was the best  acid and for Ce(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/], aliphatic oxy  acid was the best.    Mesopore Control of Macroporous Silica Gels Having  Phase-Separated Morphology by Solvent Exchange. K. Kitayama, K.  Nakanishi, and N. Soga (Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto Univ.)    Silica gels having phase-separated interconnected morphology  in micrometer range have been prepared by hydrolyzing  alkoxysilane in the presence of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). In  order to modify the structure in nanometer range, solvent  exchange treatments in various aqueous solutions have been  performed. When the gels were leached in an aqueous ammonia  solution, their pore size changed drastically. In basic  condition, the pore size reached an equilibrium value under  constant solution pH and temperature. The equilibrium pore size  increased as solution pH or temperature was raised.    Effect of Ultrasound on Ripening of Aluminogels (2). M.  Katsumoto, N. Enomoto, and Z. Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Engin. Matls.,  TIT)    High-power ultrasound was applied to the ripening of  amorphous aluminogels in aqueous solution. When ultrasonicated  at a lower power of the sonicator, the crystallization of the  gels was promoted; while at a higher power crystallization was  disturbed by ultrasonic treatment. It is thought that the  dissolution of gels was accelerated and as a result the  formation of bayerite was promoted by moderate sonication, but  that the growth of bayerite was suppressed by excessive  sonication.    Effect of Ultrasonic Irradiation on Precipitation of Ti  Oxalate From Solution (2). Hee-Lack Choi, Naoya Enomoto, and  Zenbe-e Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Eng. Mater., T.I.T.)    Ultrasonic irradiation was applied during the precipitation  of titanium oxalate in an ethanolic solution of oxalic acid. The  precipitation reaction was accelerated by ultrasound. In this  report, for the better understanding of ultrasonic effect on the  precipitation reaction we examined the reaction product which is  unidentified.    [.sup]27[/]Al NMR Study of the  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Formation Process From Chemically  Modified Al-Alkoxides. N. Tohge (Kinki University), K. Tadanaga,  T. Iwami, and T. Minami (Osaka Prefecture University)    The formation processes of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] from  Al-alkoxide chemically modified with ethylacetoacetate (EAcAc)  were investigated using [.sup]27[/]Al NMR. [.sup]27[/]Al  NMR spectra showed that the reaction of EAcAc with  Al(O-sec-Bu)[.sup]3[/] led to the formation of  six-coordinated structural units. It was found that many kinds  of condensed six-coordinated structural units, most of which  were chelated with EAcAc, were present in the sols after  hydrolysis.    Preparation of Ferrite/Alloy Composite Powders Using Redox  Reaction. H. Kobayashi, K. Saito, N. Hiratsuka, and T. Mitamura  (Saitama University)    The composite powders of nickel zinc ferrite and nickel-iron  alloy were prepared from _a_-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/],  NiCl[.sub]2[/] and Zn under an Ar gas stream using redox  reaction. Ni-Fe alloy powder, nickel zinc ferrite powder and  non-magnetic zinc oxide powder were produced with increasing of  Zn amount and heating temperature. The lattice constant of the  ferrite was increased with dissolving Zn into the ferrite. The  saturation magnetization and coercive force of the composite  powders prepared were 89.7 emu/g and 78.6 Oe, respectively.    Synthesis of MoSi[.sub]2[/] Powder by Carbothermal  Reduction Process. Y. Ishizaka and J. Hojo (Fac. Eng., Kyushu  Univ.)    MoSi[.sub]2[/] powder was prepared by a carbothermal  reduction process using MoO[.sub]3[/], quartz and active  carbon at 1400C in Ar + H[.sub]2[/] (50%) atmosphere.  Excess quartz was needed to produce MoSi[.sub]2[/] single  phase without lower silicides (Mo[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/],  Mo[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/]C). After treated with HF  solution, the powder was 0.5-2 m in size.  MoSi[.sub]2[/]-SiC composite powder was also obtained by  adjusting an excess of quartz and active carbon.    Synthesis of Organic Derivatives of Zirconium Phosphate by a  New-Developed Interlayer Amidation Method. T. Kijima, S.  Watanabe, and M. Machida (Miyazaki University)    A new approach to organic derivatives of zirconium phosphate  through interlayer amidation was applied to the zirconium  carboxyethylphosphonate-alkyldiamines and -alkylmonoamines  systems and the applicability to both systems is discussed.    Synthesis and Structure of a New Layered Aluminum-Containing  Vanadium Oxide  (Al[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]1-x[/])[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5-4x[/](OH)[.sub]4x[/]  .  Y. Oka, T. Yao, and N. Yamamoto (Kyoto U.)    A new vanadium oxide with a layered structure was  hydrothermally synthesized. The composition of the compound was  found to be  (Al[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]1-x[/])[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5-4x[/](OH)[.sub]4x[/]   and the X-ray Rietveld analysis revealed the double-sheet  structure of the M[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] layer (M = V, Al)  analogous to those of the layered hydrated vanadium oxides. The  layers are held by hydrogen bonds.    Preparation, Structure and Intercalation of Chalcogenides  With Layered Composite Crystal Structures. Y. Oosawa, Y. Gotoh,  J. Akimoto, M. Sohma, H. Hayakawa (NIMCR), and M. Onoda (NIRIM)    Three kinds of selenides with layered composite crystal  structures are formed in Pb-Nb-Se system: (PbSe)1.14(NbSe2)m  ([A] for m = 1, [B] for m = 2, [C] for m = 3). Dependence of the  product species on the preparation temperature and composition  has been investigated. Rietvelt analyses of [B], [C] and their  N2H4.H20 intercalation compounds with 0 0 L diffraction profile  have been carried out to determine the atomic coordinates in the  layer-stacking direction. Two new selenides have been found in  the Pb-Ti-Se system.    Effect of Neutron Irradiation on Knoop Microhardness of  MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Single Crystal. T. Yano, M.  Ikari (Res. Lab. Nucl. Reactors, TIT), and T. Iseki (Dept.  Inorg. Mater., TIT)    The Knoop microhardness of several orientations on the (100)  surface of neutron irradiated and unirradiated  MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] single crystals were  measured. It was confirmed that the Knoop microhardness of the  MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] single crystal was hardened  by about 4-14% by the neutron irradiation. Both of the  (111)  &lt;110&gt;  and the (110) &lt;110&gt;  slip systems  are simultaneously active in the unirradiated crystal, however,  in the neutron irradiated crystal, the (111) &lt;110&gt;  should be the dominant slip system.    Preparation and Properties of Si Doped  Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] Crystals. Shigeru  Okada, Tuyoshi Nakayama, Kunio Kudou, Kenya Hamano (Kanagawa  University), and Torsten Lundstrom (Uppsala University)    Si doped Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/]  crystals were prepared by the reaction between aluminium,  silicon and boron powders using a molten copper flux under an  argon atmosphere. As-grown Si doped  Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] crystals were  used for the study of measurements of density and unit cell  dimensions. The largest crystals prepared have the maximum  dimensions of about 2.88mm x 2.20mm x 2.16mm.    Hedvall Effect of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] on Sintering  Behavior of (Co,Ni)O. A. Nakajima and H. Segawa (Nikko Kyodo  Co., Ltd.)    Effect of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] addition on sintering  of (Co,Ni)O was investigated. Starting  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] had amorphous phase, and it  accelerated densification of (Co,Ni)O by making solid solution  at the temperature of its crystallization. This acceleration was  considered to be caused by increasing diffusion constant as a  result of crystallization of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  subsequent to increasing the amount of making solid solution.    The Effect of ZrO[.sub]2[/] Addition on NiO-CoO Solid  Solution. R. Suzuki, H. Nakamura, and H. Segawa (Nikko Kyodo  Co., Ltd.)    Relationship between density, microstructure of sintered  body  and the amount of added ZrO[.sub]2[/] was investigated. As a  result of this investigation, when the amount of added  ZrO[.sub]2[/] was 3 to 4 wt%, the density of sintered body  was the maximum and the sintered body added 0.2 wt%  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] had higher density. Average grain  size decreased with increasing the amount of added  ZrO[.sub]2[/].    Synthesis of Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/] System Powder  and Its Sinterability. S. Tanaka (Tosoh Co.), S. Nagashima and  A. Kato (Kyushu University)    An Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  hydrate-coated TiO[.sub]2[/] powder was synthesized by a  homogeneous precipitation technique and its sinterability was  studied. Densities of sintered bodies increased in calcination  temperature (800-1350C) and sintering temperature  (1400-1500C). Crystalline phase in sintered bodies were  Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/],  _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/],  Y[.sub]2[/]Ti[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]7[/]. Effect of stirring  rate during synthesis of powder on morphology and sinterability  of product was also studied.    Preparation and Sintering Behavior of Alumina-Coated  SiC(w,p). H. Nakamura, K. Naito, M. Yoshinaga, and A. Kato  (Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu Univ.)    Preparation of alumina-coated SiC whiskers or SiC particles  and their sinterability were studied. Stirring rate during  coating gives a marked effect on morphology of precipitate.  Stirring rate required for preparation of coalescence-free  coated body depends on the volume of reacting solution. Use of  alumina-coated SiC powder for sintering improved the  distribution of SiC in Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], indicating  that coated particles were useful for good distribution of  dispersed phase in matrix phase.    Effect of SiO[.sub]2[/] Addition on the Synthesis and  Sinterability of Mg-Al Spinel. Insuk Yi, Naoya Enomoto, and  Zenbe-e Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Eng. Mat., TIT)    The sinterability of Mg-Al spinel doped with SiO[.sub]2[/]  have been studied by X-ray diffractometry and Scanning Electron  microscope. The addition of SiO[.sub]2[/] remarkably decrease  the porosity of the specimens sintered at 1500C for 2 h.  This is due to the formation of liquid phase such as cordierite  etc. during densifying.    Effect of Impurities Addition on the Phase Change in  Li[.sub]2[/]Ti[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7[/]. D. Tsubone, K.  Igarashi, and T. Shimizu (Chiba Institute of Technology)    Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-added R (ramsdellite) phase was  synthesized by the melt-quenching method. The phase changes in  the Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-added R phase occurred  similarly to the non-added R phase following the route  quenched-R H (hexagonal phase) S+r (spinel and rutile)  R. But addition of Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] retarded  the H S+r successive decomposition reaction and stabilized  the H phase at high temperatures.    B1-Type Tantalum Nitride Synthesized by Shock Compression  and  Its Some Properties. Suguru Tashiro, Tsutomu Mashimo (Kumamoto  University), Katsuyoshi Oh-ishi, Yasuhiko Syono (Tohoku  University)    Shock compression recovery experiments of the porous sample  of tantalum nitride with a hexagonal structure (CoSn-type) were  performed in the impact velocity range up to 1.5 km/s to  synthesis B1-type tantalum nitride. Almost single phase B1-type  tantalum nitride bulk body was prepared by shock compression.  The lattice parameter of the shock synthesized B1-type phase was  determined to be a[.sub]0[/] = 0.43363+(1) nm. The chemical  formula was estimated to be TaN[.sub]0.96-0.99[/] by the  instrumental chemical analysis.    Coloration Due to Ni[.sup]2+[/] in CaO Matrix. T.  Nakashima, N. Motohira, Y. Nakamura, and H. Yanagida (Fac. of  Eng., Univ. of Tokyo)    Characteristic coloration is observed on  Ca[.sub]x[/]Ni[.sub]1-x[/]O (0.95 &lt; x &lt; 0.98) sintered  at higher temperatures. Their coloration shows variation with  NiO content and absorption at 490 nm decreased and 420,640 nm  appeared with increasing NiO content. From ESR spectra  coordination number of Ni[.sup]2+[/] is judged to vary from  stable six coordination into characteristic.    Sinterability and Oxygen Semipermeability of the Sintered  Bodies From La[.sub]0.6[/]Sr[.sub]0.4[/]CoO[.sub]3[/]  Powder. Y. Mutoh and T. Sakamoto (Fukuoka Ind. T. Center) K.  Morinaga and N. Yamazoe (Graduate School of Engineering  Sciences, Kyusyu Univ.)    La[.sub]0.6[/]Sr[.sub]0.4[/]CoO[.sub]3[/] powder  prepared by the thermal decomposition of acetic acids was  calcinated at 800-1100C and grinded for 1 day or 7 days in  ball mill. Particle size distribution of the powder grinded for  7 days was indepented [as published] of calcination temperature.  Relative density of 1200-1400C sintered bodies fabricated  from the powders calcinated at 900-1100C was  97-100%. The  relationship between the grain size of the sintered bodies and  oxygen permeability was discussed.    The Effect of Dispersing Medium on Mechanical Properties of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. H. Kitayama, A. Nakahira, and K.  Niihara (ISIR, Osaka University)    By milling in organic medium, organic species were adsorbed  on oxide powder surface. Effects of these organic species on the  sintering process were investigated. Microstructural observation  revealed that the adsorbed species had effects on the  microstructure of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. Variations of  some mechanical properties with the adsorbed species will be  discussed.    Effect of Microstructure on Mechanical Properties of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Ceramics. T. Koyama, A. Nishiyama  (Mitsubishi Materials), and K. Niihara (Osaka University)    Bending strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy and  crack extension resistance were evaluated for  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics with equi-axed and  platelet grains. The bending strength decreased and the fracture  toughness (SEPB) increased with an increase in the grain size  for Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics with equi-axed and  platelet grains, but the ceramics with platelet grains had  higher toughness and the maximum value was 6.6 MPa  m[.sup]1/2[/].    Fabrication of Functionally Gradient Ceramics by Planetary  Slip Casting. H. Kobayashi (College of Industrial Technology)    Functionally gradient Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] having  different particle sizes and  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-ZrSiO[.sub]4[/] pipe ceramics  were fabricated in plaster molds by the planetary slip casting  method. The molds set on a disk revolved both round its axis and  on their axis. The functionally structures were controlled by  changing the casting time of each slurry during green forming  and the revolutions per minute of molds.    Study on Mullite-Zircon Composite Materials (Part 1). K.  Hamano and U. Yanagida (Kanagawa U.)    From mixture of kaolin and zirconia, zircon began to form at  around the temperature of transformation of  monoclinic-tetragonal zirconia. So mullite-zircon composite  materials could be prepared from the mixtures of kaolin, alumina  and zirconia. The maximum amount of zircon formation can be  obtained at about 1500C, and at higher the zircon was  decomposed. Mechanical properties of the composites were  improved with increase of ``nominal content of zircon,'' i.e.,  zirconia addition and raising their firing temperature up to  about 1500C, and further their thermal expansion  coefficient was a little lowered with increase of ``the nominal  content of zircon.''    Aluminium Titanate Formation From Mixtures of Corundum and  Rutile. A. Kamezaki, K. Hamano, and S. Okada (Dept. of Appl.  Chem., Faculty of Engineering, Kanagawa U.)    Aluminium titanate (AT) formation between fine corundum  powder and coarse rutile single crystals, or fine rutile powder  and coarse corundum single crystals were observed. AT layer was  formed inside of rutile phase, and grew with holding time up to  about 8 hours, and then rate of the growth decreased. From the  result of polarization microscope observation, a part of the AT  layer was formed with parallel orientated AT grains of 10  m-20 m in size.    Formation and Properties of Ln-Si-O-N Glasses. M. Ohashi, K.  Nakamura, K. Hirao, and S. Kanzaki (GIRIN)    The homogeneous Y-Si-O-N glasses containing nitrogen atoms  of  15 or 20 eq% were prepared from the compositions in the  vicinity of the eutectic point which has the lowest temperature  in those on SiO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] phase  diagram. The density, the elastic moduli and the glass  transition temperature of the glasses increased with  incorporation of N. The coefficient of thermal expansion, the  density, the elastic moduli and the transition temperature  increased with Y content. Furthermore, the effect of cationic  field strength on properties of Ln-Si-O-N glasses (where Ln =  lanthanides or Y) was investigated.    Preparation of Cordierite Film for the Substrate of  Electronic Circuit by the Sol-Gel Process. K. Etou, T. Sei, and  T. Tsuchiya (Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology,  Science University of Tokyo)    The preparation of cordierite thin films was investigated by  the sol-gel process. The coordination number of Al was analyzed  by NMR measurement due to the used solvent effect.    Hot Compaction of PSZ Powder Utilizing Underwater-Shock  Wave.  R. Tomoshige (Kumamoto Institute of Technology), Y. Kakoki, K.  Imamura, M. Nishida, and A. Chiba (Kumamoto University)    Partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) powder was hot-compacted  by using underwater-shock wave. The obtained compacts were  heat-treated at 1473 to 1873 K for 5 h. The compacts and  heat-treated ones were investigated by hardness and fracture  toughness tests and electron microscopy. Our experimental  results are summarized as follows: (1) The compacts heat-treated  above 1673 K showed higher hardness values than commercial  products. (2) Fracture toughness value of 12.0 MPa  (m)[.sup]1/2[/] was observed in the compacts heat-treated at  1673 K.    Slip Casting of Silicon Nitride and Mechanical Properties of  Sintered Body (Part 5). S. Sano, K. Oda, Y. Shibasaki (GIRIN),  and K. Ohshima (Toshiba Ceramics)    The slip casting of silicon nitride was studied to develop a  complicated shape forming method for the fabrication of  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] engineering ceramics. In this  study, Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] produced by silica  reduction was used as the starting powder. From the slurry  containing 75 wt% solid, a high density green body (2.03  g/cm[.sup]3[/]) was obtained. The  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] sintered at 1775C for 10 h at  0.9 MPa N[.sub]2[/] pressure showed high flexural strength of  about 1 GPa.    Microstructural Control of _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  by Addition of _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Seeds. N.  Hirosaki, Y. Okamoto, Y. Akimune (Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.), and  M. Mitomo (NIRIM)    Microstructural development during liquid-phase sintering of  fine _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powder containing large  _b_ particles was studied. The large grains acted as seeds for  grain growth and in-situ composite microstructure containing  size-controlled large grains was obtained.    Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Compact Prepared by Spark  Plasma Sintering. M. Omori, A. Okubo, and T. Hirai (IMR Tohoku  University)    Y[.sub]4[/]Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]9[/] is the compound  with martensitic transformation. To synthesize a toughened  ceramic like zirconia, the growth of grains was depressed using  a spark plasma sintering equipment.  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] reacted with  Y[.sub]4[/]Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]9[/], so the strength and  toughness was decreased. The grain size of  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was controlled under 250 m and  good for the toughness. It is necessary to suppress the reaction.    Dual Phase Sialon (9). Sintering Reaction Between  Y-_a_'-Sialon and _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. Y. Ukyo and  S. Wada (Toyota Central Research and Development Labs. Inc.)    Sintering reaction between Y-_a_'-sialon and  _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was investigated by  hot-pressing the mixtures of _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  powders containing various amount of Y-_a_'-sialon. Shrinkage  proceeded rapidly above 1600C and amount of Y-_a_'-sialon  in starting powders did not affect the shrinkage behavior. No  other phase was formed during sintering. Sintered bodies were  composed of _b_'-sialon and Y-_a_'-sialon of which solid  solubility was lower than that of starting powders.    Sintering of Ground BN Powders From a Different Starting  Material. T. Hagio and Y. Yoshida (Government Industrial  Research Institute, Kyusyu)    BN ceramics were fabricated by normal sintering method using  various BN powders which were obtained by heating a synthesized  BN powder at a different temperature. The powders alone were  hard to sinter with a large free expansion. The grinding alters  BN powder to make its consolidated compact strong on heat  treatment. Relatively dense BN ceramics was obtained from the  ground powder of well-crystallized BN.    Slip Casting of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-W Continuous  Functionally Gradient Material. M. Hidaka, H. Takebe, K.  Morinaga (Department of Materials Science and Technology,  Graduate School of Engineering Sciences, Kyushu University), J.  Chu, K. Hayashi (TOTO Ltd.)    A continuous functionally gradient material was produced  using slip casting method. The difference of the sedimentary  velocity of particles within a slip due to the density  difference among the species and the size difference among the  particles were used to obtain a body with gradually distributed  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and W contents. Compositional  gradient within this type of samples were examined by electron  probe microanalysis.    Properties of SiC-BN Nanocomposites and Effect of  TiB[.sub]2[/]-Addition. N. Oyama, J. Hojo (Fac. Eng., Kyushu  Univ.), K. Kishi, S. Umebayashi (Gov. Ind. Res. Inst. Kyushu)    SiC-BN nanocomposites were produced by hot-pressing of the  fine composite powder. The nanocomposites showed a remarkable  improvement of thermal shock resistance compared with  conventional SiC-BN composites produced from the mixed powder.  However, the fracture toughness was reduced. The addition of  TiB[.sub]2[/] particles to SiC-BN nanocomposite increased the  fracture toughness without a serious decrease in thermal shock  resistance.    Strengthening of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Matrix  Composites by the Addition of SiC Particles. T. Hirano, A.  Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR, Osaka University)    Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] matrix composites reinforced by  5 vol% of SiC particles having different particle sizes  were  fabricated using the hot-pressing technique. The average  particle size of added SiC particles were 3.50, 1.26, 0.27, 0.15  and 0.04 m respectively. The mechanical properties and  microstructure of these composites were investigated. The  relative density was slightly increased, on increasing the size  of added SiC particles. The maximum average strength of these  composites was 1.3 GPa after the addition of SiC particles  having an average particle size of 0.27 m. Beside 0.04  m  SiC addition, the fracture toughness were independent of the  size of added SiC particles.    Mechanical Properties and Processing of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG Composites by Formation of  YAG Phase. B. K. Jang (U. Tokyo), M. Enoki and T. Kishi (RCAST,  U. Tokyo)    Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/SiC/YAG hybrid composite were  fabricated by hot-pressing. The grain size of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] monolith increased with increasing  sintering temperature and sintering time, while that of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG composites was effectively  restrained due to the incorporation of YAG and SiC particulates  into alumina matrix. The mechanical properties, such as bending  strength and fracture toughness of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG composites were higher  than that of alumina monolith.    Study of Self-Reinforced Behavior of Silicon Nitride  Ceramics  by Reaction Bonding Methods. Yoshiyuki Yasutomi, Motoyuki  Miyata, and Shigeru Kikuchi (Hitachi Res. Lab., Hitachi, Ltd.)    The nitridation mechanism depends on the Si powder size. In  case of fine Si powder, the Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] grains  corresponds to size of original Si particles, which was produced  by nitrogen diffusion in the Si particles. On the other hand, in  case of large Si powder, long elongated  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] grains are produced in the  nitrided body by vapor-liquid-solid reaction route. In this  study, microstructure control of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  ceramics by using reaction bonding method with mixtures of the  two type Si powder is discussed. The effect of controlling the  Si powder size on mechanical properties of reaction bonded  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics was investigated.    Fabrication and Mechanical Properties of Zirconia/Alumina  Whisker Composites. N. Tamari, T. Tanaka, and I. Kondoh (GIRI,  Osaka)    On the fabrication of zirconia/alumina whisker composites  using hot-pressing, although little improvement of bending  strengths was observed, fracture toughness became higher by  replacing zirconia containing 3 mol% yttria with zirconia  containing 2 mol% yttria. The technique of spark plasma  sintering brought on dense zirconia/alumina whisker composites  at lower temperature than hot-pressing and the composites with  higher bending strengths and fracture toughness than hot-pressed  bodies.    Silicon Carbide Fiber Reinforced Si-N Composites Prepared by  Polysilazane Impregnation Method (1). H. Morozumi, K. Sato, A.  Tezuka, H. Kaya, and T. Isoda (TONEN Corporation)    High strength silicon carbide fiber reinforced Si-N  composites (-307 MPa) were obtained by applying polysilazane  impregnation and pyrolysis method to a plain weave stacked  prepreg. These 2D composites showed the same effectiveness as  carbon fiber reinforced Si-N composites.    Influence of Fiber-Sheet Distance on the Mechanical  Properties of SiC Fiber Reinforced SiAlON. Ueno Kazuo, Inoue  Takahiro (GIRI, Osaka), Teremoto Naohiro (Osaka Elect. Commun.  Univ., Undergraduate School)    SiAlON composite reinforced with CVD SiC fiber was  fabricated  from the alternative stacking of matrix green and SiC fiber  sheet with different distance between the fiber sheet, by  hot-pressing at 1500C under the N[.sub]2[/] pressure of  0.2 MPa for 30 min. Full-dense composite contains the fiber  sheets with the distance of 0.56-1.0mm. Ambient temperature  bending strength of the composite (ca. 350 MPa) is comparative  with that of monolithic SiAlON, but high temperature strength at  1000C is improved. The composite having the fiber sheet  distance of 0.67mm shows the highest value of the  work-of-fracture, that is, ca. 2100 J/m[.sup]2[/] among other  composites, that is far bigger than the value of monolithic, 100  J/m[.sup]2[/].    Synthesis of Glass/Alumina Composite by Crystallization of  Corundum. A. Matsumoto and T. Nishikawa (TOTO Ltd.)    Alumina dispersed glass composite was synthesized by  corundum  crystallization from glass matrix. The composite was prepared by  firing sericite or kaolinite-nepherine syenite, all of which are  cheap natural products. Corundum grew as hexagonal plate  crystals dispersed so uniformly that can't be expected by  alumina premixing method.    Colloidal Processing of New Zealand Kaolin. Yuji Higashi and  Yoshihiro Hirata (Kagoshima Univ.)    New Zealand kaolin and alumina woven fabrics were formed  into  laminated composites (57 vol% woven fabrics) by doctor  blade  method of aqueous suspensions containing polyacrylic ammonium  and methyl cellulose at pH 8. The green composites were  hot-pressed to 86.3% theoretical density at 1350C  for 1 hr  at 39 MPa in a N[.sub]2[/] atmosphere.    Synthesis of Bismuth Oxide-Clay Composites by an  Intercalation. T. Endo, T. Izumitani, H. Takizawa, M. Shimada  (Tohoku Univ.), and S. Shin (Nat. Inst. Mater. Chem. Res.)    Bismuth oxide-clay composites were prepared by the  intercalation of polynuclear species such as  Bi[.sub]6[/]O[.sub]4[/](OH)[.sub]8[/][.sup]2+[/]  etc. formed as a result of hydrolysis of  4BiNO[.sub]3[/](OH)[.sub]2[/]BiO(OH) in distilled water at  95C. The basal plane of the resulting composite was in the  range of 16-32 A depending on the concentration of Bi-species.  On calcining below 400C, the surface area was about 180  m[.sup]2[/]/g for the 16A-composite and 10 m[.sup]2[/]/g  for the 32A-composite, respectively. This result was perhaps  responsible for the different stratification of Bi-species.    Mechanical Properties of Cement Paste Dispersed Graphite  Particles. T. Nishikawa, C. Ishikawa, and M. Takatsu (NIT)    Compressive, bending strength or fracture toughness of  cement  pastes dispersed the non-reactive graphite particles was  investigated. The addition of graphite caused the increase of  bending strength, but the decrease of compressive strength. The  results were discussed according to the fracture energy and the  crack propagation.    Synthesis of Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Materials Using a  Silicate Cluster. I. Hasegawa, M. Ishida, and S. Motojima (Gifu  University)    A new type of inorganic-organic hybrid materials have been  synthesized by the reaction of a silicate cluster with the  double four-membered ring structure  (Si[.sub]8[/]O[.sub]20[/][.sup]8-[/]) and  dimethyldichlorosilane in 2.2-dimethoxypropane. IR and  solid-state CP MAS [.sup]29[/]Si NMR spectroscopies of solid  products indicated that the products are composed of the  Si[.sub]8[/]O[.sub]20[/][.sup]8-[/] structure as a  building unit which is linked by  (CH[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]Si units. The products were  thermally stable up to 370C in air and increased in  specific surface area by heating at 300C.    Preparation of Screen Printing Inks With Oxide Phosphors. S.  Tsutsumi (Fuji Seisakusho Co., Ltd.), N. Sakamoto (Fukuoka Ind.  Tech. Center), and K. Muraoka (Graduate School of Engineering  Sciences, Kyushu Univ.)    Viscosity control of high concentrated suspensions was  studied to establish a preparation guide of screen printing ink  with oxide phosphors. Flow curves (relationship bet. shear rate  and shear stress) of ink samples were approximated with an  equation _ee_ = k[.sup]-1[/]_s_[.sup]1-n[/], where _ee_, k,  _s_ and n were apparent viscosity, viscosity index, shear  stress  and flow index, respectively. It was found that n was useful and  simple parameter to control viscosities of screen printing inks.    Preparation of  Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Thin Films  by Sol-Gel Method. S. Yoneda, S. Takahashi, and M. Kuwabara  (Kyushu IT)    Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] thin  films were prepared on BaPbO[.sub]3[/] substrates by sol-gel  method. The perovskite phase was formed in the films by firing  at 600C, while in the form of powder firing at 900C  was required to yield the perovskite phase. It has been  confirmed that the use of BaPbO[.sub]3[/] having a perovskite  structure as a substrate was effective to lower the temperature  of the Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/]  perovskite phase.    Preparation and Optical Properties of  TiO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] Coatings by the Sol-Gel  Process. Chii-Shyang Hwang and Chou Wen-Chung (National Cheng  Kung University)    TiO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] optical films were prepared  by the dip-coating via modified hydrolysis of Ti &amp; Si  alkoxides.  The film thickness, microstructures and the properties of films  were investigated, by the various process parameters including  composition and viscosity of solution, withdrawing speed of  substrate, heat treatment condition.    Preparation of Transparent and Conductive Cadmium Stannate  Thin Films by Sol-Gel Method. T. Furusaki, S. Azuma, J.  Takahashi, and K. Kodaira (Hokkaido University)    Transparent and conductive Cd[.sub]2[/]SnO[.sub]4[/]  thin films were prepared on fused silica substrates at  550-750C in a covered crucible by sol-gel method. The  films were smooth and were strongly adhesive to a substrate. The  thickness of the films was 100 nm.    Synthesis and Characterization of Amorphous  LiNbO[.sub]3[/] Particles Derived From Metal Alkoxides. S.  Ono, Y. Nishi, and H. Mochizuki (Nagoya Municipal Industrial  Research Institute)    Amorphous LiNbO[.sub]3[/] particles can be produced from  the dehydration of LiNb(OH)[.sub]6[/] particles by  heat-treatment at 200C for 2 h. LiNb(OH)[.sub]6[/]  particles precipitate by hydrolyzing the lithium and niobium  double alkoxides solutions under the controlled H[.sub]2[/]O  concentration in the range of  Rw(H[.sub]2[/]O/LiNb(OEt)[.sub]6[/])4.0-7.5. Particles  radii varied from 40 nm to 100 nm with increasing the  H[.sub]2[/]O concentrations and showed narrow size  distributions.    Preparation and Crystallization of Fine Alkoxide-Derived  Mullite/SiC or Mullite/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Composite  Precursor Powders. H. Suzuki, H. Nishiuti (Toyota Technological  Institute), and H. Kamiya (Tokyo University of Agriculture and  Technology)    Fine composite precursor powders of mullite/SiC or  mullite/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] were prepared by  spray-drying the precursor solutions with uniformly dispersed  SiC ultra-fine powders or Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  whiskers. This novel process will allow distribution of SiC or  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] in the raw powders, leading to the  high-performance composite ceramics by sintering these precursor  powders. This paper describes the morphology and crystallization  behavior of composite precursor powders prepared by this novel  process. Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] reacted at relatively low  temperature with mullite precursor in the ambient atmosphere,  whereas SiC did not react after crystallization of orthorhombic  mullite. The results showed that the composite ceramics with  very uniform structure or nanosize-composites can be prepared by  sintering these composite precursor powders.    Effect of Prehydrolysis on the Structure of a Complex  Alkoxide as a Cordierite Precursor and Their Crystallization  Behavior. T. Fukui (Krosaki Co.), C. Sakurai (Nippon Steel Co.),  and M. Okuyama (NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd.)    The complex alkoxides as cordierite precursors were  synthesized by reactions of prehydrolyzed TEOSs with Al and Mg  alkoxides, and effect of prehydrolysis on an alkoxide structure  was analyzed by IR, [.sup]27[/]Al- and [.sup]29[/]Si-NMR  spectroscopies. The crystallization of the resultant gels from  the complex alkoxides was also studied, and a relation between  the alkoxide structure and the crystallization was considered.  When water ratio to TEOS (H[.sub]2[/]O/TEOS) of prehydrolysis  is &lt;1.2, the (EtO)[.sub]3[/]Si-Al = structure in the complex  alkoxide increases with increasing water ratio. When  H[.sub]2[/]O/TEOS is &gt; 1.2, the condensation degree of  aluminosilicate skeleton (-(Si-O-Al)[.sub]n[/]-) increases  with increasing water ratio. Mg alkoxide coordinates to the Al  atom in aluminosilicate regardless of water ratio of  prehydrolysis. For a temperature at the low end of the range for  formation of _a_-cordierite, increasing the water ratio of  prehydrolysis is effective under these hydrolysis conditions,  because a larger number of Si-O-Al bondings are introduced into  the Mg-Al-Si complex alkoxides.    Effects of Seeding on Phase Transformation and Microcracking  in Complex-Alkoxide-Derived Cordierite. M. Okuyama (NGK Spark  Plug), T. Fukui (Kurosaki Refractory), and C. Sakurai (Nippon  Steel)    Cordierite gel powder prepared by the hydrolysis of an  alkoxide-complex was seeded with crystalline _a_-cordierite  particles. The seeding appeared to promote a direct formation of  the _a_-cordierite from the amorphous state. The development of  microcracks due to -_a_ cordierite transformation could be  prevented by the modified crystallization behavior, resulting in  the improved flexural strength of _a_-cordierite of 190 MPa.  The  seeding also lowered the crystallization temperatures of  _a_-cordierite to 900C, which could be attributed to the  epitaxial crystallization of the chemically homogeneous mother  powder.    Pyrolysis Process of Poly(isopropyliminoalane) as an AlN  Precursor. Y. Saitoh, Y. Sugahara, and K. Kuroda (Waseda  University)    The pyrolysis of an AlN precursor,  poly(isopropyliminoalane),  was investigated by means of TG-MS and TG-GCMS. The major weight  loss occurred between 220C and 540C. Compounds  containing aluminium and hydrocarbons were detected in the  temperature range 220-320C and 320-540C, respectively.    Development of Fabrication Technique of a Ceramic Particles  Monolayer Useful for Designing Functional Films. K. Umeda, K.  Kawanabe, Y. Takao, Y. Shimizu, and M. Egashira (Nagasaki  University)    Attempts were made to develop fabrication technique of a  monolayer consisting of uniform and spherical SiO[.sub]2[/]  fine particles. Dehydration-condensation reactions between  surface hydroxyl groups on a Si substrate and carboxyl groups in  a dicarboxylic acid film prepared on the substrate by the  Langmuir-Brodgett process, followed by the same reactions  between surface hydroxyl groups on SiO[.sub]2[/] particles  and carboxyl groups at the opposite side of the film, enabled us  to fabricate a monolayer of SiO[.sub]2[/] particles tightly  bonded to the substrate. In addition, it was revealed that  pretreatment of SiO[.sub]2[/] particles with boric acid was  indispensable for fabricating a closed packing monolayer.    Patterning of Oxide Thin Films by the Photolysis of  Chemically Modified Metal-Alkoxides. N. Tohge (Kinki U.), K.  Shinmou and T. Minami (Osaka Pref. U.)    UV irradiation on the gel films prepared from Zr or  Ti-alkoxides modified with _b_-diketone dissociated the chelate  bonds in the films and made the gel films insoluble in leaching  solutions. Based on these changes in properties of gel films by  the UV irradiation, fine-patterning process for oxide films such  as ZrO[.sub]2[/] and TiO[.sub]2[/] have been developed.    Preparation of BaWO[.sub]4[/] Thin Film by an  Electrochemical Method. Woo-Seok Cho, Osamu Asai, Masatomo  Yashima, Masato Kakihana, and Masahiro Yoshimura (T.I.T.)    BaWO[.sub]4[/] film has been prepared on W substrate in  aqueous solutions containing barium ion at room temperature by  electrochemical method. Highly crystalline BaWO[.sub]4[/]  films were prepared even at room temperature without any heat  treatment. The thin films consist of grains with about 1 m  in  size. The weight change of deposited film was dependent on the  holding time and the applied current density during the  electrolysis.    Electrochemical Synthesis of Ferroelectric Oxide Films and  Their Electrical Properties. H. Adachi, Y. Matsumoto, and J.  Hombo (Kumamoto University)    BaTiO[.sub]3[/] thin films were prepared by  electrochemical reduction on stainless steel in aqueous  solutions containing both Ba[.sup]2+[/] and Ti[.sup]4+[/].  Cracks occurred during heat-treatment in the films were improved  by various additives act as siftor or depressor. Dielectric  properties of these films were investigated.    Preparation and Dielectric Properties of BaTiO[.sub]3[/]  by Chemical Process. K. Satoh and Y. Suzuki (Shonan IT)    Crystalline BaTiO[.sub]3[/] particles were prepared at  room temperature from Ba-Ti solution which was obtained by  mixing Ti(O[.sup]i[/]Pr)[.sub]4[/] and methanol suspension  of Ba(OH)[.sub]2[/] As-prepared powders were crystalline with  nanometer particle size. The sintered BaTiO[.sub]3[/] showed  a dielectric constant of about 2000 at room temperature.    Formation of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] From Single Crystal of Ba-Ti  Isopropoxide. Y. Suyama (JFCC), M. Nagasawa (TTI), Y. Tomokiyo,  T. Manabe (Kyusyu Univ.)    Single crystals of metal alkoxide complexes have the  possibility of direct conversion into oxides with well-defined  and homogeneous composition at atomic level. We synthesized a  single crystal of Ba-Ti isopropoxide, and the crystal was found  to be converted into BaTiO[.sub]3[/] at 100C. The  particle size and crystal structure of BaTiO[.sub]3[/]  derived from the Ba-Ti isopropoxide crystal were investigated.    Barium Titanate Ceramics Prepared From Ba-Ti-O Amorphous  Fine  Particles. S. Wada, T. Suzuki, and T. Noma (Faculty of  Technology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology)    Ba-Ti-O amorphous fine particles were synthesized by mist  decomposition method from barium and titanium nitrates. Barium  titanate ceramics with various grain sizes (30-500 nm) were  prepared by hot pressing (50 MPa, 1000-1100C) of these  particles. These dielectric constants decreased as the average  grain sizes of barium titanate ceramics decreased, and the size  effect was observed in the ceramics with the average grain size  greater than 30 nm.    Low-Temperature Synthesis of  Ba(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Ta[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Perovskite  by Hydrolysis of Metal Alkoxides. S. Katayama, I. Yoshinaga, T.  Nagai, and M. Sugiyama (Nippon Steel Co.)    Crystalline  Ba(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Ta[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] powders  were synthesized at a low temperature (around 100C) by  hydrolysis of Ba, Mg, and Ta alkoxides. The alkoxides were  hydrolyzed in the H[.sub]2[/]O:OR ratio (r) of 10 under  refluxing to yield a crystalline precipitate, although the  hydrolysis with a small amount of water (r = 2) gave an  amorphous precipitate. In the case of non-refluxing, amorphous  precipitates were obtained, even in the ratio of r = 10.    Synthesis of  Pb(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Powders  From Nitrate Solutions. Yoshio Yoshikawa (Nihon University)    Chemical synthesis of fine PMN powders has been limited by  difficulties in the availability of a niobium precursor  compatible with chemical routes. Coprecipitation methods were  investigated using an aqueous solution of lead and magnesium  nitrates, and peroxo-niobium complexes prepared from niobium  hydrogen oxalate with hydrogen peroxide. Coprecipitate  characteristics as a function of reaction conditions will be  discussed.    Synthesis of (Pb, La) (Zr, Ti)O[.sub]3[/] Powders by  Polymerized Complex Method. O. Uchiyama, Y.

Yellowish  transparent polymer resin containing Pb, La, Zr and Ti ions was  obtained through the polyesterification between citrate  complexes and ethylenglycol without any precipitation.    Structure and Characterization of  La[.sub]1-x[/]Sr[.sub]x[/]MnO[.sub]3[/] Synthesized  From Acetate. K. Kitagawa, K. Yamana, S. Nakamura (IRII), and K.  Kitagawa (Kanazawa U.)    Fine powder of  La[.sub]1-x[/]Sr[.sub]x[/]MnO[.sub]3[/] electrode was  synthesized with using metal acetate solutions. Crystal  structures of X = 0.1 and 0.2 were different from those of X =  0.3 and 0.4. La[.sub]1-x[/]Sr[.sub]x[/]MnO[.sub]3[/] (X  = 0.3) showed the highest power generation activity. It was  assumed that the amount of Mn[.sup]4+[/] and oxygen vacancy  increased with increasing Sr[.sup]2+[/].    Electroless Deposition of La(Sr)MnO[.sub]3[/] Perovskite  Films. T. Sasaki, Y. Matsumoto, and J. Hombo (Kumamoto  University)    La[.sub]1-x[/]MnO[.sub]3[/] perovskite precursor was  electrolessly deposited on YSZ from a solution containing  Mn[.sup]2+[/], La[.sup]3+[/] and oxidizing agent. This  film was immersed in a solution containing Sr[.sup]2+[/]  ions. The amount of Sr incorporated into the precursor was  dependent on the concentration of Sr[.sup]2+[/] ion in the  solution and the immersion time.    Growth of SrTiO[.sub]3[/] Thin Film by Hydrothermal  Electrochemical Method. K. Kajiyoshi, K. Tomono, Y. Hamaji  (Murata Mfg. Co., Ltd.), and M. Yoshimura (Res. Lab. Eng.  Mater., TIT)    Thin films of SrTiO[.sub]3[/] were grown beyond a  thickness limit of ca. 25 nm hitherto attained by modifying the  electrolysis part of the method. The film thickness increased  linearly to more than 2 m with an increase in current passed  through the Ti anode. Current efficiency increased from 0.8 to  3.0% with decreasing potential of the Ti anode from +16.0  to  +8.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.    Synthesis of Spherical Hollow Particles From TEOS. K.  Kamiya,  K. Uchida, A. Kawai, and F. Ikazaki (N.I.M.C.)    Synthesis of spherical hollow silica particles by  interfacial  reaction of O/W emulsion was investigated. Partially hydrolyzed  TEOS was prepared by stirring the solution of  TEOS:C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH:H[.sub]2[/]O:HCl  (0.9:9:1.3:0.03 mol) for 90 min. The partially hydrolyzed TEOS  was mixed with di-butyl phthalate and the mixture was emulsified  by homogenizer in water containing surfactant, followed by  hydrolysis with ammonia. Yield of spherical hollow silica  particles of about 50% was obtained. The effect of  operating  conditions on the characteristics of the prepared spherical  hollow silica particles was conducted.    Preparation of ZnS and CdS Fine Particles From Thiourea  Complexes by the Spray-Pyrolysis. N. Tohge, S. Tamaki (Kinki  Univ.), K. Okuyama and Y. Hori (Hiroshima Univ.)    ZnS and CdS fine particles have been prepared by the  spray-pyrolysis using aqueous solutions of thiourea complexes of  metal nitrates and characterized in terms of preparation  conditions. The sulfide fine particles of Wurtzite structure in  submicrometer were obtained in a temperature range from 600 to  800C.    Continuous Preparation of Monodisperse Fine Particles Using  Couette-Tayler Vortex Flow Reactor. Takashi Ogihara, Teruaki  Yanagawa, Nobuo Ogata, and Koukichi Yoshida (Faculty of  Engineering, Fukui University)    Couette-Tayler vortex flow reactor, in which metal alkoxide  was continuously hydrolyzed in dilute alcohol solution, was  designed. Several types of metal alkoxide were used and then  this reactor successfully led to the formation of monodisperse  powders. It was found that this reactor was available for  sol-gel route.    Synthesis of Nanometer-Sized ZnO Fine Particles. T.  Horiuchi,  T. Sugiyama, and K. Ushiki (Government Industrial Research  Institute, Nagoya)    Transparent zinc oxide colloids were synthesized. Particle  size of the colloid were between 2 to 3 nm and the crystalline  phase of them was Zincite at any synthesis temperatures. A blue  shift of absorption edge was also observed in UV-VIS absorption  spectra. As the synthesis temperature increased, the absorption  edge shifted to longer wavelength.    Initial Precipitation Behavior of Aluminum Hydroxide  Particles. M. Yada, H. Nagai, and A. Kato (Kyushu University)    On the synthesis of aluminum salt solution by homogeneous  precipitation method using urea, the initial precipitation  behavior of aluminum hydroxide in the presence of sulfate ion  was investigated. It was observed that the growth of aluminum  hydroxide particles occurred discretely up to ca. 80 nm in  diameter, but above this size the growth occurred by  accompanying the particle coalescence in the course of the  precipitation of aluminum hydroxide.    Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Boron or Carbon-Rich  B[.sub]4[/]C Crystals. Knio Kudou, Shigeru Okada, Torsten  Lundstrom, Masaaki Miyamoto, and Yasuo Hikichi (Kanagawa U.,  Uppsala U., Kokushikan U., NIT.)    We have studied for the solid solubility of carbon or boron  elements in nearly stoichoimetric B[.sub]4[/]C. Carbon or  boron doped B[.sub]4[/]C crystals were preparation by  arc-melting method using B[.sub]4[/]C and carbon or boron  powders as starting materials in an argon atmosphere. Carbon or  boron-rich B[.sub]4[/]C crystals obtained were used for  measurements of Vickers microhardness and oxidation resistivity  at high temperature in air.    Sliding Behavior Between BN Composite Ceramics and Metal. T.  Takeuchi, Y. Tsutsui, and K. Sawano (Process Technology Research  Laboratories, Nippon Steel Corporation)    The friction and wear behaviors between  BN-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] composite ceramics and metal  were investigated using a pin-on-disk tester. The wear rate of  ceramic pins were strongly dependent on the surface roughness of  the metal disk. The coefficient of friction did not change  significantly in the case of rough surface metal, while the  coefficient decreased with increasing BN content in the case of  the smooth surface metal.    The Effect of Trace Impurities on the Sinterability and  Electrical Conductivity of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia With Small  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Additions (1-10 wt%). M. Mori, H.  Itoh, and T. Abe (CRIEPI)    Eight mol% yttria stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) with 1  wt%  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], which showed the highest  electrical conductivity at 1000C and the highest  sinterability, contained the least quantity of sodium after  heating at 1300 or 1400C. It is suggested that  Na[.sub]2[/]O-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/]  interaction at grain boundaries of 8YSZ particles offers a  possible explanation for the improvements in sinterability and  ionic conductivity.    Effects of Additional CuO on Sintering of  SnO[.sub]2[/]-Doped In[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Ceramics.  T. Matsushita (Kumamoto Institute of Technology) and H. Kagota  (Ferro Enamels (Japan) Limited)    The powder compacts of 2 at.%Sn-doped  In[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] were sintered at the temperature  range from 1000 to 1400C for 1 hr. The sintered ceramics  had the low bulk densities of 3.5 to 3.8 g/cm[.sup]3[/]. On  addition of CuO above 2 wt.% to the compacts, the bulk  densities of the ceramics increased up to 5.7 g/cm[.sup]3[/]  and their electrical resistivities decreased down to the order  of 10[.sup]-2[/] _O_cm with increasing the sintering  temperature.    Sintering Behavior of Lead-Based Multilayer Ceramic  Capacitors (MLC) With High Specific Capacitance. T. Mori, A.  Ochi (NEC, Fundamental Res. Labs.), and M. Kondo (NEC Circuit  Component Div.)    Ag-Pd alloy can be used as internal electrodes of lead-based  MLCs. Effects of silver on sintering of lead-based dielectric  ceramics were studied by measuring a sintering temperature of  dielectric ceramics added 0-0.5 mol% of silver. A 0.5  mol% of  silver addition causes a fall in sintering temperature by  150C. SEM observation around the internal electrodes of  MLCs were also done in order to study the sintering behavior.

Mn[.sub]6[/]N[.sub]5[/] and  Mn[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]2[/] films deposited on slide glass  exhibited the strong preferred orientation with the metal  closest packing plane paralleled to substrate surface.  Temperature dependence of electrical resistivity (_r_-T curve)  for Mn[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]2[/] showed metallic behavior and  that of Mn[.sub]6[/]N[.sub]5[/] exhibited metallic or  semiconductive depending on nitrogen content.

Fine composite powders of  SiO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] system were  produced from SiCl[.sub]4[/]-AlCl[.sub]3[/]-O[.sub]2[/]  reaction system. Powder products were amorphous. The particle  size was 40-200 nm. SiO[.sub]2[/] particles had a large  surface area near 300 m[.sup]2[/]/g because of the porous  structure. The surface area was reduced by the inclusion of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and the addition of  H[.sub]2[/]O to reaction atmosphere because pores in  particles disappeared.    Synthesis of Sialon Powder by Carbothermal Reduction of  Vapor-Phase-Reacted  SiO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Powder. Kiyoshi  Itatani, Natsuko Mizutani, Akira Kishioka, and Makio Kinoshita  (Sophia University)    _b_-Sialon powder has been prepared by the carbothermal  reduction of the vapor-phase-reacted  SiO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder.

Low carbon content amorphous AlN powder is prepared from  NH[.sub]3[/] and triethylaluminum (TEA) by vapor phase  reaction at 400-800C. The relation between the reaction  condition and the carbon content in the product powder was  investigated. It was revealed that the carbon in the amorphous  AlN powder consists of at least two species. One species is  derived from ethyl group of TEA, and another one is derived from  the carbon compound that is generated by TEA pyrolysis. These  carbon species have a difference in the volatility at the  elevated temperature in the crystallization process.    Silica Fiber Synthesized by Oxidation of SiO Gas. H. Kotaka  (Toshiba Ceramics, STK Ceramics Lab.) and H. Saito (Toyota  Technological Institute, STK Ceramics Lab.)

Ishihara, and Y. Takita (Faculty of Engineering, Oita  University)    The morphology and the yield of the  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] whiskers were varied by the  addition of transition metals such as Fe, Ni, Cr, and Co, i.e.,  diameter of the formed whiskers increased by the addition of Co  or Cr. It became apparent that Outside Whiskers grew on the wall  where temperature was 920-1335C in a tubular reactor  irrespective of starting materials.    Microwave Luminescence Properties of SiC Whiskers. K. Amita,  S. Sasada, Y. Takao, Y. Shimizu, and M. Egashira (Nagasaki  University)    Microwave luminescence properties of SiC whiskers prepared  by  thermal decomposition of sulfur-containing silicon oil have been  investigated under different atmospheres. Microwave luminescence  spectrum could be obtained in both low (0.3 Torr) and high  (0.001 Torr) vacuum for the whiskers prepared, but only in the  low vacuum for commercially available ones. All of sharp peaks  in the spectrum at the low vacuum were ascribed to residual  gases in the environment, but at the high vacuum a peak  corresponding to the band gap of _b_-SiC (2.3 eV) was observed  at around 550 nm, in addition to large and broad peaks beyond  600 nm.    Fabrication and Properties of SiAlON Reinforced With  Si-Ti-C-O Fiber. T. Inoue, S. Sodeoka, and K. Ueno (GIRIO)    SiAlON reinforced with Si-C-Ti-O fiber (with 3 wt%  Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as additive) composite was  hot-pressed at 1500C for 30 min. The composite showed lower  bending strength than that of monolithic SiAlON at room  temperature, but strength degradation at 1200C was improved  than that of monolithic SiAlON. The composite exhibited high  fracture toughness and the work of fracture.    Influence of Additional Element and Mechanical Property on  Joining PSZ to Titanium by Oxide Solder. I. Usui (Industrial  Technology Center of Saga)    The joining was performed using  Na[.sub]2[/]O-SiO[.sub]2[/]-TiO[.sub]2[/] system at  temperature of 1173 to 1373 K for 1.8 ks in vacuum. Addition of  Cu decreased the equilibrium contact angle between Titanium and  solder. Addition of MnO increased the bond strength. In the case  of PSZ/Na[.sub]2[/]O-SiO[.sub]2[/]-Cu-MnO-CoO/Titanium,  the bond strength was 72 MPa. Heat treatment at 573 K for  jointed specimen increased the bond strength to 120 MPa.    Wire Electro-Discharge Machining of the Structural Ceramics.  T. Matsuo and E. Oshima (Kumamoto University)    Conductive ceramics such as ZrO[.sub]2[/]-NbC. Sialon-TiN,  etc. were machined by a wire electro-discharge machine. The  work-plates of 10mm thickness have been cut by a 0.25mm dia.  brass wire in pure water. In this study, machining rate as well  as surface roughness was measured under different conditions and  NbC contents. Also, the side gap and warp were studied. Thus,  the optimum conductive carbide content and machining conditions  were evident for the wire EDM from standpoints of productivity  and surface quality.    Mechanical Properties Observation of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Metal Nanocomposites by  Ultra-Micro Indentation Technique. T. Sekino, H. Kitayama, A.  Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR, Osaka U.)    Some mechanical properties of monolithic  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal nanocomposites were  investigated by using ultra-micro indentation technique for a  Berkovich type indenter. The load-displacement behavior has been  measured at the maximum indentation force of 10 to 400 mN.  Micro-hardness, elastic modulus and elastic-plastic deformation  phenomena were calculated by using averaged raw data. Both  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal composites indicated the  elastic deformation even at maximum indentation force of 10 mN,  however, plastic deformation of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal composites were accelerated.    Influence of Temperature on Microstructure and Tensile  Strength of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Fibers. H. Iwanaga  (Faculty of Liberal Arts, Nagasaki University), M. Ichihara, S.  Takeuchi (Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of  Tokyo)    Alumina monofilaments (10 m in diameter) were composed  of  many crystallites of 0.1-0.5 m in diameter, within which  many  small pores were distributed. Growth morphology of the  crystallites and pores were observed by TEM. Tensile strength  measurements of the filaments were carried out at elevated  temperature.

Hayashi, and  T. Nishikawa (Kyoto I.T.)    Fracture behavior of mullite at high temperatures was  investigated by the constant-stress and constant-stress rate  techniques. SCG region was observed at all fracture surfaces.  Apparent critical stress intensity factor at the high  temperature depends on stress rate, decreasing to 3.0-3.5  MPam[.sup]1/2[/] with increasing stress rate. Mullite with  large grain has greater crack velocity compared with fine  grained mullite.

Nishikawa (Osaka Cement Co., Ltd.)    The addition of WC to the Zirconia-Alumina composites  improved the mechanical properties. The composites were prepared  by slip-casting method. The composites were sintered in vacuum  at 1700C for 3 hr and isostatically pressed at 1700C  for 1 hr under a pressure of 180 MPa in Ar. Flexural strength of  the composites was 1500 MPa and was not satisfactorily improved,  but the fracture toughness was enhanced to 9  MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] by the addition of WC.    Elastic Moduli and Fracture Toughness of  CeO[.sub]2[/]-Containing Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystals  (Ce-TZP). Y. Kubota (Tosoh), M. Ashizuka and H. Hokazono (Kyu.  Inst. Tech.)    Elastic moduli and fracture toughness of 12 mol%  CeO[.sub]2[/]-containing tetragonal zirconia polycrystals  (grain size: 28 m for Z12C-I, 6.1 m for Z12C-II) were  measured as a function of temperature. Young's moduli were  194-195G, and fracture toughnesses were 6.4 for Z12C-I and 6.7  MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] for Z12C-II at room temperature.

Elastic modulus and fracture toughness of 9 mol%  MgO-partially stabilized zirconia was measured as a function of  temperature. Young's modulus showed the minimum value around  600C in heating process and increased with falling  temperature in the cooling process. On the other hand, the  fracture strength was not changed by rising temperature up to  750C in the heating process and showed the maximum value at  450-500C in the cooling process.    Creep Deformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Particle Dispersed MgO  at High Temperature. E. Yasuda, K. Sekine, and T. Akatsu (RLEM  TIT)    Compressive creep of MgO polycrystalline in which  ZrO[.sub]2[/] particles are dispersed at 1400-1500C  under 6-30 MPa were studied. The steady state creep rates vs.  stress curves of ZrO[.sub]2[/]/MgO were characterized by a  transition in stress exponent n the same as those of monolithic  MgO. It was found that the transition stress of  ZrO[.sub]2[/]/MgO were higher than that of monolithic MgO.    R-Curve Behavior of Ce-TZP/Lanthanum-_b_-Alumina  Composites.  T. Fujii, Y. Hamada (Nisshin Flour Milling Co., Ltd.) and S.  Hirano, M. Miura (Nagoya University)    Ce-TZP/Lanthanum-_b_-Alumina composites with a fracture  toughness of 9-12 MPa-m[.sup]0.5[/] had been developed. An  indentation-strength method was used for measurement of R-curves  in these composites (0 wt.% and 0.2 wt.% MnO[.sub]2[/]  addition). The _b_ values (the slope of indented bar strength  vs. indentation load on a log-log plot) of these composites were  0.176 for 0 wt.% MnO[.sub]2[/] and 0.108 for 0.2 wt.%  MnO[.sub]2[/] addition respectively.    High Temperature Strength of Rapidly Solidified Mullite  Ceramics Containing ZrO[.sub]2[/]. H. Ito, K. Morino  (Tokuyama College of Tech.), Y. Yamasaki, K. Takagi (Technical  Research Lab., Toyo Kohan Co., Ltd.)    Amorphous mullite ceramic powders containing ZrO[.sub]2[/]  prepared by Rapid Solidification (RS) were hot-pressed to study  the characteristics of sintered compacts at elevated  temperatures. These compacts showed less reduction of strength  than those without the RS treatment with increasing temperature.  Dilatometric measurements revealed that the phase transformation  of ZrO[.sub]2[/] was suppressed in the RS sample due to a  fine microstructure. This indicated that the phase  transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] led to decrease of the  strength at elevated temperatures.    Cyclic Fatigue Properties of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  Ceramics at Room Temperature. M. Ogawa and K. Isozaki (Denki  Kagaku Kogyo K.K.)    Cyclic fatigue tests of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  ceramics were carried out at room temperature to investigate the  influences of starting powder on the fatigue behavior. Higher  fatigue resistance for cyclic stresses in 3-point bending method  was obtained for the sintered body prepared from  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powder with higher _a_-phase  content.    High Temperature Properties of SiO[.sub]2[/] Doped  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics. M. Isomura, T. Takahashi  (NGK Insulators, Ltd.), Y. Endoh, Y. Furuse (Tokyo Electric  Power Company)    High temperature properties of SiO[.sub]2[/] doped  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramic were examined up to  1600C.

Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Composites in  the  Si-Al-O-N System. J. Tani, A. Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR,  Osaka University)    We have successfully fabricated high strength Si-Al-O-N  composites prepared by hot-pressing mixtures of fine  _g_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powders at 1600C. In the  present study, the relationship between microstructure and  mechanical properties of these composites was investigated. TEM  observations revealed that fine Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  particles were dispersed both within the  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] matrix grains and at the grain  boundaries. Surface structure of selected grains in the atomic  scale was also performed by AFM with much higher lateral and  vertical resolution compared with SEM.    Fiber-Matrix Interface and Mechanical Properties of 3D  C[.sup]F[/]/SiC Composites. K. Igashira, K. Nishio, J.  Fujioka, and S. Okazaki (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.)    The 3D-C[.sup]F[/]/SiC composites were prepared by polymer  conversion method. Some modifications in processing were done so  as to control the properties of fiber-matrix interface.  Mechanical properties of the composite was remarkably affected  by condition on fiber-matrix interface.    Flexural Creep Behavior of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  Doped SiC at 1600C in Air. H. Takahashi (Asahi Glass Co.,  Ltd.), Gou Iyogi and Seiichi Hamada (Tokyo Electric Power  Company)    Four point flexural creep behavior of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] doped SiC was investigated over  the temperature range from 1400 to 1600C in ambient air.  The stress exponents obtained below 1500C were close to 2  though that at 1600C was 3.3. Apparent activation energies  were calculated 400 to 490 kJ/mol. Microscopic observation of  crept samples suggests the severe degradation of grain boundary  at 1600C by oxidation.    High-Temperature Mechanical Properties of TiC  Particulate-Dispersed SiC Composites. X. H. Tong, T. Iseki  (Tokyo Inst. of Technol.), B-W. Lin (Indust. Technol. Res.  Inst., Taiwan, R.O.C.)    Up to 1600C, high temperature bending strength and  fracture toughness of Ti doped SiC/TiC composites were measured.  The bending strength of SiC/TiC composites did not change up to  1200C, decreased at 1400C and slightly increased at  1600C due to remarkable growth of  Ti[.sub]3[/]SiC[.sub]2[/] crystal particles just at  1400C. The existence of Ti[.sub]3[/]SiC[.sub]2[/] in  the microstructure of hot pressed SiC/TiC composites was  confirmed by XRD.    Residual Strain in Metal Boride Particle Dispersed SiC  Ceramics. T. Mizutani and A. Tsuge (Toshiba R&amp;D Center)    The Selsing's formula is extended to the general formulas  which contains the effects of dispersed particle amount by using  a pseudo cell model and a concentric double sphere  approximation. The derived formulas are applied to  pTiB[.sub]2[/], pZrB[.sub]2[/] or pWB amount effect on the  unit lattice volume measured with X-ray diffraction analysis on  the surface of SiC composite with dispersed particles.    Mechanical Properties of Surface Treatment Carbon Fiber  Reinforced SiC Matrix Composites. K. Naito, H. Yoshida, and C.  Yamagishi (Nihon Cement Co., Ltd.)    SiC layer of 0.3 micron thick was deposited on carbon fiber  at 1500C by CVD method. The fiber reinforced SiC matrix  composite was fabricated by Hot-Press sintering method. SiC film  was coated on the composite to examine its oxidation resistance.  The composites coated SiC were exposed for 200 hours in  N[.sub]2[/]/O[.sub]2[/] gas mixture at 1450C. In the  results, oxidation properties were improved, because of flexural  strength after oxidation test was as much as that before test.    Mechanical Properties of Intermetallic Compound NiAl  Prepared  by Reaction Sintering Method. M. Inoue, K. Kudo, Y. Yamaguchi,  and K. Suganuma (National Defense Academy)    Reaction mechanisms and mechanical properties of NiAl  prepared by reaction sintering were investigated. Fully  densified monolithic NiAl could by synthesized successfully by  vacuum hot-pressing at 1100-1500C. The defect strengthening  and hardening due to nonstoichiometry were confirmed.

These composites showed 30-45 MPa in _t_zx and 0.5-0.7  kJ/m[.sup]2[/] in G[.sub]IIC[/].    Anomalous Shock Compression Behavior of the  Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Doped Tetragonal Zirconia. T.  Mashimo (Kumamoto University) and D. E. Grady (Sandia National  Laboratory, USA)    Precise particle-velocity measurements were performed on the  Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-doped tetragonal zirconia by the  VISAR method. Very fine three-wave structures were observed,  while the normal two-wave structures were observed on the cubic  zirconias. Release waves from Hugoni of state of 11-13 GPa  suggested an anomalous large spall property. These unusual shock  wave profiles may be related to the phase transitions of the  tetragonal zirconia.    Strength Under Shock Compression of the  Microstructure-Controlled Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]  Ceramics. A. Nakamura, T. Mashimo (Kumamoto University), and A.  Yamakawa (Sumitomo Electric Co., Ltd.)    In order to study the effects of microstructure on the  shock-yielding property, the Hugoniot-compression curves of  grain-controlled and SiC-whisker doped  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics were measured by means of  the inclined-mirror method combined with a powder gun. The HEL  stress of the grain-controlled ones, whose grain dimensions were  finer, were larger than the normal ones. The SiC-whisker doped  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics showed an anomalous shock  wave profile.    Improvement of Sodium Corrosion Characteristics of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] by High Purification. Y. Hirakawa,  E. Yoshida, Y. Tachi, and S. Kano (Power Reactor and Nuclear  Fuel Development Corporation, Oarai Engineering Center)    Creation of advanced materials is an essential issue to  attain innovative improvement of fast reactor performance to  achieve its excellent economics. This paper clarifies the effect  of improvements on the sodium corrosion resistance of purified  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/].    Steam Corrosion of Plasma Sprayed,  Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Stabilized ZrO[.sub]2[/]  Coatings. K. Yasuda, M. Itoh, S. Arai, and T. Suzuki (R&amp;D  Center, Toshiba Corp.)    Experiments on the t-m phase transformation of  ZrO[.sub]2[/] containing 8 wt% Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  on the average were carried out under a saturated steam  atmosphere to understand the mechanism of steam corrosion from  the viewpoint of Y distribution. The phase transformation  occurred in heterogeneously Y distributed t-ZrO[.sub]2[/]  coatings, but it did not occur in homogeneously Y distributed  ones. This result suggests that a homogeneous Y distribution in  t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] depresses the phase transformation.    Behavior of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] Spray Coating  at Elevated Temperature. Y. Kurisu, M. Amano, Y. Sinohara  (Nippon Steel Corp.), H. Saka, K. Kuroda (Nagoya University)    The stability of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] spray  coating in contact with Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/] powder  were evaluated at elevated temperature. At the coating surface,  tetragonal ZrO[.sub]2[/] transformed into monoclinic  ZrO[.sub]2[/] for the transfer of the stabilizer element (Ca)  caused by the iron diffusion into silica glass. The  transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] can be inhibited by the use  of Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as a stabilizer.    Durability of WC/TZP Ceramics in Aqueous Environment. Tetsuo  Yoshio, Yuushi Hara (Okayama Univ.), Kohei Oda (Yonago NCT),  Toshihiko Nishida (Kyoto IT), and Takaki Masaki (Toray  Industries Inc.)    The primary emphasis of this work is on chemical durability  of zirconia composite (WC/Y-TZP) in aqueous environments. Water  corrosion of the ceramics proceeds with weight loss caused by  dissolution of W. Its extent varies with the processing  conditions and WC content. The results suggest that an  understanding of these chemical evaluations might be important  for improvement of the aging-degradation durability of WC/Y-TZP.    Preparation and Properties of Porous Ceramics Using  _a_-Quartz Particles. S. Furuta, H. Nakao, and H. Katsuki (Saga  Ceramics Research Laboratory)    _a_-Quartz particles were used for raw material to produce  porous ceramics. Their pore diameter and porosity were changed  by particle size and some additives which were useful for the  formation of the green body. The abrasion test of porous body by  stirring showed a minimum weight loss when bentonite was used  for the additives.    Effect of Talc Grain Size on the Pore Distribution of  Cordierite Ceramics. M. Nakahara, Y. Hashizuka, Y. Kondo, and K.  Hamano (Kagawa Industrial Technology Center, Kanagawa Univesity)    Effect of talc grain size on the pore distribution and  bending strength of cordierite ceramics was studied. Six kinds  of samples were prepared, and examined their apparent porosity,  pore distribution and bending strength.    Synthesis of Spherical Porous Silica Particles. H. Mori, H.  Yamashita, and T. Maekawa (Ehime University)    Spherical porous silica glass whose average diameter is 40  m are synthesized by the sol-gel process in W/O emulsions  and  a successive thermal treatment. The pore size can be controlled  by changing temperature of thermal treatment. The presence of  residual carbons can be avoided by decreasing unreacted  alkoxides with increasing water content of the initial solution  at the sol-gel process.    Preparation and Characterization of Porous Glass in  Na[.sub]2[/]O-B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-CaO-SiO[.sub]2[/]  System. T. Nakamura, H. Yamashita, and T. Maekawa (Ehime  University)    Porous glass was prepared by phase separation process. The  pore diameter, the specific surface area can be controlled by  this process. From the result of elemental analysis, the main  ingredients are silicate whose silica content exceeds more than  99%.    Preparation of Siloxane Oligomer by Phase Separation. H.  Iyanagi, Y. Takasuka (Pola Lab.), and S. Hirano (Nagoya Univ.)    A unique siloxane oligomer was separated from reaction  mixture when N-phenyl-_g_-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane was  hydrolyzed and polycondensated using NH[.sub]4[/] OH without  stirring. Molecular weight distribution of the oligomer was  rather sharp and mean molecular weight was not so affected by  the period until phase separation. It was considered that the  unique oligomer was synthesized through prevention of  polycondensation by phase separation.    Behavior of Organically Modified Fibrous Silicas in Aqueous  Solution. Y. Miyamae, H. Iyanagi, Y. Takasuka (POLA Lab.), and  S. Hirano (Nagoya Univ.)    Organically modified fibrous silicas were prepared by the  sol-gel method of alkoxysilane. We found the fibrous silicas  treated by heating had the ability of decolorizing the dye  solution. The pH values of the fibrous silicas varied with their  heat treatment temperature in aqueous solution. The behavior  changed with their structure of organic groups. The variation of  pH values were related to the behavior of the dye decolorization.    Synthesis of Fibrous Sodium Titanate Hydrate. H. Suzuki, K.  Igarashi, and T. Shimizu (Chiba Institute of Technology)    The synthesis of fibrous sodium titanate hydrate was  examined  by hydrothermal reaction of fibrous titanium dioxide hydrate and  sodium hydroxide. The reaction approached closely to the  completion when the concentration of sodium hydroxide was higher  than 5 mol/l at the temperature of 130C. The product had an  X-ray diffraction pattern with the largest peak at lattice  spacing of 1.1 nm.    Powder Synthesis by Emulsion Firing. K. Takatori and S. Hori  (Toyota CRDL)    Two oxide powders, ZrO[.sub]2[/] and ZrTiO[.sub]4[/],  were synthesized by an emulsion firing method. The emulsions  containing metal ions in the aqueous droplets were air atomized  and fired to yield oxide powders. The synthesized powders were  characterized by SEM, BET and XRD. They were spherical and  submicrometer in size. The emulsion firing method was considered  to be applicable to synthesize fine mixed-oxide powders.    Preparation of Mixed Valence Bismuth Oxides From Alkaline  Aqueous Solutions. N. Kinomura, M. Hosoda, and H. Kojima  (Yamanashi Univ.)    Pyrochlore type  Na[.sub]0.39[/]Bi[.sub]3.45[/]O[.sub]7[/] and  BiO[.sub]x[/] containing Bi[.sup]5+[/] were prepared by  low temperature hydrothermal reaction using hydrated sodium  bismuth oxide, NaBiO[.sub]3[/]-nH[.sub]2[/]O, as a  starting material. The mean valence of Bi in the pyrochlore is  3.94. The X-ray powder pattern for the pyrochlore was indexed in  the cubic system with a = 1.0943(8) nm. The crystal structure  was refined with the X-ray powder Rietveld method. The  pyrochlore decomposes above 380C with two steps of weight  losses caused by complete reduction from Bi[.sup]5+[/] to  Bi[.sup]3+[/].    Preparation of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  Composite Particles by Thermal Decomposition of Metallo-Organic  Compounds. H. Yoshimatsu (Okayama Ceramics Research Foundation),  Y. Miura, A. Osaka (Okayama University), and H. Kawasaki  (Industrial Technology Center of Okayama Prefecture)    Gels prepared from ethyl acetoacetate aluminium  di-iso-propylate (ALCH) and zirconium n-butoxide were heated  between 700C and 1400C in air to prepare  ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] composite  particles. The volume fraction (V[.sub]t[/]) of tetragonal  ZrO[.sub]2[/] in the total amount of ZrO[.sub]2[/] for the  ALCH derived particles heated at 1400C for 2 h was greater  than that for the particles with the same Zr/Al ratio from  mixtures of aluminium sec-butoxide and zirconium n-butoxide.    Preparation of _b_'-Sialon by a Sol-Gel Method. C. Sakurai  and T. Nose (Advanced Mater. &amp; Tech. Research Labs., Nippon  Steel Corp.)    _b_'-Sialon (Z = 2) was prepared by a sol-gel method using  _g_-(aminoethyl)aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and aluminum  s-butoxide modified with triethanolamine. Single phase  _b_'-Sialon was obtained at 1500C in N[.sub]2[/] by  carbothermal-reduction-nitridation. Existence of Al-O-Si bonding  in the gel was important to synthesize single phase _b_'-Sialon  at lower temperature.    Synthesis and Hot Isostatic Pressing of Ni-Se-Te Materials.  T. Hattori, S. Nishiyama, T. Matsuzaki (Chiba University)    NiSe and NiTe were prepared by solid state reactions in  vacuum. These synthesized powders were mixed and CIPed into  pellets, followed by HIPing in capsules. The amount of  substitution of Te for Se was comparatively small, less than 25  mol%. In the other way, Se substituted for Te in NiTe  more than  25 mol%. The density of HIPed NiSe-NiTe body increased  with  increasing amount of Te up to 50 mol%. It seems to be  because  the melting point was depressed by solid solution. The density  of NiTe was highest.    Fabrication and Characterization of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC/Ni/TiC/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  Symmetrical FGMs by SHS/HIP. Z. Li, K. Tanihata, Y. Miyamoto  (ISIR, Osaka Univ.)    The symmetrically arranged functionally gradient materials  of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC/Ni/TiC/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  densified using Si fuel at 100 MPa N[.sub]2[/] pressure by  SHS/HIP. The product size was about _P_ 30 x 6mm. The Ni  content  was 20 to 30 wt% at the center layer and diffused toward  the  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] layer. The surface hardness and  toughness were similar to the bulk  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], but decreased and increased  remarkably toward the inside respectively. The  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] surface had the compressive  residual stress of about 200 MPa. Flexural strength ranged in  600 to 700 MPa which depended on the microstructure.    Mechanical and Electrical Properties of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Metal Composites With Continuous  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and Metal Phases. Y. Batai, T.  Watari, T. Torikai, and O. Matsuda (Saga University)    The composites consisted of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], Al  and Si grew by oxidizing Al-Si-MgO powder compacts. The  electrical conductivity of the composite (50% oxidation)  was  0.94 _O_[.sup]-1[/]-cm[.sup]-1[/]. This indicates Al phase  is continuous. The bending strength of the composites had the  maximum value of 412 MPa in case that oxidation ratio was  50%.  The fracture toughness of the composites increased with  decreasing oxidation ratio and was 4.88 MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] in  case that oxidation ratio was 35%.    Combustion Synthesized TiC Body With Dense Surface Layer. M.  Ohyanagi, M. Shibuya, and M. Zoizumi (Ryukoku University)    TiC cylindrical body with dense surface layer was fabricated  by combustion synthesis. The dense surface layer can be formed  in the green density greater than approximately 75%. The  reactant compacts were ignited by using an ignition pellet of  loose powder compact consisting of same content as the reactant.  Effects of the green density and an exposed gas pressure on a  fabrication of the dense surface layer were studied. The  features of the layer were also reported.    SHS Casting of MoSi[.sub]2[/] and FeSi[.sub]2[/]. Osamu  Yamada (Osaka Industrial Univ.)    The new thermite type SHS process (TM-SHS) has been  developed  by combining the modified thermite reaction and the combustion  synthesis reaction. The TM-SHS has potentiality for increasing  reaction temperature over melting points of such silicide  ceramics as MoSi[.sub]2[/] and FeSi[.sub]2[/] due to large  formation heat, and for casting the molten products.    Compatibility of Various Ceramics in Elevated Temperature  Sodium. Y. Tachi, E. Yoshida, Y. Hirakawa, and S. Kano (Power  Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, Oarai  Engineering Center)    Research has been carried out on the creation of new  ceramics  to be used under severe nuclear environment in order to attain  an innovative improvement of fast reactor performance by using  their excellent heat-resisting properties, etc. Sodium  compatibility of various ceramics has been evaluated by their  weight change resulted from sodium exposure tests at 550 and  650C for 1000 and 4000 hours.    High Temperature Oxidation Behavior of Silicon Nitride  Ceramics. M. Ueki, Y. Sato (Nippon Steel Corp.), and K. Kurokawa  (Hokkaido University)    Two types of silicon nitride ceramics with  Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]  added as sintering aids in different volume percentages and  another type of silicon nitride ceramic with  Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and HfO[.sub]2[/] added as  sintering aids were investigated for high-temperature oxidation  behavior in the temperature region of 1100 to 1300C.    Corrosion Study of Silicon Nitride Ceramics in Plutonium  Nitrate Solution (2). T. Kurita, Y. Suzuki (Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation), and K. Uematsu (Nagaoka  Univ. Tech.)    Corrosion behavior of silicon nitride ceramics was  investigated in plutonium nitrate solution. Sample was examined  with weight loss, corrosion layer and SEM. Elements dissolved in  plutonium nitrate solution were determined with the DCP analysis.    Corrosion Behavior of Structural Ceramics in Combustion Gas  Flow. Y. Endo, Y. Furuse (Tokyo Electric Power Co.), H.  Kobayashi, T. Takahashi (NGK Insulators, Ltd.), A. Hashimoto  (Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.)    Corrosion behavior of ceramics was investigated under  operational conditions of gas turbines. From investigations by  SEM observation, X-ray diffraction and measurement of surface  profiles, it is considered that surface layers which could be  protective against further oxidation were not formed on the  surface of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] specimens exposed to  combustion gas flow. Results of 100 hr exposure test indicate  that ceramic oxide coatings can be effective to increase  corrosion resistance of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/].    Oxidation Behavior of Cubic-Boron Nitride Powder at High  Temperature. M. Tabira, K. Kobayashi, Y. Uchiyama, H. M. Cheng,  and H. Sano (Faculty of Engineering, Nagasaki University)    Oxidation behavior of 8 cubic-BN powders was investigated in  dry air at elevated temperature comparing with that of  hexagonal-BN. Weight loss started at about 1000C for c-BN  and no weight gain was observed, while weight gain started at  850C for h-BN showing the maximum at 1150C. Many pores  and cracks were observed on the surface of oxidized c-BN powder.  It was considered that both formation and evaporation of  B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] proceeded at the same time for  oxidation of c-BN and this caused the TG curve with no weight  gain.    Oxidation and Strength Degradation of SiC Fibers in Air and  Water. (T.I.T.) Yu. Gogotsi and M. Yoshimura    Fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites are being  developed for a variety of applications. Knowledge of the  environmental effects on mechanical properties of the fiber is  essential for composite design and property prediction. The  objectives of this work were to investigate the mechanism of  oxidation of SiC fibers in air and water and to determine the  tensile strength and Young's modulus of the fibers after  oxidation and hydrothermal corrosion.    A Tentative Preparation of _b_-SiC-Coated Carbon Fiber. S.  Yamada (Nishi Tokyo Univ.), E. Yasuda, T. Akatsu (TIT), and M.  Kimura (Tokai Univ.)    To improve the heat-proof temperature of carbon fiber,  carbonized and graphitized carbon fibers derived from PAN were  heat-treated with SiO at 1400C in vacuo for various  minutes. _b_-SiC-coated fibers showed over 100C higher  temperature where 2% weight-decrease appeared.    Compositional Analysis and SEM Observation at the Interfaces  in Oxidation of ZrC Single Crystals. S. Shimada, M. Nishisako,  M. Inagaki (Hokkaido University), and K. Yamamoto (Dowa Kogyo)    The oxidation of ZrC single crystals was carried out at  500-600C and Po[.sub]2[/] = 2.6 kPa. It was found that  the ZrO[.sub]2[/] phase is divided into two zones 1 and 2.  Zone 1 showed a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and  contained as much as carbon of 14-27 at%. Zone 2 was  found to  contain the 7-17 at% carbon, and many pores and cracks.    Effect of LaB[.sub]6[/] Addition and Grinding Treatment on  Graphitization of Oil Coke. S. Araki, K. Kobayashi, Y. Uchiyama,  H. M. Cheng, and H. Sano (Nagasaki Univ.)    Effect of grinding and LaB[.sub]6[/] addition was  investigated on graphitization and sinterability of raw oil coke  powder. Grinding was found to lower graphitizability and improve  sinterability of the powder. Oil coke with 5 wt%  LaB[.sub]6[/] heat treated at 2500C indicated a higher  value of d[.sub](002)[/] than unadded oil coke.    High Temperature Oxidation of SiC-C Particle Mixtures. M.  Ishikawa, H. Nanri, M. Wakamatsu, K. Watanabe (Taiko  Refractories Co., Ltd.), N. Takeuchi, S. Ishida (Kyoto IT)    The oxidation behavior of SiC-C particle mixtures was  studied  at 600 to 1400C in O[.sub]2[/]-Ar mixture. Oxidation was  monitored by the measurement of the evolved CO and  CO[.sub]2[/] using quadrupole mass spectrometer.    Oxidation Resistance of Carbon Fiber Reinforced SiC Matrix  Composites. K. Nishio, K. Igashira, J. Fujioka, and S. Okazaki  (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.)    Mono- and multi-layer SiC films were coated on carbon fiber  reinforced SiC matrix composites by CVD method to improve their  oxidation resistance. Cracks in the SiC coatings occurred during  CVD process were sealed with B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/],  coated composites were subjected to cyclic oxidation tests in  air at 1350C. Weight change of the composites coated with  SiC multi-layers was smaller than that of the composite coated  with SiC mono-layer.    High Temperature Behavior of Additive Metals in MgO-C  Bricks.  E. Hatae, T. Suruga, J. Yoshitomi, and I. Furusato (Krosaki  Corporation)    MgO-C bricks have excellent slag and thermal shock  resistance  and are widely used in converters. It is well known that metals  such as Al, Si, and Al-Mg alloy are added to prevent oxidation  of MgO-C bricks. We will mainly discuss the high temperature  behavior of MgO-C bricks with Al, Al-Mg alloy and Mg-B  additions. We also investigated the addition of Mg-B material to  MgO-C bricks. Consequently, oxidation resistance and hot M.O.R.  were found to be greatly improved by less than 1%  additions of  Mg-B material together with less than 5% Al or Al-Mg  alloy.    Properties of Alumina-Magnesia Castable Refractories for  Steel Ladles. K. Yamaguchi, I. Takita, K. Furuta, Y. Matsuo, Y.  Urita (Krosaki Co. Monolithic Div.)    We have made improvements in Alumina-Magnesia castable  refractories for steel ladles. It was recognized that use of  fine magnesia powder and super fine silica powder brings about  superior corrosion resistance. The reason why corrosion  resistance is improved result from improved density, due to  spinel expansion under load.    Changes of Elasticity by Slag Penetration Into Monolithic  Refractories. E. Udagawa, E. Maeda, and T. Nozaki (Iron &amp;  Steel  Research Labs., Kawasaki Steel Corp.)    The structural spalling derived from slag penetration is the  most significant phenomenon for wear of refractories. Then we  investigated about changes of material properties such as  elasticity by slag penetration into magnesia based monolithic  refractories. Elasticity of the material measured at room  temperature increased by slag penetration, and the magnitude of  it was great at the hot face side of specimen compared with the  place at penetrated CaO finally reached.    Quantitative Evaluation of the Dimensions of Process Zone  and  Crack-Face Bridging Region. H. Kurita and M. Sakai (TUT)    The fracture toughness of ceramic materials is controlled by  the frontal process zone as well as the crack-face bridging  behind the crack-tip. In graphite materials, the process zone  size is extremely large. Its R-curve behavior is dominated by  grain bridging. These zone sizes are evaluated quantitatively  through a fracture mechanics approach.    Evaluation of Fatigue Crack Growth Characteristics of  Alumina  Ceramics. F. Tamai (Industrial Technology Center of Saga) and K.  Hirano (Mechanical Engineering Lab., AIST, MITI)    In order to know the influence of cyclic load on the crack  propagation behavior of sintered alumina, static and cyclic  fatigue crack growth tests were carried out over a wide range of  fatigue crack growth rate. The crack growth rate da/dN was  independent of frequency. In cases of R, R = 0.1, 0.5, the crack  growth rate in cyclic fatigue was higher than that in static  fatigue. The effective stress intensity factor range  _D_K[.sub]eff[/], together with K[.sub]max[/], is a useful  parameter to describe the cyclic crack propagation rate.    Effect of Notch-Root Radius on the Fracture Toughness of  Alumina Ceramic. T. Nishida, Y. Hanaki (Kyoto I.T.)    The dependence of the K[.sub]IC[/] value on the notch-tip  radius has been examined up to notch radii as small as few  microns in a dense, fine-grained polycrystalline alumina  ceramic. The K[.sub]IC[/] value was found to be independent  of the notch sharpness for tip radii &lt;10 m.    The Crack Growth Resistance of an In-situ Toughened  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics at Elevated Temperatures.  T. Miyajima, Y. Yamauchi, and T. Ohji (GIRIN)    The crack growth resistance (R-curve) and the fracture  toughness (G[.sub]Ic[/]) of a rod-like  _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] toughened  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics were determined by the  use of AM-DCB specimen at elevated temperatures. The effect of  the fractured temperature on the maximum crack growth resistance  (R[.sup][/]) was more sensitive than that on the fracture  toughness. The results from this R-curve study indicate that  integral relationship of crack-face bridging force and bridging  length take minimum-value about 1100C and maximum about  1200C at displacement rate of 0.005mm/min.    Failure Probability Assessment of  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics Under Multi-Axial Stress  States. T. Kato and K. Isozaki (Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K.)    The failure probability in the compression test of ring  specimen was calculated using the mechanical properties obtained  from 3-point bending test. Three kinds of criteria were  evaluated in the calculations. The calculated values of penny  shaped crack criterion and G-criterion were in good agreement  with the experimental values.    Temperature Dependence of the Elastic Moduli, Dilational and  Shear Internal Frictions (I). M. Fukuhara, A. Sanpei (Toshiba  Tungaloy), I. Yamauchi (Cho-onpa Kogyo)    We succeeded to develop a high temperature-simultaneous  measuring system for all elastic moduli (Young's, shear and bulk  moduli, Poisson's ratio and Lame parameter), dilational and  shear internal friction values from room temperature to 1823 K,  by an ultrasonic pulse sing-around method. These elastic moduli  and Lame parameter of _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], (Y)TZP  and _b_'-sialon decrease and their Poisson's ratio increases  with increasing temperature, suggesting activation of shear mode  in the high temperature region.    Temperature Dependence of the Elastic Moduli, Dilational and  Shear Internal Frictions (II). M. Fukuhara, A. Sanpei (Toshiba  Tungaloy), I. Yamauchi (Cho-onpa Kogyo)    The elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio of (Y)TZP and  _b_'-sialon decrease and increases with increasing of  temperature, respectively. The high-temperature shear internal  friction for (Y)TZP and sialon are more sensitive to strain and  softening of glassy phase at grain boundaries, compared with the  dilational one. Rapid increase in dilational friction  corresponds to grain boundary sliding phenomena such as  superplasticity and recrystallization.    Problems of Fitting Fatigue Data of Ceramics to a Straight  Line. N. Yamada, Y. Nakasuji, and H. Sakai (NGK Insulators, Ltd.)    The method of straight line fitting and the variability of  estimated crack growth parameter n for fatigue data of ceramics  were considered. The least square method (LSM) was applied to  Monte Carlo simulation data of the static fatigue life time  obtained from the Weibull distribution of initial strengths and  the power law of the slow crack growth. The average of crack  growth parameter n estimated by the LSM is not in agreement with  the true value. The standard deviation of n is relatively large  and influenced by the Weibull modulus m.    Ultrasonic Fatigue Test of Sintered  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] (III). T. Makino, Y. Nakasuji, H.  Sakai, and M. Matsui (NGK Insulators, Ltd.)    Ultrasonic fatigue test of sintered  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was conducted to evaluate the  influence of precrack length on fatigue behavior. S-N curves  show the reverse S-shaped behavior. Fatigue limit depends on the  precrack length. The longer the precrack length is, the smaller  the difference between fast fracture strength and fatigue limit  becomes.    Effect of Applied Stress Ratio on Fatigue Lifetime  Distribution of Polycrystalline Alumina Ceramics. T. Ina, K.  Yasuda, K. Jinbo, Y. Matsuo, and S. Kimura    The lifetime distribution on cyclic fatigue loading was  investigated on variable applied stress ratio. The range of  lifetime distribution on cyclic fatigue loading was narrower  than on static loading. This suggests that fatigue behavior  between under cyclic loading and static loading is different.    Evaluations of Quenching Liquid Used on the Quenching Method  for Ceramics. T. Nishikawa, T. Gao, M. Hibi, and M. Takatsu (NIT)    Transitional temperatures in the specimen were measured  after  quenching and analyzed with various quenching liquids. The heat  transfer coefficients h were obtained for each temperature  difference. The mixture of mineral oil and butanol proved to be  the suitable quenching liquid for thermal shock test of ceramics.    Corrosion of Hexagonal Boron Nitride in Oxygen and Water at  Elevated Temperatures. Kohei Oda (Yonago National College of  Technology) and Tetsuo Yoshio (Okayama University)    This work is concerned with the reactions between h-BN  materials and common oxidizing media, such as oxygen and  H[.sub]2[/]O. The oxidation and hydrothermal corrosion  kinetics for h-BN were found to obey linear rate law and  described by the surface chemical reaction controlled shrinking  model. The apparent activation energies were found to be 300  kJ/mol in dry oxygen and 60 kJ/mol in water, respectively.  Corrosion behavior of sintered h-BN will be discussed with  regard to its microstructure.    Transmission Electron Microscopy of Grain Boundaries in MgO  Aggregates. T. Matsui, J. Nakao, H. Nakamura, H. Taira (Process  Tech. Res. Lab., Nippon Steel Corp.), and M. Ueki (Adv. Mat.  &amp;  Tech. Res. Lab., Nippon Steel Corp.)    Observation of grain boundaries for MgO aggregates with  different purities was performed using transmission electron  microscope. The MgO aggregate, containing about 0.5 wt%  B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as impurities, has glassy  grain-boundary phases. On the other hand the MgO aggregate,  containing only 0.003 wt% B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as  impurities, has crystalline grain-boundary phases.    Phase Transition Enthalpy Between Tetragonal and Monoclinic  Phases in ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  ZrO[.sub]2[/]-CeO[.sub]2[/] Solid Solutions. M. Yashima,  H. Takashina, M. Kakihana, M. Yoshimura (Tokyo Institute of  Technology), T. Mitsuhashi, T. Ikegami (National Institute for  Research in Inorganic Materials)    Compositionally homogeneous  ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  ZrO[.sub]2[/]-CeO[.sub]2[/] solid solutions were prepared  by arc melting and by sintering, respectively. Transition  enthalpy between tetragonal and monoclinic phases, which were  determined by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry)  measurements, decreased with an increase of dopant content. The  DSC peak broadened and the transition temperature decreased  linearly with an increase of dopant content.</p>

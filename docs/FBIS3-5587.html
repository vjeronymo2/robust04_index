The mechanism to stop an import  surge, according to Trade Secretary Rizalino S. Navarro, will be  activated whenever unscrupulous suppliers injure local producers  with shipments of competing products at artificially low prices.  "While we are removing or liberalizing trade, you have to make  sure the guy on the other shore does not prejudice industries  here through unfair trade practices," he said.    Meanwhile, Navarro said, the import ban he proposed to the  Monetary Board, policy body at the Central Bank of the  Philippines late in February 1994 should not be treated as a  signal that government was going back on its word to force local  industries to be efficient by making it compete with foreign  competitors.    "I am not going to open that door wider so that everybody is  protected," he said, dousing cold water on speculations of local  manufacturers on a government aboutface on its import  liberalization program. The proposed ban was for a six-month  period. It will apply on tires, refractory bricks, paper  products, and glass products. Navarro recommended the temporary  ban after monitoring showed a surge in imports on these four  items.    Earlier, Sen. Leticia Ramos-Shahani asked the Senate to  inquire into the reported dumping of foreign articles in the  country at prices less than their fair market value in  anticipation of the effectivity of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Philippines is a signatory to the  GATT whose protocol would be submitted to the Senate for  ratification. The agreement is set to take effect July 1995.    "This dumping would greatly prejudice local manufacturers or  similar goods because they would find it difficult to  restructure their capital requirements and update their  factories, plant facilities, and their inventories," Shahani  warned. Shahani said that uncontrolled dumping of goods from  abroad would impair the ability of Philippine industries to  compete in the world market.    President Ramos and the senators led by Senate President  Edgardo J. Angara, in their third regular Tuesday breakfast  meeting this week agreed to ask Trade Secretary Rizalino Navarro  to create a panel of Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)  experts to provide accurate data on the GATT which would help  senators understand the complexities of the international  agreement.</p>

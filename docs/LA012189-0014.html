			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FAREWELL ADDRESS  </P> <P> In his farewell address, President Reagan's closing comments concern the view  from his White House window. He sees a "shining city on the hill . . . more  prosperous, more secure and happier than it was eight years ago."  </P> <P> In easy sight of the White House are people living in the park; Washington has  achieved the "honor" of being No. 1 in violent deaths, due, no doubt, to the  huge increase of drug use in that city.  </P> <P> I'd like to have the name of the stuff they use to clean the White House  windows.  </P> <P> WILFRED COUZIN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (4): Agriculture sets the pace - Privatisation / The industrial structure poses problems Privatisation to date has been acknowledged as slow: the challenge the government has set itself is both to speed it up and give it a strong enough institutional and popular base to sustain the process through what will inevitably be a tough period immediately ahead. The industrial structure of Latvia was, if not hostile to privatisation, certainly discouraging. Agriculture was largely collectivised, with individual plots being very small. The country's industrial base was heavier than that in the other two Baltic states - reflecting in part a longer industrial tradition than either Lithuania or Estonia, especially round Riga, the main Baltic city. And it was more dependent on the Soviet Union for both supplies and markets, and less able easily to switch. Latvia has also received a higher proportion of Russian immigrants than its two neighbours since the war and many of these were concentrated in the industrial enterprises - as workers and as managers. Parts became and remain non-Latvian enclaves. The first privatisation efforts were directed at agriculture. From 1992, the land, hitherto largely collectivised, was split up into small plots, with the intention of encouraging a healthy smallholding class. However - as the figures for agricultural production show - the initial effect has been to cause production to decline sharply - as some 200,000 new proprietors struggle to produce, battling with a lack of appropriate machinery, with plots of an uneconomic size, and with insufficient surpluses to buy grains and fertilisers. At the same time legislation giving former owners the right to reclaim land held by them or their families before the Soviet occupation, while justifiable both as a moral right and as an encouragement to active ownership, has further complicated landholding. It has also handed over land in many cases to absentee landlords and further fragmented the countryside. 'You have thousands of proprietors, many of whom can now only produce for themselves,' says Juris Paiders, editor of Dienas Bizness, the main Latvian economics paper. 'It means that you have actually taken land out of the market, not put it in.' In the rest of the economy, privatisation was handed over, in the first place, to the ministries which had, in the Soviet period, commanded the same enterprises, regulating their behaviour, appointing their management and passing on the plans and demands from Moscow. Municipalities were given the responsibility for shops and small businesses. The latter privatisation, normally the easiest to achieve in post Communist economies, has gone ahead rapidly, especially in Riga's City centre - where the streets have been transformed by newly restored shops selling imported and native products and by a rich array of cafes and restaurants. There is a high proportion of joint ventures, with partners coming especially from Scandinavia and Germany. The decision to hand over to the ministries control of the big privatisations has proved, however, a decentralisation too far and too soon. Privatisations were achieved, but went largely to existing management which brought in financial partners without effective oversight. The law provided that managers could lease their plant and buy it over a set period of years. Many are now doing this, though the collapse of production in the last two years has meant that they are doing so with great difficulty - especially where, as in many cases, exports went to the Soviet Union. The traditional jewels of Latvian industry - such as the VEF electrical plant and the RAF small bus plant - were transformed from leaders to laggards overnight, and are now struggling to make themselves attractive to investors. The previous government led by Mr Valdis Birkavs (now the Foreign Minister) decided last year to restructure a process clearly seen to be failing - and set itself the target of privatising 75 per cent of all state property by 1996.' I want to speed up the privatisation process,' says Mr Maris Gailis, the present premier. 'There are worries that it will lead to high unemployment because it will demand more efficiency and there will be fewer bureaucrats, but we can do more in retraining. The problem was that many of these people worked under 100 per cent control of the state and the Communist Party. Now they have to realise that success comes only through their efforts.' Instead of a decentralised approach based on the ministries, the government decided to set up two institutions - a Privatisation Agency to put into effect the privatisations themselves, and a state property fund to manage the existing state portfolio. These are new bodies, and as yet untried. Mr Janis Naglis, the general director of the privatisation agency, appears anxious to hurry - 'we must do this fast. If we were to prepare everything scrupulously it would take us 100 years - we simply have to get it going.' Still, he has to work with several problems at once: firstly, there is no free sale and transfer of land; secondly, there is as yet no securities law and there is no functioning stock exchange - though an exchange is being prepared; and thirdly, the citizens all have vouchers issued some two years ago but as yet have nothing to spend them on. Breaking through this circle of problems will inevitably bring some rough decisions. The way of doing so, developed by the government, Mr Naglis and the relatively large numbers of foreign advisers including those paid for by the European Union's Phare programme, the international financial institutions and USAID, is to put on the market, starting from this week, some 44 companies which have been more or less prepared for the market, and to invite international tenders for them. As well as being offered to foreign investors, these companies will also be open to voucher privatisation on the part of Latvian citizens - though it appears to be unclear what proportion of the companies will be offered to foreigners and what proportion to domestic investors. The new executives in charge of the project are young and energetic, but conscious of an uphill struggle before them. 'When I talk about privatisation to foreign companies,' says Mr Uldis Vitolinsh, head of the Latvian Development Agency, 'they have an image of two things - mafia and national conflicts. Wherever I go the first question is always: 'What problems do you have with the mafia?'' Though the vagueness of Latvia's privatisation programme is a problem, it is also an advantage - according to Mr Andrew Baldwin, a consultant working with the EU's Phare programme. 'It is fortunate it has not chosen any particular prescription of privatisation. It can move forward in a more flexible and better-managed way than before.' Foreigners can take 100 per cent of an enterprise by law - though many will wish to retain a substantial Latvian shareholding, as those involved in the 5000 joint ventures do. (One third of these have Russians as the main foreign partner). The agencies, and their foreign advisers, are now working with a number of Latvia's more attractive companies to make them ready for the market. These include the large Latviya Hotel; the Solo-Riga piano plant; the Latvia Shipping Company; and the creation of a joint venture between a Latvian airline and SAS, the Scandinavian carrier. Other companies, especially in the agrarian and wood business (where exports have been growing strongly) are also likely to be attractive. The hard pounding which the state's economy has suffered since independence has depressed living standards and hit exports, as in other former Soviet republics. However, the pounding has had perverse benefits: it has been a testing school for revealing which enterprises have a core of real potential and a management team able to survive in chaotic conditions. And it has also shown that the economy, unlike Estonia's, will probably remain partly oriented towards Russia. Thus, Latvia has much to gain from success in Russia. Where now its banks are a conduit for Russian flight capital, they can also be a means through which successful Russian companies can establish foreign affiliates, and reach out to Europe - especially if and when Latvia becomes a full member of the EU. Latvia's selling point of being an intermediary between west and east has so far been two-edged. With greater transparency and a determined attack on crime it could work to its advantage, with the Russian and the Latvian privatisation programmes dovetailing.</p>

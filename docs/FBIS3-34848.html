A high authority of the Islamic State of Afghanistan told  BAKHTAR that, as demanded by peace councils, for the purpose of  opening supply routes and in respect for the sacred month of  Ramadan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan has agreed to  implement a cease-fire with the forces of Hezb-e Eslami in Kabul  alone. During this period, peace delegations will observe the  opening of highways to Kabul and the free flow of transport  along these highways.    The source said the jehad declared against the Dostam looter  militia by the president of our country is continuing. Dostam  is in no way a party to the current cease-fire.

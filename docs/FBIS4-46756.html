			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with N. Isingarin, by GUDOK correspondent T. </F> Shirshova, Alma-Ata, under rubric "On the Commonwealth's Main  Lines": "Seeing the Prospects"]    [Text] The Kazakhstan republic's Ministry of  Transportation was the scene of a meeting between Transportation  Minister N. Isingarin and representatives of the branch press:  three railroad newspapers and a GUDOK correspondent. The  participants in the meeting touched upon various questions  pertaining to the current status and prospects for developing  the railroads of Kazakhstan. We were publishing that  conversation today.    [Shirshova] Nigmatzhan Kabatayevich, could you please  discuss  the state of affairs on the republic's railroads? Does the  branch correspond completely to today's requirements?    [Isingarin] If one speaks about our railroads immediately  after the collapse of the Union, during that period they were  capable of providing for the necessary volume of freight and  passenger shipments. It was also impossible to complain about  the rate to which they were provided with equipment, since,  beginning in the 1970's, there was active development of  Kazakhstan's main lines, especially the Virginland Railroad. But  after the break in the economic ties among the former union  republics, certain shortcomings were revealed.    The configuration of our railroad network does not  correspond  to the internal railroad-car flow. For example, the republic's  center is not linked with the western rayons of the republic.  The economy, under conditions of sovereignty, requires the  development of those structures which, when Kazakhstan was part  of the Union, would not have been given the go-ahead, since  there was no need for that. For example, today the petroleum-gas  industry is developing in West Kazakhstan. But in specifically  that part of the republic there is no capability of organizing  rail shipments in full volume.    Could we have previously built a petroleum refinery in  Aktau?  I would scarcely think so, since we got our petroleum products  from Russia.    After the separation, Kazakhstan's railroad workers proved  to  be without the industrial base that they needed. And currently  not a single finished article is being produced in our republic  to meet the needs of railroad transportation. That is the main  problem today!    In addition, railroad transportation has proven to be not  ready for the changed trends in passenger flows. Previously even  the people on business trips were sent basically to Moscow. But  currently the number of passengers leaving Alma-Ata and going to  Alma-Ata has doubled. The volume of shipments within the  republic has increased. But our pool of passenger cars has  become obsolete, they are wearing out, and there is simply a  catastrophic shortage of them. And so we simply cannot carry  approximately 20-25 percent of our potential passengers.    Because of the break in the economic ties and the failure to  receive payments, there has been an increase in the freight  shipments within the republic. Previously the virgin lands  received petroleum products from Omsk and Tomsk, and last year  they came from Guryev. East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk Oblast  used to receive coal from Kuzbass, but currently we bring it in  from the Shubarkul deposit (Kazakhstan), that is, a distance  that is twice as long as previously.    There has arisen a problem with improving the system of  administering rail transportation in the republic, because the  previous union scientific and normative base has been lost.    [Shirshova] How, then, will the branch develop in the  future?    [Isingarin] Most probably Kazakhstan's rail transportation  will be constructed according to the Russian model. Therefore we  are attempting to preserve close ties with the RF MPS [Ministry  of Railroads]. This is expressed in a number of agreements that  were signed by Kazakhstan Mintrans [Ministry of Transportation]  and MPS. We support branch publications -- the ZHELEZNODOROZHNYY  TRANSPORT magazine and GUDOK newspaper.    Incidentally, GUDOK once published an article in which, in  particular, it was mentioned that Isingarin is dreaming of  creating an MPS of the Commonwealth countries. That is true. And  I shall even add that I proposed creating a company on the scale  of the CIS -- "Gruzovoy Vagon -- 1520"-- in order to unite all  the railroad-car pools and to create on their basis an  intergovernmental structure in which each country would be a  shareholder with its own railroad cars, but in which there would  be a single repair base and a single system for regulating the  pools. But nothing has happened yet. The politicians are still  holding onto their sovereignty, even if it harms the situation.    Currently I am proposing creating from the Commonwealth's  railroads a transnational railroad company with a single  scientific-technical policy and a single leadership. The people  of Kazakhstan are ready to forgo a certain part of their  sovereignty for this purpose. But we shall all be winners since  we shall not create our own scientific-technical base in each  country.    The transnational company could be created on the basis of  the Russian MPS, but so far the CIS countries are probably not  ready for this idea. Although the European Community's  Commission on Transportation already is a kind of ministry for  Europe's transportation.    But for the time being the situation is forcing us to think  about independent steps. We are uniting our own scientific  forces, and with the aid of the Russian Academy of  Transportation we are creating a national scientific center.  Much is being done in our republic to manufacture spare parts.  The steel-casting plant in Pavlodar produces parts for automatic  couplers, and the motor-vehicle repair association in Alma-Ata  produces elements for attaching reinforced-concrete ties. We  have to produce 30-40 percent of the spare parts that we need.    Currently we are also creating a plant base for repairing  equipment. We shall also produce certain things, for example,  passenger cars. For this purpose we intend to increase our  business relations with Germany, Russia, and Turkey.    Today we are unable to carry all the passengers across West  Kazakhstan, and we also have a complicated situation with such  shipments in the south of the republic. It is necessary to  create new routes, and to make a number of trains daily ones.  For this purpose we are attempting to purchase a hundred  passenger cars in Germany.    [Shirshova] What is the rate policy on the railroad main  lines?    [Isingarin] The rates are regulated by the state. Everyone  thinks that the railroad workers must not suffer any losses from  the shipments, but at the same time the republic is experiencing  a sharp increase in the prices of energy carriers, although in  our republic they will soon exceed the worldwide prices. But if  there is another rise, the railroad workers will also be forced  to raise the rate for shipments. This will impact upon the  clientele. And the raising of the prices of their output will  lead to the ruination of the railroads themselves. So everyone  has to behave very cautiously.    [Shirshova] A problem that is no less urgent today is the  problem of nonpayments. What are the railroad workers  undertaking in order to get the money that is owed to them?  Aren't they suffocating from their debts?    [Isingarin] At one time the Kazakhstan government made the  decision: no freight would be shipped without prepayment. But  currently, one after another, decisions are being made that  require the railroad workers to ship without prepayment, whether  it be coal, or grain, or gas for the population.    As of today, we are owed 1.5 billion tenge. At the  same time we ourselves have become debtors. The Virginland  Railroad, for example, owes Russia almost 200 billion rubles.  All this has led to a situation in which the railroad workers  have been forced to accept output as a form of payment on  account, to pay for the shipments. For example, it was decided  that half the Ekibastuz coal that is en route to Russia should  be channeled into paying off the miners' indebtedness to the  railroad workers. We shall transfer that money to the Russian  MPS in order to pay off our debts. The Kazakhstan government  supports this kind of reciprocal settlement: there is no other  alternative.    [Shirshova] How have the market and the new relations had an  effect on the operation of transportation?    [Isingarin] Railroad workers were among the first in the  republic to sense sharply the uncontrollability of the market.  The volume of shipments dropped by one-half. Recently we  resolved the question of preferential payment for them. If the  customer has money for prepayment and has freight, the railroad  workers guarantee to him that he will receive shipment benefits.  We want to attract freight in this way.    [Shirshova] Do the railroad workers have any hope of getting  money in exchange for shipments? I am talking about indebtedness  to three railroads of 1.5 billion tenge.    [Isingarin] At the present time there is a republic-wide  reciprocal offset. If it proves to be possible to carry it out  intelligently, the railroad workers will be able to count on  success. Starting in February of last year, the railroad workers  have been attempting to get payment of shipments without invoice  acceptance, but they have been unsuccessful...    [Shirshova] We like to make parallels with the state of  transportation abroad. But the countries in the near abroad give  their railroads subsidies for their development. Can the  Kazakhstan railroad workers count on this?    [Isingarin] Only a rich country can give subsidies. As you  know, the republic's budget at this moment is in a very  difficult situation. There won't be any subsidies. In addition,  railroad transportation, unlike many other branches in  Kazakhstan, is currently operating at a profit. The only problem  is that the profit drowns in the reciprocal debts.    [Shirshova] Will the existing system of administering rail  transportation be preserved?    [Isingarin] We have already discussed among ourselves  various  alternatives and have decided that, at this stage, it is more  desirable to preserve the existing system of administration.  When the economy settles down, the questions of  material-technical supply are resolved, and the market  requirements are defined, then we shall also improve the  administrative system.    If one speaks about the economics of railroads, the  reduction  in shipments will continue for many years. We shall not return  to the volumes of the 1980's in the foreseeable future. In  addition, there has been an intensification of labor. Even if,  within, say, 20 years, we do return to that volume of shipments  that we used to have, we shall cope with it with a much smaller  continent of workers. Our hope is to open two new international  through-shipment main lines: the Trans-Asian and the Eurasian  main lines.    [Shirshova] Today China is worried about the rise in prices  for through shipments by way of Kazakhstan. There is less  freight than one would like. What is the reason for this?    [Isingarin] The Chinese railroad workers are waiting things  out. They are building 1620 kilometers of second tracks between  Urumchi and Lanchow. As soon as the construction is completed in  1995, a broad exit will immediately open up for a flow of  freight, and it is our task not to create any barriers to this  flow, either in the form of customs barriers or rate barriers.  It is necessary for us to think about how, in the year 2000, we  can guarantee the shipments of freight from China in a volume of  10 million tons, of which 5 million will be by rail. I feel that  we must be able to carry the same number of millions in the  direction of Turkey and Iran. If that through shipment occurs,  the volume of work will undoubtedly increase and this will  simultraneous resolve a number of problems linked with personnel  downsizing, earnings, etc.</p>

The bill is before  the Assembly Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> No Orange County firms have been identified as participants in the project,  Reagan said. A search for companies is being conducted in part by officials of  Pacific Bell in Orange. Pacific Bell, among other companies, markets  telecommuting services.  </P></p>

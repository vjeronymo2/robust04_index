An independent business magazine, the weekly commercial  ACTUALIDADE, alleged that the three ministers have set up a real  estate company and three other funds with an Angolan businessman  nicknamed as Mr. (Antonio Mosquito). The men accused of  embezzlement were Agriculture Minister Isaac dos Anjos,  Territorial Administration Minister Paulo Kassoma, and Minister  of Assistance and Social Reintegration Norbeto dos Santos.    Similar charges were laid against the three during a session  of the Central Committee of the ruling MPLA [Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola] which suspended a corruption  debate on 21 December.</p>

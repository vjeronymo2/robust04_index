			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Japan's trade surplus grows but nature of the beast changes: The way export billions are recycled is undergoing a stressful shift because of bank weaknesses JAPAN'S manufacturing industry is running up a huge current account surplus  -one that is likely to continue, on current trends, for the foreseeable future. Yet the offsetting process - outward capital flows that allow the balance of payments to balance - is reaching a turning point. Last week the government announced the October current account surplus rose by 60 per cent from the same month last year to Dollars 11bn. The Bank of Japan believes the trade surplus will reach more than Dollars 120bn this year. The scale may be familiar but the nature of the beast has changed since its last surge in the mid-1980s. Then export volumes rose strongly as Japanese manufacturers launched an assault on foreign markets. The surplus now is largely the result of higher prices for exports and lower prices for imports rather than a huge sales offensive in export markets. Export volumes are growing at about 2.7 per cent a year. Most of the 9-per-cent a year rise in export value is accounted for by an increase in prices as a result of the strengthening of the yen against the US dollar and the development of more up-market Japanese products which command higher prices. Import volumes have fallen as Japanese consumer spending has stagnated. Japan's import bill has been further cut by the fall in oil prices. In the mid-1980s the trade surplus was recycled as an outflow of long-term capital from Japan: its institutional investors bought foreign stocks and shares; its manufacturers set up plants abroad; its real estate developers bought large swathes of property. At its height in 1989 this long-term capital outflow reached Dollars 122bn. But last year long-term capital flowed back into Japan as its investors retrenched and foreign investors bought Japanese stocks which have plunged in price. The outflow of long-term capital has resumed but it has reached only Dollars 16bn. The shortfall has been made up from two sources. Short-term capital outflows have reached Dollars 63bn so far this year. But the most important factor has been a series of transactions buried within the bank's accounts. The Japanese banks are paying for their bad debts by boosting their profits through paying low interest rates to depositors and charging high interest rates to borrowers. As a result depositors abroad are switching their money to non-Japanese banks. In addition US and European banks are charging their Japanese counterparts a risk premium for borrowings. Rather than pay higher rates of interest the Japanese banks are repaying these borrowings from foreign banks. As a consequence yen-denominated deposits made with Japanese banks outside Japan fell by Dollars 85bn to Dollars 185bn in the year to July, while deposits made in foreign currencies fell by Dollars 70bn to Dollars 495bn over the same period. However the Japanese banks have barely reduced their lending to foreigners. By reducing their liabilities abroad - mainly deposits and borrowings from banks - and maintaining their foreign lending, the banks have created a short-term capital outflow large enough to recycle the trade surplus. The problem is that this source is drying up. The Japanese banks have run down their foreign borrowings to a point where they do not have much left to play with. That implies long-term capital will have to start flowing out of the country again to recycle the surplus. Yet all the channels seem to be clogged up. Foreign direct investment by Japanese manufacturing companies is about 40 per cent down from 1990 with little prospect of it picking up. Japan's real estate developers are flat on their backs. All but two Japanese banks have withdrawn from long-term lending to overseas infrastructure projects. The scope for Japanese banks to recycle the surplus through 'off-balance' sheet lending is limited, given the scrutiny they are under from international banking regulators such as the Bank of International Settlements. Japanese institutional investors could buy more foreign assets and foreign investors could sell out of the Tokyo market. That would scarcely be good news, however, since it might drive down the Tokyo stock market. 'The weakness of the banking system probably means it will take longer and prove more difficult to arrange the capital flows to offset the surplus. It will create a lot of stress in the system,' said a senior official at the ministry of finance. That stress could be alleviated in several ways. A sharp appreciation of the yen might choke off the trade surplus and make it more attractive for Japanese investors to put their money into foreign assets. Further cuts in interest rates could stimulate bank lending. An injection of public money into the banks to help them sort out their bad debts might encourage them to halt the contraction of their international activities. And the Japanese government is likely to come under international pressure to stimulate the economy to revive imports.</p>

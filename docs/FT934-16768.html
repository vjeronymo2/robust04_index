			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / M0 rise is highest for three years THE NARROW measure of money supply increased by 0.4 per cent last month to give the highest year-on-year growth rate since the summer of 1990. M0 - mainly notes and coins in circulation - rose by a seasonally adjusted 5.4 per cent in the year to September, after an increase of 5.2 per cent in the 12 months to August. Together with buoyant consumer credit figures, also out yesterday, the news will help to ease fears that the UK recovery is running out of steam. The strength of M0 is also likely to diminish prospects for an early cut in interest rates. M0 rose above its ceiling in February and has, apart from one month, stayed there since. The month-on-month rise was slightly higher than economists' expectations of 0.3 per cent. The buoyancy of M0 reflects strong growth in retail spending and the reduction in UK interest rates over the last year, which has made it less expensive to hold cash. There were few revisions to the provisional figures for broad money in August. M4 - M0 plus bank and building society deposits - rose a seasonally adjusted 3.7 per cent in the year to August. The government's target range for M4 is 3 per cent to 8 per cent. Confidence about exports among UK manufacturers has improved on the last quarter, according to a survey carried out by Gallup and DHL, the distribution company. Half of UK producers believe the likely reduction in interest rates will have a positive effect on export sales while two thirds of companies say the UK is ahead of overseas competitors in coming out of recession.</p>

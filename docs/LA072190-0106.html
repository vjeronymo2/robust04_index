			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1,860 ARE NOMINEES FOR PACE  </P> <P> Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos Race Course, said  he has been overwhelmed by the response to the California Cup race for  3-year-old pacers, which will be run in the fall of 1992.  </P> <P> A total of 1,860 nominations with $10 payments were received by the July 15  deadline, forcing Arnold to increase the estimated purse value for the races in  1992 and '93.  </P> <P> In advertisements during the last two months, Los Alamitos estimated a purse of  $350,000 for the open division and $150,000 for the filly division of the  futurity-style California Cup Pace in 1992. For foals of 1990, the estimates  for the second California Cup Pace were $500,000 and $200,000, respectively, in  1993.  </P> <P> However, those estimates now appear conservative. "This is totally unreal,"  Arnold said this week. "I never dreamed of numbers in the thousands. There  isn't a major farm in the United States that didn't nominate. That's how much  faith they have in California.  </P> <P> "This is the most rewarding thing I've seen happen since we took over last  year."  </P> <P> Arnold and Fred Kuebler, director of racing, said nominations have been  received from 16 states as well as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  </P></p>

			<p>920110 FT  10 JAN 92 / Algerian women stage protest Several thousand women assembled in Algiers yesterday in a show of opposition to the Islamic fundamentalists who are poised to take control of parliament, AP writes from Algiers. 'We must fight,' Ms Khalida Messauodi, a women's rights activist, told the crowd at a meeting hall. The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front, which wants to curtail the employment of women and has criticised co-education, took an overwhelming lead in the first round of voting two weeks ago, winning 188 of 231 seats decided. The remaining 199 seats will be decided in the second round of voting next Thursday. Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister whose ruling National Liberation Front won only 15 seats in the first round, confirmed his cabinet would resign after the second round.</p>

The  CPC, the state, and the people have placed great hopes on social  sciences workers in this regard. We should firmly seize this  historic opportunity; uphold Marxism as our guidance; better  serve reform, opening up, and the construction of spiritual and  material civilization; and serve as a good adviser and assistant  to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "France To Fund `Humanitarian Radio'"] </F>   [Text] France will fund half of the budget (in other words  250,000 francs out of 500,000 francs) for a "humanitarian radio  for Rwanda," which will be set up shortly by Reporters Without  Borders, the journalists' rights defense organization, Lucette  Michaux-Chevry, the minister-delegate for humanitarian action,  announced yesterday.    "This radio will provide a useful counterbalance to the  `Mille Collines [one thousand hills] Radio,' whose devastating  influence is well-known," the minister said in a communique,  referring to the radio controlled by the Hutu extremists and its  calls for violence. According to Mrs. Michaux-Chevry, this  radio, "serving nongovernmental organizations," could provide a  valuable service, for instance by broadcasting information about  displaced persons, those who have disappeared or are being  sought, advice on travel, security, access to medicines,  drinking water, and so forth.</p>

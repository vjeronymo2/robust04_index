			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "We Want to Spend $42 Million in </F> Order to Earn $800 Million"]    [Text] Tourism is of the utmost importance, because it is  one of the most important invisible exports that can constitute  a locomotive for economic progress in Egypt, in view of the fact  that it is connected to all the other aspects of [Egypt's]  economic activity and contributes, both directly and indirectly,  to the anticipated volume of business.    At the present time, Egyptian tourism faces a crisis that  basically consists of a decrease in demand for Egypt's tourism  product and thus a decrease in the income earned by tourism.  This is a result of the negative image that has been exaggerated  by some of the Western media concerning terrorist incidents. The  Ministry of Tourism has prepared a plan to stimulate tourism in  order to manage and deal with the crisis. Dr. Mamduh al-Biltaji,  minister of tourism, feels that the element of time is of  extreme importance in the establishment of this plan and  obtaining the budget required, in view of what is demanded in  terms of the necessity of having the ministry comply with the  proper deadlines in a professional manner so that the plan for  vigorous promotion of tourism can begin right now, as the time  draws near for tour organizers and international tourism  companies to prepare their programs for the marketing of tourism  for the world's various competing destinations.    The minister also feels that the matter requires the  expenditure of the necessary effort and money, in accordance  with international standards, in order to stimulate tourism. He  says that the decrease in income from the fund of tourism and  the capacities of the private tourism sector, under current  circumstances, are making it necessary for the public treasury  to participate in the budget for promoting tourism and that this  participation will be decisive with regard to the possibility of  managing and dealing with the crisis. He further states that  when the expected volume of business occurs, after the campaign  to promote tourism, then this participation will, of course,  decline.  <H5>  Joint Effort </H5>   Representatives from government agencies, as well as from  the  public and private business sector, participated in preparing  the plan to promote tourism, and the plan will be carried out by  means of a joint effort undertaken by both government and  nongovernment parties.    The government parties from the Ministry of Tourism are the  Egyptian [General] Authority for the Promotion of Tourism, the  principal party in charge of carrying out [such plans] by means  of its foreign tourism offices actually located in the important  markets; and the Conferences and Exhibits Authority, which is in  charge of the work concerning conferences and exhibits and  promoting them. There is also the Ministry of Culture, which  participates by providing archaeological models to tour groups,  as well as certain facilities at tourist sites (the Antiquities  Authority), as well as the other artistic and cultural agencies  of the ministry. Then there is EgyptAir, which participates by  providing both free tickets and tickets at reduced prices, and  takes part in promotional programs in general. And finally there  is the Exhibits Authority in the Ministry of Economy, which  helps exhibits with their marketing and arrangements, if they  require it.    The nongovernment parties provide facilities and services in  their areas of competence, and they also partially finance the  plan and are in charge of producing some of the promotional  tools. These parties are the Egyptian Federation of Tourism  Organizations, the Egyptian-American Chamber of Commerce (and  similar organizations), and representatives of the hotel  establishments and large tourist villages.    A permanent committee will be formed to represent the  government apparatus, as well as the public and private business  sectors, and this committee will follow up on the implementation  of the plan and evaluate its results. The committee, under the  chairmanship of the minister of tourism, will hold meetings once  every three months in order to evaluate performance, overcome  any obstacles that might occur, and suggest changes necessary in  light of the results of practical application.    The plan is very much concerned with investing in the tools  for promoting tourism in six principal world markets that export  tourism to Egypt, and they were selected in accordance with  objective and scientific criteria. These markets are the United  States, Britain, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan. These are  the markets that export the most tourism to Egypt, and they are  also the markets that were most affected by a negative mental  image of the terrorist events. These six principal markets were  chosen as the target of an intensive effort to promote tourism  in accordance with criteria and data dealing with numbers and  types of tourists, average lengths of stay and expenditures per  tourist, and the degree to which each market would respond to  the campaign to promote tourism that will be undertaken.  <H5>  The Arab Market </H5>   At the same time, though, the plan does not neglect other  markets that might represent less volume and be of less  importance. There will be a continuation and increase in efforts  made and usual promotional tools utilized in these markets. The  promotional activities, within the framework of the plan, will  extend to a number of new markets such as South Africa, East  Asia, Russia, and East Europe. These markets are promising and,  at the same time, were not influenced to the same degree by the  negative image protrayed by some of the Western media concerning  the situation in Egypt.    In view of the fact that the Arab market is of a special  nature and is one of the important markets that exports tourism  to Egypt, the plan has borne in mind the necessity of  intensifying efforts to promote tourism by creating the  appropriate tools--such as tour groups; hospitality programs;  intensified contacts with official and professional  organizations; more reliance on the role of the Egyptian press,  radio, and satellite channel; and, at the same time, less use of  the more expensive promotional tools (such as newspaper and  television advertisements) that are not appropriate for this  market. In this regard, for example, it has been decided to  close the Egyptian Tourism Office in Kuwait, within the  framework of the effort to geographically restructure the  tourism offices and streamline expenses.    The plan's overall budget until the end of the currrent year  is $36.199 million for the promotion of foreign tourism and 20  million Egyptian pounds for the necessities for the production  of printed materials, films, and hospitality programs that take  place in Egypt (that is, a budget totalling about $42 million).  The budget required for carrying out this plan until the end of  next June is estimated at $25 million, since the expenditure  during the first half of the year will increase as a result of  production expenses.    Dr. al-Biltaji says that the Ministry of Tourism will  require  two-thirds of the plan's financing requirements during the  second half of this year in the 1994/95 fiscal year budget.  <H5>  Implementation Actually Begun </H5>   The minister adds: "Since the plan includes 1994 as a whole,  we actually began implementing some of its programs as of last  January. They include the hospitality programs for  representatives of the specialized tourism informational media  and some of the representatives of the popular world media,  actual participation in the most important international tourism  exhibits and markets, financing some newspaper and television  advertisements, and following up on the normal promotional  activities in our foreign tourism offices."    Dr. al-Biltaji points out that implementing the plan in a  comprehensive, intensive, and productive manner until the end of  the year, and then in subsequent years, is something that is  dependent on the necessary awareness of the great economic  importance of tourism and the strength of its links to all types  of economic development and activity in [Egyptian] society. He  also states that this can only be carried out by providing the  necessary resources for promoting tourism.    The minister goes on to say: "If, at this critical stage, it  is necessary for the public treasury to shoulder a considerable  portion of the promotional burdens, it is also true that the  anticipated tourism business--in fact, it is certain, according  to the criteria and rates of international expenditures--will  bring an increase in tax revenues and will also result in more  business for society as a whole. It will also contribute toward  solving the unemployment problem, especially among educated  young people and university graduates. Furthermore, it will also  lead to prosperity of the private tourism sector and  consequently to an increase in the volume and proportion of its  contribution toward paying the costs of this promotional  activity in the future, and thereby will result in a  corresponding decrease in the volume and proportion of the  contribution made by the public treasury.  <H5>  Main Goal of the Plan </H5>   The main goal of the promotional plan has been determined.  It  is to provide incentives for increasing the demand for Egypt's  tourism product and to increase the rate of tourism so that it  approaches that of the year 1992. Achievement of this [overall]  goal involves several other subgoals, which are the following:    1. Raising the level of the promotional tools utilized at  the  present time and the creation of some additional tools.    2. The creation of a sophisticated library of audio-visual  materials to serve the purposes of promotion in the future.    3. Establishing the framework for coordinated activity  abroad, which will combine the efforts of the government and  private sectors in order to serve the cause of Egyptian tourism.    4. The creation of an agenda for Egyptian archaeological,  cultural, musical, and athletic events, which could be utilized  to attract tourists.    5. Opening up new horizons for Egyptian tourism in  alternative markets in which promotional efforts have not been  previously pursued in intensive fashion.    6. Highlighting the numerous attractive elements that Egypt  possesses, such as the new tourist areas, an environment free of  pollution, the hospitality of the Egyptian people and their  friendliness toward foreigners, and the fact that Egypt has the  lowest crime rate in the world.    7. Providing better opportunities to present Egyptian  tourism  development plans and plans for investing in new tourism areas  to serious foreign investors in order to encourage them to  invest their capital in these plans, so that new absorption  capacities can be added to the presently available capacity.  <H5>  Correcting Egypt's Image </H5>   The efforts of the activity in the targeted markets are  being  focused on correcting Egypt's national image and putting the  terrorist incidents into their proper perspective, in  cooperation with the other agencies of the state, which are  working toward this goal--particularly Egypt's media and  diplomatic missions abroad. The Ministry of Tourism is  accomplishing this by means of an intensive advertising campaign  dealing with the areas and features that attract tourists to our  country.    The goal is accomplished more effectively if one approaches  the consumers directly. Statistical studies have shown that the  largest proportion of tourists who come to Egypt come as  individuals rather than in tour groups. This, of course, means  that one must utilize widespread popular international media  such as television, news agencies, and the principal specialized  and nonspecialized press.    Although this approach is costly, the returns it yields are  double the cost. Therefore, contacts must be strengthened with  traditional distributional channels such as tour organizers,  travel and tourist agencies, companies that furnish incentives  for tourism, conference organizers, associations, and airline  companies. Also, the level of the sales promotional materials  must be raised in terms of their language and production so that  they attain an internationally respectable level.    The efforts of the activity are also being focused on the  implementation of a program for marketing Egypt's tourism  product, as well as on development and investment on sound  bases--a program in which one makes use of specialized national  and foreign expertise in this field and utilizes a group tour  approach having a variety of components and in which active  participation in important international tourism conferences and  exhibitions is involved. The activity also involves the  establishment of a well-thought-out program for sending out  invitations to tourist and media personalities to visit Egypt so  that they see for themselves that the situation is stable in  Egypt and become personally acquainted with the Egypt's  historical, natural, human, and cultural features that attract  tourists. Also, an organized mechanism needs to be established  to periodically follow up on the phases of the plan, evaluate  its results one by one, and introduce necessary modifications in  light of this.  <H5>  Eight Main Tools </H5>   The program for implementing the tourism promotional plan  depends on eight main tools:    1. Printed materials: Available printed materials will  continue to be used, but new materials will be added that, in  terms of artistic and printing production, will be on a  competitive international level.    2. Films: Five advertising films in different languages  dealing with both traditional and new tourist attractions are  being produced. They will be shown over the international BBC  network, and then over national networks. This will take place  in each of the six "main tourist markets" over a 16-week period  that has been determined by marketing experts who know the best  timing. The periods chosen are April-May and September-October,  with the films being shown five days per week. Also, two  documentary films are being produced. The first of them concerns  the present absorption capacity of Egypt's hotels, the tourist  villages, the infrastructure, both the traditional and new  tourist attractions, new areas of tourism development and plans  for investing in them. The second film concerns the most  important events on the tourism agenda and shows some of the  various activities connected with these events, as well as the  historical and natural panoramic background associated with  them. Arrangements are being made to have these films utilized  by the national television networks in each of the targeted  markets and to have them shown during professional conferences,  exhibitions, and festivals held abroad.    3. Press: Paid advertisements and special supplements are  being published in the most important newspapers and magazines  in each of the targeted countries.    4. Exhibitions and conferences: An inventory is being made  of  the important regional and international conferences and  exhibitions of a tourist nature, and the necessary arrangements  are being made to actively participate in them. In addition to  this, an inventory is being made of the exhibitions and  conferences that could possibly be held in Egypt, and the  necessary advertisement plans are being made to increase tourism  revenue in connection with them.    5. Tourism agenda: The objective of this is to make a list  of  and confirm a group of various cultural, musical, and religious  events that are held at certain times and places and  geographically distributed throughout Egypt's tourist provinces,  and to include these events in the foreign promotional programs  in order to acquaint people with them and turn them into an  additional tourist attraction.    6. Foreign visits and hospitality programs: These are  considered to be among the most important means of promoting  tourism because they focus on the idea of direct personal  contacts and becoming acquainted with Egypt's tourist  possibilities on the spot. Work is continuing on the policy of  having those persons responsible for tourism in Egypt make  visits to each of the main targeted markets, and others  participating in the visits would include people from the public  and private business sectors. Furthermore, invitations to visit  Egypt are continuing to be sent out to a select group of  prominent writers and businessmen in each of the targeted  markets, and invitations are also being sent to some influential  international personalities such as the heads of international  tourist organizations or prominent artists to attend Egyptian  events.    7. Organized tour groups: These constitute a direct field  activity directed to the consumers. Rrevenue from them can be  increased by means of appropriate media coverage. Most of the  [efforts involving] the organized tour groups are being directed  to the new markets and the Arab market.    8. Contests: These are considered to be an effective means  of  stimulating popular interest in Egypt and increasing knowledge  about it. Foreign tourism offices are in charge of arranging  these contests, together with establishments concerned in the  countries where the offices are located, whether they be  schools, universities, clubs, or other groups. The contests can  take on the form of questions that must be answered, or they can  be part of an already existing popular contest program in the  country concerned. In this case, a free visit to Egypt would be  the winner's prize, and the plan would set aside 180 prizes for  90 winners and 90 accompanying persons in the six markets, with  each market having 30 prizes. The contests would be carried out  in cooperation with international airline companies, EgyptAir,  and the group of hotels that operate in Egypt.  <H5>  Choice Between Two Alternatives </H5>   In conclusion, Dr. al-Biltaji, the minister of tourism,  said:  "This promotional plan has the objective of having Egypt attain,  by the end of the present year, the level of income earned  during the peak year of 1992, that is, $2.1 billion as opposed  to the $1.3 billion earned in 1993. This is something that is  quite possible if we undertake the necessary effort and make the  expenditures necessary for comprehensive marketing. In other  words, we want to spend $42 million in order to earn $800  million." He went on to say: "This plan seems ambitious or out  of the ordinary. But this is not the case because, in fact, we  are being confronted with two alternatives. The first choice is  that we could reduce expenditures in order to deal with a whole  list of actual priorities and requirements that, in some case,  are urgent. The second choice aims at the future, would break  through the blockade of our current problems, adopt the  mechanisms of modern marketing, deal with the competition, be in  line with the international rates of expenditures necessary for  the promotion of tourism, direct the most competitive capability  in the Egyptian economy toward export, and thus be committed to  marketing requirements. This latter alternative is the choice  that I believe we all need to come to the defense of."</p>

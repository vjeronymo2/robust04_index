			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL DISTRICT SEX EDUCATION  </P> <P> This letter is in response to the letter (Dec. 10) by James W. Angell, Robert  P. Steward and Charles H. Sword.  </P> <P> What needs to be made absolutely clear is what I, members and supporters of the  Committee to Restore Ethical and Traditional Education (CREATE), and other  concerned citizens of the Newport-Mesa school district have, and are, objecting  to regarding some of the teaching in the school district.  </P> <P> Specifically, we have objected to the teaching of sexual-arousal skills to high  school students; we have objected to the demonstration of condoms on bananas,  and the teacher making condoms available to students; we have objected to the  showing of R-rated movies to children under the age of 17; and we have objected  to teaching children that pedophiles (child abusers) really love children.  </P> <P> We have also objected to the manner in which homosexuality has been taught. All  we have ever asked is that both sides of this controversial issue be presented,  as the rules and regulations of this district require.  </P> <P> The reaction of the letter writers to our objections is that "we intend to  impose upon our schools our own specific moral code and system of censorship."  The members of the school board, the administration, and these writers and  others who are attacking us are hypocrites. If they really were concerned with  censorship, and sincerely had a desire for intellectual and educational  freedom, they would join with us and demand that the rules and regulations of  the school district be enforced and that all sides of a controversial issue be  presented. I cannot help but wonder what type of theological and political  goals St. Mark Presbyterian Church must have to suggest that anyone who objects  to this type of teaching is an ultra-radical extremist.  </P> <P> We also wish to know why it is that a school district that refuses to allow  Christmas carols to be sung so that no one would be offended has permitted the  filthy, vulgar and disgusting presentation of sex as described above.  </P> <P> JOHN M. GUSTAFSON  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

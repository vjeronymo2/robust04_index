			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Insurance premium tax is likely to be levied gross The government is close to deciding to levy the proposed new 3 per cent insurance premium tax gross instead of net of brokers' commission. The change, proposed in November's Budget, would require an amendment to the finance bill under scrutiny in the Commons. The move is one of several changes being considered by ministers after meeting industry representatives. Alterations would generally be motivated by ministers' desire to introduce the new tax - due to take effect from October - in as practical a manner as possible. Levying the tax on a gross rather than a net premium basis, as originally suggested, would slightly increase the Pounds 750m it is projected to raise for the Treasury in a full year. Ministers are also under pressure to extend the list of exemptions, now confined to long-term insurance products such as endowments and some types of commercial insurance. Conservative MPs are among those arguing that extended warranties offered to purchasers of items such as cars and white goods should be exempt. Ministers are understood to be sympathetic to this argument but anxious not to create a potentially troublesome legal loophole. Sir John Cope, the paymaster general, argued this month for the 'relatively low' tax to apply across a broad base, so that 'as fair as possible a distribution of the tax burden' would be achieved. The Association of British Insurers has written to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, arguing for exemptions on private medical insurance, payment protection for creditors, credit insurance and surety bonds. The industry body was disappointed with the decision to introduce the tax, and has stressed the importance of ensuring the 3 per cent rate does not rise. Labour strongly opposes any exemption for private medical insurance.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Clinton set to back off on tax credit PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday tried to regain momentum for his economic programme by appealing to voters in middle America to help him take on the 'powerful lobbyists' who are beginning to line up against his proposals. But as he spoke to high school students in Chicago, the White House was already preparing to give ground on one important element of the package, agreeing to abandon its proposal for an investment tax credit and instead to accept a lower increase in the corporate income tax rate than it had originally requested. The investment tax credit has featured in Mr Clinton's economic programme ever since last year's election campaign, but it has never won much support from either business or Congress. The proposal included a permanent credit for businesses with sales of less than Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m), as well as a temporary two-year credit for larger businesses, intended to stimulate the economy in the short run and encourage companies to create new jobs. Together, the two credits were expected to cost Dollars 24bn over five years, but critics said they would at best only bring forward investments that would have been made in any case. Businesses have generally said they would prefer a lower tax rate. The administration, which at first had tried to replace the investment tax credit with other business investment incentives, now seems likely to accept a corporate tax rate of 35 to 35.5 per cent, instead of the 2 percentage point rise to 36 per cent it had originally requested. Mr Clinton has been caught in a cleft stick over his tax bill as the first flush of Democratic unity behind the new president has faded. Flexibility on points such as the investment tax credit is the necessary price for stronger support in Congress for the overall plan, but every sign of that flexibility only goes to encourage more members of the US Congress to press their own private amendments. The proposed new energy tax is a particular target for changes. Mr Clinton, buoyed by two days outside the confines of Washington, expressed confidence that he could still drive his legislative agenda through Congress, with the help of renewed backing for his plan from the voters. 'All I have to do, I think, is go out here and ask them to help me sell it because the American people want something done about the deficit. They want something done about the economy,' Mr Clinton said.</p>

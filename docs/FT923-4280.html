			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Technology: Getting heated about insurance - Technically Speaking LIKE many people who buy home computers knowing little about technology, I was persuaded to sign up for an extended warranty policy to cover repairs once the original guarantee ran out. It turned out to be a costly mistake - though I also learnt that there is a remedy. In my case, the two-year policy was from Restart, an insurance package sold by Dixons, the retailers, for which I paid Pounds 182. This entitled me to have a repairman call at my home within 24 hours. I use my computer a lot as a word processor and as a remote terminal for the FT's computer and database, so I need this reassurance. For the first 18 months, everything was fine. But last November the screen started bouncing up and down. The problem got so bad that I decided to call in Restart. Within 24 hours, as promised, a man came from ACT, the servicing firm which carries out the work for Restart. He took one look at the screen. 'It's too close to a radiator,' he said. 'It should be all right if you move it away.' That was all. He spent the next quarter of an hour using my phone to fix up new appointments, and left. I thought that was the end of it. But two months later I received a letter from a company called London General Holdings which, it turned out, were the underwriters on the insurance policy. Their claims assessor, Michael Springer, said they would not pay up because the policy 'does not include coverage of faults that are caused by a wilful act or neglect or failure to follow the manufacturer's instructions'. He enclosed ACT's bill for Pounds 130 and told me to pay up. I was, to put it mildly, flabbergasted. I searched the operating manual for an instruction to keep the computer away from a radiator but could not find one. So I wrote to Springer asking him to direct me to it. He wrote back: 'I cannot give a precise reference in your manufacturer's operating instructions where you are advised to install your computer away from a heat source.' In other words, he could not support the reason for rejecting my claim. I then wrote to his boss asking him what wilful act or neglect I had perpetrated. He was unable to substantiate that charge either. I was obviously at an impasse, and ACT was writing impatient letters asking for payment. But I was determined not to let the matter rest. To cut a long story short, I complained to the Insurance Ombudsman who arbitrates in disputes between insurance companies and their customers. I sent him copies of all my correspondence, and he agreed to look into my case. After about three months, I received a brief letter from Springer saying that 'as advised by the Insurance Ombudsman' he was settling my claim. It was a sweet victory, but not, I have to say, one that surprised me. The case put up by London General (which despite its name is a subsidiary of Chicago-based Aon Corporation) was obviously weak, and the long correspondence I had with them yielded little but their repeated assertions that I had misinterpreted their policy. I gather from ACT that my problem with London General was not an isolated one: many customers received bills for Pounds 130, and complained. Since then, Restart has switched to different underwriters, which suggests that there were deeper problems in the relationship as well. (Springer declined to make any comment for this article.) For me, the case exposed worrying differences in understanding over the purpose of an extended warranty contract. If I pay a lot of money for a policy to have a repairman call, I do not expect to be told two months later that the call was not justified. Policies should either be more clearly written, or policyholders should be advised beforehand that there is a risk that the insurance company will reject the claim, and the cost that entails. The Insurance Ombudsman obviously has some sympathy with this view. But I have not renewed the policy.</p>

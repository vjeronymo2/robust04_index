			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Beijing 'must play by rules' Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday warned China it must play by world trade rules and said the Europeans and Americans were united over Beijing's bid to join the international economic community, Reuter reports from Paris. 'If the Chinese are going to continue to grow, trade and become an international player, they are going to have to play by the rules.

Mr Kantor said China must change its trade practices before it could join the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

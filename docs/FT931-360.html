			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Minorco to acquire 50% stake in Irish zinc-lead operation MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based overseas investment arm of Anglo American of South Africa, is to buy a half-share in the Lisheen project in Country Tipperary, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit in Europe, for about Dollars 72m. This represents another important step in Minorco's ambition to become a hands-on operating company in the natural resources industry. It comes only days after Minorco agreed to pay Redland Pounds 55m (Dollars 78.10m) for Steetley Iberia, a Spanish aggregates business. Minorco will buy the Lisheen stake from Ivernia West, a small Irish exploration company. Ivernia owns 47.5 per cent of Lisheen and various other exploration licenses in the area, and is to buy the outstanding 52.5 per cent from Chevron, the US oil company. Originally, Chevron was to sell its holding to Lac Minerals of Canada, but an arbitrator ruled that Ivernia had pre-emptive rights. Mr David Hough, Ivernia's managing director, said Minorco would provide Dollars 66m for his company to take up its pre-emptive rights, taking in exchange a half-share in Lisheen. Ivernia would have 100 per cent of all other licenses. Minorco would pay about Dollars 6m to Chevron to cover the US company's costs in the venture. Also, Minorco would provide Ivernia with up to Dollars 18m to pay for Ivernia's share of cash needed for the planning and pre-feasibility study processes. No Ivernia equity would be issued so the shareholdings of Ivernia's two big investors, Minorco and Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group, would remain at 24.5 per cent each. Mr Hough said Outokumpu's two representatives on the Ivernia board had voted in favour of the arrangements agreed with Minorco. The South African company will operate the Lisheen project, where reserves are estimated to total 25m tonnes of 11.8 per cent zinc, nearly 2 per cent lead and to contain 1 troy ounce of silver a tonne. Mr Hough said it would cost about Dollars 140m to develop a mine at Lisheen which should be capable of generating an annual profit of Dollars 40m to Dollars 50m. He said it was hoped planning approvals for the project would be completed by October and that a mine would start operating late in 1995 or early in 1996.</p>

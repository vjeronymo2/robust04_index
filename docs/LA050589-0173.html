			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE FUND TO SAVE OZONE GETS LUKEWARM RECEPTION  </P> <P> Eighty countries considering ways of saving the Earth's protective ozone layer  backed away today from a plan to set up an international climate fund.  </P> <P> The scheme was put forward at a U.N.-sponsored conference by Mostafa Tolba,  head of the U.N. Environment Program, and supported by delegates from  developing countries. Its intention was to help poorer countries phase out  damaging chemicals without hindering their economic development.  </P> <P> The idea was rejected by several industrialized countries, such as Britain and  the United States, which said they preferred to use existing aid arrangements.  </P> <P> Tolba had sought a clear commitment to a fund, but delegates agreed instead to  set up a working group to consider ways of helping developing countries. The  fund idea has not been entirely ruled out.  </P> <P> Environmentalist groups accused the meeting of sidestepping important issues  and of delaying decisions that could affect the future of humanity.  </P></p>

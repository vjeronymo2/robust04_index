			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (1): Bureaucracy is forced to switch focus - Four years of collapsing share and property prices have forced the administration to concentrate on more open and competitive financial markets. But officials, banks, their affiliates and customers are closing ranks The Japanese bureaucracy's guiding hand has returned to the financial markets, in an attempt to steer them through the worst recession since the second world war without hitting a crisis. Four years of collapsing share and property prices have forced the administration to switch focus away from its previous gradual progress towards more open and competitive financial markets. Now officials, banks, their affiliates and customers are closing ranks, despite pressure for more deregulation from Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, who is eager to deflect US frustration at Japan's remaining market barriers. The return to old ways is illustrated by a revealing meeting one morning last November, in one of the typically shabby, grey-painted rooms of Japan's finance ministry. Officials had called in senior executives of Japan's life insurance companies, among the biggest investors in the Tokyo stock market, to explain the ministry's attitude to the previous day's fall in share prices to nearly 16,000, a new low for the year. Both sides knew that at that level, Japan's banks start to become worried that their capital, part of which is in equities, will begin to suffer, posing a danger of a credit squeeze for the hard-pressed economy. That afternoon, Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's largest insurer, bought Y10bn of shares. A day later, the market picked up slightly. Nippon Life insists that it acted purely on its own decision. The anecdote shows that the ministry's 'administrative guidance' is as effective as ever. It is encouraging financial institutions to confront the problems caused by the financial excesses of the late 1980s, yet the ministry is also doing all it can behind the scenes to prevent markets sliding out of control. The administration's scope to intervene has been made all the stronger by the erosion of political authority, with the collapse of the Liberal Democratic Party in last summer's elections and the ensuing political upheaval. For this reason, Japan's financial markets can expect a longer and gentler adjustment than did Wall Street after its cataclysm in late 1987. Banks are accelerating the pace at which they deal with their most pressing problem: the need to write off a mountain of bad debt. Increased write-offs will be the main feature in an expected decline in net profits of the 11 leading city banks to Y356bn in the year ending tomorrow, from Y421.1bn in 1993, forecasts SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo. Yet banks are facing up to non-performing loans only slowly by western standards. The real extent of the problem, and hence its future impact on the supply of credit, is hard to measure. Officially, the 21 leading banks calculated their non-performing loans at Y13,700bn, at the last count at the end of September. Yet the definition of a bad loan, one on which no repayments have been made for six months, is lax by the US standard, under which a debt must be declared bad the moment the terms of the loan are breached. Under this tougher US regulation, Japan's bad debt mountain would grow to at least Y30,000bn. The difference highlights Japanese banks' traditional concern with helping big corporate customers through bad times. To make matters worse, the lingering recession and the yen's relentless rise are adding dud industrial loans to the debts of property developers, or companies using overvalued property as collateral, which lay at the origin of the problem. Worryingly, corporate bankruptcies caused by the recession rose to a record 60.8 per cent of total collapses last year, according to Teikoku Databank, a private credit bank. In January, the overall number of company collapses climbed to a seven-year high. All this cyclical turmoil coincides with an underlying change in Japanese banks' basic role. 'There is great change going on in the financial system. . .' says Mr Yasuo Noda, managing director of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Japan's largest. 'The economy of Japan was built up over the past 40 years by a financial system dedicated to providing cheap capital for industry. But we cannot continue in exactly the same way. There has to be a more diversified formula, to cope with economic change and a more diversified client base,' he explains. The main change cited by Mr Noda and his colleagues is an acceleration in corporate borrowers' tendency to turn away from banks to the bond markets for funds. Bank loans have dropped over the past decade from just under 85 per cent of corporate borrowing to about 70 per cent, according to Salomon Brothers Asia. The drop will get faster as companies, under pressure to curb costs, chase cheaper funds and as Japan's fledgling corporate bond market develops in response, predicts Salomon. Banks would dearly love to capture this business. Their appetite is made all the sharper by a decline in the underlying demand for capital, with corporate investment set to fall this year for the third year running, according to the Industrial Bank of Japan. Yet the government has allowed banks to step into the protected securities business only gradually, under resistance from Japan's powerful stockbrokers, still suffering from the plunge in stock market prices. The 10 trust and long-term credit banks were allowed last April to establish securities subsidiaries to issue, but not market, convertible and warrant bonds, and to deal in straight bonds. City banks' subsidiaries will be allowed to follow next year in what the finance ministry says will be an 'orderly manner to avoid confusion.' Another change in old values, accelerated by the recession, is the partial dismantling of the outer fringes of Japan's keiretsu of relationships between diversified groupings, bound together by cross-shareholdings. In the past, these were seen to be an important strength of Japanese industry's competitiveness, helping to bind together banker and corporate client, and manufacturer and supplier. They continue to be criticised by the US as a way of keeping foreign companies out. Yet a growing number of Japanese businesses have come to see part of their keiretsu links as disposable. That is why Nippon Steel announced recently that it will sell Y66bn of securities, to help reduce its operating losses, while Kobe Steel will sell Y31bn. Yet keiretsu are only weakening at their outer boundaries. The core is stronger than ever. The big banks which are often at the heart of these relationships report that they are being asked to offer increasing help for their leading corporate customers. Financially unsound companies unfortunate enough not to be linked to a friendly keiretsu bank soon join the queue of bankruptcies. That was a lesson of last autumn's collapse of Muramoto Construction, the largest post-war financial failure, which had failed to cultivate sufficiently close links with Daiwa Bank, its leading lender. Japan's biggest stockbrokers, by contrast, appear to be further into their restructuring than is the banking industry. The big four brokers, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, are just starting to see the benefits of the staff reductions and closures of retail outlets they made in the 1980s. Reduced costs will be one of the two main features of an expected turnround by the big four, from a combined loss of Y60.1bn in the year to last March to a net profit of Y100bn this year, forecasts Mr Mark Faulkner, financial analyst at SG Warburg Securities. The other feature is a pick-up in average stock market turnover, from Y250bn per day to about Y400bn over the same period; comfortably over the Y350bn at which the big four break even, he says. However, the legions of second-tier brokers clearly need to cut costs or reduce their dependence on commission income if they are to be profitable at the market's present level. They still need average market turnover of about Y450bn to break even, estimates Warburg's Mr Faulkner. One of the few bright spots in Japan's otherwise unsettled financial markets is the pension fund industry. Fund management is set for strong growth for the next few decades, thanks to the fact that Japan has the world's fastest ageing population, in which the proportion of people over 65 will roughly double to 26 per cent by 2020. Pension assets, will grow by 50 per cent from their present Dollars 1,600bn by the end of this decade, forecasts Morgan Stanley Investment Advisory. About 94 per cent of pension fund assets are managed by the 15 main Japanese life insurance and trust companies, estimates Morgan Stanley. Not surprisingly, foreign fund managers, as well as Japanese ones, are fighting hard to get into this tightly protected market, one of the hottest areas in the US-Japan trade dispute. But the government has so far proved resistant to pressure to open the market to newcomers. The outcome of this dispute will be closely watched as a test of whether the government is confident enough to switch the focus back to making the financial markets more competitive.</p>

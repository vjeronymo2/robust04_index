			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 REGIME FOES DEFY PANAMA'S BAN ON RALLIES  </P> <P> The three top opposition leaders defied a ban on rallies and marched through  the streets of the Panamanian capital on Saturday, their first public  appearance since they were physically assaulted after the May 7 election.  </P> <P> And late Friday, U.S. officials reported that the government had released 15  Panamanians employed to provide security at U.S. Embassy offices. Two  Panamanians are still being detained.  </P> <P> Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and vice presidential  candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo (Billy) Ford were beaten up on  May 10 by paramilitary forces of strongman Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> The government Saturday prohibited "marches, meetings, public demonstrations or  caravans of vehicles" by any political organization until at least June 5.  </P> <P> But, said Endara, "The prohibition does not have any meaning to us." The  politician spoke as he made his way through an outdoor market in San Miguelito  on the capital's eastern outskirts. The stop was one of six made by a caravan  of about 20 opposition vehicles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blocked Traffic  </P> <P> The caravan briefly blocked traffic on some major routes. Police watched but  took no action.  </P> <P> Endara said the caravan was designed "to thank the people for their support May  7."  </P> <P> Independent observers say the opposition candidates were leading the  Noriega-picked government candidates in the national election two weeks ago  when Noriega's troops seized election ballots. The results of the election have  been annulled by the government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Violence Probe  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the government said the 17 security guard personnel were questioned  as part of an investigation into the May 10 violence.  </P> <P> Those detained work for Tesna Protective Services, an American firm that  operates in Panama under the name Memsa. The company provides by contract about  80 employees who serve as security personnel for U.S. diplomatic offices. They  are not employees of the U.S. Embassy.  </P> <P> Alexis Guerra, a bodyguard of Ford, was killed in the May 10 violence, and  another, Humberto Montenegro, was wounded.  </P> <P> Guerra was a Tesna-Memsa employee, on leave from the company. Montenegro had  been employed by Tesna-Memsa until early this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Response to Visit  </P> <P> The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communique saying the  prohibition on demonstrations was in response to the upcoming visit by  delegates from the Organization of American States.  </P> <P> The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago,  accompanied by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, are due in Panama on  Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution of Panama's 15-month-old  government crisis.  </P> <P> The organization on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of Gen Noriega,  the commander of the Panama Defense Forces and the effective ruler of the  country.  </P> <P> The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since February, 1988, when he  was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida. Noriega has survived  economic sanctions and international pressure, accusing the United States of  seeking to scrap a treaty that will give Panama full control and supervision of  the Panama Canal by the end of the century.  </P></p>

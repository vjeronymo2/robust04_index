			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. B. Safonov; UDC 538.566:533.93] </F>   [Abstract] The reflection of electromagnetic waves from an  inhomogeneous semiconductor transfer layer with a perfectly  conducting screen is examined. Using an analytical solution of  the wave equation, an expression is obtained for the  reflectivity of the electromagnetic waves, depending on the  thickness of the layer, the width of the transition region, the  concentration of electrons, the degree of absorption and the  length of the irradiating wave. Figures 5; references 3.</p>

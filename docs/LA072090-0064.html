			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MASTERS NATIONAL CYCLING;  </P> <P> RUNNER-UP FINISH SHOWS SHE'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK  </P> <P> In her first three-kilometer time trial, after only 2 1/2 months of training on  a track, Boulevard's Marti Ray of the San Diego Cyclo-Vets placed second  Thursday in the women's 40-over division in the Masters National Cycling  Championships at the Velodrome.  </P> <P> Ray finished in 4:23.88, behind Camille Buchannan of Williamsburg, Va., who won  in 4:22.23.  </P> <P> "I'm really happy. I did my personal best," Ray said. "I pretty much went out  and did what Dave Grylls (her coach and a former Pan Am champion) projected I  would do from practice runs.  </P> <P> "I'm totally in love with track racing. The depth and intensity of training  required on the track will be terribly beneficial to my endurance."  </P> <P> Ray, 40, who has been competing in biathlons for two years, considers herself  an "endurance athlete" and usually does marathon cycling; she began cycling 13  years ago as a form of fitness. There was a five-year span during which she  quit the sport, but she resumed five years ago when she began to feel out of  shape.  </P> <P> Ray had planned to do the 40-kilometer time trial in Tijuana Monday, but a  collision Sunday in the national biathlon in Ontario, Calif., made it  impossible for her to ride in it.  </P> <P> "It was an unfortunate mishap," Ray said. "A women ran into me and poked a hole  in my disc (wheel)."  </P> <P> Ray finished that race and took third, but shortly after the brand new, $1,200  wheel was taken off the bike, it exploded. She didn't have another wheel to use  Monday.  </P> <P> Her husband, Ralph, has designed and built approximately 12 bikes for her so  far. The couple has traveled to the wind tunnel at Texas A&amp;M to test the  aerodynamics on all their equipment. Marti has been in the wind tunnel four  times and has the lowest drag coefficient of anyone who has tested there. This  means her style is the most streamlined.  </P> <P> Ralph invented a training device called Spin Coach and had it patented in 1981.  It's unlike a stationary bike in that it allows the cyclist to do isolated leg  training in addition to a regular workout.  </P> <P> "You can train one leg at a time for specific training of muscles," Marti said.  "You develop a nerve pattern in the muscles, and it makes the leg more fluid in  the entire stroke."  </P> <P> Ray does most of her training on the stationary bike but takes to the road "to  develop road-handling skills or for social fun rides."  </P> <P> After a fourth-place finish in the men's 30-34 one kilometer time trial  Wednesday, Danny Van Haute of San Marcos won the three-kilometer time trial in  3:45. Another local rider, Peter McCurdy, finished third in 3:48.  </P> <P> "I'm happy, but I wanted to do 3:42," Van Haute said. "My dad (Frank, also his  coach) was clocking me and said I was right on mark with two laps to go. Then I  lost three seconds on those two laps."  </P></p>

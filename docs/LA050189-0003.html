			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has asked four nations to accept  U.S. anti-terrorism agents who would gather intelligence and check airport  security, U.S. News and World Report said. Bush Administration officials were  unavailable for comment. This week's edition of the magazine named the  countries as Britain, Italy, West Germany and Israel and said that if  permission were granted, agents of the Federal Aviation Administration could be  in place by year's end. The publication also said that Skinner earlier told  aviation officials abroad that the White House would soon ask Congress to make  it a crime for any airline flying in and out of the United States to leak  information from the U.S. government about terrorist threats.  </P></p>

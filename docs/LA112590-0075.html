			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> BEETHOVEN: SYMPHONIES NOS. 7 &amp; 8. Chicago Symphony conducted by Sir Georg  Solti.  </P> <P> London 425 525-2. No surprises here -- the performers are too familiar to us  and to each other, and Solti too straightforward a conductor. Neither of these  performances catch fire with the kind of emotional abandon and rhythmic  vivacity others have found. But they're nevertheless surprisingly attractive in  their plain-spoken sturdiness, effective despite (or because?) of the steady  sobriety of their unfolding. Underlying the apparent effortlessness of the  playing, however, is a firm hand at the helm, and an unselfish intellect that  knows this music doesn't require much prodding to work.

Undefeated in three fights,  Tom "Bomber" Brown of Chula Vista will face Mike Powell of San Diego in his  professional debut. San Diego's Brad Powell (2-1) takes on Spring Valley's Gil  Jacobs (1-1).  </P> <P> Other fights include: Campo's Randy "Cowboy" Leaks (9-2) vs. Las Vegas' Donald  Stephens (6-2); San Diego's Jorge Rivera (14-9) vs. Los Angeles' Vicente Lopez  (7-1); Barrio Station's Rojelio Perez (3-2) vs. Mexicali's Jose Luis Vasquez  (6-4); Los Angeles' Charles Kirk Young (2-2) vs. Mexico City's Roberto Gonzalez  (7-1).  </P> <P> FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Roman Fortin, a San Diego State offensive tackle, will play in the 1990 Senior  Bowl. The game, to be played in Mobile, Ala., Jan. 20 at 11:30 a.m., gives  seniors an opportunity to display their skills in front of professional scouts  and coaches.  </P> <P> Fortin (6-feet-5, 270 pounds) was an All-WAC second team selection this season.  </P> <P> WATER POLO  </P> <P> Two players and the coach were honored with postseason awards for UC San Diego,  which enjoyed its finest season ever.  </P> <P> Jason Brown was named to the NCAA All-American second team, and Jason Vance was  selected honorable mention. Brown, a junior who plays the two-meter position,  led the Tritons with 81 goals and set a school record by drawing 85 opponent  ejections. He was the only player chosen from a non-Division I school.  </P> <P> Denny Harper was named coach of the year by the Western Water Polo Assn. for  the second consecutive year. UCSD won its second consecutive WWPA title and  earned an automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament where the Tritons finished  sixth.  </P></p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Major's future CONSERVATIVES who dream of replacing Mr John Major with a charismatic leader, or one more to this or that political taste, would do well to pause before unsheathing their daggers less than three years after the Tories dismissed the then Mrs Thatcher, and willingly chose Mr Major to replace her. It is less than 18 months since he led them to an unexpected general election victory. Following a campaign in which the central figure was Mr Major himself, the Conservatives attracted 14.1m votes. No other UK party, and no other prime minister, has ever won so many. British democracy would be damaged if he were now to be replaced merely to suit the political convenience of his party. This does not mean that Mr Major can regard his hold on office as secure. Unlike the president of the US he was not elected for a fixed term, removable only by impeachment or the threat of it. A UK prime minister keeps his job for just so long as he can command a working majority in the House of Commons. When he loses the confidence of his own colleagues he, or she, must go. It is that confidence that Mr Major is finding it so difficult to maintain. The fault is partly his own. The election was fought on the proposition that the recession would end as soon as the government was returned. Voters who found that it did not were understandably annoyed. Speeches made by the prime minister before sterling was ejected from the exchange rate mechanism a year ago sounded hollow in the aftermath of Black Wednesday. The authority lost by Mr Major on that fateful day has not been regained. The government's handling of much of its business, notably the plan to close coalmines, has been inept. The prime minister's hesitant and incomplete changes in his cabinet have added to an impression that he is a weak leader. Disgruntled It is not obvious, however, that any conceivable successor would find the job more manageable. The government was returned with a majority of only 21 in April 1992; that figure has since fallen to 17 as a result of by-election losses in Newbury and Christchurch. This gives disproportionate power, and publicity, to disgruntled backbenchers seeking the limelight. Some dismissed ministers have permitted themselves to become resentful and destructive ordinary members, as shown by the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, this week. The deep divisions among Conservatives over European policy persist, in spite of the passage of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. There is a genuine debate over the desirability of further increasing taxation in the November Budget. The party may unite around the new chancellor's proposal to squeeze public sector pay, but if the consequence is that services are curtailed the process is unlikely to win popular support for the Tories, the prime minister, or even the usually affable Mr Kenneth Clarke. Should the latter replace Mr Major he would find that his undoubtedly superior political skills would not in themselves suffice to turn the Conservatives' fortunes around. Fractious The truth is that the Tories' fall in the opinion polls cannot be blamed on Mr Major alone. The real problem is the present condition of the Conservative party. In office since 1979, it has become fractious, divided, uncertain of its own destination or that of the country. The frequent complaint that the prime minister lacks vision might be directed at the party itself. Potential successors vary in the images they project of the kind of British society they would aspire to construct. There is no single Conservative mission. One of the by-products of the political cycle is that losing parties can refresh their thinking while out of office. The Conservatives achieved this most famously after 1945, and again in the years leading up to their victory in 1979. A spell of opposition has its benefits. The Tories enjoy no such luxury today. They are still in the early years of a new parliament. They must find a means of re-energising themselves while still in power. If Mr Major can show at the forthcoming party conference, or in the months thereafter, that such an exercise can take place under his leadership, he will have justified the confidence placed in him by the country at election time.</p>

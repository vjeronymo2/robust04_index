			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Isle of Wight ferry operators cleared by MMC labelled the world's most expensive route by aggrieved islanders - were yesterday cleared by the Monopolies Commission of acting against the public interest. The commission concluded after an eight-month study that Wightlink, the biggest Isle of Wight ferry operator, enjoyed a technical monopoly on services to and from the UK mainland, but cleared it of abusing its position. Isle of Wight County Council said it was disappointed by the verdict. It had hoped that the commission would force Wightlink to give up at least one of its three routes to a competitor. It took comfort from a decision by Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, that the director general of fair trading should check the position again in three years' time. Wightlink, a subsidiary of Bermuda-based Sea Containers, is the biggest of four operators on Isle of Wight routes. The others are Red Funnel, a subsidiary of Associated British Ports, and two independents: Hovertravel and Cowes Express. The Monopolies Commission launched its investigation into the four companies' ferry services last year because of complaints from islanders about fares. It received almost 600 letters on the subject during its inquiry. In the absence of bridges, tunnels or regular air services between the island and the mainland, the ferries offer the only means of crossing the Solent to nearby Southampton, Portsmouth or Lymington. Residents said high fares limited their ability to visit the mainland and discouraged tourist traffic, on which the local economy was heavily dependent. The commission's report says Wightlink has a technical monopoly on the island's ferry services, carrying 71 per cent of the passengers, 85 per cent of cars, 80 per cent of lorries and 94 per cent of coaches. The company's profits, it says, are substantial, at about 12 per cent of the replacement costs of its assets. They are not so great, however, as to be regarded as against the public interest and the other operators are making losses or moderate profits. The commission acknowledges that ferry fares per mile on Isle of Wight services are among the highest in the UK. A day return for a car and family of four can cost Pounds 59.40 on a summer weekend, it says. The shortest crossing distance, Lymington to Yarmouth, is just under 4 miles and the shortest crossing time, Southsea to Ryde, is 10 minutes. The report says comparisons with other routes are of limited value, however. Short crossings tend to have a higher cost per mile than long ones, it says. Many comparable Scottish services are heavily subsidised and cross-Channel ferries carry much heavier loadings. Mr James Sherwood, president of Sea Containers, said the report vindicated the company's strategy since acquiring the Isle of Wight ferry services from British Rail in 1984. 'This strategy has been to increase capacity and frequency of sailings and standards of on-board comfort while not increasing tariffs by more than inflation,' he said. Cross-Solent Ferries.

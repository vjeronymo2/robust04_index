			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brasilia, 30 May (AE) -- The Provisional Measure  in the Economic Stabilization Program that creates the URV [real  value unit] has become Law No. 8880. The measure, which was  approved by congress, was sanctioned by President Itamar Franco  on 27 May with two vetoes and it was published in the official  gazette on 28 May. [passage omitted]    The two vetoes by President Franco to Provisional Measure  482  affect the parity between agricultural products prices  (Paragraph 2, Article 16) and labor relations (Article 41).  Paragraph 2, Article 16, established that "monetary correction"  of rural financial, marketing, or investment credit operations  regardless of their source, "must be equivalent to the minimum  prices in force for agricultural products." This amendment was  part of the agreement reached between the congressional ruralist  bloc and the government to approve the provisional measure.</p>

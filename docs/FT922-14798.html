			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TURNOVER in the London Traded Options market soared to one of its highest levels this year as dealers hedged positions ahead of next week's election, writes Joel Kibazo. Traders chose the end of the account day to take positions in front of the impending election. However, a substantial part of the day's volume was based on three large trades in stock options. Lasmo topped the league table of top stock option trades. It traded a total of 5,116 contracts, and was closely followed by Guiness with a day's total of 5,042. James Capel was reported to have traded some 5,000 contracts in each of the above, selling puts and stock in the process. Asda was also busy registering a total of 3,136 lots. The FT-SE option traded a total of 11,095 contracts. By the close, turnover in the options had reached a hefty 50,569 contracts. In contrast, trading in stock index futures was described by one trader as 'dull' with little in the way of institutional business and independent traders taking centre stage. The session was volatile and June closed at 2,413, around 4 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 28. Turnover reached 4,934 lots.</p>

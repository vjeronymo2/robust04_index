			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has given rather unusual instructions to economic organs,  including the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations  [Keidanren] that, in commenting on the economic stimulus package  announced recently, they should "indicate" to outsiders "a high  appraisal" of the program. This was disclosed in a document  obtained by TOKYO SHIMBUN on 13 February.    This document, which also includes a "model" comment, urges  economic organs to clarify their position on supporting  correction of the gap in the ratio between direct and indirect  taxes, and also on demanding a "prompt decision" on how  financial sources will be secured to make up for losses from tax  cuts -- an issue that has been discussed among various political  parties following the rejection of the "national welfare tax"  concept. In this way, MITI imposes pressure on the economic  organs to make a high appraisal of the package. However, the  economic circles have reacted strongly, saying: "It is  tantamount to control of speech by bureaucrats." Moreover, in  view of the fact that bureaucrats are being criticized for  "controlling Japan," the MITI document will most likely create a  stir in the international community.    On the afternoon of 8 February, before a cabinet decision  was  made on the comprehensive economic package, MITI sent the  document to various economic organs, including Keidanren, the  Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry [JCCI], the Japan  Federation of Employers' Associations [JFEA], and the Japan  Association of Corporate Executives [JACE]. The document  entitled "Draft Comments on the Economic Package" is mainly made  up of "major points" and "model" answers that economic organs  should make when asked by new agencies to comment on the details  of the economic package.    Among the points clearly stated in the document are: that 1)  they should welcome and highly appraise the government's  decision on launching the package totalling over 15 trillion  yen; 2) that they should support the government's plan for  correcting the gap in ratios between direct and indirect taxes;  3) that they should call for an end to discussion on tax system  reform, including the issue of how to finance losses from tax  cuts, at an early date so as to obtain public consensus on the  reform; and 4) that they should indicate their intention to  immediately take measures based on early legislation of budget  and tax reform bills.    Moreover, the document gives several "model" answers based  on  these points. For example: "The package can be highly appraised  as a decisive judgement made by the ruling parties and  government." Even a proviso is attached to the document, saying  they should highly appraise the package "by touching on proper  content" such as concrete examples concerning tax cuts.    In response, however, the business circles maintain that  "the  document should not be accepted" because it is unprecedented.  Another top business leader also strongly criticized MITI and  expressed his displeasure openly. He said: "MITI intends to  mold public opinion by trying to convey the will and ideas of  those who govern to those who are governed." Thus, evaluations  of the package announced by the four major economic organs did  not exclusively support it. For instance, JAEC Chairman Masaru  Hayami even indicated dissatisfaction with the land tax system,  and said: "It will have only a limited effect on promoting land  transactions." Thus, the four economic organs managed to repel,  for the time being, the pressure imposed on them by MITI.    However, being a MITI-authorized corporation formed on the  basis of the Law on Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the JCCI  maintains delicate relations with MITI. Thus, in the comments  issued on the evening of 8 February in the name of Chairman  Kosaku Inaba, the JCCI stated: "We welcome the liberal measure  of earmarking 1.3 trillion yen to help small and medium-sized  companies." In this comment, it can be noted that some  "consideration" must be given to MITI's intention.    In response to opposition from business circles, a senior  MITI official first admitted sending such a document to economic  organs, and then denied it was an attempt to impose pressure on  them. He explained that "the document is designed to make them  fully understand the package, but 'they are not asked' to act in  accordance with the document."    According to MITI Administrative Vice Minister Hedeaki  Kumano: "No instructions were given to make draft comments nor  did I know what was all about. Generally speaking, when an  economic package has been worked out, a briefing will be given  to the business circles so as to make them fully aware of the  package. This time we tried to give them a briefing. I don't  think instructions were given as to how the package should be  appraised..."</p>

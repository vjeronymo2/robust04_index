			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Churchgoer wins tribunal backing on Sunday working A systems engineer who refused to work on a Sunday because it prevented him from going to church has won his case for unfair dismissal from an industrial tribunal. This is the first time an industrial tribunal has ruled in an unfair dismissal case based on the grounds of the applicant's religious beliefs. Mr Andrew Dutton, who worked for Hughes Rediffusion Simulation at Crawley, West Sussex, for five years, said: 'I am just an ordinary guy who did not want to be forced to work Sundays. I tried hard to reach a compromise with the company and failed.' The company, a subsidiary of General Motors, wanted Mr Dutton to work up to 26 Sundays a year - which could have resulted in Sunday working for a continuous 12 months - but he said that as a practising Christian he could not. A further hearing will set damages for Mr Dutton, but he is now without a job. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, welcomed the tribunal's ruling. He said: 'The government has fostered a climate in which employers disregard the fundamental rights of their employees in the pursuit of profit at the expense of dignity.' The Keep Sunday Special Campaign, which was not involved in Mr Dutton's case, said yesterday that the affair highlighted 'the importance of securing adequate employment protection for employees to ensure their right to express their religious beliefs of whatever persuasion'. The proposed limited employee protection contained in the Sunday trading bill going through parliament covers only those in the retail trade and not in associated industries or other sectors. Mr Dutton won his case under the 1978 Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act.</p>

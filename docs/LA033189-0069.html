			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSCAR: AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION;  </P> <P> EL RESCATE PARTY AT VERTIGO WAS NO PIECE OF CAKE  </P> <P> Like some Oscar ceremonies of years past, some Oscar parties have more glitches  than glitz.  </P> <P> Take Wednesday night's second annual Oscar-watching party and fund-raiser held  by El Rescate, a support group for Central American refugees in the Los Angeles  area. The 1988 El Rescate party at the Mondrian Hotel attracted a large crop of  young actors, but this year's version, held at the newly reopened discotheque  Vertigo in downtown Los Angeles, attracted fewer celebrities and more  logistical problems.  </P> <P> Many guests who paid $100 apiece to attend were left out on the sidewalk during  the telecast -- when the doormen, who insisted that the club wasn't ready to  receive partygoers, acted as if they were shepherding a standard Friday-night  club crowd instead of prepaid ticket holders. And many of those who managed to  get in soon regretted it. Every one of about 20 people questioned expressed  displeasure with the night's events.  </P> <P> Costume designer Scilla Andreen-Hernandez did finally get in. She and her  escort had arrived at 5:30 and were not allowed inside for more than an hour.  Once in, she made the mistake of trying to enter a restricted area -- which was  not marked -- and was grabbed roughly by a Vertigo guard.  </P> <P> "This is ridiculous. I almost wonder why I came," she said.  </P> <P> As the Oscar ceremony began at 6 p.m., only about 100 people were inside the  club; ticket-holders were lined up outside. Those who circumvented the guards  outside watched the ceremony on monitors donated by KMEX-TV.  </P> <P> Guests got the first peek at Vertigo's interior, which combines high-tech  industrial furnishings with a '70s-style disco floor, complete with fog  machines. Vertigo's employees appeared touchier than Secret Service agents,  treating guests like interlopers and in at least one case, cursing at a woman  who was merely trying to find a bathroom.  </P> <P> "You can't take pictures inside the club," one employee told a television  newswoman, "and you can't take pictures of anyone -- unless they're smiling."  </P> <P> More gracious was event chairman Esai Morales as he ran around, fixing a number  of last-minute details.  </P> <P> "We're dealing with a club that's holding its first opening," he said. "On the  last day (before the party), it seems that everybody decides they want to come  and they call."  </P> <P> Morales was less enthusiastic about a competing Oscar party at the Mondrian,  which was billed as "The Second Annual Academy Award Celebration at the  Mondrian." Sources within El Rescate had indicated that the group was  considering legal action against the other fund-raiser's organizers, for  possible misrepresentation of their party.  </P> <P> "Put it this way," Morales said. "We as an entity don't want to take legal  action, but who knows? I'm going to let the powers that be straighten it out."  </P> <P> Things took another bad turn at about the time that the best picture was  announced. Lots of people were inside by then, but actress Rain Pryor, who was  scheduled to speak on stage at the concert afterward, was refused entry at the  door when she couldn't produce identification. (She later got in when she was  OKd by someone inside the club.)  </P> <P> Other ticket-holders on the sidewalk -- including actors Harrison Ford and  Kiefer Sutherland -- gave up and left without ever getting inside.  </P> <P> Fire marshals arrived at 9:15, sealed off one balcony, forbade further  admissions and promptly threatened to shut the club down for overcrowding.  (Fire Marshal Addison Burdine declined to comment or to estimate the number of  people on hand.)  </P> <P> "The Fire Department was sort of unreasonable about it," said Vertigo's general  manager, Goyn Samuels. "They made us take the tables off the dance floor, and I  can understand why some people who had to get up would be upset."  </P> <P> Asked about guests' other complaints, especially the guards' manhandling of  some partygoers, Samuels pointed out that the night's staff also included  security people hired by El Rescate.  </P> <P> "This is not all Vertigo staff," he said.  </P> <P> El Rescate officials, however, said Vertigo was responsible for the evening's  problems. The organizers expected the club to have been open for several weeks  before Wednesday night's party.  </P> <P> Instead, Oscar night turned into a dry run for the new club: There was not one  public telephone in the building, and guests who left to use one were not  readmitted. Many guests never had a bite to eat. Those who ate, however, were  enthusiastic about the peeled shrimp, cheese puffs, seafood pizza and fresh  oysters.  </P> <P> Dessert arrived without silverware. Waiters simply told guests to take pieces  of cake off of trays. Hungry guests who complied discovered, to their dismay,  that they were holding cold, wet hunks of ice cream cake.  </P> <P> A musical jam session began after 11 p.m. and soothed some feelings. Jane Fonda  introduced singers Holly Near and Bonnie Raitt, who performed songs in support  of Central American causes, and Dennis Quaid was scheduled to join them later.  </P> <P> And there was always celebrity watching. Those spotted included Gregory Hines,  Billy Idol, Robert Downey Jr., Sarah Jessica Parker, Howard Hesseman, Sen. Alan  Cranston, songwriter Stephen Bishop, Chad Lowe, Rob Lowe, Daphne Zuniga and  comedian Taylor Negron, who was a late arrival, coming straight to the party  from emceeing another Oscar party at City Restaurant.  </P> <P> Marlee Matlin, best actress winner of 1987, was another late arrival.  </P> <P> "It was so nice not to have to be a nominee or a presenter this year," she  signed. "I watched the show over at Henry and Stacy Winkler's, with good  friends. And my shoes off."  </P> <P> Some of the other guests might have envied her.  </P></p>

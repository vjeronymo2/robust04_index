A Date of Full Availability (DOFA) shall be established as the last day of the month in which substantially all the units in the MROP project are available for occupancy after reconstruction; the PHA and HUD will execute an amendment to the ACC to remove the units of the MROP project from the original development project, and initiate the operating subsidy for the MROP project units, both effective as the end of the quarter in which DOFA was achieved. Changes to applicable data systems shall also be effective as of that date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael B.

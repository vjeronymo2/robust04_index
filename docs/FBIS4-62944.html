			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marat Zubko report: "Finnish President on Karelian Issue"] </F>   [Text] Helsinki -- "Last year Finnish exports to Russia  increased by one-third, and imports from our country doubled!"  Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told Russian journalists  before setting off on his visit to Moscow.    During this talk, Martti Ahtisaari was asked: "Is the  Karelian question on the agenda at this time?" In reply, the  president said that it all depended on what was meant by the  Karelian question. If the thrust of the question is directed at  ties between Finnish provinces and Karelia within the framework  of cooperation between the neighboring regions of our countries,  then we can have a sensible discussion about this topic.    Is Finland assuming the role of an intermediary in the  conflict between Russia and Estonia? If both sides propose such  a role to us, Martti Ahtisaari stated, we will have to examine  whether or not we have the prerequisites for this task. During  his visit to Russia, the president intends to listen attentively  to everything that is said to him on this subject.</p>

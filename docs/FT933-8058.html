			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Councils spurn reforms: Lang fails to quell gerrymandering storm over Scottish shake-up THE organisation which represents councils in Scotland has told Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, that it will not reconsider its refusal to co-operate with government plans to reshape local government. Mr Charles Gray, convener of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), has told Mr Lang: 'We are not prepared to help you make the best of a bad job.' Cosla strongly opposes the white paper on reorganising local government which proposes creating 28 single-tier authorities to replace the nine regional, three island and 53 district councils. The reform also involves taking water services out of the hands of regional and island councils and creating three water authorities. Cosla has argued that the present two-tier structure should be maintained and objects to the loss of council control of water services. The Labour-dominated body is particularly angry about the proposed boundaries for the new councils, drawn up without the setting up of a commission of the kind operating in England. Mr Lang has been widely accused of gerrymandering to create Conservative-controlled councils. The gerrymandering charge has been levelled at the intended creation of councils in South Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, Stirling and Berwickshire &amp; East Lothian which could have Conservative majorities. Critics have argued that these councils would have smaller populations than adjoining Labour-controlled authorities. A recent System Three opinion poll showed support in Scotland for single-tier councils at 29 per cent in July against 46 per cent in May. Cosla is refusing to take part in discussions with the Scottish Office on the details of the plan, which will form a bill in the next session of parliament. It has urged member councils to boycott discussions. So far Lothian and Grampian regions, which are Labour-controlled, have banned discussion with the Scottish Office. Strathclyde region, the biggest in Scotland, has told its officials not to take part in talks. Central and Tayside regions are also likely to ban contact with the Scottish Office. However, Highland region, which will survive after reorganisation while the district councils under it disappear, has said it will continue talking to the government. Borders region is strongly opposed to the proposal that it should lose Berwickshire, but has nevertheless decided to keep talking to the Scottish Office. The boycott on discussions will make it more difficult for the Scottish Office to complete its plans. On the other hand councils will find it more difficult to influence the final shape of the legislation if they refuse to discuss it.</p>

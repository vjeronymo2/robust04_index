			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MEDITERRANEAN SUMMIT;  </P> <P> TALKS AT SEA -- A SYMBOLIC BACKDROP;  </P> <P> LOGISTICS: MEETING ABOARD SHIP WILL ENSURE SECURITY AND PRIVACY. BUT IT ALSO  RAISES THE SPECTER OF SEASICKNESS.  </P> <P> The decision of President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to  hold their first working meeting aboard warships at sea will immediately create  a memorable and symbolic backdrop for the historic event.  </P> <P> The settings will dramatize the growing military-to-military contacts between  the two superpowers and the two nations' decreasing military and political  rivalry.  </P> <P> The summit-at-sea provides the leaders with the desired security, privacy and  intimacy. But it also poses a host of logistical problems unlike those of  previous onshore summits, from the choice of ships to the possibility of rough  water and seasickness.  </P> <P> Washington and Moscow have agreed to send roughly equivalent cruisers from  their navies for the meetings, but the specific ships have not been named. The  United States and the Soviet Union both maintain substantial fleets in the  Mediterranean, including cruisers, destroyers, frigates and submarines.  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy also continually stations an aircraft carrier in the region, but  the Soviets have no equivalent ship.  </P> <P> The obvious U.S. choice is the cruiser Belknap, flagship of the U.S. 6th Fleet,  which is permanently based at Gaeta, Italy. As the fleet's flagship, it has  quarters fit for a senior naval commander, including a wood-paneled conference  room and elegant wardrooms and staterooms.  </P> <P> But the Administration may be reluctant to use the Belknap, since its name is  associated with a Nov. 22, 1975, incident in which the cruiser collided with  the carrier John F. Kennedy off Sicily, killing eight American sailors and  injuring 46.  </P> <P> Navy spokesman Lt. Bruce Cole said that three U.S. cruisers would be on station  in the Mediterranean in time for the Dec. 2-3 summit: the Aegis-class cruiser  Yorktown and the guided-missile cruisers Wainwright and Harry E. Yarnell.  </P> <P> Each is about 550 feet long, displacing 7,000 to 9,000 tons. The Soviet navy  has several equivalent classes of warships, including the new Kara-class  cruisers.  </P> <P> Also still to be decided is whether the discussions will take place while the  ships are under way or at anchor.  </P> <P> Landing a helicopter on a moving warship is a tricky business, even in good  weather, naval experts say. And boarding from a smaller launch can also be  harrowing in high winds and heavy seas, they said.  </P> <P> Retired Adm. Gene LaRoque of the pacifist Center for Defense Information  suggested that the meeting likely will take place in a neutral port, such as  the island of Malta, or as the ships are lashed together in international  waters.  </P> <P> There is scant historical precedent for a shipboard summit. The last time an  American President met a foreign leader aboard a warship was during World War  II.  </P> <P> President Franklin D. Roosevelt met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill  aboard the British battleship Prince of Wales off the coast of Newfoundland in  August, 1941.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: TRUE TOUGH GUYS WON'T BE IN RING  </P> <P> Next week in Las Vegas, Sugar Ray Leonard will fight Roberto Duran, and we  sports writers will pull out all the stops. Words such as courage, valor,  toughness, daring, willingness to suffer and ability to take it will dot the  prose.  </P> <P> Okay, Roberto Duran is tough. But does he have horns? He'll try to left-hook  you. But with a fist, not an antler. He can hit you. But he can't gore you.  </P> <P> Sugar Ray Leonard is fast? Well, sure. But he only has two legs. How'd he like  to run down something that has four?  </P> <P> One of the fighters might have a slight pull in the weights -- a pound or two.  But it won't be 1,500 pounds. What if you had an opponent who had a ton edge on  the scales? And four legs? And horns?  </P> <P> Duran is mean. But he won't bite you. He won't try to stomp you to death. At  least, I hope he won't.  </P> <P> Mike Tyson is fierce. He takes people out in 91 seconds. But how would you like  an opponent so tough that if you last eight seconds with him, you win?  </P> <P> Listen! You think the 1927 Yankees' lineup was Murderers' Row? I'd like to show  you the real article -- a lineup that would make the Capone gang look like  vicars.  </P> <P> You get in the ring with Duran, you get the Marquess of Queensberry rules: No  gouging, head-butting, kicking, biting, hitting a man when he's down. This  bunch knows no rules. There are no offsides, interference calls, holding  penalties. No timeouts. No play ruled dead. When the play's over, you run like  hell. Or you'll be called dead.  </P> <P> You've heard of the football team so tough it was responsible for "six  nosebleeds, five broken teeth, four limp-offs -- and three  positively-refused-to-return-to-play"? That wouldn't even be a good night for  this bunch.  </P> <P> You think hockey is violent? Hah!  </P> <P> Sports teams get called the Bulls, Broncos, Steers, Longhorns, Mavericks,  Mustangs, Colts. But this bunch is the real article.  </P> <P> Football coaches have been accused of getting their lineups out of the bushes  in Central Park, mob hideouts and post office walls. Well, this lineup is as  hand-picked for runaway malice as the crew of a pirate ship or the Dillinger  Gang. The Gestapo would run.  </P> <P> Tackling Bo Jackson is a minuet compared to taking on this bunch.  </P> <P> What we have reference to is the cast of characters who will line up against  the real cowboys, not the 1-11 football team, all next week in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> While Leonard-Duran will be settling their championship at the Mirage, the  cowboys will be settling theirs across town at the Thomas &amp; Mack Arena in  the National Finals Rodeo, the World Series of cowboying, the last stand of the  Old West in our time. It is where they crown their bull-riding, bronc-riding,  steer-wrestling and calf-roping champions of the year.  </P> <P> They are in tougher than Duran or Leonard. You remember the old fight cartoon  where one pug looks across the ring and sees this hairy sub-human with the  invisible brow, drooling in the other corner, and his manager says to the  referee, "My boy says he don't fight till he hears it talk"? Well, the cowboys'  opponents can't talk or think very much; they're pretty much impervious to pain  and they have no conscience. And there's no referee to stop it. All they know  is, they want to get these guys off their backs and drop-kick them to the moon  if possible.  </P> <P> They're hungry, homicidal, irritable, trigger-tempered.  </P> <P> In most sporting events, you are not required to make your opponent any madder  than he already is. You don't have to lean across the line of scrimmage to  Lawrence Taylor and suggest his birth was an accident or spit in his eye or  insult his sister. But you are expected to rowel an angry bull or a frenzied  pony if he starts to show compassion. The last thing a cowboy wants is for an  animal to hit the tanbark and just stand there.  </P> <P> There's little likelihood of that. A cowboy would carry a rattlesnake if he  thought it would make the horse buck more. But rodeo stock is rounded up for  its antisocial quotient. These guys would all be in the Mafia if they were  human. Or they'd be serial killers.  </P> <P> They don't fear man, just hate him. They have names like Midnight and  Terminator and Geronimo. The bulls are called Cyclone, Twister, Tailspin,  Bullet and even Mack the Knife. Sometimes, they just have a number. Usually 221  or 288, but it probably should be 1375286990132 Attica. Last year's Bull of the  Year was a double-rank, dagger-horned, four-footed sociopath named Skoal's  Pacific Bell.  </P> <P> "That's because he likes to reach out and touch someone," drawls his owner, Dan  Russell. He put more people in traction than the Hollywood Freeway.  </P> <P> These cowboys are really America's Team. Eighty John Waynes. Against the  baddest cast of characters west of the Pecos. And they don't get helmets and  face masks and shoulder pads, just a ten-gallon hat and a short rope. They are  the first guys since the early Christians who have to fight wild animals for a  living.  </P> <P> Roberto Duran might get knocked out. But a whole bunch of clowns don't have to  jump in the ring in fright wigs and rubber barrels to coax Sugar Ray Leonard  out of stomping him to death or sinking a horn in his groin. Also, Roberto  should know another thing: You can't say,"No mas!" to a Brahma bull.  </P></p>

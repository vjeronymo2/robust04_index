			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Japan to grant aid to Vietnam JAPAN is about to grant aid to Vietnam, ending two decades of official economic isolation and opening the way for Japanese companies to broaden trade and investment ties with that country, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Tokyo last week received informal approval to resume aid from Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US acting secretary of state, removing the obstacle of US opposition. Japanese officials indicated that the government will wait until after the US election tomorrow to make a formal announcement, but funds are expected to start flowing before the end of the year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency's response, dated March 24, 1994, did not agree with this interpretation. The March 24 letter states,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``daylight opening'' is defined in the Final Rule as ``the maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.'' An obstruction in this context would include any obstacle or object that would block, obscure, or interfere with, in any way, access to that exit when opened. In determining the ``maximum unobstructed opening of an emergency exit,'' we would subtract, from the total area of the opening, the area of any portions of the opening that cannot be used for exit purposes as a result of the obstruction. The area measurements would be taken when viewed from a direction perpendicular to the plane of the opening.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the particular illustration included with the Wayne letter, the March 24 letter states that the area forward of the seat back and leg would be considered obstructed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 20, 1994, Mr. Thomas D. Turner of Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) wrote to the agency regarding the March 24 letter. The Blue Bird letter states, ``(w)e believed and were told (by agency personnel) that the definition of `daylight opening' applied to the exit opening itself and did not involve access to the exit opening.'' The Blue Bird letter also notes that additional interpretations will be needed to address obstructions at rear emergency exit doors, emergency exit windows, and the front service door. Blue Bird requested that the agency suspend enforcement until either (1) a final rule is issued in connection with a December 1, 1993 NPRM which proposed two alternative means of determining the maximum credit of emergency exits or (2) September 1, 1994. Blue Bird stated that this would allow sufficient time to resolve these issues and make any necessary changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 26, 1994, Mr. Turner met with agency to further explain the scope of the problem for Blue Bird. In this meeting, Mr. Turner explained that the confusion resulted in part because the term ``daylight opening'' is used differently from the November 2 final rule definition in other contexts. The alternate definition is consistent with Blue Bird's understanding of the term prior to the March 24, 1994 letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 27, 1994, Ms. Jane L. Dawson of Thomas Built Buses (Thomas Built) wrote to the agency to request a delay of the effective date of the November 2, 1992 final rule. Thomas Built stated that the March 24, 1994 letter ``differs drastically from the general interpretation of the school bus industry.'' Thomas Built also stated that one effect of the March 24 letter was the need for additional interpretations regarding other emergency exits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interpreting the term ``daylight opening'' either as any area not visually obstructed or as the entire area of the exit opening, results in crediting some exits with more exit area than the agency intended. On some buses, this would result in an incorrect determination that either no additional exits or fewer additional exits are required. For example, if a rear emergency exit door is credited with greater area than allowed, a manufacturer may have determined that no additional exits were required. On other buses, the manufacturer may have determined that only an additional side emergency exit door was required. However, if the required exits and the additional side emergency exit door are credited with greater area than allowed, this determination would be incorrect and an additional emergency roof exit may also be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has determined that the term ``daylight opening,'' without clarifying explanation, is arguably ambiguous, in that it leaves open the question of whether an ``obstruction'' is a visual obstruction or a physical obstruction. This is the issue resolved by the agency's March 24, 1994 letter to Wayne.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rather than penalize manufacturers that utilized the alternative interpretation, at significant cost to them, NHTSA has decided to allow manufacturers the option of complying with the previous requirements regarding the number and type of exits required for a school bus until September 1, 1994. That is, until September 1, 1994, manufacturers can install either a rear emergency exit door or a side emergency exit door and a rear push-out window.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to Blue Bird's request to suspend enforcement until a final rule is issued for the December 1, 1993, NPRM, NHTSA has determined that such a delay is not warranted. Each of the options proposed in the December 1, 1993 NPRM would further limit the amount of area that can be credited for an emergency exit. Because any final rule consistent with the proposals in the December 1, 1993 NPRM would require vehicle redesign, additional leadtime would be necessary after publication of such a final rule. Therefore, NHTSA has determined that suspension of the November 2, 1992 final rule until the rulemaking proceeding for the December 1, 1993 NPRM is final would unnecessarily delay the safety benefits of the November 2, 1992 final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that the safety effects of an extension to September 1, 1994 will be minimal. The November 2, 1992 final rule required additional exits on some school buses. The confusion about the amount of area credited for each exit has resulted in some school buses having fewer exits than the agency expected under the November 2, 1992 final rule. However, many of these school buses have been redesigned to have more exits than required prior to the November 2, 1992 final rule. The agency expects that manufacturers will not revert to prior designs during the extension period. Therefore, much of the anticipated benefits of the final rule will be retained during this time period. In addition, the length of the extension period is short. Therefore, NHTSA anticipates minimal loss of safety benefits as a result of this extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

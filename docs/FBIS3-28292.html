			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was learned on 4 February that during a series  of meetings with Japanese cabinet ministers, U.S. Trade  Representative Kantor proposed that "Japanese and American  politicians join delegations of the two countries to the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks."    In a bid to hammer out an accord in the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks prior to the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11  February, vice ministerial talks will be held in Washington  beginning 7 February. The United States is still critical of  Japanese bureaucrats, saying, "No progress can be expected  because of tough Japanese bureaucrats." Mr. Kantor's proposal is  believed aimed at extracting concessions from Japan on the issue  of setting numerical targets which have become a focal point at  the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks by having Japanese  cabinet ministers attend the talks. In response, the Japanese  Government rejected Mr. Kantor's proposal, saying, "We do not  want to bring any change to the way the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks are held," (says a senior official in the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry). As a result, vice  ministerial officials from the two countries will hold the talks.    Speaking at a news conference on 4 February, Mr. Kantor  said,  "Foreign Minister Hata will lead the Japanese effort and he will  assume the responsibility for the talks." In this way, Mr.  Kantor talked as if the Foreign Minister had promised him during  a meeting that he would assume the responsibility for the talks.  In response, Japanese bureaucrats reacted against Mr. Kantor's  statement, saying, "Foreign Minister Hata did not make that  promise," and confirmed anew that mainly working-level officials  will attend the talks.</p>

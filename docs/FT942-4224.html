			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Three suits filed to block Times Mirror cable deal Three law suits have been filed against Times Mirror, the US media group, seeking to block the proposed sale of its cable television operations to Cox Enterprises for Dollars 2.3bn. Times Mirror said it was in the process of studying and evaluating the complaints. One of the suits, filed by a shareholder, raises objections to the terms of the deal relating to Chandler family trusts. The Chandler family holds a 55 per cent controlling interest in Times Mirror. Other Times Mirror shareholders will receive stock in Cox Cable, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, as part of the proposed transaction. The Chandler trusts, which are precluded from holding stock in Cox, will instead receive a new non-voting preferred Times Mirror stock that will continue to pay dividends of about Dollars 42.5m a year. Times Mirror said this week that dividends paid to other shareholders would be substantially reduced when the proposed transaction is completed, to enable greater investment in digital media ventures. Under the terms of the agreement with Cox, Times Mirror will also receive Dollars 1.36m in cash through a debt swap arrangement.</p>

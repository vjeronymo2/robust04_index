			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Communist Party Secretary Gennadiy </F> Zyuganov by Mauro De Bonis in Moscow; date not given: "Trust  Me, I Will Be Your Brezhnev"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [De Bonis] Mr. Zyuganov, are  you happy about the amnesty that freed Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and  others who took part in the confrontation between Parliament and  Yeltsin last October?    [Zyuganov] The amnesty decreed by the Duma is the victory of  reason. However, we must not forget that it is only a first  step in the right direction. The second step is to remove from  power the incompetent people that are selling off our country.    [De Bonis] Will this amnesty benefit Yeltsin or the  opposition?    [Zyuganov] It will be to everyone's advantage. However, the  radical democrats do not want to understand this, and the mass  media continues to utter hysterical cries and predict that there  will be a bloody clash. I assume that they have still not  assessed the political importance of what has happened, but it  would be better for them to think this over well.    [De Bonis] Immediately after the liberation of the prisoners  there was talk of civil war.    [Zyuganov] If there is going to be a civil war, Europe will  experience terrible hours. Rather, it would be a catastrophe  for the entire planet. The Russian ship must travel in calm  waters if it wants to berth in a good port.    [De Bonis] Let us talk about the economy a little. President  Yeltsin has abandoned his shock therapy policy. Was this the  victory of the people over the reformers?    [Zyuganov] It was the victory of sound thinking over those  who tried to destroy Russia. You cannot talk of reforms when  the state is falling apart, when half of the factories are not  working, when the aged are being humiliated, when culture, the  economy, and the moral foundations of our population are being  destroyed. Europe will soon realize what the destructive  process has brought and what it itself contributed by supporting  first Gorbachev and then Yeltsin.    [De Bonis] Who is responsible?    [Zyuganov] The real author of this policy is the IMF, whose  development models were imposed upon Russia as has already  happened in Latin America. For the IMF bosses it is a matter of  transforming the economy of a country into an economic space to  be exploited to its own advantage, and the results to date are:  in Yugoslavia their models have led to a ferocious war, in  Czechoslovakia the country has been divided into two, in Poland  industrial production has fallen by 40 percent.    [De Bonis] What are the objectives of the Russian  Communists?    [Zyuganov] Our objective is to change the course of the  shock  therapy into a normal evolutionary development of reforms, and  to work to bring about a new growth in culture, science, and  health. Moreover, it will be necessary to take the appropriate  measures to protect the elderly and children. To put a moral  brake on the pornography that is rampant in the country and to  stop the spreading Americanization, primarily through television.    [De Bonis] Are you still against the Americans? It seems  that President Clinton looks favorably on a strong Communist  Party in Russia.    [Zyuganov] We have nothing against the Americans. They have  had to take note that there has been a new political situation  in Russia since 12 December and they know well that continuing  to support the shock therapy would have led to disorder at the  international level. For this reason I now prefer a policy of  stability. I can no longer support just Russia's Choice (the  party close to Yeltsin). More support to Yeltsin could lead to  the spread of anti-Americanism, as was the case with Gorbachev.  A situation very similar to the "Cold War" situation. We do  not want this kind of relationship with the Americans.</p>

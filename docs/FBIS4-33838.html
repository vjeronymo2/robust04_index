			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "White Glove Interventionism"] </F>   [Text] Topping the strongly interventionist statements made  by Congressman Robert Torricelli a few weeks back, James Jones,  the U.S. ambassador to our country, has now crossed the line  that separates a mere opinion on a political process -- in this  case, the Mexican process -- from statements that imply  intentions to modify it.    The Washington Government usually considers our country  "excessively sensitive" when it reacts to comments made by U.S.  diplomats on national political, social, or economic issues and  denies that those statements are made with an interventionist  intention. However, although the historical background of  relations between Mexico and the United States offers enough  reasons to be sensitive, the different representatives of the  White House in Mexico seem not to be able to resist the  temptation of slipping in (with more or less subtlety, according  to the diplomacy of the official holding the position at the  time) statements geared to pressure the national government to  adapt its actions to Washington's needs, desires, or whims.    The irrepressible tendency shown by successive U.S.  ambassadors in our country to interfere in Mexico's internal  affairs reveals, in a modified and polished manner, our northern  neighbors' old belief that all the nations located south of the  Rio Bravo are, in the end, nothing more than the backyard of the  United States.    When James Jones asserted, for example, that the recent  entry  of Mexico to the OECD and the signing of NAFTA "would oblige"  authorities to act in a set manner (in this context, it is  unimportant if the manner is correct or not), the U.S.  ambassador seems to forget that the implementation of new  commercial policies is a product of decisions that are the  exclusive domain of the national government and have no direct  relation to our country's internal political situation and that  Mexicans are the ones who have to solve problems that derive  from this situation.    Likewise, when the U.S. representative in Mexico refrains  from saying whether foreign observers are necessary, but  emphatically asserts that "they will be here on 21 August," he  again adopts -- although his manner is more veiled than the one  used by his predecessors -- the interventionist attitude that  has characterized U.S. ambassadors in the republic.    Either the borderline between opinions and interventionist  statements is too hazy for U.S. diplomats or our new commercial  partners insist -- even if they publicly manifest their best  wishes for our country -- in their belief that their position as  world power gives them the authority to exert an irritating  political tutelage over Mexico and its inhabitants.</p>

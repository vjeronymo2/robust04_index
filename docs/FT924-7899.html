			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: MIM to focus on cutting costs to offset price falls MIM Holdings, the diversified Australian mining group, plans to concentrate on reducing costs to offset price falls for its main products of copper, lead and zinc, Reuter reports from Brisbane. Mr Norm Fussell, chief executive and managing director, told the group's annual meeting that the Australian and world recessions appeared to have some distance to run. 'We cannot, therefore, anticipate substantial rises in prices for MIM's main products in the short term,' he said. 'Recent falls in copper, lead and zinc prices confirm this. 'MIM must concentrate on reducing costs, thereby improving its competitive position against other producers worldwide.' Mr Fussell said costs at the group's Mount Isa and Hilton copper, lead, zinc and silver operations had been cut by about ADollars 80m (USDollars 57.1m) a year since a concerted cost-cutting campaign began 18 months ago. He said MIM's net profits for the three months to September 20 of ADollars 29m, up from losses of ADollars 3.5m a year earlier, was due to cost reductions at the group's main operations and low-cost gold mines. 'Gold will continue to be very important for MIM,' Mr Fussell said, adding that MIM was also planning to expand its copper output. 'In exploration, the search for copper has highest priority, particularly in north-west Queensland, Papua New Guinea and Chile,' Mr Fussell said.</p>

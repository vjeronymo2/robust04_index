			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: Good news on jobs fails to dispel bad mood - Wall Street THE US stock markets were in a distinctly bloody-minded mood this week. Take yesterday's employment figures. The monthly jobs data are the most closely-watched economic indicators in the statistical calendar; so the news that non-farm payrolls soared by 365,000 in February (three times the markets' expectations), and that the unemployment rate fell unexpectedly from 7.1 to 7.0 per cent, should have given share prices a substantial lift. After all, one of the main concerns that has troubled investors lately has been the failure of jobs' growth to keep up with the accelerating pace of economic activity. Yesterday's report showed that employment growth could be picking up at last. The Bureau of Labour Statistics said it was clear from the data that the jobs market had 'strengthened considerably' in February. Yet, the figures were all but ignored by the stock markets. Two hours after the data was released, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just three points - and other key indices were lower. The dollar, meanwhile, seemed to like the jobs news: it rose against both the D-mark and the yen on foreign exchange markets. At first glance, there seemed to be an obvious explanation for the stock markets' response. The news of the big increase in payrolls sent bond prices into a tailspin. The benchmark 30-year government issue dropped more than a full point, pushing the yield up sharply to well over 6.8 per cent. Equity investors do not react well when interest rates go up, and for good reasons. Higher rates increase the cost of capital for companies and the cost of loans for consumers. They also threaten to undermine the competitiveness of exporters by inflating the value of the dollar. This explanation, however, does not ring true because the stock markets have not been taking much of a lead from bond prices recently. Over the past two weeks, equity investors chose studiedly to ignore a remarkable bond market rally that sent yields down to record lows. So, why should they suddenly sit up and take notice when the bond market takes a turn, probably temporary, for the worse? Was there was another explanation for why the jobs figures failed to lift stock prices? One suggestion was that investors were disappointed by the meagre growth in manufacturing payrolls. The headline number might have risen by 365,000 last month, but manufacturing jobs increased by only 10,000. Even this does not make sense, though, if the employment report is scrutinised closely. While manufacturing jobs' growth was disappointing, the figures showed that the manufacturing work-week rose sharply last month and that overtime reached the highest levels seen in 36 years. Instead of taking on new workers, employers asked their existing labour force to work longer hours. Moreover, while manufacturing jobs' growth may have gone nowhere in February, companies in the services and retail industries added thousands of new workers to their payrolls - more than 250,000 new jobs were created in the two sectors combined. Admittedly, the majority of these were part-time, but any increase in the number of people working is good for the economy. And part-time workers earn money just like full-time workers - money that can be ploughed back into the economy. Perhaps the stock markets were taking their cue from the White House, which bent over backwards yesterday trying to play down the significance of the big rise in payroll numbers. An army of big guns - including the president, labour secretary Robert Reich, commerce secretary Ron Brown and Senate majority leader George Mitchell - was trotted out to say that the good jobs figures certainly did not mean the economy no longer required help from the government. Wall Street's economists disagreed forcefully. As Ed Yardeni, chief economist at CJ Lawrence, put it: 'Message to Washington: Kill the short-term fiscal stimulus programme. It isn't necessary.' So perhaps that was it. The stock markets did not like the jobs news because investors were worried that, with the economy recovering strongly enough on its own, the Clinton package of fiscal stimuli will lead to an overheated economy, rising inflation and higher interest rates. If this was the real explanation, it reflected a remarkable turnaround in stock market sentiment. When the president unveiled his package in mid-February, share prices plunged because investors feared his measures would retard, not promote, economic growth. Two weeks is obviously a long time on Wall Street.  ------------------------------------------ Monday       3355.41    -   15.40 Tuesday      3400.53    +   45.12 Wednesday    3404.04    +    3.51 Thursday     3398.91    -    5.13 Friday       3404.58    +    5.67  ------------------------------------------</p>

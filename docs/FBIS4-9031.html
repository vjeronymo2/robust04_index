			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 19 -- After receiving the invitation  of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) parliamentary caucus to  hold a meeting, President Lech Walesa told PAP on Tuesday that  if the caucus invites him, he is ready for a meeting and for  talks. Walesa added he "never refuses invitations and has  accepted many of organized social forces comprising more than  five-ten serious people."    Commenting on the suggestion by a group of deputies to amend  the Small (interim) Constitution, the president said he cannot  ignore an initiative "that can become a great fire." Walesa  criticised the prime minister's move to announce local elections  and said he "has a grudge against Pawlak" over doing this.    In reply to a remark that the Small Constitution does not at  the moment empower the president to dissolve parliament, Lech  Walesa said that "we are constructing a new constitution, a new  order and a new system. This process has many shortcomings and  it would be bad if the president did not see them. Being aware  of the fact that the change of the system is proposed, the  president cannot avoid issuing a challenge, cannot avoid asking  the question if the system can be changed like that, if this  case does not require asking society and the nation for consent."    "I am not doing anything that would testify to my violating  the law. I will address the nation with the question whether it  is possible for a group set up for two hours to change the basic  law and the political system of the country. In my opinion,  this is inadmissible and should be forbidden. I will build a  force that will make this not possible and in this context I  said that I will use this force to dissolve parliament. It will  be authorized to do so.    "It is in the interest of the state and all of us not to  make  accidental changes of the system, like it is happening now. It  is a challenge for today and for the future. That is why my  reaction was as it was. I reacted in that way not because I  love power and I want to have it. I reacted like that in the  name of responsibility for the future of the country, bacause  tomorrow a different coalition may be set up and change the  basic law."    Replying to a remark that the proposal was made by several  deputies only while the decision belonged to parliament, the  president said:    "A match can set fire to the whole city. Therefore I  sometimes have to strike early to make everybody think. Of  course, may [as received] opponents will say that I want to  destabilise the situation but can the fact that I am using legal  measures at my disposal be called destabilisation?"    The president stressed in this context that it was high time  to tell judges and prosecutors that "nobody should be allowed to  say that the president is destabilising (the situation) when he  exercises his rights and observes the dates envisaged by the  law." He added that there were many things in Poland which were  still in the process of creation and "our behaviours are  strange. Seeing serious shortcomings I must provoke a  discussion."    Criticising Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's decision to  order elections to local government on June 19, President Walesa  declared that this was yet another thing to which he had to  react. "For the first time I must complain about the prime  minister's conduct and tell him publicly that he should not act  in such a way. I still have time to sign the new local election  law (the final date is April 21) and he should not have done  such a thing."    Walesa also added that he would have to draw the attention  of  lawyers to the fact that the faulty legal system permitted [word  indistinct] to annouce that the elections would be held  according to the old law while the Sejm already passed a new  law. "It is not so much the prime minister that is to blame but  rather the incorrectly constructed system," the president said.    The president confirmed that he starts a tour of the country  on Friday and intends to publicly speak of this and other  problems.</p>

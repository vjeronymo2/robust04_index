			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Ukraine's role THE CURRENT visit to the US of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, is an attempt to gain international respect. Up to now, Ukrainians feel they have been treated like little brothers to the Russians, patronised and told off when they annoy the adults. There is some justice in the grievance. Ukraine is a state the size of France with a population close to that of Britain. It has considerable agricultural potential and its industrial base is huge. Most urgently, it has large nuclear and conventional forces. In the short term the international community will judge the Ukraine by the degree of responsibility it shows in dismantling this arsenal. In his talks in Washington Mr Kravchuk promised to remove most strategic weapons and to move tactical nuclear weapons to Russia for destruction. But his pledge to implement the Start agreement still leaves 46 strategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine and Mr Kravchuk wants to trade these for a US security guarantee. At a time when Russo-Ukrainian relations are worsening over a host of issues from the Black Sea fleet to Crimea, Russia would inevitably interpret this as a hostile act. Ukraine originally offered to give up all its strategic weapons. That is what it should still do. If it wishes its legitimate security concerns to be shared with the west, it must develop a serious dialogue, not proclaim its intention to be nuclear-free one day and appear to change its mind the next. But both Russia and the west should then make clear in tangible ways their recognition of Ukraine's good sense and maturity. More broadly, Russia and Ukraine - as closely tied as the US and Canada - need to cast away the idea that future relations should be shadowed by a nuclear threat. Ukraine is far too important, and the issues surrounding it too dangerous, to be any longer patronised and downgraded. It deserves the respect it wishes - so long as that respect is mutual.</p>

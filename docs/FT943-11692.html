			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Watchdog curbs water charges: Ofwat chief unveils plan to protect householders against sharp price rises A new price regime designed to curb recent sharp rises in household water bills was unveiled yesterday by Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator. The controls, known as K-factors, will limit future price increases to 1 percentage point a year above inflation for the next 10 years for the average householder. The 31 water companies in England and Wales, each of which enjoys a local monopoly, will also be expected to finance more of their investments themselves through greater efficiency. Although the new K-factors were at the tougher end of industry expectations, they were generally welcomed as fair in the industry and the City. Most water company shares gained on the day. Only South West Water, said it would exercise its right to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The new K-factors are weighted to give companies more rapid price increases in the first five years, when investments are heaviest. Average prices can rise by 1.4 percentage points over inflation up to 2000. After that, the average increment over inflation falls to 0.4 per cent. But there are wide variations. Southern Water, which has heavy clean-up costs on south coast beaches, is allowed 4 percentage points falling to 3 percentage points while four companies will not be allowed any real increases at all in the last five years. These include South West Water, which had one of the highest Ks last time and is now to be reined in. Consumer groups gave the review a cautious welcome because it provided the prospect of lower price increases, although it still meant water prices would rise ahead of inflation. But it was attacked by environmental groups which said it would inhibit much-needed clean-ups of rivers and beaches. Yesterday's review marks the first reshaping of price controls for the water industry since it was privatised in 1989. Over that period, it has provoked controversy by raising charges by more than inflation, while paying large increases in dividends to its shareholders and rewarding its senior executives and directors with generous remuneration packages. The new controls are the outcome of a three-year review of prices and costs which was intended to correct the failures of the price controls set at privatisation. In determining the K-factors, Mr Byatt said he had to allow companies enough leeway to finance the improvements required to the water infrastructure and the clean-up of rivers and beaches. These investments, largely imposed by European Union directives, would total Pounds 24bn over the next 10 years. He stressed, however, that his review was not concerned with the level of profits and salaries, which remained a matter for company managements. Companies were generally positive. 'It is a tough K determination,' said Mr Brian Staples, the new chief executive of North West Water, which also got a zero K for the last five years. 'Yet it strikes about the best possible deal for customers given the amount of capital expenditure and provides companies with the classical management challenge.' Labour and the Liberal Democrats attacked the review, arguing it did little to protect the long-term interests of the consumer or to crack down on profits made by the water companies.

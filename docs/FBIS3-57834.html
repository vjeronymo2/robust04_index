			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F> Nicola Bruening and Olaf Opitz; place and date not given: "The  Role of the Favorite Constitutes Risk"]    [Text] [FOCUS] Mr. Verheugen, you have now been in office  for more than 100 days. Supreme party manager of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] -- is this a dream job?    [Verheugen] Certainly not. In practice, the federal manager  is responsible for all the flops, while the others claim credit  for the achievements.    [FOCUS] Your predecessors were not exactly treated leniently  by your party ....    [Verheugen] ...which is why I am rather surprised about the  support that I have found.    [FOCUS] How would you describe the state of your combative  troops before the super election year?    [Verheugen] We have at least reached a point at which the  SPD is no longer giving contradictory signals. The leadership  is standing shoulder to shoulder and is ready to act. There are  no pending controversial issues. The party congress resolutions  have been accepted by the individual minorities.    [FOCUS] It is hard to believe that the SPD should have  assumed the mood of victor so quickly?    [Verheugen] Some risks will always remain. One risk is of  being the favorite, something into which we have grown. I am  warning my friends in the party: We are far from having  achieved what we want. The election will only be won after we  have polled sufficient votes. Another cause of insecurity is  the situation in terms of foreign policy. After all,  conservative politicians might like to see a lasting crisis in  Russia, which they could use for domestic policy purposes.    [FOCUS] How should Germany react to the situation in Russia?    [Verheugen] We must not build up a new enemy image of  Russia. Some people in the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU] will try to exaggerate the citizens'  security needs and turn it into an issue in the election  campaign. How this works was shown by the CDU during the Cold  War of the fifties and sixties.    [FOCUS] It was then that it won majorities. What do you  suggest?    [Verheugen] What would be more important now is a policy  that is coordinated with our Western allies and the European  Union that would make it possible for Russia really to use its  chance for democratic reform and economic renewal.    We must continue to support the democratic forces, which do  not only include Boris Yeltsin.    [FOCUS] Not everybody takes a great interest in politics  across national borders, which can be seen in the German  discussion on Europe.    [Verheugen] In this connection the SPD is sometimes closer  to the chancellor than his own sister party. As far as the  necessity for European unity is concerned, we share Helmut  Kohl's view. Edmund Stoiber's hostile policy toward Europe is  populistic, irresponsible, and dangerous. His only objective is  to make the CSU win more than 5 percent in the European  elections. Stoiber's claim that European unification was no  longer up-do-date proves his absolute ignorance as far as the  European security situation is concerned.    The decisive guarantee for peace is that there is no relapse  into a policy of national interests. Since Stoiber continues to  spread his theses, an anti-Europe party is now being founded.    [FOCUS] The SPD will also be fighting for every single vote  in the coming 18 elections. What tricks do you have in store?    [Verheugen] Solid ones. After all, I do not think that the  people expect any gimmicks from the parties. We have to conduct  an election campaign that is completely different from previous  years. The only effect of the traditional sharp controversies  and mudslinging would be for the citizens to turn their backs on  the parties in disgust. First of all, we must regain the  non-voter's interest in politics. This group constitutes more  than 40 percent of the population....    [FOCUS] ... and they do not want to hear any more shallow  promises.    [Verheugen] Which is why we must give concrete answers to  their questions. Honesty in the run-up to the election is  imperative. This applies to finance, the labor market, social  issues, the environment, and the personalities of our government  team.    [FOCUS] The SPD has so far not offered any details.    [Verheugen] This will change once our government program is  completed in late March. It will contain in great detail all  the burdens that the people can expect, how much we can save,  the areas where a fairer distribution is necessary, and what we  intend to do to improve the labor market.    [FOCUS] The election campaign will be tough this year. Can  a fairness agreement between the parties prevent uncouth attacks?    [Verheugen] We had that before, in 1980. But it did not  work. A new attempt would have to be given much thought; but I  do not rule it out. What we certainly need is for the parties  themselves to promise to limit the mudslinging and to treat  their political opponents fairly.    [FOCUS] There are plans to abolish the television debates  because extremist parties have filed court complaints against  their exclusion.    [Verheugen] As far as I am concerned, the discussions  between the leading candidates of the parties are the climax of  an election campaign, which is why I would not scrap these  programs, even if representatives of the radical Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS] or the Republikaner were to  participate in them. We must force these parties to say what  they really stand for. CDU headquarters would prefer the  federal chancellor not to participate in such rounds. Still, I  do not expect the leaders of the democratic parties to leave the  field to Mr. Gysi or Mr. Schoenhuber, no matter how eloquent  these gentlemen may be.    [FOCUS] In previous television discussions in Bonn after the  landtag elections only a select group of people would sit  together.    [Verheugen] And what was the result? After the Hamburg  Burgess election the bizarre situation arose that the Greens,  who won more than 10 percent of the vote, were not represented  at all. It was then that I said that I would not do that again.  However, there are signs of a change.    The decision on a new plan will be made this week: According  to the public radio and television stations all the parties that  are represented in the Bundestag should participate in such  rounds, that is to say including the Greens and the PDS.    [FOCUS] In the United States the election campaign is  dominated by the electronic media. When will German politicians  stop appearing in local taverns?    [Verheugen] An assembly in the back room of some cafe  certainly does not make a lot of sense. However, particularly  in the election campaign I would not like to do without talking  directly with the voters. Of course we also need television.  However, we are still limiting ourselves to conventional spots.  We simply cannot afford to buy time on private stations. No  party would financially survive an electronic election campaign.  In the United States television commercials of up to 20 minutes  are nothing unusual.    [FOCUS] Such spots cost about 3 million German marks [DM].    [Verheugen] Exactly, and we have reduced our budget for the  1994 European and Bundestag election to just under DM100  million. Still, the U.S.-style election campaign on television  is bound to come. As soon as one party starts it, the others  will have to follow suit -- maybe as early as in 1998.    [FOCUS] Nevertheless, this year you will have to think about  the fragmentation of the party landscape in Germany.    [Verheugen] I am greatly worried about the continuing  split-up of our party system. It is threatening the  predictability and stability of the democratic parliamentary  system. Even now the classic three-party system has been  smashed -- incidentally, with the effect that the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] has been drawn into a struggle  for survival.    [FOCUS] Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt sees the republic  in danger, which is why he is pleading for an English- or  U.S.-style majority voting system.    [Verheugen] I would, generally, warn against meddling with  the electoral law with the sole purpose of evading current  political difficulties. One would always have to pay for it.</p>

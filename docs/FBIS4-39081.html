			<p>BFN     [Text] Next in our program you'll hear a speech of the  president of the Moldavian [Moldovan] Republic of Pridnestrovye  [Dniester], Igor Smirnov, on the results of economic development  of the Republic, which was broadcast over the national  television channel of Pridnestrovye.    [Begin Smirnov recording in Moldovan fading to English  translation] I put a political settlement of disturbances  between Moldova and Pridnestrovye at the head of the list.  Issues were widely covered in the press but nonetheless,  continuing this topic, I must say, that for the time being a  number of contracts and agreements have been concluded following  the agreement signed by President Snegur and President Smirnov  in the presence of the CSCE mission and the special envoy of the  Russian president.    These agreements include not only economic matters but also  those concerning the cooperation of law enforcement bodies, the  mutual exploitation of air space, cooperation in the customs  affairs and the public health protection. So we can see our  cooperation is continuing.    There are various opinions about these problems both in  Moldova and Pridnestrovye. For instance, in Moldova they say  that Snegur has recognized Pridnestrovye, while Pridnestrovyan  oppositions have said [words indistinct] enough in the question  on the Pridnestrovyan confederation. I would like to make some  explanation. What is important for a concrete [as heard] man  are not only negotiations or any political (shape). The only  things which matter is his living standard, which is the  fundamental principle that forms the basis of our relations, and  which is stipulated in the agreement, [words indistinct], the  further progress in our economic relations. The main  achievements so far in the establishment of the bank accounting  center provide payment between Moldova and Pridnestrovye.  Generally speaking, I must stress that we have a positive trade  balance in our trade with Moldova because we sell them more  goods than we get from them. That is, the normal process of  cooperation is going on.    As for our relations with Russia, I must say that they are  the best and [words indistinct]. No matter what our enemies  say, but we work on the government level, we work on the  parliament level, they understand us and our cooperation is  mainly of economic character. Pay attention that we don't put  forward any questions, we don't ask to recognize us as a state.  You see, we don't need to get involved in political affairs  because these can destabilize the situation in nearby countries.  We propose just to cooperate as equal partners which means in  principle by de-facto recognition -- not even the political  recognition or economic alone.    Our economic relations with Ukraine are much better now but  still there is the main problem in creating trade joint  ventures. I must say that we have the expert balance of trade  not only with Moldova, but also with Russia and Ukraine, where  it amounts respectively to 14 and 25 milliard rubles. Of all  our neighbors, only Belorussia [Belarus] is an exception from  this rule. Our import from Belorussia exceeds our export there  which should be corrected because the exporting country is  always in more preferential position. This process is much  influenced by the different national currencies and other  difficulties in payment.    Of course we don't refuse from the cooperation with Western  countries. This year, by the way, a number of foreign  businessmen invested their money in the development of our  economy [word indistinct]. Speaking about Western investment in  our economy, we can't help mentioning such enterprises as [words  indistinct] plants of refrigerated trucks/trailers in Tiraspol,  metallurgic and [word indistinct] plants in [words indistinct]  and many other and I won't enumerate them all because they'll  take a long time. Nevertheless, this fact is not a confirmation  that European countries are ready to cooperate with us in this  sphere.    The situation in agriculture is not brilliant as it was  expected to be. I mean first of all bad weather conditions.  Due to the recent drought and continued spell of hot dry winds  and also because of light frost, the situation in agriculture  has worsened which requires additional expense. We had to  restore about 70 percent of area under crops and in this case  against the main burden is shouldered on our industry.  Industrial enterprises must earn enough money to buy grain not  only for baking but also for fodder. Our sowing campaign was  followed by a re-sowing one but all the crops however will be  used as a fodder due to bad weather.    Except for power sources, grain and sugar are two main  products whose production is strictly controlled by the  government, and I must say that we have taken certain measures  to provide us with a sufficient quantity of elementary products.  As for the livestock breeding, here we have chosen another way  and now we have completed a special agreement in order to  provide a full capacity (operation) of livestock breeding  complexes on the following conditions. We'll sell 50 per cent  of meat (and they'll) supply us with forage. Another 50 per cent  will be distributed on our own market. This scheme allows us to  provide enough forage to increase the total amount of livestock  and especially of pedigreed livestock. In agriculture, we also  welcome foreign investments. We have many joint ventures with  Israeli firms, with (agri-business) enterprises from Hungary and  Germany and we will continue our cooperation but we are not  going to sell our land for our main means of production. Our  task is to attract investors in order to provide jobs for all  [words indistinct] population.    During more than three years of its existence, our republic  becomes more firm in its position from day to day and our main  position remains the same as before. Every man [word  indistinct] on this land should have equal rights with others,  should be able to display his abilities and live free regardless  of his nationality or language. [end recording]</p>

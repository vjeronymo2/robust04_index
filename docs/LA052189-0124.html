			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY;  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS:  </P> <P> Cobra Strikes Back: Dave Parker, the Oakland Athletics' designated hitter,  batted only .194 in April but has rebounded to hit .333 in May -- 18 for 54 --  and promises revenge against any pitcher who had showed him up in April,  including the Angels' Bert Blyleven. "Blyleven was one of the guys who really  showed me up," Parker said. "It was as if he said, 'I know you're swinging bad  so take this.' He threw me back-to-back off-speed pitches. The last was a  knuckleball that I swung through and you could see he got enjoyment out of it.  I got a very special (home run) trot saved up for him. One of my very best  trots."  </P> <P> Babe's Ghosts: A key reason for the fall-off in major league home run  production has been the demise of the New York Yankees and their traditional  array of left-handed hitters to take advantage of Yankee Stadium's "short  porch" in right field. The Yankees have only two homers by left-handed hitters  and none at Yankee Stadium. Don Mattingly, the club's premier left-handed  hitter, had not hit a homer this year through Saturday, and Ken Phelps, who  came in as the major leagues' active leader with a ratio of one homer every  7.46 times at bat, had only one in 75 at-bats.  </P> <P> Superiority: Of the shift in power from the American League East to West,  Cleveland Indian Manager Doc Edwards said: "The main difference is the  pitching. When you think about the top pitchers in the East, you think about  Roger Clemens. When you think about the West, several guys come to mind."  </P> <P> No Pride: With an 18-19 record, the Indians led the East Thursday, and  operators at Municipal Stadium were greeting callers by saying "Home of the  first-place Indians." This was the latest any division has had a sub-.500  leader, a record the East extends on a daily basis now.  </P> <P> Last Words: Shortstop Andres Thomas of the Atlanta Braves went into Wrigley  Field this week saying of the Chicago Cubs: "Take away the second baseman (Ryne  Sandburg) and the catcher (Damon Berryhill) and there's nobody over there who  can play for us." The Cubs outscored the Braves in a three-game sweep, 12-3.  </P> <P> Margo: Boston third baseman Wade Boggs can continue to insist that the Margo  Adams fallout hasn't been a distraction, but he left Anaheim Thursday night  batting .291, 65 points below his career average, had only five hits in his  last 34 at-bats and had struck out 16 times, compared to 34 all of last year.

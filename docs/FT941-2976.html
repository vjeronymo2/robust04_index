			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Artificial bone set to transform hip surgery Scientists have made and tested a replacement bone material which knits cleanly with real bone. The material, which can last a lifetime, could transform life for the 500,000 people worldwide who undergo hip replacements each year. The 'bio-ceramic' has already been used successfully to repair the cheekbones of 30 patients. This year a clinical trial will start with 400 people. But according to Professor William Bonfield, head of the research team that produced the artificial bone at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London, the most important application will be in hip replacements. Current metal and ceramic implants have to be replaced surgically every five to 15 years. They fail when bone shrinks away from the implant and the joint works loose. In the UK each of the 40,000 operations a year costs Pounds 6,000, and the potential annual savings from the new material is estimated at Pounds 80m. Prof Bonfield told a conference in London yesterday that his team expected to start trials within two years on people whose first artificial hips have failed. The new material is a composite containing hydroxy-apatite, the main mineral in bone, blended with polyethylene plastic. Others have formulated artificial bone from hydroxy-apatite but what makes the London material a world first, according to Prof Bonfield, is that it has the same micro-crystalline structure as real bone. That enables the patient's bone to grow cleanly into the implant. The secret - which Prof Bonfield is negotiating to commercialise - lies in the way crystals nanometres (millionths of a millimetre) long are preserved while making the hydroxy-apatite into a ceramic. Other participants at the Hammersmith Hospital conference on 'nanotechnology in medicine' responded enthusiastically to the innovation. Prof Colin Humphreys, a materials scientist at Cambridge University, said researchers realised they had 'to work with nature on a nano-scale' if they were to make materials truly compatible with the human body. He forecast that nanotechnology would lead to implanting silicon chips in the brain 'as an aid to memory or treatment for Alzheimer's disease'.</p>

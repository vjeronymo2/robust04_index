			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AILING KILLER WHALE'S DAYS NUMBERED IN LOSING BATTLE AGAINST RARE DISEASES  </P> <P> Knootka, the ailing 8,500-pound killer whale, has not responded to last-ditch  efforts to treat a rare fungal infection that has been further complicated by a  bacterial infection, Sea World officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Officials believe Knootka, one of three adult killer whales at Sea World, will  probably not survive her bout with the illness, which was first diagnosed in  November.  </P> <P> The chances of Knootka surviving are worsened by her relatively old age, which  is mid- to late-20s, said Dr. Jim McBain, Sea World veterinarian. Killer  whales' life expectancy is 25 to 35 years. It is not known how much longer the  whale has to live, McBain said.  </P> <P> "We are all dying, but she is dying faster than most of us. If she died  tonight, I would not be surprised -- she is a very sick animal," McBain said.  </P> <P> But Knootka remains a good patient, demonstrating no signs of pain or  discomfort. She has a large appetite for herring, mackerel, smelt and squid,  which she can eat whenever she wants. Knootka also has become "good friends"  with the newly arrived killer whale Kasatka, a 4,000-pound female. Kasatka  spent two years with Knootka before being moved to Texas for a breeding  program.  </P> <P> "She is showing a desire to live," McBain said.  </P> <P> In December, Knootka became the first whale to receive itraconazole, an  experimental drug approved for human use in Europe. It was hoped that the  medication would battle what doctors said was a rare fungal infection. After  five weeks of treatment, Knootka's appetite returned and a lesion in her mouth  disappeared.  </P> <P> In recent days, however, it became clear that a bacterial infection had also  stricken Knootka. Bacterial infections are not unusual among older whales, and  Knootka' immune system, already weakened by the fungal infection, fell prey.  Her medical condition is similar to that of an elderly patient, weakened by one  illness who then succumbs to pneumonia, McBain said.  </P> <P> "Bacteria is common in the body already. When whales are young and healthy,  those bacteria don't cause problems," McBain said.  </P> <P> Knootka, who has been at Sea World since 1986, hails from the waters  surrounding British Columbia. Before her San Diego debut, she was at Marine  Land aquatic park in Niagara Falls.  </P> <P> McBain is continuing to give the whale itraconazole, as well as antibiotics,  vitamins and minerals. Her condition is monitored around the clock. After her  death, an autopsy will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the  various medications, McBain said.  </P> <P> "She will die eventually, but we are hoping it will be later and not sooner,"  he said.  </P></p>

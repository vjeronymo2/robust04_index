One of the groups to benefit most will be the private  sector,  said Yang Dakan of the State Planning Commission's Economic  Research Institute.    In an article in China Business Times he predicted sustained  growth in the private sector, particularly among hi-tech  enterprises who will also face ever-fiercer competition.    The number of self-employed businesses (those with fewer  than  eight workers) will continue to grow, he said.    He believes there will be 19 million self-employed  businesses, a rise of 12 percent over 1993. They will take on  32 million workers, about 15 per cent more than last year.    Their contracted capital will be 79 billion yuan ($9  billion), an increase of 35 percent over last year. And their  retail sales volume will be about 200 billion yuan ($23  billion), compared with 140 billion yuan ($16 billion) last year.    While self-employed businesses benefit the national economy,  their bosses are feeling the pressure of increasingly fierce  competition.    Moreover, State and collectively-owned enterprises, growing  more vigorous under the latest reforms, will also be a big  challenge, said Yang.    According to a survey conducted by the State Committee for  Reconstructing the Economic System, people in the private sector  said competition was their biggest challenge.    The only way to survive the battle is to invest more in  their  businesses and improve the quality of their service.    Yang believed self-employed business people will increase  their in vestment to record levels in 1994.    In the late 1980s, when the country's first individual  businesses were founded, most were small street stalls or minor  transporters.    Since 1990, private investment has diversified and private  scientific and technical service outlets have grown fast.    This year many more of these businesses will be set up, said  Yang.    Half of the self-employed business people are concentrated  on  the east coast, with far fewer in the vast inland areas.    The prospects for the country's private enterprises in 1994  are bright Yang said.    His optimistic prediction is based on two facts.    One is that some poorly-managed small State or  collective-owned enterprises will be leased or sold to  individuals.    The second is that better-trained workers, especially  hi-tech  talents will enter the private business sector as the country's  maturing labour market enables people to switch jobs.    In 1994 there will be 370,000 private enterprises employing  up to 5 million people, Yang predicted.    Meanwhile, more hi-tech private enterprises (those with more  than eight workers) will be set up as more people with higher  education plunge into the private sector.    The development of hi-tech enterprises must be backed by  massive investment. The contracted investment of private  enterprises will hit 200 billion yuan ($23 billion) this year,  two and half times more than last year, said Yang.    As a result, private hi-tech joint ventures and co-operation  will boom.    Increasing investment will produce increasing profits. Yang  predicted the average assets of private enterprises will be  370,000 yuan ($42,000), and the average output value will rise  to 100,000 yuan ($11,500) with an average sales volume of 70,000  yuan ($8,000).    But while the private sector will be more flexible in  management, a development gap is to emerge between the rich east  and poor west, Yang said.    In cities and towns, there will be 270,000 private  enterprises by the end of 1994, doubling last year's figure,  while 100,000 will be scattered in rural areas, only 20 percent  more than 1993.    Similarly, the imbalance between the east and west of the  country will widen, Yang predicted.</p>

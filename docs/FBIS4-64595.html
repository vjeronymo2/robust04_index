			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Election Campaign Over Welfare"] </F>   [Text] The government wants to be the guardian of the  welfare state in the upcoming elections. After the government's  meeting at Toruplund in North Zealand, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen announced that he wanted to create a program that  would give Danes a better and more secure daily life. We know  this. For it to be necessary to defend, there must be attackers.  The prime minister must believe, then, that the opposition is  out to sabotage or at least diminish the welfare society we have  today.    Now we might ask ourselves if the currently existing welfare  state is really the best possible one of its kind. And we might  also well ask if the nonsocialists are such formidable reformers  that there is reason to take on the role of the defender of  welfare. To be honest, 10 years of governments under  nonsocialist leadership did not shake the foundations of  society, regardless of how shrilly SiD [Special Workers Union]  chairman Hardy Hansen lamented over the social mass grave while,  at the same time, investing 180 million tax-subsidized kroner in  a campaign to overthrow the nonsocialist government and return  the Social Democrats to power.    But it was not Hardy's millions that paved the way for the  Social Democrats' return to power. It was Poul Schluter's  (debatable) decision to go without Folketing elections that made  possible Rasmussen's majority government. And one might ask if  the majority government's performance has given it the right to  play the role of the welfare society's defender.    Moreover, we do not know if the government as such will  defend the welfare state or if each of the four parties  individually wants to assume the role of the good that will  defend the people against evil. Why wait until after the  elections to protect the people? There are plenty of  opportunities now to take charge and demonstrate their good  will. Start, for example, by taking Agriculture Minister Bjorn  Westh by the collar for his shocking lack of a sense of justice.  In connection with the payment of land subsidies to farmers,  some payments were reduced and, of course, the farmers asked for  compensation. But yesterday Westh refused to pay compensation,  with the remarkable justification that if he did, then  compensation would also have to be paid elsewhere when the  government reduced payments.    If this arrogant behavior by Bjorn Westh is truly the  government's version of a secure life for the people, then  almost any alternative would be preferable. The government is  tough when it comes to making people pay their debts to it and  it demands interest on overdue payments from the second they are  overdue, plus a minimum of several hundred kroner in late fees.  But that is only when someone owes the state. The opposite  situation is a burden to welfare -- the welfare of the state,  that is.</p>

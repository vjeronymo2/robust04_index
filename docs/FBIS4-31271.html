			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tomasz Wroblewski from Washington: "Peasant </F> Activists' Secret Diplomacy"]    [Text] Behind the back of the Foreign Affairs  Ministry [MSZ], Prime Minister Pawlak is getting ready for a  visit to the United States. The trip, to take part in a session  of the Congress of American Polonia [KPA], is being organized by  Franciszek Mleczko, Pawlak's adviser. The Polish Peasant Party  is hoping to get the support of the KPA in the future  presidential election.    Chairman Edward Moskal has confirmed that he invited Prime  Minister Pawlak to come to the United States. The invitation was  tentatively accepted during Moskal's recent visit to Poland.  Franciszek Mleczko, adviser to the prime minister, has gone to  Chicago. He is supposed to make preparations for the prime  minister's visit during a KPA anniversary session in October.    In a conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY, Chairman Moskal did  not rule out that Mleczko's visit and the subsequent visit by  Pawlak during the congress in Buffalo will be used in electoral  political games and that they could be interpreted as KPA  support for the extreme left wing. "That is always possible,"  Moskal said, but he immediately added: "I have been called a  communist before, and my advice to them is to watch what they  say when they call people communist."    During martial law [introduced in 1981] and the period of  official boycott of agencies of the Polish People's Republic by  Polonia, Chairman Moskal was accused of maintaining personal  contacts with communist diplomats. Accusations even appeared in  Polonia newspapers, regarding Moskal's trade ties to communists  consuls in Chicago.    Mleczko is to be the main speaker at KPA's board of  directors  session scheduled to begin today. When Moskal was asked by  ZYCIE WARSZAWY how he managed to reconcile Mleczko's left-wing  views and communist past with the traditionally anticommunist  positions taken by KPA activists, he replied: "Our forum is  open to people of many ideologies and with different pasts."    Up to now, representatives from no other party have been  invited to the congress or to the Chicago meeting of the board.  Chairman Moskal says that this is explained by the fact that  Mleczko is in Chicago as Prime Minister Pawlak's and the  government's representative, not as a representative of "his  party." Neither the embassy in Washington nor the MSZ in Warsaw  has been officially notified about the prime minister's plans or  Mleczko's visit.    In a conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY, KPA activists and  directors, who asked to remain anonymous, expressed their  complete surprise and concern over the intentions of the KPA  chairman.</p>

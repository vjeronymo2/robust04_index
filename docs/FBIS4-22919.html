			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with prof, Dr Med Sci Anatoliy Aleksandrovich </F> Ilin, by correspondent S. Lokteva; place and date of interview  not given: ``Biolakt With an Emblem of Quality'']    [Text] What pediatrician doesn't know today what  Biolakt is? This baby food product has long been popular among  both physicians and mothers. But its recognition at the state  level occurred only today. The results of 30 years of work were  finally noted, and a group of Kyrgyz scientists was awarded the  republic's 1992 State Prize in science and engineering on the  anniversary of the Kyrgyz Republic's establishment ``for  creating children's dairy products of high biological value, for  developing the production process, for their production and  introduction into public health practice.''    Today we talk with one of the recipients of the  prize--professor, Doctor of Medical Sciences Anatoliy  Aleksandrovich Ilin.    [Lokteva] To begin, in behalf of the newspaper I  would like to congratulate you and your fellow workers--P.  Fedorov, D. Kudayarov, V. Babich, V. Pavlinov, A. Knyazev, K.  Sarzhanov and M. Kadyrov--on earning the award. And second, it  would be interesting to hear from you that there is room for  creative work in our long-suffering land.    [Ilin] Of course. The health of children, after  all, is a special problem. It is directly associated with the  society's standard of living. Unfortunately over 1 million  children being born today in all of the former USSR are being  raised on formula. The number of women experiencing insufficient  lactation is increasing. There are also those who are unable to  lactate at all. Therefore providing children with complete  nutrition is an important social task. As for us, the medical  scientists, our specific task in science is to make children's  dairy formulas as close as possible in their biological  indicators to mother's milk. This problem was in fact the  initial motivation for creating the product we are discussing  here.    [Lokteva] Let's remind the readers what Biolakt is.    [Ilin] A cultured milk product made from specially  selected physiological strains of lactic acid bacteria  possessing pronounced antibacterial and proteolytic properties,  and low acidity. Proteins, fats and carbohydrates in milk are  broken down in the course of the vital activities of these  bacteria. Vitamins, enzymes, antibacterial substances and free  amino acids accumulate in the food product. It is the presence  of such an intricate complex of biologically active substance  that raises the food value of Biolakt, and makes it resemble  mother's milk. The product has a positive effect on nonspecific  and specific immunity, and it normalizes gastrointestinal  activity. Biolakt is also recommend for children over 1 year  old, and as a therapeutic diet for patients with intestinal  infections. It can be used for therapeutic purposes in the  presence of gastritis, gastric ulcers, colitis and  hepatocholecystitis.    [Lokteva] As I understand it, studies were  conducted on Biolakt with the purpose of enriching it with  vitamins and microelements lacking in mother's milk.    [Ilin]Yes, the choice of microelement compounds  was important in this sense as well. Readily dissociating  compounds were the most suitable from our point of view.  Enriching the cultured milk product with lysozyme, which not  only preserves mother's milk but is also compatible in  qualitative composition with microflora of the child's  intestine, is also useful.    [Lokteva]Are different varieties of Biolakt now  being produced in this connection?    [Ilin]We have developed four varieties of the  product. Adapted Biolakt and adapted Biolakt with lysozyme,  intended for children in the first months of life; they are  especially recommended for children who are weak and often sick.  Plain Biolakt and enriched Biolakt are products for children in  the second half-year of life. And in general, Biolakt products  have therapeutic and preventive value when given to sick  children over 1 year old. Especially when anemia,  gastrointestinal and septic diseases, dysbacteriosis and lactase  deficiency are present.    [Lokteva]Let's get back to the prize. Were you  able to earn it just by doing scientific research?    [Ilin]Not only that. The most important thing  was that we developed the technical conditions and parameters of  producing the cultured milk product. For example we were able to  establish that when copper sulfate and ascorbic acid are added  to the solution simultaneously, the concentration of the latter  in the food product decreases by 30 percent. On the other hand,  were these substances to be added separately, after chelation of  the copper with protein, vitamin C would be retained completely  in the product. This is not to mention the fact that production  factors affect the energy of acid formation, the mucus-forming  ability of lactic acid bacteria, their reproduction, and  antibiotic and proteolytic capacity.    [Lokteva]Was it these technological developments  that permitted you to organize production?    [Ilin]All four varieties of Biolakt are now  being produced in all cities and rayons of Kyrgyzstan, as well  as 12 countries of the former USSR. But most importantly, a  biological factory for industrial production of bacterial leaven  used to make Biolakt in dairy shops, dairy kitchens and in the  home has begun operating in Bishkek. Mass production of Biolakt  will make it possible to reduce the shortage of baby foods at  all levels. The cultured milk product can now be available to  practically every mother in dry form. When necessary, it would  be enough to transform the dry leaven into liquid form,  according to the instructions of course, and then mix the latter  with milk, after which this fabulous baby food is ready.    Today. the Bishkek biological factory, which has an easily  remembered address--Chuy Prospekt, 304--can satisfy the demand  of youngsters in all of the former Union. I am announcing this  to you officially.</p>

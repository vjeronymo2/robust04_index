			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Dividends the only light in property gloom  -As share prices hit a new low Christopher Price considers a depressed market sector IN A sector used to depressing developments, the news that property shares had hit a new low relative to the FT-A All Share index was greeted with a benign shrug by most industry observers. 'The sector's still got some downside left,' said Mr John Atkins, property analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'It's a question of confidence and we see little good news coming out to bring buyers back into the sector in the short-term.' Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest agreed: 'Every time in the last four years that it's looked like the sector's hit the bottom and it's the right time to buy, it's actually been better to sell.' Property shares have mirrored the dramatic decline in property prices during the last four years, underpinned by a welter of statistics which have charted the sector's spiral decline. Since their peak of November 1988, property shares have underperformed the market by 64 per cent - including a slide of 25 per cent this year alone. Companies have been hit by declining net asset values and falling rents, particularly in the commercial market, where an oversupplied market has been made worse as offices have been vacated by recession-hit companies. According to the index prepared by Richard Ellis, the surveyors, rental values fell 16 per cent in the year to end-June 1992, including a drop of nearly 3 per cent during the last month, the biggest single monthly fall since 1978, when the index began. Recent gloom on receding hopes of a cut in interest rates has been deepened by the continuing effects of the recession. They have prompted growing fears that dividends could be at risk, particularly in companies with heavy exposure to the wilting office market. With asset values crumbling investors have become wary about using a company's own valuation of its assets as a judge of the company's worth. They have focused on the dividend yield, which, when a company has a high proportion of long-term office contracts, such as MEPC and Slough Estates, has been largely guaranteed. But even that aspect is being undermined by the length of the present slump. Rental income is looking less secure as a growing number of tenants go out of business. With dividend yield now suspect, investor confidence has again been shaken and share prices further undermined. Mr Stanley said the problem could recede, providing recovery came within the next 12 months. 'While dividend worries are largely behind the current weakness in some stocks, we think that most companies will hold theirs. And if we do start to get some recovery at the start of next year then investors' confidence in asset valuation will gradually increase and so will the confidence underpinning the share prices.' However, he warned that dividends would then be more likely to be cut as maintained payments would no longer be needed to retain confidence. Institutions looking at property companies for security and outperformance of the market are having to search very hard. Both County NatWest and UBS forecast that the sector will again underperform the market this year. However, they add that selected stocks have declined to such a level that they may prove irresistible to investors. For these reasons County likes Land Securities. UBS, which is advising 'underweight' clients to start rebuilding their property portfolios, is backing MEPC and Slough Estates. Both tip British Land. In spite of such recommendations, even bargain hunters are still staying away. 'Business has never been so quiet,' said one trader. 'There are too many people with burnt fingers to trust this sector again in a hurry.' The lack of buyer interest has prompted one big broking firm to bid down existing quoted prices during the past two weeks in an attempt to find a level at which buyers will come out. However, such is the fragile state of the sector that the move inspired a fresh bout of dividend concern and a further plunge in prices. 'It's a very dangerous game to play given the nervous state of the market.' said Mr Atkins. 'But of course it would be different if we could say values will recover over the next year, but we can't. 'What we do know is that before then, several more companies will go into liquidation and others will report worsening losses.'</p>

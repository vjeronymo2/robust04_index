			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Council reporting rules may change LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be required to maintain registers of all their fixed assets for the first time under new reporting rules proposed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. In guidelines circulated this week the institute calls for an accounting system that shows most fixed assets in councils' balance sheets at current cost. The system would require all authorities to identify their assets and have them regularly revalued. The proposals are open to consultation until April 19 and are expected to be endorsed by the Accounting Standards Board. They would become mandatory for the 1994-95 financial year. Mr John Scotford, the treasurer of Hampshire county council and chairman of the committee which produced the proposals, said: 'The capital side of local authority accounting just doesn't stand up to any kind of examination. It does not attempt to show their worth or how they use their assets.' The institute estimates that the one-off cost of the change would be Pounds 7m across England, Wales and Scotland, while further revaluations would amount to Pounds 1m each year.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Probe on bus operator urged Labour yesterday wrote to the Department of Trade and Industry to demand an inquiry into Stagecoach Holdings, the bus operator. It said several Office of Fair Trading inquiries had found evidence of anti-competitive practices. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's industry spokesman, said that when Stagecoach moved into an area, it flooded it with buses 'to undercut existing operators and to create a bus war which they are guaranteed to win because they invariably have the deeper pockets'.</p>

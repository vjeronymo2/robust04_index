He couldn't run a press conference.' Tory fringe conference, 1993 'Kent has got a deeply lippy chief education officer. He is on my list.' Tory fringe conference, 1993 'He used to be a PE teacher - a man of his size and girth.' BBC TV, April 1994, referring to Doug McAvoy of the NUT 'They are arguing against that. It is Neanderthal.'

The march of reform is being debauched in those areas.' Press conference on links between education and industry, September 1993 'I was flogged by the Jesuits when I was at school.' Press conference on school discipline, January 1994 'If the honourable lady were subjected to an educational brain scan, there would not be a flicker on the screen.'

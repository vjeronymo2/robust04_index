			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by leading opponents of EU membership: </F> "Why the European Union (EU) Agreement Is a Failure"]    [Text] Nothing has been achieved in the European  Union (EU) negotiations that can make an EU skeptic more  positive about membership. From the beginning Sweden has  accepted all the EU's fundamental rules. Therefore Sweden  neither requested guarantees for our freedom from alliances nor  asked for an exemption from the EU's plans for a common  currency. In addition the Swedish public access principle has  been dropped and our restrictive alcohol policy has been  abandoned. That is what 13 opinion formers and debaters from the  chairman of the Left Party to moderate economics Professor Johan  Lybeck write in a joint article.    The whole point of departure for the Swedish membership  negotiations has been Sweden's acceptance of all the EU's  fundamental rules. Almost all the "exemptions" that are now  being presented are simply transition rules of various kinds.  The most important parts of EU law, such as the Maastricht  treaty, have not been seriously mentioned in the negotiations;  Sweden has not requested any special rules there.    The Swedish negotiators have not requested or received any  guarantees concerning our freedom from alliances. On the  contrary, our negotiators have clearly emphasized that our  freedom from alliances is not permanent and that we view the  EU's development toward a joint defense policy positively. And  things have gone farther than that. There are plans to merge the  military alliance, the Western European Union (WEU), with the EU  in 1996. Then we will have an EU defense system in practice. At  that time our formal freedom from alliances will be eliminated.    Neutrality policy is already precluded if a country joins  under the current rules. Ulf Dinkelspiel made this clear in his  opening address when the negotiations began: "At the same time  we realize that the long-term formulation of a joint defense  policy that could lead in time to a joint defense system is a  goal for the common foreign and security policy that will be  discussed further within the framework of the 1996 review  conference. We do not intend to hinder the European Union's  progress toward this goal." It could hardly be expressed more  clearly; Sweden has in practice already waived the formal veto  right we should have had at the summit meeting in 1996 when a  joint defense will be established.    If we join the union, Sweden is already totally committed to  pursuing the EU's foreign and security policy and refraining  from any action that is contrary to the interests of the union.  Sweden has also approved the special declaration found in the  treaty under which member countries waive their formal veto  rights on foreign policy matters.    Sweden has not asked for any exemptions from the EU's  much-discussed and criticized plans for a joint economic policy  and a common currency, the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).  This means that Sweden is legally committed to all the steps in  the creation of the monetary union. This also means that Sweden  has no possibility of rejecting the last step of the EMU in  which our national monetary unit, the krona, will be eliminated  in favor of a common currency and a common central bank. Broadly  speaking the monetary union will preclude a national economic  policy and put us entirely at the mercy of the policies the  union dictates in the economic area.    By means of borrowing requirements the union will control  the  size of our national budget, our interest rates and our exchange  rate. This policy, which is secured by treaty and gives low  inflation a higher priority than fighting unemployment, is  currently driving up unemployment to dangerous levels in the  entire EU. The direction of the policy will be guided by the  treaty and later also by the politically independent central  bank and thus cannot be changed via democratic decisions.    Sweden has committed itself to a strict austerity policy and  a return to a fixed exchange rate in relation to the European  Currency Unit (ECU) as a step toward a common currency. At a  time of internalization and changes in the economy, we are  giving up the possibility of adapting our economy and our  conditions to the national and international situation. This  could be devastating for the Swedish economy and for employment.    The Swedish negotiators have not requested and thus have not  obtained any legally binding safeguard for the Swedish principle  of free access to public records. To the extent the issue has  been mentioned in the negotiations it has had the nature of  unilateral Swedish declarations that totally lack legal value in  future conflicts with EU law. The principle of public access is  threatened from several sides. A proposed new EU directive on  access to computer files also involves a direct restriction of  the public access principle.    The so-called breakthrough in the negotiations came on 21  December of last year. But aside from the snuff provision, the  agreement does not contain any permanent exemptions where Sweden  is concerned. The media portrayed the whole thing as a big  success, but if one looks more closely at the substance, the  package from the EU was mainly empty.    Several important environmental issues were decided in the  "package." The most important result is that Sweden has accepted  a reform moratorium under which we cannot freely increase our  environmental requirements on products. In addition Sweden has  been forced to make changes that are actually for the worse in  automobile emission requirements. Sweden has a four-year  transition period in several important areas -- cadmium, tin  organic compounds, arsenic, PCP, batteries, and the labeling and  classification of chemicals. Sweden wanted a guarantee that  would make it quite clear that the requirements will not have to  be lowered in the future; no such guarantee was given.    In some areas it was noted that Swedish rules are not in  conflict with the EU's present rules, this applies to mercury,  asbestos and chlorine organic solutions. This means that we can  keep the rules today but that they may very well end up in  conflict with EU law in the future if the EU adopts new rules in  these areas or as a result of the so-called Cassis de Dijon  principle.    Sweden has not obtained solid guarantees for a restrictive  alcohol policy. On the contrary, several of the foundation  blocks have already been abandoned. Sweden has obtained a  two-year transition rule for the quantity of alcohol that can be  brought into the country. But it is clear that border checks  within the EU will be phased out in a few more years, which will  make a functioning supervision of imports impossible. This means  that alcohol prices will have to be cut drastically in the long  run. All alcohol monopolies except the sales monopoly have been  abandoned. And there is no guarantee that the state company for  the sale of wine and spirits can continue to have a monopoly on  sales.    The removal of border checks will probably also lead to an  increased influx of drugs into Sweden.    Another kind letter from an EU commissioner is said to be a  safeguard for Swedish collective contracts. But the letter has  no legal status that implies such a guarantee. It is impossible  to rule out future conflicts in which, for example, foreign  contractors can claim that they are not compelled to respect  agreements in Swedish collective contracts.    Sweden has committed itself to full participation in the  union's common trade policy. This mean increased tariffs and  more quotas for Sweden's trade with the rest of the world. There  is a risk that several product groups will be made more  expensive for Swedish consumers, especially in the clothing area.    Nor can the issues that were "resolved" in the final phase  of  the negotiations be said to represent a Swedish success. That  Sweden will take part in the EU's regional policy subsidies is a  matter of course; all EU countries receive subsidies from the EU  funds. What is more surprising is how little Sweden will get.  The thousand kronor per person that goal-6 subsidies should  involve for inland Norrland has turned out to be considerably  less.    Even if all the subsidies from the EU's various regional  funds are included, the inhabitants of sparely populated areas  of Sweden will get back less than the approximately 2,000 kronor  that every Swede will have to contribute to the EU budget. The  Swedish negotiators had demanded subsidies from the most  advantageous fund, goal 1, but this was denied. This could be  important, especially with regard to how long goal 6 support  will remain in existence, it will be renegotiated in 1999.    As expected, Sweden will immediately adopt the EU's  agricultural policy. This means that Swedish agricultural policy  will be bureaucratized and regulated in detail.    Sweden will be allowed to phase in the membership fee for  several years. Over a somewhat longer time period this phasing  in lacks any great importance. Actually the membership fee will  become increasingly expensive in the future; it is estimated  that it will amount to 25 billion kronor a year in 1999.    Now we know what terms will apply if Sweden joins the union.  No decisive exemptions or guarantees have been given that could  inspire a more positive response in anyone who was skeptical  about union membership. For opponents the negotiating results  mean that we will now step up the pressure in our efforts  against Swedish membership in the union.    We are united in our defense of Swedish democracy, national  autonomy, and worldwide international cooperation as the  alternative to union membership.

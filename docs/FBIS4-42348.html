			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Christophe Lamfalussy report: "Di Rupo Shows He Is </F> Different"]    [Text] On Monday [30 May], for the first time in Europe's  history, two Italian neofascist ministers took the elevator at  the Charlemagne building [EC Council of Ministers] in Brussels,  provoking a candid and forlorn response from the Belgian  minister of telecommunications, Elio Di Rupo, who is making this  into a personal case of conscience.    Giuseppe Tatarella, a former member of the Italian Social  Movement (MSI), which is now merged with the National Alliance,  arrived at 0900 in the morning to attend a council of  telecommunications ministers. His colleague from the Ministry  of Agriculture, Adriana Poli Bortone, followed him in the  afternoon, but she had already been through her trial by fire  during a very courteous informal council meeting in Greece.  <H5>  "I Do Not Forget" </H5>   In the elevator they took, and in the nerve centers of the  European building, somebody had put up stickers commemorating  the victims of Italian fascism. The stickers said "I do not  forget."    Nor has Elio Di Rupo forgotten, and he aimed to make this  clear to his colleagues by reading a three-page statement in  which be noted that Europe has welcomed -- for the first time  within its walls -- a "political group which claims to be the  heir to the form of totalitarianism that was Italian fascism in  the 1930's and early 1940's."    The minister from Mons, himself the son of an Italian  immigrant, took his place in the meeting room a good quarter of  an hour late to "show his difference." A little earlier, in  front of the photographers, his colleagues also avoided shaking  hands. Mr. Tatarella sat down as if nothing had happened  between the Irish and Spanish delegations.  <H5>  The Politics, Not the Man </H5>   In his speech, which he did not have officially published,  Elio Di Rupo did not call either Italy or his neofascist  colleague into question, but rather "the politics he symbolizes,  the past which this politics evokes, and the reference it could  be elsewhere in Europe."    To better underscore what separates him from his Italian  colleague, he then cited the universal values of Europe, such as  the respect of freedoms, democracy, and others "without  distinction as to nationality, religion, or sex." Speaking to  the Italian press, Elio Di Rupo was even more explicit. "I had  to find the line between the duty of state and the duty to keep  a clear conscience," he said, sweeping aside the criticism that  he would work for the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party],  which is in the middle of an election campaign. All the  bilateral questions between Italy and Belgium will be dealt with  by the administration or through the Foreign Ministry, he added.  Only the Greek minister supported the Belgian statement.  Moreover, in Athens Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  also regretted the fact that the arrival of the Italian fascists  "went so smoothly" in Europe.  <H5>  Italian Republic </H5>   For his part, Giuseppe Tatarella, who has the rank of deputy  prime minister in the Berlusconi government, is playing down his  party's links with fascism. He sees the emergence of a new  "democratic and popular" Right in Europe, and suggested meeting  with the Belgian deputy prime minister to explain to him the  "reality" of the National Alliance.    Rome, he recalled, is preparing to welcome U.S. President  Bill Clinton: "I respect all judgements, from Clinton's  pragmatism to Di Rupo's perplexity."    Today the National Alliance has overall responsibility for  the MSI, a party which openly maintains the memory of Mussolini  while playing the parliamentary game. Three ministers,  including Mr. Tatarella, come from its ranks. Two years ago,  the party -- which defines itself as "postfascist" -- celebrated  the 70th anniversary of the march on Rome in 1922, when the  blackshirts imposed the Mussolini dictatorship with the consent  of King Victor Emmanuel.</p>

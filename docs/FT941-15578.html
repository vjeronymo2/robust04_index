			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Carbon tax level 'almost same as domestic levy' The carbon tax proposed by the European Commission would have nearly the same effect on consumers as the government's plans to put value added tax on household fuel, a report argued yesterday. The tax to help combat global warming would raise the price of household fuel by about 18 per cent, according to a paper published in the Consumer Association's policy review journal. Mr Mark Pearson, author of the study, also estimates that there would be an 8 per cent rise in the price of petrol. The price of tobacco, clothing and food would rise by less than 1 per cent, however, he says. The proposed tax on energy and its carbon content has been the European Commission's main plan for curbing emissions, the aim of the climate-change convention agreed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. European Union countries ratified the convention before Christmas, but have not yet agreed to adopt the carbon tax. The UK and France have strongly opposed the proposals.

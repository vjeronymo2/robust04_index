The idea of inviting the Polish guest to pay a  visit, which is regarded by the Swiss as the year's most  important state visit, was first put forward by Otto Stich,  finance minister and the Confederation's president for this  year. The visit will be an opportunity to "establish closer  contacts between the two countries," according to Mario Carrera  (President Stich's press spokesman), in a statement to  RZECZPOSPOLITA.    Issues linked to both countries' membership in the same  group  within the IMF will also be discussed. It is worth recalling  here that last year President Stich came out strongly in favor  of Switzerland's joining the IMF, and he also made efforts to  have Poland included in the same group [within the IMF] as  Switzerland.    Even though a lot of time is still left in which to define a  detailed program for the visit, it is already known unofficially  at this stage that President Stich would like to play host to  his guest in his home canton of Solothurn. The city of  Solothurn plays quite a significant role in the history of  Polish-Swiss contacts. Tadeusz Kosciuszko stayed and died there  in the years 1815-17. To this day in the city, there is a  modest but very beautiful museum devoted to the Polish national  hero.</p>

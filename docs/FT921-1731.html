			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: History sets its sights on the Colt hand gun - The pistol has become a victim of tough competition It may have been good enough for Buffalo Bill and scores of other American pioneers but the Colt pistol is now in danger of finally fading into history. The Connecticut-based Colt Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1836 by Sam Colt, last week filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. And while the company received an emergency Dollars 10m injection from its main creditors - the Connecticut Development Authority and Austria's Creditanstalt banking group - that may not be enough to save the 925 jobs remaining at its Hartford headquarters. Colt's history is rich enough. The hand gun, it used to be said, 'made all men equal.' But Colt has lately become a victim of declining defence contracts and tough competition from companies such as the British-owned Smith &amp; Wesson and Italy's Beretta group. At present Colt is believed to represent less than 7 per cent of the US market in hand guns. Gun control remains a political controversy in the US, with the Bush administration doing little to counter the pro-gun lobby. But Colt's weapons have proved less appealing to sportsmen, criminals and other arms aficianados than the cheaper and equally deadly 'Saturday night specials' that have proliferated recently. In its bankruptcy filing Colt said it failed to make sufficient progress in a financial restructuring that was agreed two years ago, when the company was saved with the help of Connecticut state pension funds. At the time a coalition of Colt workers, managers, private investors and the Connecticut state pension fund bought 47 per cent of the company, which had been crippled by a lengthy strike. As Colt filed for protection from creditors, Mr Anthony Autorino, chairman and chief executive of Colt, resigned. He was succeeded by Mr Worth Loomis, president of the Hartford, Connecticut Graduate Centre. Colt plans to use the Dollars 10m capital injection to reorganise its finances and perhaps its products. With gun-fever in the US creating more demand for dangerous semi-automatic weapons, Colt's focus may shift away from its traditional revolvers. A sign of the company's declining fortunes is that the police force in Hartford, Connecticut, does not even pack a Colt. The police in Colt's home town prefer the Smith &amp; Wesson .45 semi-automatic pistol, made in Massachusetts by a company that was acquired five years ago by FH Tomkins of the UK.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by anchorman </F> Jon Snow; Hurd in the Westminister studio, Snow in London; from  the "Channel 4" news program -- live]    [Text] [Snow] Foreign Secretary, you have seen the shelling  still going on in Gorazde. What can we do?    [Hurd] Well, we have not so far succeeded in Gorazde in  doing  what we managed to do in Sarajevo and central Bosnia, which is,  bringing the fighting to an end. So General Rose, the UN, have  to go on seeking to make the situation better if they can, and  meanwhile we have to consider, we have to judge -- as your  report from NATO has just said -- how we can strengthen the  effort, how we can make sure that we have more successes like  that in Sarajevo and central Bosnia, and fewer failures like  that in Gorazde.    [Snow] Well now, clearly one of the main pushes of  diplomatic  activity has been on this idea of widening the facility to call  in air strikes, to include the protecting of the safe areas --  in other words extending it beyond simply protecting UN  personnel. But tonight, Mr. Kozyrev, the Russian foreign  minister, was saying that this they will not support from Moscow  unless there is already an absolute agreement, a common stance  as he puts it, between Moscow, Brussels, and Washington.    [Hurd] We need to involve the Russians. I don't believe the  measures which the secretary general is proposing needs a new  Security Council resolution. What it does need, and what it  will now get from NATO, is detailed military staff work. We  have got troops on the ground, British and French in particular,  other Europeans, other countries, there are NATO forces in the  air. What is needed now, and what will now happen, is to work  out how these two can work together more effectively -- it's no  good dealing with air without the ground. More ground trooops  are needed. It's no good dealing with the ground without using  the NATO air assets. That's what the NATO decision today says.    [Snow] Alright, 50 minutes from now President Clinton will  announce what he is going to do. What do you want to hear from  him?    [Hurd] He's announced what he is putting to his allies. I  believe that the United States and the European allies are now  at one on the main points. Yes we need to use air power, not  because it's magic, not because it will itself bring peace, but  because it can be useful in protecting the safe areas. Yes we  need to keep sanctions strong and indeed strengthen them where  we can, where there are loopholes. Yes we need UN troops on the  ground -- more troops. I hope the President will be able to say  that America is no longer having to block the financing of other  people's troops, UN troops on the ground in Bosnia. I hope that  other countries will now come forward with troops as we and the  French and others have done. And finally, you need to have a  negotiated solution, that is the only way this war is going to  end -- as the French foreign minister said again today in his  parliament, and that means bringing together what the Russians  are trying to do, what David Owen is trying to do, what Mr.  Stoltenberg is trying to do for the UN, and what the American  Ambassador Redman is trying to do. It's not good having  diplomats going the rounds, doing their own little bit without  having a concerted effort by the international community, and  that's what we are pressing for.    [Snow] But we still have two bones of contention with the  Americans, the first is the arms embargo against the Bosnian  Muslims which, as Gorazde shows, surely remains a very unjust  position -- and the Americans feel very strongly that it is  unjust, and the second is the failure of the Americans to match  air power with ground force?    [Hurd] On your first point, I can imagine and have long  talked about a possibility that at the end of the day, if all  the UN efforts failed or the European efforts failed, and we  came to the conclusion that we had to pull out our troops, there  wasn't any longer any point in trying to stop this war. I can  imagine then a situation in which the UN and international  effort had collapsed and there were no grounds therefore for  preventing the sides from fighting it out. I think it's very  dangerous, tragic, and might lead to a spread of the war. I can  imagine that at the end of the day, I think it would be bad for  everybody concerned, but I see the logic of that.    On your first point: It's for the Americans as it is for the  Germans and the Italians and others who do not have ground  troops [in Bosnia] to assess when and in what circumstances they  could join in. We have to accept the situation as it is,  whether it is the British, French, Spaniards, and one or two  other European countries -- Russians or Ukrainians who are on  the ground, and the Americans giving a lot of help from the air,  a lot of help in the form of aid and civilian activity, but we  do have to make sure that the ground and the air effort work  together and there are no gaps or loop holes between them.</p>

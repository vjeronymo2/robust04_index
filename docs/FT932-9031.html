			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: North Atlantic drift Volatility on Wall Street has frayed nerves in London over the past few weeks, and with good reason. Equity markets around the world have leaped to discount earnings recoveries unusually rapidly in the current cycle. That is partly because of large falls in nominal short-term interest rates, which have encouraged money into shares. But there is a danger of markets getting ahead of themselves. The US is leading the recovery, so if valuations there are excessive, there is plenty for the rest of the world to worry about. By some measures - most notably yield - US shares are expensive. Ratings are also high but reported earnings have been heavily depressed by write-offs and may be as much as 25 per cent below the true operating figure. Those write-offs are helping cut costs and, combined with investment, reduce the threat of renewed inflation. US equities are not cheap, but they are not as expensive as they may appear. What would turn the equity market decisively would be a sharp move up in bond yields. Fortunately, that still looks some way off, and the threat of a heavy fall on Wall Street is limited. That should offer some reassurance to UK equities. There is, however, little reason to expect a further substantial rally soon. An earnings recovery is well discounted and the risk is of disappointing economic news before the next corporate reporting season in September. To alleviate the boredom, some will doubtless consider moving from recovery stocks which have come too far to sectors such as stores which are nearer to consumers and have been left behind in the rush.</p>

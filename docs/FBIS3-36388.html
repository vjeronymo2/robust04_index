"Taking part in the work of the Russian  parliament's upper house, I managed to meet with Russian head of  government Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of the Russian  Federation", Galazov told TASS on returning from Moscow. "We  considered some pressing issues aiming to assist the republic in  solving social and economic problems", he reported.    Commenting on the meeting of the Russian Government  presidium, which discussed the situation in the zone under state  of emergency rule in the light of the presidential decree  extending the state of emergency for another two months, the  North Ossetian president said "the Russian president's decree  was been approved but with considerable reservations. A  deputies' group was set up to gather objective information on  the spot... I submitted to the Russian Government our proposals  as for how achieve a peaceful settlement in relations between  North Ossetia and Ingushetia. These proposals had been approved  by the republic's multi-national people. The Ossetian side is  ready to work for improving relations with all neighbouring  countries. But we must not use force on this way towards peace.  Force engenders only force", Galazov stressed.    The North Ossetian leader flatly rejected the idea by the  Ingush side of imposing a special rule on the Prigorodniy  District as the sole possible way to overcome the current  crisis. Galazov qualified the idea as a gross interference into  North Ossetia's internal affairs. "The problem of refugees'  return should be solved not with military help of federal  authorities, but on the basis of Kislovodsk accords", he said  referring to the agreements on a complex solution to the problem  of refugees and forced migrants in Ingushetia and North Ossetia,  which were reached by the Russian, Ingush and North Ossetian  delegations in the North Caucasian town of Kislovodsk last  March. "Of the greatest importance here are conciliation  commissions now working in each locality of the Prigorodniy  District", Galazov emphasised.    The situation in the zone under state of emergency rule,  which has been extended for another two months, remains  relatively calm, TASS was told at the North Ossetian Security  Council. Military sources confirmed that no conflicts on ethnic  grounds had been registered there. Russian peacekeeping forces  and local law-enforcement bodies are in control of the situation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dialogue between NHK correspondent Fujimori and Newscaster </F> Yoshiaki Kawabata -- live; from the "NHK News 7" program]    [Text] [Kawabata] I will now speak with reporter Fujimori  who is reporting from the prime minister's official residence.    Mr. Fujimori, what is happening at the prime minister's  official residence?    [Fujimori] Leaders of the ruling coalition parties are now  assembling at the prime minister's official residence, and they  will soon hold a meeting to discuss ways to deal with the  present political situation. The leaders of the ruling  coalition parties in their meeting this morning confirmed the  need to continue efforts to persuade the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] to remain in the coalition. Later, in the  afternoon, Prime Minister Hata called SDPJ chairman Murayama to  ask the latter for talks, but chairman Murayama told the prime  minister he had no intention of complying with his request for  talks. Chairman Murayama is believed to have concluded there  are no prospects for breaking the deadlock over the SDPJ's  breakaway from the coalition through talks, unless extraordinary  changes have occured since the SDPJ broke away from the  coalition after the Central Executive Committee and a meeting of  members from the both houses of the Diet decided that the SDPJ  should quit the coalition. Chairman Murayama returned to his  home at 1600 [0700 GMT] this afternoon, and there seem to be no  prospects for talks between him and Prime Minister Hata. The  leaders of the ruling coalition parties will discuss how to deal  with the issue of the SDPJ's breakaway from the coalition.    [Kawabata] Just now, former Prime Minister Hosokawa can be  seen entering the prime minister's official residence. The SDPJ  is still taking a tough stand. Mr. Fujimori, what sort of other  options do the ruling coalition parties have?    [Fujimori] The ruling coalition parties intend to continue  to  try to persuade the SDPJ to remain in the coalition. If the  SDPJ continues to reject the persuasion, and refuse to remain in  the coalition, the leaders of the ruling coalition parties will  have to form a new cabinet without the SDPJ. The ruling  coalition parties will become a minority in the Diet. The ruling  coalition parties have 182 seats in the House of Representatives  and their seats are far less than those held by the Liberal  Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the ruling coalition parties hold  62 seats in the House of Councillors, only one-fourth of the  majority. With those seats in the Diet, the ruling coalition  parties would be unable to get any bills to pass in the Diet if  the LDP and the SDPJ objected, and they would be hard-pressed to  run the Diet in the future.    [Kawabata] Mr. Fujimori, thank you very much.</p>

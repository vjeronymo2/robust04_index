			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading SPECULATION about a large gilts auction, along with poli-tical and economic worries, led to strong selling in the derivatives and heavy turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. The March futures contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,822, and after a brief few minutes of buying at the beginning of the session, it fell on selling by independent traders. A sell order for around 3,000 contracts executed by a leading independent firm, together with further mid-morning selling by a US house as talk on the gilts auction surfaced, led to more weakness in March. It reached the session's low of 2,780 just before the opening of Wall Street. The firm start in New York helped the March contract briefly regain some of the earlier loss before another bout of selling led to a further retreat. March finished at 2,795, down 28 from Friday's close and around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 14. Turnover was heavy, reaching 12,210 contracts. In traded options, an active session in the index options led to total volume of 34,506 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 15,322 lots, against Friday's figure of 8,073, while 4,509 contracts were transacted in the Euro FT-SE option. Asda was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 2,257 lots, followed by British Steel with 2,140 contracts dealt. Shell Transport had 705 lots traded.</p>

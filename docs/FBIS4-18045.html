			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report in the "Government" column: </F> "The Government Presidium Has Decided To Fight Forest Fires and  Trade in Wool. Discussion of Situation in Russia's Economy Has  Been Postponed"]    [Text] The latest session of the Russian Federation  Government Presidium yesterday began with Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin proposing that it not discuss the implementation of  the Council of Ministers resolution On the Situation of the  Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development for 1994 but,  "owing to its special importance," devote to this subject a  special session set tentatively for 3 May. Therefore the  ministers had to consider a draft federal program titled  Reducing the Level of Radiation of Russia's Population and  Production Personnel from Natural Radioactive Sources in  1994-1996 (radon program) and map out urgent measures to protect  forests and reindeer pasture lands as well as preserve the sheep  breeding and processing industry.    There are two federal programs in Russia to protect forests  from fire and on reforestation, said Valeriy Shubin, chief of  the Russian Federation Forestry Service, but due to a shortage  of funds preparations for the summer period "have practically  been thwarted," in spite of the fact that some 600 pockets of  forest fires (approximately 6,000 hectares) have been  identified. The Forestry Service was to get 135 billion rubles  this year to implement the programs, but so far has received  only a small portion and managed to conclude contracts with only  six out of 19 air units -- and even those have only 11 percent  of the required fuel stocks. Mr. Shubin demanded, in addition  to funds, the creation of a "rapid reaction" fire fighting  reserve and to provide forestry employees with firearms and  ammunition. The government presidium deemed these demands quite  reasonable and decided to finalize the draft resolution on  measures to protect forests and reindeer pastures from fires and  present it for signing to the government in three days.    It was also decided to finalize and submit to government  approval the radon program. To protect Russians from radiation  (sources: radon gas and construction materials, primarily  granite slates), whose aggregate dose exceeds by 300 times the  level produced by the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power  station, the first stage of the program calls for research to be  conducted, technological charts to be drawn up, and standards  worked out. The second stage envisions a campaign of public  awareness and training in methods of protection against natural  radiation. The overall cost of the project is 41 billion  rubles, including 20 billion from the federal budget.    The presidium related with full understanding also to the  draft resolution moved by the Agriculture Ministry on urgent  measures to preserve the domestic sheep breeding and processing  industry. Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha said that the sheep  population in Russia has been halved compared to 1990, while  woolen fabric production has fallen by 80 percent. At the same  time agricultural producers, according to him, cannot find a  market for 60,000 tonnes of wool, to which amount the upcoming  sheep shearing will add another 70,000 to 80,000 tonnes.  Therefore Mr. Zaveryukha asked the government to help market  the surplus wool because "this is a matter of survival for those  Russian Federation ethnic groups that traditionally engage in  sheep breeding." First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets supported  the country's number one agrarian and called on the ministers  not to shun agrarian questions and "not stigmatize the agrarians  as anti-marketeers, but let the Agro-Industrial Complex into the  market."</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Fresh threat to British recovery BRITAIN'S rising government deficit poses the biggest threat to the UK recovery, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, warned yesterday. Speaking in Washington where he is attending meetings of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Lamont refused to rule out the possibility of further tax rises later this autumn in the first of the UK's new unified budgets. 'We will have to address it (the deficit),' he said. The chancellor was reacting to concern in financial markets that a continuation in the recent sharp rise in the gap between government spending and revenues could sap international investor confidence, possibly leading to a slide in the pound which might require higher interest rates. Under plans announced in Mr Lamont's March budget, UK taxes are to rise by a combined Pounds 16bn over the next three years. The Treasury expects the deficit to reach Pounds 50bn in the 1993-94 financial year. Mr Lamont said the UK was poised for sustained growth after the 2 1/2 -year recession. He said there were 'a number of encouraging features' about Britain's performance during the recession, including rising manufacturing productivity and business investment , which testified to the 'underlying strength' of the economy. He said prospects for a gradual reduction in UK unemployment were not as poor as some people thought, while with wage inflation at the lowest level for 25 years the climate for business was 'excellent'. 'I am determined that there should be no return to the boom conditions of the late 1980s, when a surge in corporate and residential investment coincided with an unsustainable growth in consumer demand,' Mr Lamont said.</p>

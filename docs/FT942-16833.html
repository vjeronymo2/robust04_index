			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Trade News: Modest recovery in E Europe foreseen - UN body's report critical of western help in region The countries of eastern Europe may experience a small economic recovery this year after four years of slump, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. However, output in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union is likely to continue to decline. In its annual survey of developments in the region, the UN body says aggregate output in eastern Europe could rise by a modest 1 per cent in 1994, the first year of growth since the collapse of the communist system in 1989. Poland is expected to notch up another year of 4 per cent growth, with more modest gains for Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and possibly Hungary. For other countries in the region, the outlook is for continuing stagnation or further falls in output. The ECE believes total output in eastern Europe may have fallen by about 3 per cent last year, but this was less than half the 1992 rate of decline. In Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, output plunged on average by some 13 per cent following a 20 per cent drop in 1992. The depression has been greatly intensified by an additional 'trade shock' caused by the collapse of trade between CIS members, the ECE says. The UN body, which groups western and eastern European nations, the US and Canada, has been consistently critical of the way western governments and the main international financial institutions have handled assistance for the process of transition from communist to market economies. The latest report maintains that western help has been far less than either expected or required, and western finance has flowed mainly to the most successful countries with the highest incomes per head. Private foreign direct investment into eastern Europe (excluding the CIS) has amounted to less than Dollars 10bn since 1990, including flows of about Dollars 3.5bn last year. More than 90 per cent has gone to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Poland, with 80 per cent going to the first two. Official flows of assistance to eastern Europe totalled some Dollars 10.5bn since 1990, the bulk of which has gone to the same four economies, it says. Meanwhile, the CIS republics have attracted negligible amounts of private investment and little official aid. For the region as a whole, neither the volume nor the co-ordination of international assistance 'has. . . been commensurate with the scale and complexity of the problems to be overcome'. Social hardship in the transition economies, including mounting unemployment, continues to breed a dam-aging disillusionment with economic reform, the survey adds. The ECE calls for improved international co-ordination mechanisms to target western assistance within coherent national programmes, combined with more leeway for individual governments to follow political and economic programmes for economic transformation that best suit their countries' needs.</p>

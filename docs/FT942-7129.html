			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (10): A new farming elite is emerging - The agriculture sector has been transformed Brazilian agriculture is learning to support itself. Despite cuts in government aid, lower import tariffs and general economic instability, the 1993-94 cereals harvest is expected by the Ministry of Agriculture to be a record 74m tonnes. Part of the reason for the success has been a number of impressive productivity gains in the past decade, mainly on the back of government investment in the 1970s. Now that the government has largely withdrawn from the sector a new farming elite is emerging, often represented by large agro-industrial companies or export-oriented producers that can compete in world markets. However, some economists worry that the free market shake-up is leading to smaller and less efficient producers being condemned to subsistence farming and that more workers are being forced to abandon the land and end up swelling Brazil's shanty towns. 'Only the highly efficient producers will survive,' declares Mr Jose Carlos Duarte da Conceicao, president of the Coplan co-operative in Campinas, 60 miles from Sao Paulo. The co-operative, which represents 538 coffee and cotton producers and has annual gross sales of Dollars 18m, encourages the use of fertilisers, high-yielding seeds and automation to increase its members' productivity. Coffee yields are 20 bags (60kg each) a hectare, compared with a national average of eight bags, says Mr Conceicao. The transformation during the past decade is striking, he says, recalling his arrival at the co-operative 10 years ago when government subsidies were still flowing: 'It was ridiculously corrupt. People were taking the money and spending it on anything except farming. Today, the industry has become much more professional.' This growing professionalism largely began in the 1980s with the phasing out of government subsidies. It was followed by a general reduction of other government support to farmers - sparked by Brazil's financial crisis - which included cuts in agricultural loans and purchases of excess stocks. One of the most outstanding examples of improved productivity concerns soya. While the planted area of soya in the past decade has increased only slightly, to about 10m hectares, production has soared from 15m to 23m tonnes, reports Conab, a government agricultural agency. The productivity gains, according to Professor Guilherme Leite, an agricultural economist, were made possible by government investment in the 1970s in new seeds and agricultural technology tailored to a semi-tropical climate, and by the opening up of the vast terrains of the central and western states such as Mato Grosso. Today, Brazil is the world's second-largest soya exporter after the US and the leading exporter of orange juice, another crop that was hardly cultivated 25 years ago. This crop evolution continues a historic pattern. The Portuguese colonisers planted sugar cane in the north-east, which was later supplanted by coffee in the state of Sao Paulo. Soya has now become by far the most important crop in Brazil. Soya earns Brazil more than Dollars 3bn a year and accounts for some 40 per cent of agricultural exports, with coffee and orange juice earning about Dollars 1bn each. While Brazil is still the world's biggest coffee exporter, its importance, however, has declined significantly since the early 1950s when it represented the vast majority of agricultural exports. Last year, coffee accounted for just 16 per cent. Similarly, because of Brazil's industrialisation, agriculture has declined dramatically in its importance to the economy, shrinking from about half of gross domestic product 40 years ago to 13 per cent today, according to Mr Leite. But today's agricultural sector is often highly competitive thanks to low production costs, says Mr Andre Pessoa of consultants MB Associados. He highlights the growth in exports of processed chickens, which benefit from low costs for land, labour and feed. 'Californian chickens receive large subsidies and we get none and yet we are still competitive in world markets,' says Mr Pessoa. But some other products are less competitive. With the lowering of tariffs, Brazil has become an importer of crops such as wheat. Economists say this is because wheat is highly subsidised by the US and European Union and also because countries such as Argentina have better soils for wheat production. Mr Pedro de Camargo, president of the Brazilian Rural Society, a producers' association, complains that while Brazil has lowered or eliminated import tariffs and subsidies, the rest of the world has not. 'We are being taken for a ride and we don't have the political clout to insist on changes by the US and Europe,' he says, claiming that the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks will not benefit Brazilian agriculture. The losers under Brazil's move to a more professional system are those producers left behind by the technological advances, which includes large parts of the poor north-east of Brazil as well as sugar cane workers in the state of Sao Paulo. This process has sparked a strong migration of rural workers to the shanty towns in the past decade. Mr Lus Inacio, presidential candidate Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers Party, intends to institute a thorough agricultural reform and find land for up to three million landless families. But any changes will first have to overcome the powerful landowners' lobby in Congress.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Sweden gives clear Yes to EU: Vote in favour of membership keeps enlargement timetable on course Sweden yesterday voted by a clear margin to join the European Union, keeping on course the Union's plan to enlarge from 12 to 16 members next year. The final result showed 52.2 per cent in favour of membership and 46.9 per cent against, while 0.9 per cent cast blank votes. The vote followed decisive approval of membership this year by Austria and Finland. It increases the chances of a Yes vote in Norway, the last of the four European Free Trade Area applicants to vote. Its referendum is due on November 28. The result was greeted with relief in Stockholm and Brussels as the Swedish EU opposition, spearheaded by leftists and environmentalists, had mounted a strong campaign, arguing that membership threatened Sweden's democracy and welfare system. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish Social Democratic prime minister, said he was 'extremely satisfied'. He said: 'Sweden will now be part of creating a peaceful and democratic Europe.' Mr Hans Van den Broek, the EU commissioner for external affairs, said: 'I am certainly impressed. I can say on behalf of the European Commission that we are very much encouraged by this result. I think it is a real impulse towards further good co-operation within the European Union when Swedes say we want to be a member of this Union.' In the same vein, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany, which currently holds the EU presidency, said the 'political stability, years of peace-oriented foreign policy and economic power (of Sweden) are a gain for the European Union'. The EU had feared that if the Efta enlargement plan stumbled, it might derail plans to build closer ties with - and eventually offer membership to  -six countries in eastern and central Europe. As recently as a week ago, polls indicated that the No campaign had a strong chance of victory, although it faced the combined pro-EU resources of the political establishment, led by Mr Carlsson, Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative former prime minister, industrial and trade union leaders, the main farmers' organisation and most of the national newspapers. Attention will next swing to Norway, where opinion polls continue to show a strong lead for the No campaign, which defeated a move to join the European Economic Community in a referendum in 1972. But Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour government has gambled that a Yes vote in Sweden would provide the impetus to swing the electorate towards membership. She said last night: 'If Sweden and Finland are members of the EU there are many in Norway who will see it as a break in our traditional co-operation with our Nordic partners for us to stay out.' Late last week, one opinion poll, in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, showed for the first time for months the Yes camp moving ahead of the opposition if Sweden first accepted membership. The poll showed a Yes lead of 46 per cent to 41 per cent. In Sweden, a powerful appeal for a Yes vote made over the last few days of the campaign by the political establishment appeared to have won over many of the numerous voters who did not make up their minds until just before voting. Mr Carlsson and Mr Bildt, normally bitter political rivals, appeared together in the final television debate on Friday evening, arguing forcefully that Sweden risked being isolated economically and politically if it stayed outside the Union. The vote will provide an important boost for Mr Carlsson, vindicating his low-key campaign strategy, which was designed to maintain unity within the Social Democratic party. The country is this year pulling out of a three-year recession but is still struggling to control unemployment running at 13 per cent of the workforce and deep deficits in the public finances, with the state debt rising fast towards 100 per cent of gross national product. The Yes campaign argued that a No vote would shatter market confidence in Sweden. Lex, Page 18</p>

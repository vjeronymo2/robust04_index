			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Rafsanjani to sweep Iran poll IRANIANS went to the polls yesterday, with President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani widely expected to retain power in a landslide victory, Reuter reports from Tehran. Mr Rafsanjani faced challenges from three rivals, all of whom professed few differences with his policies - university president Abdullah Jasbi, right-wing economist Ahmad Tavakkoli and former member of parliament Rajabali Taheri. Each has said he broadly agrees with Mr Rafsanjani's economic and political liberalisation and each had the stamp of approval of the clerical Council of Guardians which endorsed them as true heir of the 1979 Islamic revolution. Authorities have mounted a media campaign calling for a big turnout to show the continued popularity of the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>

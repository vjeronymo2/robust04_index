			<p>BFN     [Text] Aleksandr Kavsadze, who chairs the Georgian  parliament's Ethnic Relations and Human Rights Committee,  expressed the hope that the Moscow agreements of April 4 on  political settlement in Abkhazia and return of the refugees  would be honored.    He told journalists in Tbilisi Friday, however, that  unexpected events might take place if the security guarantees  for the refugees were full implemented.    Kavsadze said that this agreement, like the earlier ones,  could be wrecked but emphasized the need "to try to succeed  jointly. You don't stop when you go in darkness, torch in hand,  just because the torch may go out."    The Georgian parliament's Deputy Chairman Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili said that future documents on Abkhazia had to be a  detailed blueprint for the political structure of the autonomous  republic. He called for equal rights to be given to all the  citizens. "If the Georgian and Abkhazian populations are not  convinced that these rights are guaranteed, there will be no  peace," he emphasized.    Rcheulishvili said that those who had fought on the  Abkhazian  side, notably North Caucasian nationals, and seized houses  belonging to Georgian families "are automatically regarded is  illegal residents there."</p>

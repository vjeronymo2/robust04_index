For the first nine months, FarWest reported a $6.6-million loss,  contrasted with a $6.3-million profit a year ago.  </P> <P> In its recent overhaul of rules regulating the thrift industry, Congress  required that all junk bond investments be carried on an S&amp;L's books at  current market values rather than at the purchase price.  </P></p>

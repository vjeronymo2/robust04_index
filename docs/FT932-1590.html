			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / No increase in current-account deficit: Exports grow faster than imports A RISE in earnings from the export of services has failed to prevent an increase in the current-account deficit to its highest quarterly level for nearly three years. The gap on the current account between all imports and exports - taking in merchandise goods and invisible trade, covering services and financial transfers - came to Pounds 4.01bn in the first quarter. This was up from Pounds 3.88bn in the fourth quarter of last year and Pounds 2.26bn in the third quarter. The surplus on invisible trade was Pounds 494m in the first quarter, little changed from Pounds 474m in the previous three-month period. In the third quarter of last year the invisibles surplus was Pounds 1.02bn. The net income flowing into the UK from invisible trade helped to defray the large deficit on visible, or merchandise, goods. This reached Pounds 4.5bn in the first quarter, compared with Pounds 4.35bn in the last quarter of last year. One bright spot from the seasonally adjusted CSO figures is that the surplus on services in the first quarter came to Pounds 1.15bn, up from Pounds 647m in the fourth quarter of last year and Pounds 892m in the July-September period.</p>

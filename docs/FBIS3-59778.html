Platelets are activated when they come in  contact with foreign objects and lose their shape, but in blood  this newly developed polymer membrane has a surface similar to  that of the inside of a blood vessel, so it can extract  platelets without causing their deformation. It is expected that  this membrane will find a wide range of applications such as in  the manufacture of platelet-derived preparations used for  hemostasis and bone marrow transplants, in the diagnosis of  illnesses, etc. The research group will announce its results at  the meeting of the Society for Polymer Science to be held in  Kyoto on 31 May.    To remove platelets the newly developed membrane is placed  in  contact with blood for about one hour. Because the platelets  attach themselves to the membrane, when it is removed from the  blood and washed in physiological saline, non-activated  platelets can be obtained.    The polymer membrane is a sheet of the biocompatible organic  material MPC (methacryloyl hydroxyethyl phosphorylcholine) to  which positively and negatively charged substances have been  bound. When blood comes in contact with the MPC membrane, the  phospholipids in the blood adhere tightly to the surface of the  membrane. Because phospholipids are components of the cell  membranes in blood vessels, etc., the membrane is not recognized  as a foreign object in the blood. The group believes that is why  the platelets do not become activated.    Blood component preparations made from platelets are used  for  hemostasis and bone marrow transplants, but activated platelets  cannot be administered because they cause blood clots.    Currently platelets are extracted from blood by  centrifugation to avoid activation, but it appears that they can  be separated much more easily when this membrane is used. It  appears that it is possible to extract erythrocytes and  leukocytes as well by varying the substances bound to the MPC  membrane. In the future this membrane may find wide-ranging  applications such as in the study and diagnosis of diseases in  which blood cell abnormalities occur.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Storms kill 44 in southern states A series of tornadoes and violent thunderstorms that ripped through five southern states killed at least 44 people, injured more than 350 and damaged scores of rural communities, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Atlanta. The governors of Alabama and Georgia are expected to call on the federal government for economic assistance for the hardest-hit areas, where many residents who lost their homes are poor and have no insurance. The worst death toll was in the north-east Alabama town of Piedmont, where a tornado slammed into the Goshen United Methodist Church during a Palm Sunday service, devastating the brick structure with about 140 worshippers inside. Authorities said 20 people died from injuries received when the church's roof collapsed. Police reported two other deaths in Alabama, including a woman who died along the Coosa River near the town of Ragland, where a tornado destroyed several houses and mobile homes and severely damaged another church. Another 18 people died in Georgia and more than 200 were injured in severe storms and tornadoes which blasted several rural communities on Sunday afternoon. Six members of one Georgia family died in when a funnel cloud swept up their mobile home and catapulted it 30 feet. By yesterday morning an estimated 7,000 people were still without power in northern sections of the state. Thirteen shelters had been opened for the homeless, while workers struggled with power lines and washed-out roads.</p>

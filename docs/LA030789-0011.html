			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITERS' VIEWS OF RUSHDIE BOOK  </P> <P> I fully agree with Richard Rodriguez ("Baiting Religion, American Style,"  Editorial Page, Feb. 25) for saying what the American Muslims have been saying  all along. He said, "To reiterate blasphemy through a microphone seems to me a  provocation. I do believe that American writers believe that they are  protesting censorship. But should one not question the propriety of giving  further offense to Islam?"  </P> <P> Rushdie has written a blasphemous book and has committed a grave folly. He now  realizes it. The writers are displaying malice and contempt for Islam and  Muslims by their overindulgence in reading Rushdie's book. This insult is not  acceptable to the Muslims living in the United States and Canada. We are  outraged and at the same time dismayed. If the PEN members think that they are  protesting Khomeini's proclamation, then why don't they show a little courage  and go to an Asian country and read the book.  </P> <P> MOHAMMAD YACOOB  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

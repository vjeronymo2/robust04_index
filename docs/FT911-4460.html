			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Letter: Computer users in conflict Sir, Your article on the proposed software directive refers to the struggle between computer groups, large and small (April 17). There has been total disregard of the opinions of most interested parties, namely computer users in business, education and government (both local and central). If the directive is approved, it will increase costs and restrict the flexibility of most computer users in the UK and Europe. The MEPs who condemn the lobbying should ask why it is taking place. Users, such as ourselves, who have substantial investment in technology were not consulted by the DTI or the Commission before the 'compromise was thrashed out' in December. If we had been consulted, we would have made it clear that it is unworkable and in conflict with the competition objectives of the Commission. It is essential that either the amendments are adopted or the Council of Ministers does not approve the unamended version. PB Livesey, director, information services, House of Fraser, 1 Howick Place, SW1</p>

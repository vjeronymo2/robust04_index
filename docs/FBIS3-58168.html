The statement said only that "a contact" had taken place  between North Korean representatives to the IAEA and officials  from the nuclear watchdog but did not give any details except to  say "the contact is expected to continue next week."    North Korea had agreed to a resumption of international  inspections of its nuclear facilities after a gap of almost a  year, a senior U.S. State Department official said Wednesday.    But Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis would not be pinned  down on whether North Korea had agreed only to a single  inspection of its seven previously visited nuclear facilities,  as press reports had suggested, rather than a resumption of  regular visits.    The International Atomic Energy Agency has made it clear  that  they regard regular inspections as the basic condition to be  able to ensure continuity of safeguards and verify that North  Korea was not developing a nuclear weapon.    The IAEA said Thursday it had not received any notification  from North Korea that it was ready to allow resumption of  regular inspections, and at a meeting Wednesday the Pyongyang  side simply took note of an IAEA request to discuss details of  renewed inspections and said it would report back.</p>

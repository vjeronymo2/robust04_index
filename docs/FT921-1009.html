			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Rescue package for Sogo Jukin announced JAPAN'S Second Association of Regional Banks announced a rescue package for Sogo Jukin, one of the eight housing loan companies, which faces a sharp increase in bad loans due to the plunge in domestic land prices. Japanese housing loan companies hold deteriorating property-related loan portfolios, which include funds extended to resort and golf course developments. Last year, Chigin-Seiho Housing Loan and Juso were forced to turn to creditors and shareholders for financial aid. Housing loan companies were set up in the 1960s by financial institutions, such as life insurance companies and banks, to fund individuals' housing and property purchases. Sogo Jukin was set up by the 72 second-tier regional banks, while Chigin-Seiho is backed by life assurers and Juso by trust banks. The companies increased their exposure to high-risk developments in the loose credit of the late 1980s. Increasing financial problems at the housing loan companies will burden the financial institutions which back the companies. According to Teikoku Data Bank, a Japanese credit agency, loans extended by the eight companies to companies which failed last year totalled Y90.7bn (Dollars 678.3m). The sharp rise in bad loans prompted the Ministry of Finance to conduct inspections of the housing loan companies last month. Sogo Jukin, which holds outstanding debts of Y1,400bn and loans of Y1,300bn, is expected to post pre-tax losses for the next fiscal year to March 1993. The second-tier regional banks will cut interest rates on new loans from 6.5 per cent to the long-term prime rate, currently at 6.0 per cent. The banks will also maintain the balance of outstanding loans to Sogo Jukin at the current level until the end of March 1997.</p>

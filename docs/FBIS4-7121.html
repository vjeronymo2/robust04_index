			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song received a letter of thanks from Eason  Jordan, senior vice president of CNN, who had visited the DPRK  together with former heads of state and government and  politicians of different countries.    Expressing thanks to President Kim Il-song for welcoming CNN  to the DPRK, the letter dated April 19 says:    Our visit was a memorable one, with the high point our  meeting with you on April 16th.    At the beginning of our trip, I wrote to you to reaffirm  CNN's commitment to fair, balanced and objective coverage of the  DPRK. After a week of reporting here, including a live broadcast  from DPRK TV, I hope you will agree that we have maintained  those high standards. In addition, I hope our reports have made  some contribution to greater international understanding of your  country and to the cause of world peace.    With this visit, I hope we have laid the groundwork for a  long-term, positive and mutually beneficial relationship  qbetween CNN and the DPRK. We stand ready to return to  Pyongyang at any time when warranted by important news  developments, and we hope your government will continue to give  positive consideration to our requests to travel here.    Again, many thanks for all you have done to help us.</p>

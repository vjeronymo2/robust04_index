			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 3 May (INA) -- A Yemeni Interior Ministry  source today revealed the parties behind the criminal  assassination attempt on the life of Hasan Muhammad Makki, the  Yemeni first deputy prime minister, last Thursday.    In a statement tonight, the source said that preliminary  investigations conducted by the competent authorities have  proven the involvement of Shaykh Naji 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shayif,  who is member of the General Committee, which is the highest  leadership at the General People's Congress [GPC], in the  assassination attempt in which eight of his loyalists took part.    The source pointed out that the Yemeni authorities have  failed to arrest Shaykh Naji al-Shayif because he and his  loyalists fled the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Monday.</p>

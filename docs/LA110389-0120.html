			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> The history of modern art in America includes such signposts as the hard-edged  work of the American Abstract Artists group in the '30s and the Pollock,  Rothko, Motherwell generation of the '50s. Italian born abstract artist Giorgio  Cavallon is firmly planted in both of those artistic crucibles. He immigrated  to the United States in the '20s, worked with Gorky in the WPA, was a charter  member of the American Abstract Artists and showed his work in the pivotal 1951  exhibition of American abstraction at the Museum of Modern Art.  </P> <P> In this first West Coast exposure to Cavallon, it's difficult to evaluate his  significance because the abstract idiom he doggedly pursued for more than 40  years has been mined and hyped to the point of banality. In that context,  Cavallon can't help but look a little dated and weather worn.  </P> <P> His career shows that as early as the '40s, Cavallon was already using  landscape and still life as a springboard for watery, expressionistic  arrangements of color that remotely recall the washy geometries of Diebenkorn.  His native Venice inspires the bright, light drenched patches of transparent  color fitted together flatly like a free-form quilt.  </P> <P> One large untitled piece builds a loose abstract infrastructure, covers it over  with just enough white to let the paint below show through, then slashes a band  of red and a small counterpoint of yellow across the surface. Few can argue  with the work's consistency and place in the development of American  abstraction. (Manny Silverman Gallery, 800 N. La Cienega Blvd., to Nov. 25.)  MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

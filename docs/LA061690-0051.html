			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO EASE HATCH ACT'S POLITICAL CURBS VETOED;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: AIDES SAY BUSH WILL ALSO REJECT A MEASURE TO GRANT WORKERS UNPAID  FAMILY LEAVES. OVERRIDES ARE UNLIKELY.  </P> <P> President Bush vetoed a measure Friday that would allow federal workers to take  a more active role in partisan politics, and aides repeated his pledge to veto  a bill that would guarantee workers the right to take unpaid family or medical  leaves.  </P> <P> Congress, which has not yet overturned a Bush veto, appears unlikely to be able  to override in either case. But Democrats hope both vetoes -- Bush's 12th and  13th so far -- will provide them with workable campaign issues during this  fall's elections.  </P> <P> The federal workers bill would amend the Hatch Act, the law that bars  government employees from taking part in almost any partisan activity beyond  merely voting. Changing the Hatch Act has been a popular cause among many of  the federal government's 3 million civilian employees.  </P> <P> The family and medical leave bill, which cleared Congress Thursday night, has  been a major goal of women's groups and labor unions for several years. Polls  show that the idea is extremely popular among women who work outside the home  and younger voters of both sexes, constituencies eagerly sought by both  parties.  </P> <P> Unions representing federal workers have long argued that the Hatch Act is  unfair, barring federal workers from the kind of political activities that  other citizens are allowed.  </P> <P> But Bush, in his veto message, praised the law. "The Hatch Act has successfully  insulated the federal service from the undue political influence that would  destroy its essential political neutrality," he said.  </P> <P> "After all the debate, no real need to repeal the existing Hatch Act has been  demonstrated," he wrote, adding that the proposed changes would "inevitably  lead to re-politicizing" the civil service.  </P> <P> The bill Bush vetoed would have allowed federal civil service and postal  service employees to hold office in political parties, serve as delegates to  political conventions and to solicit political contributions from co-workers  under protections designed to prevent supervisors from forcing their underlings  to make contributions.  </P> <P> Although several Republicans representing states and districts with large  numbers of government workers supported the bill in Congress, debate over the  Hatch Act has a strongly partisan cast. Republican Party officials have argued  that easing the Hatch Act would strengthen the Democratic Party because federal  workers more often than not support Democratic candidates. Unions representing  state and municipal workers and teachers have become some of the strongest  sources of Democratic Party workers, they point out.  </P> <P> The Hatch Act bill had passed both houses of Congress by more than the  two-thirds margin needed to overturn a presidential veto: 334 to 87 in the  House on Tuesday and 67 to 30 in the Senate last month. But congressional  leaders and Administration vote counters both agree that enough Republican  senators are likely to switch their votes to uphold Bush's veto.  </P> <P> The family and medical leave bill would require companies with more than 50  workers -- a group that employs nearly half of the nation's workers -- to  guarantee employees 12 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or  serious illness of the worker, a child, a spouse or parent.  </P> <P> Bush has said he opposes the idea of the government's mandating such benefits.  Business leaders argue that the bill would cost them too much, and, in a  meeting with business lobbyists last month, White House Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu pledged that Bush would veto it.  </P> <P> When asked Friday morning if that veto threat still stands, Bush spokesman  Marlin Fitzwater said, simply: "Yes."  </P> <P> Democratic leaders have accused Bush of waffling on the issue, noting that  during his campaign last fall he pledged to support measures to "ensure that  women don't have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a child or  caring for a child after a serious illness."  </P> <P> "It's time to see if President Bush advocates the same policies as President as  he did on the campaign trail," said Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell  (D-Me.).  </P> <P> The bill was passed by the Senate on a voice vote Thursday night after being  passed by the House last month, 237 to 187.  </P></p>

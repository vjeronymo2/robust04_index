			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Placer Dome helped by higher gold prices Higher gold prices helped Placer Dome, the Vancouver-based mining group, to post a slight rise in second-quarter earnings, in spite of a drop in output. Earnings climbed to USDollars 24m, or nine cents a share, from Dollars 21m, or eight cents, a year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 242m from Dollars 234m. Placer's share of gold production from its 14 mines in the US, Canada, Chile, Australia and Papua New Guinea fell to 449,000 ounces from 453,000 ounces. But the average price advanced to Dollars 387 per ounce, from Dollars 357. First-half output was down to 891,000 ounces from 903,000 ounces. Higher production at five mines was offset by the disposal of the Dona Lake mine and closure of the Equity Silver mine, and by lower production at the Detour Lake, Kidston, La Coipa and Golden Sunlight properties. Placer said its share of production would total 1.8m ounces this year. Output from Australasia was expected to dip by 7 per cent, mainly due to lower grades at the Kidston and Porgera mines. Production from Canada would fall by 3 per cent, but the US would grow by 5 per cent, mainly with improved grades and mill throughput at the Cortez mine and new production at Bald Mountain.</p>

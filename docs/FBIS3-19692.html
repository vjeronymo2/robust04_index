The  Alliance 90/Greens, the many voters' associations, and the  Southern Schleswig Voters' Association (SSW) increased their  shares of the vote, in part considerably. Nevertheless, the SPD  managed to remain the strongest party in the towns and districts  of the land. The CDU had its worst local election result in  this land since the first elections in 1946. The FDP, which  became the third strongest party at the local elections in 1990,  is no longer represented in 10 of the 15 district councils or in  the town halls of the four towns that do not belong to a kreis  [district]. The Alliance 90/Greens is now represented in all  the district councils and in the city parliaments of Flensburg,  Kiel, Luebeck, and Neumuenster.    SPD Federal Manager Verheugen said that the result achieved  by the SPD is "within the scope of what was expected." The  elections were primarily characterized by aspects of local  policy. In terms of federal policy, it is to be noted that the  Bonn coalition parties have once again lost votes, while the SPD  has remained the strongest party, Verheugen said.    CDU Secretary General Hintze called the CDU's results in  Schleswig-Holstein "unsatisfactory." However, it is gratifying  that it was possible to narrow the distance between the SPD and  the CDU from more than 12 percent at the 1992 Landtag election  to about 1 percent at this local election. The SPD's "drawer  affair" in Kiel [involving the alleged bribery of a CDU official  by the SPD] has caused lasting damage to the party's credibility.    FDP Chairman Kinkel called the result achieved by his party  "unpleasant"; however, it should not be overestimated. He is  certain that the FDP will manage to get out of the "negative  trend." At the moment, the FDP has difficulties because  everything that does not work in Germany is blamed on those  ruling in Bonn "and we have to take the blame for some problems."    Mr. Volmer, a spokesman for the Alliance 90/Greens, said  that  the parties of the "informal grand coalition in the Federal  Government" have suffered a "sound defeat," because many people  demand a "fundamental reform policy instead of crisis management  along outdated lines." [passage omitted]    Schleswig-Holstein Minister-President Simonis (SPD) believes  that her party's losses are primarily due to SPD mistakes in  local policy in some regions and not to the land policy. She  does not believe that the drawer affair in Kiel had any  influence on her party's election results.    Mr. Boernsen, chairman of the SPD group in the Landtag, said  that all the democratic parties could now improve their  reputation among the voters in the north, if the drawer affair  were brought to a conclusion in the Landtag as quickly as  possible. This gave rise to harsh protests among the CDU, the  FDP, and the Greens. The SPD should put the truth of the affair  on the table, and then the drawer could be closed, it was said.    CDU Land Chairman Hennig said that the CDU had achieved  "relatively good results" compared with the trend at federal  level.    FDP Land Chairman Koppelin spoke of a "serious defeat" for  his party. However, it is not only the policy of the FDP that  is to be blamed for that. An opinion poll, which was published  during the week before the elections and predicted 3 percent of  the vote for the FDP, hurt the party. Nevertheless, he is  convinced that the bourgeois camp as a whole has not shrunk.  Koppelin said that the liberals must just make their position  in this camp clearer and also say "where the trip goes to" at  the federal level.    Mr. Gaertner, land manager of the Alliance 90/Greens,  interpreted the local election result primarily as a signal for  Bonn. The course has been set toward a red-green [SPD-Greens]  coalition; the Greens have finally put aside their image as "the  eternal losers of elections and fundamentalists."</p>

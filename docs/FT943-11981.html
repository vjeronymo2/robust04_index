			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taipei rallies to close at four-year high Demand from corporations and arbitrageurs absorbed small-lot profit-taking by overseas investors, and prices closed marginally higher in light volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index rose 47.71 to 20,345.37, reversing a 2.3 per cent decline over the previous three sessions. The index rose to a high of 20,390.88 in the early afternoon, but slipped to a low of 20,241.75 in the last half hour of trading. The market focused on worries over profit-taking by foreign investors, looking to take advantage of the yen's strength. Volume totalled 253m shares against 223m. Dealers were sidelined on the last day of trading for their July books. Some analysts, however, do not expect a mass exodus from Japanese stocks by overseas investors. 'Some fund managers have decided that Japan will be quiet for a few months while European and south-east Asian markets have fallen low enough. But many people are still substantially underweight in Japan,' said Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged up 0.99 to 1,622.78, while the Nikkei 300 rose 0.20 to 293.96. Advances led declines by 514 to 472, with 192 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was down 1.26 at 1,308.41. High-technology stocks were lower. Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, lost Y19 to Y735 and Hitachi declined Y17 to Y975. But Fujitsu gained Y10 to Y1,040 and Oki Electric Industry rose Y4 to Y740. Automobile makers continued to face selling by overseas investors. Nissan Motor fell Y5 to Y745 and Toyota Motor declined Y50 to Y2,100. Arbitrage buying lifted bank stocks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank gained Y30 to Y1,780 and Mitsubishi Bank rose Y10 to Y2,590. But brokers declined, with Nomura Securities down Y10 to Y2,230 and Nikko Securities losing Y10 to Y1,250. Nippon Housing Loan, the housing loan company facing mounting bad debts, declined Y11 to Y230 on reports that it was pulling out of the mortgage securities business. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 39.88 in volume of 56.2m shares. The index declined for the fourth consecutive day on position squaring. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y60 to Y6,700. Roundup Local stories predominated yesterday. Nomura has reduced its weighting in Japan from 36 per cent to 28 per cent, and, within the region, has moved 2 per cent to Korea, and 1 per cent each to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan. TAIPEI finished at a four-year high led by a rally in financials, chemicals and foods, while the plastics sector rebounded after lagging behind last week. The weighted index added 39.22 or 0.6 per cent to 6,727.22, its highest level since June 6, 1990. Turnover was firm at TDollars 107.24bn. Among financials Cathay Life Insurance surged TDollars 14.00 to TDollars 218.00 to gain the daily seven per cent limit before going ex-dividend. HONG KONG recovered from morning losses to close firmer on late buy orders triggered by better-than-expected government land auction results. The Hang Seng index rose 19.74 to finish at 9,194.36 after falling to a low of 9,117.02 in early trade. Property issues jumped sharply after the afternoon auction but came off their highs by the close as investors concluded that the sale of the relatively small sites was not enough to determine whether the government's recent campaign to cool the real estate market was effective. Cheung Kong ended 30 cents higher at HKDollars 35.90, Henderson Land gained 40 cents to HKDollars 38.90 and Sun Hung Kai Properties added 40 cents HKDollars 47.90. MANILA fell 1.5 per cent on profit-taking after gaining about 120 points in two days, and brokers said that prices were likely to consolidate further. The composite index fell 42.98 to 2,728.53 in volume of 708.9m shares worth 1.21bn pesos. Davao Union Cement, which was making its debut on the exchange, was actively traded well above its offer price of 5.60 pesos. Its B shares ended at 6.90 pesos while the A shares closed at 6.00 pesos. SYDNEY weakened as sentiment was undermined by prospects of tighter monetary policy, with a central bank board meeting in progress yesterday. The All Ordinaries index fell 7.0 to 2,041.3, just off its low of 2,039.2. Turnover was only modest at ADollars 233m. Banks and insurers were weaker, with only isolated gains. Elsewhere BHP rose 6 cents to ADollars 18.58, and in the mining sector, CRA fell 24 cents to ADollars 18.56, with WMC down 15 cents at ADollars 7.30 and MIM adding 1 cent to ADollars 2.99. Retailers were soft, with Coles Myer down 3 cents at ADollars 4.22. SEOUL was lower after broad-based selling but some lightly weighted shares continued to attract investor interest. The composite stock index gave up 3.92 to 935.20, with the August 12 deadline for investment trust companies to repay an as yet undecided amount of borrowings to the central bank continuing to overshadow the market. Reports that gunfire had been heard on the northern side of the inter-Korean border on Monday also depressed sentiment, although the defence ministry said there had been no unusual military activity that would indicate provocation by North Korea. KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by speculative buying of second-line stocks although a lack of foreign buying continued to keep a lid on the market. The composite index rose 3.93 to 1,008.31. Golden Plus was among big gainers, rising 55 cents to MDollars 8.40 on rumour of a business venture in China. SINGAPORE was mixed after a quiet trading day. The Straits Times Industrials index ended 6.22 lower at 2,206.04, with the decline largely attributed to losses in Sembawang and Fraser &amp; Neave . Sembawang dropped 30 cents to SDollars 10.20 amid speculation that the performance of its engineering division was likely to drag down the results of the group. BANGKOK ended slightly lower in quiet trading as investors awaited today's no-confidence debate in parliament. The SET index closed 1.56 lower at 1,346.50 after fluctuating between 1,339.71 and 1,353.39. Turnover was a moderate Bt5.96bn. Newly listed Rockworth was most active issue, closing at Bt119 on turnover of Bt422.5m. It opened at Bt102 against a subscriber price of Bt85, before peaking at Bt124. BOMBAY edged ahead in a trading session curtailed to one-hour because of a disruption in the suburban railways. The 30-share BSE index rose 16.13 to 4,122.78. Some buying was reported in A group shares by the local investors in an otherwise dull trading session.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Leading Article: One year on THE DEPARTURE of Britain and Italy from the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago today arguably constituted the biggest monetary rupture since the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s. The comparison is suggestive, in that both events coincided with big changes in the global political and economic balance. In the first case, it was the waning of US power and influence as a result of the Vietnam war; the currency dislocation was widely attributed to the inflationary financing of the US military effort. In the second, the de facto collapse of the ERM coincided with the end of the cold war and the explosive growth of parts of the Asian economy, while the technical economic cause lay in the refusal of the French to permit a D-Mark appreciation within the ERM in response to German unification. It is not difficult to make the case that these monetary phenomena were symptomatic of deeper problems and that the markets were, in both cases, providing an adjustment mechanism to cope with the fall-out from government policies that ran far ahead of public opinion. The inflationary nature of the Vietnam war financing was, after all, necessitated by a lack of popular support; and there has clearly been a failure on the part of Europe's political elite to understand the fears of ordinary people who have to bear the brunt of the adjustment to difficult new economic realities. The farmers who are agitating in the streets of Paris against the US-EC farm trade deal are just one example of how the fear of globalisation and of competition from lower-paid workers in the developing world is eating into the psyche of the underskilled. They sense a threat to real incomes; and rightly so, since the scale of structural adjustment in older industries will be painful as millions in China and elsewhere industrialise. In a world where there is no shortage of global demand, but where the balance of that demand is being redistributed eastward, the important lesson for the EC is not to fall now into the opposite trap of a populist retreat into protectionism. That would prevent the reallocation of resources needed to take advantage of the changes in global economic structure. On this score the good news, one year after the ERM started to crumble, is that capital controls have been debated but not introduced. The bad is that the response of France and Belgium to the more recent upheaval in the ERM suggests continued resistance to the markets' message.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At its session today, the Czech  Government approved an agreement on repaying the former Soviet  Union's debt to the Czech side.    [Begin Prime Minister Klaus recording] The government is  aware that this is the maximum possible that could have been  achieved at the moment. As someone has so pointedly said, the  government is happy with a sparrow in the hand, although some  people may have hoped for a fat pigeon--not even on the roof but  in the skies. The results and advantages of this solution are  very considerable indeed. [end recording]    According to Klaus, the size of the debts involved, the  interest rates, and the schedules have all been definitively  agreed upon. According to the agreement, our Republic should  receive $52 million by the end of this year, $100 million in  1995, and almost $400 million in 1996. [passage omitted]</p>

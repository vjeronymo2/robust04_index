			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Weekly interview with President Eduard Shevardnadze by </F> correspondent Nato Oniani--recorded]    [Text] [Nato Oniani] Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, last week  the situation grew tense again in Abkhazia. Villages in  Abkhazian Svaneti [northeastern Abkhazia] were attacked, and  villages in Zugdidi Rayon were shelled. People have been  wounded and killed. How would you assess the aggravation of the  situation in the wake of ideas expressed in the UN secretary  general's report? Do you think it is an attempt by Abkhaz  leaders to make a permanent border along the Enguri River? What  will Russia's position be if the situation is aggravated? Will  that big treaty with Russia be useful for us as a defense  mechanism, considering that one of the paragraphs of the treaty  prohibits training and sending combat units from the territory  of one undersigned country to the other?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The aggravation of  the situation in Abkhazia: We have to take any possible  measures, and certain measures have already been taken, to  protect the villages. Definite stabilization of the situation  was observed yesterday. Some civilians, including the wounded,  were led out. In connection with the aggravation of the  situation, I appealed to the Russian president, as you know.  This was followed by the Russian Government's statement. I am  not able say what influence this statement has had or will have  on Abkhazs or what practical action the Russian Government will  take, but we can infer that the Abkhazian side has planned a  fairly large-scale operation. The very near future will show  whether this can be stopped and a state of stability can be  restored. At least, the Russian Government's statement says  that the sides should immediately stop any activities leading to  further aggravation and new confrontation in Abkhazia.    Now, what is my assessment of these events? We are facing an  event that cannot be defined in words other than the following:  Gudauta leaders are openly and publicly slighting both the  United Nations and Russia because the appeal by Russia--the  Russian Government's appeal--is not the first. If these appeals  are sincere and if their mediation also has sincere aims, I mean  aims for peace, this action carried out by those in Gudauta can  be regarded as nothing but a slighting of both the United  Nations and Russia. I believe this should considered at the UN  Security Council and in Russia.    In this connection, I must say that I do not understand what  mission the UN observers are carrying out in Abkhazia. Back in  Sukhumi [just before the city fell to Abkhaz forces in autumn  1993], I was also puzzled. I still do not understand the aim of  their stay here. Expenses are rather high. Indeed, we favored  the idea of their intervening from the very beginning. But as a  new stage of the confrontation is beginning, and we are already  facing this, and the observers do not utter a word or even make  a statement, this should make us feel concerned. The United  Nations and its leadership should think about it. Let them at  least blame us. Most of all I cannot understand their silence  when preliminary agreements to cease fire and not to aggravate  the situation are openly violated. I am still convinced that  the dialogue should be renewed, because the failure of a peace  mission meets the interest of neither the United Nations nor  Russia. We have been positive about the necessity of the  peaceful settlement since the very beginning of the Abkhazian  conflict. We still confirm our readiness for the renewal of  negotiations. However, as I have already said, we also have to  be ready for different measures.    [Shevardnadze continues] Joint actions by the United  Nations, Russia, and countries friendly to Georgia can grow into  an extremely interesting precedent that can be used as a model  or as an interesting example of the settlement of conflicts  after the Soviet Union has disintegrated. This is a really  unprecedented case when an international organization--the UN  Security Council; one of its members--Russia; and four other  countries, including members of the Security Council, are  cooperating with the aim of settling a conflict. It is  significant that this concerns one of the republics, one of the  countries of the former Soviet Union. When all of this ends, it  will be of the utmost significance for the future because the  occurrence of similar conflicts cannot be ruled out in other  countries.    As for the significance of the treaty with Russia, I have  talked about it repeatedly. I would like to reconfirm that we  will not be able to reach any sort of peace in Abkhazia unless  we have Russia's backing in our striving to establish peace.    A few words about the commitments of the two sides. We,  Georgia, are already implementing our commitments stipulated by  the treaty and abide by every paragraph, every statement, every  word. It is of great importance that we have signed an  agreement on protecting state borders jointly. I believe that  the Russian leadership aspires to the same thing, or something  similar, in order to implement the whole package of agreements  Mr. Yeltsin and I signed in Tbilisi and to implement it the way  our peoples expect.    You have mentioned a renewed conflict, the aggravation of  the  situation in the Zugdidi area. My representatives are there,  and as far as I know they have gotten in touch with Gudauta.  There is an impression that the incidents that occurred there  and which had serious effects have been provoked by the lack of  control. I have been told that by their observations the  incidents were initiated by the militants deployed in the area.  This can be regarded as proof that the Gudauta leadership  cannot control the situation in all regions. This is my answer.    [Oniani] Thank you. Last week, Georgia joined NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, and a NATO delegation arrived in  Tbilisi. You appealed to them for active support and the  strengthening of peace. Do you think that NATO can be more  active-- I mean active involvement--as of a political  organization, in order to prevent current events from becoming a  source of new confrontation and new turmoil in Turkey, as a NATO  country, or in Russia, which will apparently join the NATO  initiative. These are the countries you have mentioned, as well  as Iran.    [Shevardnadze] The principal subject I discussed with the  NATO delegation pertained to principles of cooperation between  NATO and CIS, and NATO and Russia. You might ask me why the  cooperation between NATO and Georgia did not attract principal  attention. It did indeed attract attention, but I want to  reiterate that NATO is not able to go far in its cooperation  with us. A confrontation between NATO and Russia would lead the  world to a situation in which relatively small countries would  be harmed--and Georgia would be harmed first. Cooperation with  NATO is undoubtedly promising in the long run. It seems very  interesting. I, as well as the leaders of Russia and other  countries, have given a positive assessment of the Partnership  for Peace initiative, and it will be efficient if we are not led  into a new wave of confrontation. I am still referring to  relations between CIS and NATO and Russia and NATO. I believe  that this very issue is central today. If these relations are  normal, Georgia will gain a lot from this: As I once said, a  commonwealth of commonwealths.    [Oniani] One of the most important events of the past week  was the parliament's endorsement of the Cabinet of Ministers. So  far, one candidate for vice premier has been approved and  another has not been approved. Do you believe that the Cabinet  you have presented will receive support?    [Shevardnadze] I will tell you the state of affairs. The  Cabinet is working because the prime minister and one vice  premier have been approved, although all this has taken a lot of  time. I am going to meet the parliamentary majority today for  additional consultations. I have had a contact, a dialogue,  with the minority, and I would like to say that the dialogue was  constructive. We must come to an agreement in the parliament as  well as in the whole community that a policy of defiance will do  no one good today. If the endorsement of the Cabinet drags out  and grows complicated, the crisis will be aggravated because the  country will be even more unmanageable. That is why I believe  the endorsement of the Cabinet should be done quickly. This is  in our common interests.    Quite a few issues about the ways to conduct our work are to  be considered during the meetings with both the majority and the  minority. I would like to appeal to the parliament to work more  intensely--on Tuesday and probably on Wednesday and  Thursday--and we would be able to finish this task in three or  four days. We should approve those whom we consider necessary.  The ministers should be sure that their mission continues. If  someone is not trusted, this is an issue that should be handled  promptly. I cannot rule out that I will use my right to  repeatedly present a candidate that the parliament has not  approved.    [Oniani] Here is the final question. Your visit to the  United States, as well as the Ukrainian and Kazakh leaders'  visits, has caused a complex reaction in certain circles in  Russia. I would say it caused a remarkable irritation. I would  not say that our opposition has reacted to this positively  either. There emerged an idea that this visit was premature and  could have affected certain processes negatively.    [Shevardnadze] No, it was by no means premature. It was a  little overdue for various reasons.    Now, about our tasks in connection with this visit. I made  explicit statements about it during my TV interview and  addresses on the radio. The task of primary importance was to  convey a message of the truth from a height like the Security  Council, and I was able to stand on a high rostrum many times  during the visit. I am referring to conversations with  President Clinton and his associates, conversations in the  Congress, and so on. I believe that a very useful and necessary  job has been done.    The second task was to secure the continuation of Georgia's  relations with the West by making it more concrete and  permanent. I regard this as a concern for Georgia's future, and  my visit served to reinforce the basis of the relations.    Apart from all of this, I had to go to the United States of  America just to express gratitude for the assistance they  rendered along with other Western countries. If we are still  alive, we are alive because of assistance from the European  Union. And you know the contribution France, England, and  other countries render through the European Union. We have been  getting constant assistance from the United States. This had to  be said, and the gratitude of the Georgian people had to be  expressed.    I have announced that President Clinton promised aid of up  to  $70 million. Amplification is being done now, new programs are  being added and I was informed the day before yesterday that the  sum had increased to $80-85 million.    [Shevardnadze] This will increase if we meet our  commitments on securing stability in the country. Above all,  these commitments are in our interests.    I saw immense prospects for American business, and foreign  businesses including Russia and other countries in general, to  flow into Georgia. Georgia will only gain from this.    Now a few words about that irritation you have mentioned.  This visit was extremely interesting and useful in the context  of relations between Russia and the United States and East-West  relations in general. I do not think that Georgia and its  leader are entitled to a distinguished mission as regards  East-West relations, but every country including Georgia is  capable of contributing to this.    I believe that preventing a new wave of confrontation  between  East and West, between Russia and the United States, should be  the main concern of all countries, big as well as small. I  believe that normal relations between these two countries are of  special interest for small countries, including Georgia. Any  kind of confrontation would harm our national interests.    Another thing: An independent state should not be worried if  it acts in the interest of universal peace. Any kind of  negative reaction to actions not contradicting the interest of  universal peace can be considered as survival of imperialist  thinking. Everyone has to get used to the idea that yesterday is  over, and we have to deal with new countries, independent  countries, who plan visits themselves. Incidentally, I would  like to tell you that when the date of President Yeltsin's visit  coincided with my visit to France... [Oniani interrupts]    [Oniani] He postponed his visit...    [Shevardnadze] This has proved again that the president is  well aware that old times and the old system have passed, and he  has postponed his visit for 10 days so that our planned visit to  Paris, France, will not fail. So nothing terrible is happening.  There will be negative opinions, too, but in general the visit  has played its role and accomplished its positive mission for  Georgia and not only for Georgia.    [Oniani] Thank you. You have been listening to Mr. Eduard  Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of  state.</p>

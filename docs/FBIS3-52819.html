This was revealed in a  statement by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif following a  meeting that lasted more than two hours. The meeting was  attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi; Dr Kamal al-Janzuri,  deputy prime minister and planning minister; Dr. Yusuf Wali,  deputy prime minister and agriculture minister; and the social  affairs minister, the information minister, the minister of  public business sector, the finance minister, the education  minister, the local administration minister, minister of state  for population and family affairs, minister of state for the  People's Assembly and Consultative Council affairs, the economy  minister, health minister, minister of state for international  cooperation; and Dr. Isma'il Hasan, governor of the Central  Bank; and Dr. Zakariya 'Azmi, director of the President's Office.    Al-Sharif noted that President Mubarak heard a report on the  GATT agreements that have so far been signed by 114 countries  and represent 90 percent of the volume of international trade.  He said that the economy minister pointed out that the GATT  agreement involves three main areas: currencies, financing, and  trade. Al-Sharif noted that the report touched on Egypt's  membership in the agreements that were reached before the GATT  agreement and the positive aspects that bolstered Egypt's  national economy since these agreements were signed between 1970  and 1991. The report stressed that the agreements which Egypt  joined between 1970 and 1991 were reviewed by the cabinet and  the constitutional establishments. The report explained the  conflict in interests between the advanced nations and the  developing countries and the negative impact of the GATT  agreement on the economies of these countries in the short term  and the positive aspects that may be gained in the medium and  long terms.    Al-Sharif pointed out that President Mubarak discussed the  export policy and the impact of the GATT agreement on Egypt's  export policy and on the system of export shares and the effect  of the gradual cancellation of the shares system, which the GATT  agreement notes will be canceled over a 10-year period. The  report notes the approval in the GATT agreement of Egypt's  memorandum on protecting Egypt's clothing industry and stopping  exports of ready-made clothing and textiles in the early stages  of the implementation of the agreement. President Mubarak also  discussed the impact of the gradual abrogation of subsidies on  agricultural commodities over a six-year period and its effect  on the prices of food and agricultural commodities. President  Mubarak stressed that the economic policies must be based on  enhancing the positive aspects and drawing up plans to confront  the negative effects on the Egyptian economy in accordance with  future economic policies in the short, medium, and long terms.  He also called for assessing the effects of canceling subsidies  on agricultural commodities during these six years by the  producing and exporting countries and the effects of rising  prices of the commodities that Egypt imports, such as wheat. He  called for drawing up economic and financial policies to address  these factors.    Mubarak called for increasing Egyptian exports to the Arab  and African markets by removing obstacles and facilitating  procedures for exports, particularly textiles, cotton,  ready-made clothing, and other commodities. Al-Sharif noted  that President Mubarak also discussed a report on the  performance of the public business sector. [passage omitted]</p>

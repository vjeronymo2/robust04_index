			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "Hall Calls For Unification of </F> Forces"]    [Text] In the local government elections, the "post-August  1980" forces should together oppose the Democratic Left Alliance  and the Polish Peasant Party, according to Conservative Party  leader Aleksander Hall.    Speaking at a news conference on Saturday [12 February],  Hall  very sharply criticized the achievements of the Pawlak  Government so far. "Those who thought this government would  continue the work of its predecessors should take a closer look.  There is no question of a sensible alternative to this  government, either," he said.    In Hall's opinion, the government has failed to present a  scenario for any sphere of public life. The Conservative leader  also criticized the Pawlak Government's personnel policy.  "People are selected on the basis of political criteria, rather  than professional criteria. Persons who gained notoriety under  the People's Republic are receiving back high-ranking posts," he  said. He viewed the latest conflict inside the coalition as  evidence of a lack of elementary political culture and an  inability to think in terms of the state.    In view of the strength of the postcommunist camp, the  forces  of "Post-August Poland" must seek an accord, Hall said. The June  local government elections are going to be trial of strength for  them.    Next, the post-Solidarity parties should produce a single  candidate in the presidential elections strong enough to oppose  left-wing candidates, Hall said. In his opinion, if the  Solidarity groups fail to get together, they will suffer another  calamity. A Solidarity presidential candidate must have a  political program, said Hall. He must possess the image of a  statesman, and have enough prestige to gather the broadest  possible support. Last but not least, he must appeal to the  voters.    "Kazimierz Ujazdowski only took a small number of activists  away from the Conservative Party, even though these were good  people," said Hall. "So there is no question of any  disintegration of the Conservative Party. We have merely lost  the Lower Silesian constituency, that is all." He said he had  no intention of returning to the Democratic Union but, as head  of the Conservative Party, he wants to "guard and champion  conservative values," even if such an attitude causes a  temporary crisis among the Conservatives.</p>

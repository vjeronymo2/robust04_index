Speaking in  East London on Sunday night Ba'hai leaders expressed shock and  dismay at the senseless killing of three members of their  spiritual community.    The dead men are: Dr Shamam Bakhshandegi, 29, a dentist who  worked at Mdantsane hospital; Mr Riaz Razavi, 44, the director  of finance at the University of Fort Hare; and Mr Hooshmand  "Alex" Anvari, a visiting American national.    A Ba'hai leader in the Eastern Cape, Mr Cyrus Mahmoudi, said  the four gunmen had entered the church at about 2PM. "I don't  know weapons very well," a shaken Mr Mahmoudi told SAPA, "but,  according to some members of the congregation, at least one of  the men had an AK-47, the others had pistols. There was no  discussion at all. These men said they wanted the white people  to stand one side."    The three the victims, who were picked out because they had  a  lighter skin colour than everyone else present, were then told  to empty their pockets. After they had complied with the  gunmens' request "they were brutally shot down in cold blood in  the presence of many women and small children".    Mr Mahmoudi said that at no time had the gunmen given any  reasons for their actions. "This was a blatantly racist attack  against us, a church which has always preached that we are all  one kind."    The killers then grabbed a set of car keys belonging to one  of the men they had shot dead and made their getaway in the  stolen car.    Another Ba'hai elder, Cecil Cook, of Stutterheim, said the  "attack was on a religion which believes in the unity of  mankind. Nothing could be more racist."    The Ciskei Government released a statement on Sunday night  deploring the "despicable and cowardly action". The statement  added that "every effort" would be made to apprehend the killers.    "The stage has now been reached when it is only fair to  announce that no mercy will be shown to the sub-humans who  perpetrate such crimes."</p>

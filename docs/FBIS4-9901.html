			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Over the 1 April weekend, President Carlos  Roberto Reina announced that the economic cabinet will announce  this week the nine measures to be implemented by the current  administration. Although he did not specify what type of  measures his economic cabinet will announce, Reina reiterated  that the measures are necessary "and will be disclosed this  week."    Regarding the last increase in fuel prices, Reina said: "We  are doing the best we can within our means. We cannot avoid  certain adverse situations, but everything will be done to  increase social spending." He added, "The people have given me  their trust, and I ask them to continue to do so."    Meanwhile, Reina recalled that the increases are not the  only  measures that require unselfishness. He stressed, "unselfishness  is also fighting corruption of all types, and this is what we  are doing; unselfishness is telling the people the truth and  meeting all challenges courageously."    Regarding the substantial increase in the price of kerosene  for home use, Reina noted that the product had been subsidized,  "and if you want the real price, you will see it is still higher  than the fixed price." He argued, "I have tried to prevent this  as much as I could. Nevertheless, the government must continue  with its plan; otherwise, we will return to the high levels of  corruption that prevailed in this country in the past."  <H5>  Huge Debt of the Wealthy </H5>   Referring to the economic crisis the country is facing,  Reina  pointed out that the government's plan is to increase social  spending to ease the population's hardships. He said, "Our goal  is to increase social spending to as much as 35 percent of the  national budget." Nevertheless, he said it is first necessary to  correct situations like the one detected in the National  Enterprise for Electric Power, where the government discovered  that "wealthy people" owe some 190 million lempiras.    Reina went on to explain: "It is wealthy people, not poor  people. How can we allow this to continue? There are situations  the government will explain.... These are extremely dramatic  aspects of recent circumstances."    Asked if he was bowing to pressure from international  financial institutions [IFI's], he answered, "I will never bow  to the dictates of the IFI's." He argued, "I have the highest  opinion of the mandate, but we have inherited a very difficult  situation that must be faced with honesty."  <H5>  Tragedy in Mexico </H5>   Regarding the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio,  presidential candidate of the Mexican Institutional  Revolutionary Party, Reina said it would be a tragedy to return  to a time of assassinations and security threats to political  figures. He said he hopes the Mexican people will recover from  the shock of the incident, "and that this barbaric conduct will  never again be emulated in Honduras." Reina believes this tragic  incident in Mexico will not have repercussions in the Central  American countries. [passage omitted]</p>

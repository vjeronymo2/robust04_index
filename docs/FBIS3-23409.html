This  prompted the army command to take basic measures and to deploy  units in this party's centers that were used for planning these  bombings.    Visitors of President Ilyas al-Hirawi, citing him, told our  radio that there were four detainees in the bombing of the  Sayyidat al- Najat church, and that two others managed to flee  to the occupied border strip.    THE NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY, quoting concerned parties, said  that the results of the investigations into the bombing will be  made public next week at a meeting at Justice Minister Bahij  Tabbarah's office.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recycling the image of CIS aluminium - Kenneth Gooding talks to the emotional defender of an industry under attack LIKE MANY Russians, Mr Igor Prokopov can become emotional at times. And he gets noticeably cross when anyone suggests that the Commonwealth of Independent States is entirely responsible for bringing the world's aluminium industry to its knees and to a point where low prices are threatening the existence of many smelters. Some European producers, for example, blame the unprecedented surge in exports of aluminium from the CIS for driving them to the point of extinction. But Mr Prokopov, who is president of Concern Aluminiy, the holding company for the CIS industry, points out that aluminium is a world commodity and there is only one market - a world market. The CIS is now an important member of that market and the rest of the industry will have to adjust to that fact, he says. Japan once was a big aluminium producer, he recalls, but now makes virtually none. The Japanese were forced out of the business in the early 1980s because their costs were too high, particularly their energy costs. Nobody blamed the CIS producers for that, says Mr Prokopov. So why blame them now when other high-cost production in threatened? Mr Prokopov says most CIS smelters use low-cost hydro-electric power, as do smelters in Latin America and Canada. It is not their fault if smelters in central Europe have to buy energy that is relatively high-cost and that makes them the world's highest-cost producers. And the CIS has not been increasing its capacity like Canada and central Europe have recently. Mr Prokopov becomes particularly agitated at suggestions that the CIS is dumping aluminium in the west. How can this be, he asks, when all official CIS contracts are linked to the world price fixed by the London Metal Exchange and most of the export is handled by reputable western trading companies? He is making this spirited defence of his industry because the European Commission is at present considering whether it should impose draconian quotas on CIS aluminium imports to 'safeguard' its domestic producers. He says this would make no sense. Putting a fence between Europe and the CIS would not work - the metal would simply enter the world market elsewhere. Quotas would make even less political sense at a time when the world's industrialised countries were dismantling trade and tariff barriers and providing the CIS with other help for its transformation to a market economy. Mr Prokopov points out that the CIS uses much of the hard currency raised by aluminium sales to buy raw materials, equipment and spare parts for its smelters and, because each smelter supports a community, food for employees and their families. Many of these necessities are bought in the European Community, which is not only the nearest big market for aluminium but also the nearest big supplier of such goods. Last year the CIS industry was allowed by the central authorities to export 650,000 tonnes of aluminium free of duty to raise cash for these necessities. Mr Boris Yeltsin , the Russian president, recently signed a decree to permit 520,000 tonnes to go out duty-free this year. That is not to suggest CIS total aluminium exports will be cut this year. Both CIS output, at about 3.2m tonnes, and official exports at 850,000 tonnes, will be about the same as in 1992, he says. But Russia hopes to stem the flow of unlicensed exports from the CIS. Some suggest these reached 400,000 tonnes last year but Mr Prokopov insists they were not that high. Nevertheless, there has been so much unofficial metal available that the London Metal Exchange has become very wary about registering any more brands of CIS aluminium because of worries about ultimate ownership and who is taking responsibility for quality. Mr Prokopov says virtually none of the unofficial metal is being exported from Russia but is escaping via other members of the federation. Russia is introducing new customs regulations to make it much more difficult for metal to slip out this way. The CIS industry knows it has an image problem. One of the most telling points put by EC producers is that clean, modern, community capacity is being shut down to make way for imports from heavily-polluting, out-dated CIS smelters. So the CIS producers last week in Helsinki joined with some of its western suppliers to form a new association to defend and promote the CIS industry's interests. Mr Prokopov admits it is difficult for his industry to attract the investment to make the smelters less environmentally damaging. VAW of Germany recently estimated it would cost USDollars 6.6bn to modernise just four of the 14 CIS smelters and most observers believe the CIS simply cannot afford to go that deeply into debt. One solution which is emerging, however, would be for the CIS to use intermediate technology and upgrade those of its smelters using the old Soederberg production system - ten out of 14 smelters - instead of jumping to the most up-to-date, pre-baked technology. Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, chief executive of the Kumera Corporation, a Finnish group with many years of experience supplying Russia, suggests that this would cost an affordable total of Dollars 600m. His company has put proposals to all of the CIS Soederberg smelters, offering to upgrade them by using well-tried technology developed by Reynolds Metals of the US. Reynolds has converted two of its own Soederberg smelters in the US. Mr Kumpulainen says the Reynolds' technology not only cuts pollution substantially - for example at one smelter 20 kg of emissions a year would be reduced to only 2 kg - it also saves energy. The present power efficiency of 80 per cent would be raised to 90 per cent. Ironically, because Russia has perhaps the most stringent emission regulations in the world, the smelters would still not meet the rules after upgrading. Mr Erik Jensen, one of the Reynolds Metals' executives at Helsinki, insists the CIS primary aluminium industry is 'tremendously viable'. He wishes western bankers would understand it was a unique industry, with very low costs and little or no debt, thus making it very hard for the rest of the world to compete. 'It has great technological strength, is well-organised and is producing a commodity that is instantly convertible into cash,' he points out. The CIS industry has the ability to repay debt rapidly, yet western bankers insist on placing conditions on loans that they would not dream of imposing elsewhere in the industry. Anywhere else the smelter would be used as collateral for loans but that is not possible in the CIS. Mr Jensen says this is probably because the question of who owns the smelter remains obscure. This ownership question is gradually becoming clearer as the industry is privatised. Mr Prokopov says management and employees now own 51 per cent of the Russian smelters with the rest in the hands of the state. But this 49 per cent is being sold at auctions to the public. Mr Prokopov insists that the difficulties facing foreign investors in the CIS can be overcome. Many western companies, particularly from Italy, are building joint ventures. For example, Fata, the Italian industrial group, and Reynolds are working with a Russian consortium to build a plant to produce 43,000 tonnes a year of aluminium foil - 'this will leave more aluminium in Russia,' he says: 'This is not aid, it is investment. We are convinced both Fata and Reynolds will see satisfactory profits.' Reynolds' Mr Jensen says the joint venture is making only slow progress but his company's philosophy is that as many new downstream products as possible should be encouraged in Russia. 'There is,' he says, 'no better way to help the world aluminium industry.'</p>

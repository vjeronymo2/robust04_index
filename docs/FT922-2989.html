			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: Tales of parents and children PERSISTENT RUMOURS by Lee Langley Heinemann Pounds 14.95, 294 pages THE TAP DANCER by Andrew Barrow Duckworth Pounds 14.99, 181 pages THE SILENT DUCHESS by Dacia Maraini Peter Owen Pounds 14.99, 235 pages IN THE old days, British families in India sent their children home to school at the age of seven or eight. No one thought it odd. But in Persistent Rumours, having sent him away (thus proving to the child that she does not love him), James's mother dies, abandoning him twice over. The rest of his seemingly successful life, with its successful marriage (for he is lucky to find the loving, patient Daisy), is spent trying to solve the mystery and fill the emptiness. The headmaster told him that she was drowned in a shipwreck off one of the Andaman Islands. Later, he returns to his birthplace and hears the rumours. Were there any survivors? Had they a hope among the ferocious cannibals? In old age, determined to discover more, he revisits the Andamans with Daisy. What he finds is dramatic and startling; but it is revealed with such tenderness and credibility that, for all the macabre facts uncovered, it makes psychological truth and a sort of circular sense out of James's fractured life and unlovable personality. Daisy, the quiet heroine, is there to pick up, quite literally, what remains. Beautifully constructed, the story switches between times and generations in a complex but unconfusing way. At the human level, much is said, obliquely, about deprivation, love and lovelessness, memory, fidelity, the life of the heart and senses, and the limitations of reason. At the intellectual level it makes sense of an ancient mystery, uncovering clues and trailing those elusive rumours. The visual climax, in which what happened is shown as if by lightning, in a flash of childhood memory that tells everything, is at once haunting and brilliant; and the colonial past, the islands' savage inheritance, is linked with today's world in the figures of two old men facing each other briefly across a stretch of water: possibly brothers. With such touches - economy of means, richness of feeling and suggestion - this post-colonial story makes its point. The Tap Dancer is another tale of parents and children but with a staid chronological technique, a narrative running straight along a decade or so. Richard, Tim, Edward, William and Ben are the sons of a manic, ill-tempered and ill-natured domestic tyrant; William is the narrator. Father has no friends and no noticeable relationship with his meek wife. A bully and a bore, he hates homosexuals, Jews, socialists, Roman Catholics, 'redbrick university cattle' - indeed, almost everyone. Liberals who think views like his no longer exist in civilised society should take a look at him, for he clearly exists and in every phrase rings true. The present accepted ideas of democracy, tolerance and decency of speech and feeling have never come near him. Out of this public-school Alf Garnett, Andrew Barrow has made a comic masterpiece about a fascist beast far superior to Nancy Mitford's one-dimensional old horror, Fa. Full of sidelong observations and oblique goings-on, discursive events and apparently pointless but cumulatively powerful detail, the narrative reminds me of the magnificent, unemphatic fiction of Natalia Ginzberg, who was everything Father would have hated - Jewish, left-wing, intellectual, foreign. From Wiltshire to the Isle of Man, with occasional outings to London, we follow the progress of Father, poor put-upon Mummy, their dogs, their endless domestic crises. Barrow has a voice and a style to be taken seriously, and his first novel has more valuable social comment than many a tale of trendy manners; Father, tap-dancing weirdly across the kitchen in moments of glee, has immense vitality and, what is odder, even a certain humanity. By comparison, The Silent Duchess, despite an exotic subject, is wan and forgettable. Taken at the age of seven to watch a 13-year-old boy hanged in Palermo, married at 13 to her middle-aged uncle, Marianna, who is deaf-and-dumb, watches the world and sniffs its smells with a highly developed nose. Her life-story in the barbarous 18th-century Sicilian aristocracy is told with a minute realism that is the book's best quality. But a touch of magic - she can read people's thoughts - doesn't work, and the longish pieces of monologue from servants vary the tone but fail to persuade. Crammed with information which is interesting but unable on its own to make a satisfying novel, the book fails because its characters are unmemorable. Marianna has little but the pathos of her circumstances, lumbered as she is with the man she calls uncle husband - brutal in bed but, considering Sicilian husbands in general, not so bad out of it.</p>

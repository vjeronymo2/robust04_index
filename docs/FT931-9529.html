			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Most teachers to receive pay increase of 1 to 1.5 per cent over year ALMOST all teachers will receive a pay increase worth between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent over the full year from this April, Andrew Adonis writes. The rise will be accompanied by an overhaul of the teachers' pay scale, but plans for full-blown performance pay have been shelved pending pilot studies. All qualified teachers will receive a 0.55 per cent increase on April 1, and a one-off payment of Pounds 90 on May 1. On September 1, they will be transferred to a new pay scale, giving a further increase to most. Teachers are presently paid on a 10-point scale from Pounds 11,184 to Pounds 18,837, with five different incentive allowances - ranging from Pounds 1,296 to Pounds 7,692 - for those assuming extra responsibilities or demonstrating 'outstanding ability' in the classroom. The allowances will be abolished from this September, and all teachers will be placed on a 18-point scale, ranging from Pounds 11,295 to Pounds 30,573. Teachers will have their present salaries converted to a safeguarded entitlement on the new scale. Thereafter, the award of extra points will depend on 'qualifications, experience, responsibilities, excellence, and recruitment and retention factors'. In the process, some highly rated teachers could gain well above the average increase, possibly as much as a 2.5 per cent rise overall. But others stand to fare below average. Head teachers and deputy heads will receive a 1 per cent increase on April 1. Overall, the package will cost an extra 1.5 per cent. Local education authorities, most of which are presently spending at their capping ceiling, yesterday expressed concern at their ability to foot the bill without redundancies. The pay increases and new scale structure are as recommended by the teachers' pay review body, but have been reduced slightly by the government to keep the additional cost for 1994-95 down to 1.5 per cent. In its report, the review body emphasised that, for the past two years, pay rises for teachers outstripped those for non-manual employees generally. It noted: 'Starting salaries for teachers now compare more favourably with those for other newly employed graduates - although we recognise that more needs to be done to improve subsequent salary progression for teachers.' Mr John Patten, education secretary, endorsed the new structure, welcoming in particular the review body's proposals for rewarding excellent teaching. 'School governors have shown that they are ready to reward high-achieving heads and deputies. The new structure will encourage them to be equally positive in taking decisions on the pay of classroom teachers,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Turkey Extends Poised Hammer </F> Mandate"]    [Text] The Turkish parliament extended the Poised Hammer  mandate on Tuesday, 28 December. The vote was 196 to 160, with  two abstentions. The Turkish National Security Council [NSC]  recommended the extension of that force's mandate on 20  December. The NSC's decision had to be supported by the Council  of Ministers and the parliament in order to be legalized.    Poised Hammer, which was originally deployed in Turkey for a  period of three months after the Gulf War, has been in that  country for nearly two years. Obviously, the Turkish  parliament's approval will enable that force to remain in Turkey  for another six months. Recalling the deployment of Poised  Hammer in Turkey, several political experts believe that it has  a rather wide-ranging sphere of activity. They also believe  that Poised Hammer can be used to strengthen Washington's  regional security plan and oppose any move that might threaten  Western interests in the region.    The Turkish Government has allowed the deployment of an  allied military force on its territory to defend certain parts  of its border and protect the Kurds against possible attacks by  the Baghdad regime. But how can the Turkish Government claim  that the country's sovereignty extends right up to its border?  Is Poised Hammer's task limited to what has been disclosed thus  far, or does this force have an undisclosed mission in the  region? The Turkish people are in the dark about this, and  opposition by a significant number of people in Turkey to the  presence of the allied military unit in this country can be  viewed from this perspective.    Some 69.37 percent of the respondents in a public opinion  poll carried out by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS in Ankara last year  said that they wanted the Western military units to withdraw  from Turkey. Considering that nothing has been mentioned in  connection with the duration of the Poised Hammer mandate and  when this force's task will end, it is believed that setting a  date for the withdrawal of this force will take a long time.</p>

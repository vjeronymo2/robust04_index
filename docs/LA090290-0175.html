			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAR OF NERVES TESTS DIPLOMATS AT EMBASSIES  </P> <P> A week after they were ordered to clear out, diplomats at nearly 30 embassies  in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait remained defiant Saturday, even though their food and  water supplies were dwindling.  </P> <P> The staff at the Moroccan Embassy had been marched off at gunpoint, and several  other embassies had suspended operations, but most of the diplomats were  staying on despite the Iraqi harassment, according to reports reaching here.  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and 10 of his officers and staff were  holding out at the embassy, reportedly keeping sporadic contact with the 2,000  or more Americans trapped in Kuwait city.  </P> <P> The Iraqi deadline for closing the embassies expired Aug. 24 at midnight, and  the Iraqi director of information, Naji Hadithi, said the next morning, "For  the time being, there is no use of force, and I do not think there will be any  use of force."  </P> <P> But Iraqi troops were positioned outside the U.S. Embassy and refused to permit  anyone to leave or enter. At last report, the troops were still in place.  </P> <P> Electric power and water lines to most of the major embassies have been shut  off. In Paris, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that at the French Embassy in  Kuwait the lights were blinking on and off like a nightclub's.  </P> <P> "It's a war of nerves," he said, "a process of asphyxiation."  </P> <P> Many of the embassies switched on emergency generators and have been able to  maintain communications with their governments.  </P> <P> A spokesman at the British Foreign Office said in London that Ambassador  Michael Weston, who observed the deadline sipping champagne at his embassy with  three of his officers, has been able to get word out that Iraqi tanks were  moving on the coast road outside his window.  </P> <P> Ottawa's External Affairs Ministry reported that water and power had been cut  off at the Canadian Embassy but that officers were in contact with Canadian  nationals trapped in the city.  </P> <P> "All Canadian and locally engaged staff at the embassy are reported to be  well," a ministry spokesman said.  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime ordered the embassies closed down in  recognition of his proclaimed annexation of Kuwait following the Aug. 2  invasion.  </P> <P> "It is not a matter of confrontation," said the Iraqi ambassador to London,  Azmi Safiq Salihi. "Rather, it is a matter of sovereignty. By this I mean  Kuwait is a part of Iraq, and each country can have only one embassy (in  Baghdad) to represent it in Iraq."  </P> <P> The Moroccan Embassy was forced to close the morning after the deadline when  Iraqi troops intercepted its diplomats as they attempted to enter the grounds.  The Foreign Ministry in Rabat said a soldier leveled his rifle at a diplomat  and told him to "raise his hands and walk a long distance."  </P> <P> The Moroccan spokesman said: "Diplomats were forbidden access to offices in a  brutal manner and were told to close the embassy and leave Kuwait or else other  measures would be taken." Morocco promptly expelled two Iraqi officials from  Rabat in retaliation.  </P> <P> In announcing its deadline, the Iraqi government said that officials who failed  to comply would lose their diplomatic immunity, would be stripped of all  privileges and become subject to detention.  </P></p>

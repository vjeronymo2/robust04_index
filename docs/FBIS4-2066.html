			<p>BFN     [Text] Qingdao, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Qingdao city, in East  China's Shandong Province, well-known for its textile industry,  has carried out a strategic economic shift to put stress on the  chemical, machinery and electronics sectors.    According to Zhang Rongxiang, a top official in charge of  the  city's economic affairs, Qingdao poured more money into these  fields last year, accounting for 49 percent of the province's  total such investment, and 10 percent more than in textiles.    He said that 44 percent of the completed projects involved  these industries, including a 1.2 billion-yuan oil refinery and  an 80 million-yuan project which is to produce big-screen colour  televisions.    Statistics show that last year the city fulfilled 675  projects on technological improvement, which cost more than 2.8  billion yuan. They are expected to increase the city's annual  output value by 6.17 billion yuan. And they will bring in 692  million yuan in profits and 167 million U.S. dollars in foreign  exchange.    Zhang also said the city will encourage enterprises in the  spheres of machinery, electronics and chemical industry to seek  cooperation with big-name international conglomerates.</p>

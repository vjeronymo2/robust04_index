The idea of increasing peasants' income and gradually improving  peasants' material and cultural lives must be taken as the  starting point and objective of our rural economic work.    Present at yesterday's provincial meeting on rural work were  provincial party and government leaders Li Changchun [provincial  party secretary], Ma Zhongchen, Ren Keli, Song Zhaosu, Wu  Guangxian, Zheng Zengmao, Song Guochen, Zhang Deguang, Fan  Qinchen, Ma Jianzhan, Zhang Wenbin, Zhong Lisheng, Li Chengyi,  Zhang Honghua, Yu Jiahua, Yao Zhongmin, Tu Jiaji, Ren Weiyuan,  and Yuan Nong.    Song Zhaosu, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, presided over the meeting.    In his closing speech, Governor Ma Zhongchen pointed out: In  order to give correct guidance to rural economic work, it is  necessary to break away from outdated concepts and conventional  methods of thinking, but adopt new concepts and new methods of  thinking on the market economy, and to learn how to guide rural  economic work with these concepts and methods of thinking on the  market economy. [passage omitted]    To conclude his speech, Ma Zhongchen said: The idea of  increasing the peasants' income and gradually improving their  material and cultural lives must be made the starting point and  objective of rural economic work. It is necessary to correctly  handle the relationship between reform, development, and  stability; to study harder; and, in particular, to protect and  give full play to initiative on the part of cadres at the  grass-roots level and the broad masses of people. Various local  authorities, when implementing the guidelines laid down by this  meeting, must conscientiously sum up their own good experience,  straighten out their thinking, continue to work in a  down-to-earth manner, and strive hard to speed up the  development of the market economy in the rural areas of Henan  province.</p>

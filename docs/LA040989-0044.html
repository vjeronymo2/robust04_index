			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: BEYOND WESTWEEK  </P> <P> Beyond the speeches, the symposiums, the awards, the networking and the  socializing, Westweek is at heart a grand furniture and furnishings show.  </P> <P> As such, it is a time for interior and industrial designers, architects and  store owners to see, touch and feel the latest products of an expanding,  style-conscious industry.  </P> <P> Eventually, much of what was unveiled in the "to-the-trade-only" showrooms of  the Pacfic Design Center in West Hollywood during Westweek will find itself  into the more tony stores everywhere over the next year.  </P> <P> With that in mind, the following is a sampling of some of the new products that  were displayed at Westweek.

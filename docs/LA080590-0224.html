			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SALINAS GOLFER DEFEATS LA HABRA'S MAY  </P> <P> Terrence Miskell of Salinas shot a three-under-par 69 Friday to score a  nine-stroke victory over runner-up Bob May of La Habra in the Pacific Coast  Amateur at the Eugene Country Club.  </P> <P> Also nine strokes back was Bill Edwards of Moultrie, Ga.  </P> <P> The 24-year-old Miskell, runner-up in the U.S. Public Links Championship in  Portland in July, finished with a 72-hole total of 10-under-par 278.  </P> <P> Miskell's runaway victory wasn't even close to a tournament record for margin  of victory. In 1988 at Bear Creek Golf Club in Colorado, Billy Mayfair won the  Pacific Coast Amateur by 18 shots.  </P> <P> Miskell started Friday's final round with an eight-shot advantage and he didn't  let up from his stinging pace in the final 18, hitting 15 greens and mixing  five birdies with three bogeys.  </P> <P> "I play aggressive," Miskell said. "I'm out to make birdie, even if it's the  hardest hole in the world."  </P> <P> The California native played all four rounds below par, and finished the  tournament with three consecutive rounds of 69.  </P></p>

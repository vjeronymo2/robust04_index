			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Easing next year EUROPEAN futures markets yesterday appeared to be taking the view that the next round of central bank policy easing will come next year and not before the end of 1992, writes James Blitz. The longer-dated futures contracts in sterling, D-Marks and French francs all showed good rises yesterday, implying that the cost of 3-month money will drop next year. By contrast, the shorter-dated futures in Europe fell back yesterday as markets continue to take the view that the Bundesbank is keeping monetary policy on a tight rein for the time being. Sterling futures contracts now describe a falling interest rate yield curve in the spring of 1993, but not before. The March 1993 contract rose 6 basis points to a close of 93.77 yesterday, while the June contract rose 10 basis points yesterday to 93.94. The latter price means that 3-month money next summer would be at 6.06 per cent, implying at least another 100 basis points off base rate within the next 6 months. Beyond that, the interest rate curve rises again. The March 1995 contract was yesterday trading at 92.16, suggesting that 3-month money will be near 8 per cent again in 2 1/2 year's time. Rates in the cash market describe roughly the same trend. Three-month money, which is seen as a key guide to the market's view on rates, closed at 7 5/16 per cent from a previous close of 7 3/8 per cent. That price is well above the base rate figure. But the easier close on the day reflects the ease with which the Bank of England's shortage of Pounds 750m was removed. In the early round, Pounds 520m was removed, and there was late assistance of Pounds 105m. One commercial bank dealer suggested that the Bank of England might go out of its way to help remove shortages in the next few days because of the government's need to convince banks and building societies to pass on the full effects of last Friday's base rate cut. 'With the short-dated periods much higher than base rate, the banks will have a good reason for complaining of high funding costs,' he said. Like sterling, the longer-dated Euromark contracts rose sharply yesterday. June 1993 Euromarks rose 5 basis points to a close of 92.82, and December 1993 was up 6 basis points at a close of 93.43.</p>

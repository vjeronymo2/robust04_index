			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Management: The annual agony of Christmas giving It is now the Christmas party season: a time for lechery and indolence. It is also a time of gift exchange, personal and corporate, which like so many things at Christmas is fraught with difficulty. Gift buying is an annual torment which means so much to the chancellor of the exchequer, the high street shops and the credit card companies. But what makes this business of gift exchange and present-buying so difficult? Maybe it is because they are imbued with much meaning - they can be statements of influence, power, taste, sympathy or emotion. It is not only the problem of to whom one gives presents or not, and/or how much/little to spend, but more importantly what sort of item to purchase. Gifts are one of the ways in which the mental pictures others have of us are transmitted and likewise, we disclose to our gift recipients our pictures of them. The subtlety of the exchange can be best seen when it goes wrong. We can all remember, as a child, receiving a present which was insulting because we had outgrown it. On the other hand, over-eager parents may cause extreme anxiety by giving gifts for which the child is simply not ready. Most toy manufacturers recognise this problem and indicate the toy's appropriate age range. Wouldn't it be fun to do the same for adult presents, putting labels on aftershave like 'ideal for Essex man'; or executive toys 'for the middle manager going nowhere'? It is precisely because we give people something 'suitable', as we perceive it, that individuals are so frequently given the same sort of present. How many executives receive bottles of whisky? Should a person receive a variety of unusual presents, one may wonder at the gift-givers' very different perceptions and the real identity of the recipient. The Christmas present also imposes an identity on the giver, as well as the receiver. Some men confirm their 'macho' identity by presenting non-personal gifts, such as cigars following the birth of a child. There is the conspicuous presentation of expensive gifts to celebrate simultaneously one's wealth and generosity. A gift may also be a portion of oneself - a sort of example of one's talent - so the artistic give pictures, gardeners a plant. Gifts can be an important source of dominance particularly if one cannot reciprocate. Occasionally, adults can embarrass each other by the generosity of the present. To accept a gift is, to an extent, to accept the identity it imposes. However, gifts can be rejected if they are perceived as unfriendly acts. A giver may express contempt by purchasing a gift for an individual which is inferior to those openly given to others. Gifts may have symbolic qualities  -a gold watch for good riddance, travel luggage encouraging a long journey. 'Hint-type' presents may also be rejected - cosmetics to conceal poor skin, a watch for the habitually late. Many 'joke' presents fall into this category, for example, hot, spicy chewing gum (for the loud mouthed). Joke gifts may also reflect a rather insecure relationship. Just as easily, gifts can be an expression of guilt, such as an attempt to compensate for a certain deficit. They make excellent items to use in the atonement of sins but they can be easily rejected as not being sufficiently compensatory. Exchanging presents is another, more acceptable form of rejection. There are so many people returning unwanted gifts to the stores after Christmas (clearly not always because the size is wrong) that one wonders if anybody received a present which they wanted. Some groups try to prevent gift inflation, such as setting a limit on a present's cost. Another way of coping can be to set aside certain goods or services as specifically gift-related and somehow not part of the mundane economic world. Confectionery and gift tokens play an important role here. But, however hard people try, the social rankings so beloved by the British are reflected in, and maintained by, Christmas gifts, for the allocation of the quality and quantity of presents brings people into comparison who are rarely contrasted with one another. 'What did you get for Christmas?' provides excellent data on exactly where someone stands in the pecking order. Both buying and receiving presents is a maze, full of rules and conventions and sub-texts and messages about multiple facets of the giver and receiver alike. Even a statement of one's ideal gift can be a minefield, as a British ambassador to Washington once discovered. The diplomatic envoys from several countries were canvassed by a local radio station; the French ambassador described his ideal Christmas present as peace throughout the world, the Canadian ambassador wished for an end to starvation, while the British ambassador requested a nice box of crystallised fruit.

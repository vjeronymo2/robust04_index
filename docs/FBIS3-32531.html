Guatemala and Germany have signed a cooperation agreement  through which Germany grants Guatemala 28 million German marks.  After a one-year suspension of German financial cooperation due  to the political and human rights problems during the Jorge  Serrano government, the two countries negotiated the new aid,  which will be used for financial and technical cooperation,  especially basic education in rural areas. (Guatemala City  PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 29 Jan 94 p 64)    Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielmann has announced  that  with the objective of regulating the austerity policy in public  expenditures, the Council of Ministers on 1 February signed an  agreement that, among other things, prohibits the transfer of  funds from one appropriation to another and eliminates  superfluous expenditures such as vehicles assigned to certain  officials and entertainment allowances. She said transfers will  only be permitted to deal with emergency situations or cases of  national interest. She said from 25 million to 30 million  quetzales a year are expected to be saved with the measure, and  these funds will be used in the social sectors, mainly for  preventive health and education.

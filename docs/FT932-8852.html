			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Tonight's viewing has plenty of fodder for aspiring criminals and voyeurs of the cheaper sort. Hypotheticals (BBC2, 7.50pm), the TV intelligentsia's answer to university debating societies, returns tonight and gathers hangers, floggers and hand-wringers to consider juvenile crime. A strange hour to schedule it, as intellectuals of a different ilk will instead be flocking to Brookside (C4, 8pm), the one soap on British television that isn't full of suds and lather and little else. Very rarely is there a moral imperative to watch TV. Bad Company (BBC2, 9pm), dramatising the 1978 murder of newspaper delivery boy Carl Bridgewater, is one example. Crimes are also perpetrated on-screen. The first of a seven-part documentary, Singles (ITV, 10.40pm) features 'Ruby, 24, blonde and beautiful' and her efforts to find a partner in London. Singles may be a ratings-winner, but perhaps for all the wrong reasons. A much better idea: why not set the video for The Naked Truth (BBC2, 4pm), and grab the chance to see the incomparable Peter Sellers in a rarely-screened 1957 farce?</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Ashdown fillip on co-operation: The Liberal Democrats at Harrogate MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the party leader, was yesterday given an almost free hand to develop co-operation with other parties. A motion expressing a belief in working with anyone like-minded and in promoting campaigns on common causes received strong support at the Liberal Democrat conference. In his rallying speech to the conference this afternoon, Mr Ashdown is expected to welcome yesterday's resolution as a good base from which to proceed. Today's speech will also be used to launch Mr Ashdown's first full-scale attack on Mr John Major's lack of leadership since the election. Previously he has sometimes sounded as though he admires the prime minister. In deliberately rejecting the idea of 'promoting' discussion, the agreement reached yesterday is a dilution of what Mr Ashdown appeared to have in mind in his speech in Chard, Somerset, soon after the general election. Then, in a move which left many of his parliamentary colleagues unhappy, he called for the Liberal Democrats to be the 'catalyst' for debate with people of other parties and the politically uncommitted. The party activists' deep-rooted suspicion of Labour was reflected in many speeches, and in the cheers that greeted the rejection of an amendment highlighting areas where members of the two parties agree. Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, argued that an earlier proposal which referred to 'promoting a process of discussion' represented a 'begging-bowl approach'. But Dr Jenny Tonge, the party's general election candidate in Richmond and Barnes, warned delegates that, in order to defeat the Conservatives, some Liberal Democrats would have to consider voting tactically for Labour as some Labour supporters had done in Richmond and Barnes at the election. Several speakers repeated warnings that it was the electorate's view of the Liberal Democrats' as being close to Labour that had prevented them from achieving greater success in the general election.</p>

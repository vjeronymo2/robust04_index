			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Welsh Water to cut 18% of workforce Welsh Water yesterday said it would announce plans for its Pounds 55m cash pile in October when it unveils its corporate strategy to investors and analysts. The group also revealed details of a cost-cutting plan which will mean the loss of 18 per cent of the utility's 3,000-strong workforce. Welsh, which has one of the strongest balance sheets among the 10 water and sewerage companies, has several options for the cash from buying back shares to expanding its non-regulatory businesses. Mr Graham Hawker, Welsh's chief executive, implied the preferable option would be to expand the businesses. 'If we can use our skills and assets to generate superior returns to shareholders then that's what we should do,' he said. Any diversification would have to be treated cautiously after the group's unhappy experiences as hotels manager and unwelcome investor in Swalec, the regional electricity company. Welsh also announced yesterday that it planned to shed 550 mostly white collar jobs, in a move designed to help it beat efficiency targets set by the industry regulator last month. The company was widely regarded to have done well out of the regulator's price review, with annual increases of 0.5 percentage points above inflation allowed to 2000. The job cuts will result in a Pounds 17m provision against profits this year but are expected to bring a similar level of savings over two years. Mr Hawker said the redundancies included senior managers and head office staff. All would be voluntary and more than half of the proposed cuts had been agreed already. Some 140 people had left between April 1993 and 1994, with a further 230 planned by the end of this year. The balance would leave by the end of the 1996-97 financial year. Savings of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m were expected in the first full year.</p>

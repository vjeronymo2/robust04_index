During the meeting, to be held later today, the Palestinian  leadership is expected to define the PLO stance on continuing  the peace negotiations on every level, in light of the Israeli  terrorist actions against the Palestinian people, which are the  result of Israel's continuing intransigence and failure to  implement the Declaration of Principles Agreement and withdraw  from Gaza and Jericho.    President 'Arafat telephoned Nasir al-Qidrah, the chief  Palestinian observer at the United Nations, and asked him to  submit an urgent memorandum to the UN Security Council on the  hideous massacre, which contravenes every international  agreement and custom, and to call for an emergency Security  Council meeting to discuss it.</p>

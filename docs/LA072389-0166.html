			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WIFE PLOTTED SACRIFICE, COURT TOLD  </P> <P> The wife of Liberia's former defense minister persuaded a police inspector to  help her make a human sacrifice to further her husband's career, a  court-martial heard.  </P> <P> Inspector Joe Lesolee told the court Friday that he killed Patrolman J. Melvin  Pyne on orders of former Defense Minister Gray D. Allison and with help from  his wife, Watta Allison.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Allison, stripped of his office in June, is charged with killing  Pyne, whose body was found March 31 with his heart ripped out on a railway  track near Monrovia.  </P> <P> Lesolee said Watta Allison proposed they make a sacrifice. When he suggested a  sheep, she replied: "A sheep? Lesolee, my man, I thought you were a man. What  we want with sheep?"  </P> <P> She said they needed human blood. Lesolee said he and Watta Allison recruited  officer Pyne and got him drunk. Lesolee then hit him with an iron bar. A nurse  slit Pyne's throat and drained the blood into a bucket, Lesolee said.  </P></p>

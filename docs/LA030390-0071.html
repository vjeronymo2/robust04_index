			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE ORDERS CITY TO RELEASE BRADLEY REELECTION DOCUMENTS  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Friday ordered city officials to release boxes of  detailed financial records on Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's 1989 reelection  campaign, but postponed a decision on whether to release other documents that  have been referred to investigators.  </P> <P> City officials had denied a Los Angeles Times request to inspect the records,  which are being audited by Los Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez. The request  was made late last year when the paper reported that a series of inner-city  campaign carnivals, organized by Bradley supporters, may have violated state  and local campaign reporting laws.  </P> <P> Last month, The Times asked the court to order the release of the records.  </P> <P> Judge David P. Yaffe on Friday ruled that 23 boxes of campaign documents held  by the city clerk must be opened to inspection.  </P> <P> The city attorney's office argued unsuccessfully that the records were not  public because they were only temporarily in the custody of city auditors.  </P> <P> Times attorney Glen A. Smith argued that the city clerk's office had the  documents as part of its official, legally required duties, which makes them  public under state law. Yaffe agreed with the Times, but said the order would  not become final for 15 days to allow objections to be filed.  </P> <P> Yaffe also tentatively indicated he would order the release of 47 Bradley  campaign documents related to the carnivals that have been referred to the Los  Angeles County district attorney's office and the state Fair Political  Practices Commission for investigation. But Yaffe agreed to review those  documents privately next week before ruling on their release. Deputy City Atty.  Linda Lefkowitz argued that the records are exempt from disclosure because they  are the focus of an audit and investigation that "could lead to action by more  than one . . . law enforcement agency."  </P> <P> Last month, The Times reported that the material turned over to the district  attorney's office included copies of about $80,000 worth of money orders  generated by the carnival and apparently delivered directly to the mayor. Also  included were handwritten notes that the mayor sent to his campaign accountant  indicating how to report the contributions.  </P> <P> Bradley has said he relied on campaign accountants and lawyers to determine how  the carnival proceeds should be reported. His office declined to comment Friday  on Yaffe's ruling.  </P></p>

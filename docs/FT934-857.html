			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Alcoa to take Dollars 70m charge in fourth quarter Alcoa, North America's largest aluminium producer, is to take a Dollars 70m, or 80 cents a share, after-tax charge against earnings in the fourth quarter of 1993. It has also announced its fifth round of job reductions in 20 months. The company said Dollars 59.4m of the fourth-quarter charge is associated with the cost of permanent lay-offs of 1,600 hourly and salaried employees in its US aluminium operations. Some of the reductions have already occurred and the balance will be complete in 1994. The remaining Dollars 10.8m of the charge stems from closing several production operations, including an aluminium rod plant in Rockdale, Texas. Alcoa is one of the few US aluminium producers to have remained profitable in the face of a world aluminium glut and sharply depressed prices. The company had third quarter earnings of Dollars 28.8m, or 32 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.2bn.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Provisions leave Bardon with a deficit of Pounds 47.9m Bardon Group, the UK and US aggregates group, incurred a 1993 pre-tax loss of Pounds 47.9m after writing down the value of its marine dredging business by Pounds 60m. It is the second time in two years that the group has made large losses following substantial write-downs. In 1992 Bardon ran up a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 40.3m after provisions of Pounds 58.5m. The latest write-down was made against Civil and Marine, which sells marine dredged aggregates in the UK and continental Europe and which Bardon was attempting to sell to reduce further its large borrowings. Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said yesterday that negotiations had been terminated, adding that it was not in shareholders' interests to sell the business while continental European construction markets - accounting for 40 per cent of sales - were in recession. Mr Tom was more optimistic about UK and US markets where volume sales and prices of aggregates had improved recently. As a result, he said: '1994 promises to be an appreciably better year.' Group turnover for 1993 increased from Pounds 336m to Pounds 351m. However, following disposals of profitable businesses and reflecting continued pressure on margins, operating profits before exceptional provisions fell from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 28.8m. Losses per share worked through at 12.5p (12.4p). Adjusted for the exceptional items, there were earnings of 1.1p (2.8p). A maintained final dividend of 1.2p makes a same-again 2p total. Following disposals and a Pounds 72m rights issue net debt fell from Pounds 307m to Pounds 233m, representing a reduction in gearing from 89 per cent to 66 per cent. Operating profits in the UK, excluding discontinued operations, fell from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 11.5m with sales volume and prices remaining generally flat last year while costs had increased. On the same basis, US profits increased from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 16.5m reflecting increased construction activity in the north eastern states. COMMENT Bardon would be a good business if it was not for the debts. The company is well placed to take advantage of the construction recovery on both sides of the Atlantic with volumes and margins likely to move further ahead this year. The housing recovery and an upsurge in road orders in the UK since the autumn should underpin domestic sales and earnings this year. The following year may be more difficult with the government expected shortly to announce large cuts in the road programme. Pre-tax profits could reach Pounds 22m this year putting the company on a prospective p/e of 22. Existing shareholders should hold but Bardon looks like it still needs a sale to get the debt down.</p>

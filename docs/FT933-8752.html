			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Joint management for Finnish banks SKOPBANK and the Savings Bank of Finland, the Finnish banks, are to come under joint management in a move to streamline their operations and improve efficiency. The banks have run up heavy losses and are controlled by the Government Guarantee Fund, which has been set up to bail out the country's banking system. Mr Heikki Koivisto, head of the Government Guarantee Fund, said the move would reduce overlaps between the two banks in treasury activities and corporate banking. Skopbank will concentrate on international business, wholesale banking and large corporate clients, while Savings Bank of Finland will concentrate on the personal sector and small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Koivisto denied the reorganisation was a step towards a full merger of the two banks, which have so far received a total of FM32bn (Dollars 5.44bn) in state support. But he said it would assist in the long-term aim of returning them to the private sector. Analysts said the move removed speculation that the banks' activities would be split and sold to other Finnish banks. Savings Bank of Finland was formed last year from a merger of 41 regional savings banks. Skopbank is the central bank of the savings banks.</p>

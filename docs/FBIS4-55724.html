			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Warsaw, 19 May--On 19 May, Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak received Josef Lux, deputy prime minister and  agriculture minister of the Czech Republic, who is in Poland on  a one-day visit. Issues connected with "the intensification of  trade in agricultural and food products between our countries  and the repayment of Polish debts in the Czech Republic" were  among the subjects of the talks, Andrzej Smietanko, the Polish  minister of agriculture, told journalists after the meeting.    The Polish debt in the Czech Republic amounts to  approximately $57 million. At the meeting, it was agreed that  we would be repaying it by investing in areas on the Czech side  of the border. Construction of border crossings and ecology  projects, mainly sewage-treatment plants, are envisaged.    The Polish minister reported on work on agreements on  cooperation in the field of veterinary medicine and plant  protection, as well as an agreement on cooperation between the  Polish and Czech agriculture ministries. [passage omitted]    Lux gave an assurance that land belonging to Polish farmers  but lying on the Czech side of the border and land belonging to  Czech farmers but lying on the Polish side would not become a  subject of tension between the governments. "We will not allow  any border changes," Lux said. "Irrespective of which citizen  owns land in Poland or the Czech Republic, he will be subject to  the law of the country where his land is," he added.    Lux expressed the hope that the law on subsidies of certain  groups of goods that had been adopted by the Sejm "would not  lead to any restrictions in trade between our two countries."</p>

This was reported in an INTERFAX interview on Thursday by  Eduard Khashkayev, a member of the Chechnya cabinet.    In Khashkayev's opinion, the October events in Moscow  resulted from "a whole series of unlawful actions committed by  the Russian leadership, which was opposed by Ruslan Khasbulatov,  who strictly complied with all the provisions of the then  Russian Federation Constitution."    Chechen State Counselor Ruslan Akhtakhanov, who took part in  the conversation with the INTERFAX correspondent, stated that  denying Ruslan Khasbulatov, who is a citizen of Chechnya, the  opportunity to run for election to the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly is regarded by the republic's population as  another violation of human rights by Moscow officialdom.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION TO CONSIDER ELIMINATION OF TWO-DIVISION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> A City Section competition committee on Monday proposed the elimination of the  two-division playoff system for the section's 49 high school football teams,  effective next fall.  </P> <P> Under the plan, proposed at an Interscholastic Athletics Committee meeting, all  teams would play in one division, with 16 teams advancing to a postseason  tournament that would crown one champion.  </P> <P> The IAC is scheduled to vote on the proposal at its next meeting, April 23.  </P> <P> Since 1976, the City has crowned 4-A Division and 3-A Division football  champions, but the system has been criticized because of the size of the  divisions. Currently, 16 teams compete in the 4-A and 12 qualify for the  playoffs.  </P> <P> City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness has called the system a sham, saying it  merely isolates the schools -- Carson, Banning, Dorsey -- that no one wants to  play. Nevertheless, he expects some schools to resist the change.  </P> <P> "It would be foolish not to expect an outcry," he said. "But is it a viable,  legitimate division? Either the divisions have to be of equal size or we should  do away with the divisions." JOHN LYNCH  </P></p>

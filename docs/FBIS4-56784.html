			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia via </F> telephone from Accra, Ghana -- live]    [Excerpt] Good morning from Accra, Ghana, to all our  listeners. I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel  Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to  participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson  Mandela tomorrow.    Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by  his  friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at  the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international  airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house  and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral  and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation.  I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the  South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South  Africa is also a main point of their conversation.    Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over  the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in  office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the  sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when  he carried out a broad program of activities that included  participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province.    The two countries have also adopted, at different  international forums, common positions on just causes, when  firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to  great enemy pressures.    Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the  spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens  our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young  Ghanaians are studying in Cuba.    Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban  personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the  delegation members reported on the main activities taking place  in our country.    We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where  the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's  inauguration. Many officials here in Ghana said Fidel could not  be absent from such a significant event in South Africa. The  Cuban ambassador to Ghana told us this, and that the presence of  the Commander in Chief in South Africa is greatly appreciated.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD;  </P> <P> BUBKA REGAINS INDOOR VAULT RECORD AT 19-9 1/4  </P> <P> Sergei Bubka of the Soviet Union regained the world indoor pole vault record  Saturday, then failed three times at clearing 20 feet in the Yomiuri-Chitose  track and field meet.  </P> <P> Bubka, using the same pole as the one he used in winning the gold medal at the  1988 Seoul Olympics, cleared 19 feet 9 1/4 inches on his third and final  attempt in front of 11,000 fans.  </P> <P> Bubka, the world record-holder at 19-10 1/2 and the two-time world outdoor  champion, bettered the previous world indoor record of 19-9 set by compatriot  Rodion Gataullin Feb. 4 at Gomel, USSR.  </P> <P> "Today's performance was not so good technically, but my physical condition was  good," Bubka said. "I also like this arena."  </P> <P> Although Bubka failed to clear 20 feet, he said: "If all conditions are fit for  me, it will be possible to clear 6.20 meters (20-4 1/4 this season). I did it  during training."  </P> <P> He will not have the chance to reach the barrier in next month's World Indoor  Championships at Budapest, Hungary, because he is skipping the meet.  </P> <P> American Tim Bright cleared 18-8 1/4 to finish second.  </P> <P> Other men's winners included Americans Joe DeLoach in the 60-meter dash, Danny  Everett in the 400 meters, Mike Powell in the long jump and Willie Banks in the  triple jump, and Sweden's Patrik Sjoberg in the high jump.  </P> <P> Women's winners included Evelyn Ashford in the 60 and Tamara Bykova of the  Soviet Union in the high jump.  </P> <P> DeLoach, who defeated Carl Lewis in winning the gold medal in the 200 meters at  Seoul, won the 60 in 6.60 seconds.  </P> <P> "I was satisfied with my second career race in the 60 meters," DeLoach said. "I  was aggressive at the start."  </P> <P> He said he will focus on the 200 at the World Championships.  </P> <P> Everett, a bronze medalist at Seoul, led all the way in winning the 400 in  48.97.  </P> <P> "I'm satisfied with the result," Everett said of his first indoor competition  this season.  </P> <P> Powell, a silver medalist at Seoul, leaped 26-4 1/2 in winning the long jump.  </P> <P> Banks, the world record-holder at 58-11 1/2, won the triple jump at 53-2 1/4.  </P> <P> "My (physical) condition was good, but for some reason I couldn't jump well,"  Banks said.  </P> <P> Sjoberg's winning height in the high jump was 7-4 1/2.  </P> <P> Ashford, winner of three gold medals and one silver in the last two Olympics,  won the women's 60 in 7.27, beating Jamaican Grace Jackson, who was second in  7.41.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to break my best time of 10.71 in the 100 meters and eventually  beat (world record-holder) Florence Griffith Joyner," Ashford said.  </P> <P> Bykova won the women's high jump at 6-4 1/4, and American Louise Ritter, the  Olympic gold medalist, finished fourth at 6-0 3/4.  </P> <P> "I did expect to win today," Ritter said. "I was quite disappointed. It was the  worst result this season after eight competitions. I had a bad stomach this  morning. I think it's a virus."  </P></p>

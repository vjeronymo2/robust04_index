			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Field rises 14.7% to Pounds 13.7m - Signs of economic recovery begin to show through Field Group, the carton maker which went public in July last year, raised underlying pro forma pre-tax profits by 14.7 per cent to Pounds 13.7m in the year to April 3, helped by an acquisition. The gain was in spite of pricing pressures and scant market growth. In 1993 profits were depressed by a property write-down of Pounds 1.95m and a Pounds 1.25m charge for the termination of hedging instruments from the management buy-out. Without adjusting for the flotation and including these exceptional items, pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 8.95m. The shares, floated at 250p, rose 7p to 250p yesterday. Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said Field had outperformed the market and raised its UK market share from 15.4 per cent to 16.6 per cent. He expected further rationalisation in the market, with a number of middle-sized players currently up for sale. Field could be interested in buying at the right price, but preferred expansion in northern Europe, he said. Mr Gilchrist added that pressure from supermarkets had kept down prices of packaging for foods, detergents and tissues. However, these accounted for only a third of group turnover. Although cautious on current year prospects, the chief executive said there were now signs of economic recovery and he expected continued progress helped by Pounds 20m of capital expenditure in the last two years. Group sales rose 11.4 per cent to Pounds 155m, including Pounds 6.63m from the Boots Print business acquired just after the float. Operating profits, before exceptionals, rose by 11.7 per cent to Pounds 14.1m, including Pounds 550,000 from acquisitions. Mr David Nussbaum, finance director, said that like-for-like growth, excluding the acquisition, exchange rate movements and allowing for 1993 being a 53 week period, was 8.1 per cent. Operating margins were unchanged at 9.1 per cent. The interest charge fell from Pounds 646,000 to Pounds 357,000, with the group ending the year with net cash of Pounds 4.2m. A lower tax rate, of 22 1/2 per cent, boosted earnings per share by 27 per cent to 17.9p, before exceptionals. Mr Nussbaum said the tax rate would rise to around 30 per cent over the next four or five years. A final dividend of 4.75p is proposed to give a total of 7.05p, up 10.2 per cent on the notional 6.4p for 1993. Mr Gilchrist stressed the rise reflected the strong balance sheet and low tax rate, and this sort of dividend increase could not be expected every year.</p>

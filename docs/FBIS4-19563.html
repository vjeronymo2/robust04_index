			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ritva Liisa Snellman: "Over a Million Finns </F> Driven Into Short-Term Jobs; Researcher: Situation Is Permanent,  Uniform Wage Society Is Breaking Down"]    [Text] Rovaniemi -- According to Asko Suikkanen, assistant  professor of social policy at the University of Lapland, the  situation of over a million working-age people in the labor  market has completely changed in the 1990's.    This group has had to adjust to short-term, uncertain jobs.  Meanwhile, there have been unemployment periods of varying  length. Income consists sometimes of wages, sometimes of income  transfers, or sometimes of work performed in gray markets.    A diminishing group of people in the export industry or  firms  successfully operating in domestic markets enjoy income from  secure wages.    When the Labor Ministry announces that there were 524,300  jobless at the end of February, it is only slicing a momentary  random sample from the existing number. In fact, over a million  Finns applied for work last year at the Employment Office. Of  that number 768,834 were unemployed at least part of the time.    In Suikkanen's opinion, it no longer pays to talk of those  who are working or those who are not. Instead of two groups,  four groups that completely differ from one another have arisen:  the lucky ones, those who live in uncertainty, those who have  been ousted from the labor market, and the newcomers who are  waiting for an opportunity.    So the labor market has changed, but social security and  social policy have not.    "Our social security system is designed to protect the  interests of people who have jobs that pay a regular wage during  periods of illness or of brief unemployment. It simply does not  take into account the circumstances of other groups."    Suikkanen does not think that an upswing will alter the  situation; on the contrary, it has become a permanent one.    He would also revise income transfers to be flexible and  simple. Since people's situations vary, the same solution does  not work for everyone. Laying people off should be avoided, and  those who have been laid off should be put back to work.    Suikkanen suggests that one way of doing this would be to  divide the work the way the Danes, for example, do: Three local  employees and one unemployed worker share the work equally.  Wages and per diem allowances are added up and each of them gets  one-fourth of the total. Each gets every fourth week off.    There are already signs in Europe of a willingness to share  the decreasing number of jobs with several other workers. At the  Volkswagen Corporation, for example, working hours were  shortened and wages lowered for three years so that 30,000 jobs  could be preserved during these years.    Suikkanen thinks that the whole uniform wage society will  begin to break down unless the changes are interfered with  through social policy measures. The next parliamentary elections  will indicate whether citizens who have been shunted to the  sidelines have begun to revolt. People's attitude toward taxes  has already changed: Business firms and households' delinquent  taxes have increased.    Uncertainty and reduced wage income are affecting everyone's  life. Starting a family is postponed, renting one's home is  becoming widespread, and pension accrual is decreasing.    New life-styles have now come into being. People do  volunteer  work or fill the gap left between wage work and social security  by doing odd jobs in gray markets.    The drop in income is also apparent as households'  indebtedness: People are not always able to pay bills that are  part of everyday life on time.    "Maybe we won't recognize the fact that the change is  permanent before the end of the decade. Most of the influential  research institutes still believe that economic cycles will  patch things up. Only from 10 to 20 researchers are trying to  talk of new solutions to the problem."</p>

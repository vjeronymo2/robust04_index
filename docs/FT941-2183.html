			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Denmark maps out the route for telecoms privatisations - Andrew Adonis and Hilary Barnes on Tele Danmark's prospects Telecommunications shares have been outperforming their stock exchanges worldwide. But Tele Danmark, the Danish state operator whose privatisation was announced yesterday, is likely to prove particularly attractive to institutional investors. It is partly the luck of the draw. Tele Danmark is the first of a string of EU privatisation candidates. With only the UK and Spain currently boasting large operators with private shareholdings, investor choice is limited. State operators in the Netherlands, Greece, Germany and Italy are following behind, as are numerous operators outside the EU. As the numbers grow, so will investor discrimination. Tele Danmark - an operator formed by the merger of five regional telephone companies - can nonetheless withstand fairly exacting comparisons. It is near the top of the EU's efficiency league, benefiting from its regional inheritance. Although each of the constituent companies had a regional monopoly, they competed fiercely to demonstrate to the public that they were the best and the cheapest. With 59 exchange lines per 100 people, Denmark is ahead of the rest of the EU. Tele Danmark's cellular mobile networks also have an impressive record. The company operates two mobile phone systems, the Nordic Mobile Telephone service, where it has exclusive rights to Danish traffic, and a GSM service, where it claims a 60 per cent market share in competition with a second licence holder, Dansk Mobil Telefon. Denmark boasts nearly 50 cellular subscribers per 1,000 people, against barely 30 in the UK and fewer still in France and Germany. Tele Danmark is anxious not to be submerged by larger telecoms operators as European markets open up, and appears to be succeeding better than many of the EU's smaller operators. It has helped establish optical fibre links between Copenhagen and St Petersburg, Copenhagen and Poland and south through Poland to the Czech border. It is also developing cellular networks in east Europe, with a 16 per cent share in mobile phone network under construction in Hungary and Ukraine and 20 per cent in a service in Lithuania. Tele Danmark reported a turnover in 1993 of DKr16.29bn (Dollars 2.45bn) compared with DKr15.65bn in 1992, and made a net profit of DKr1.56bn, up from DKr916m in 1992. According to the prospectus, about DKr11.4bn of the privatisation proceeds will be used to settle pension commitments and repay debts to pension funds and for other expenses. On the assumption that the issue raises DKr18bn, about DKr6.5bn will be left to strengthen group equity capital, which was DKr8.7bn at the end of last year, when total assets were DKr26.1bn. The success of the sale will have a bearing on others planned. 'This is the road map for a string of other privatisations,' said Mr Scott Mead, head of European communications group at Goldman Sachs, one of the global co-ordinators of the privatisation. 'All the EU's smaller states will be looking to see how international investors take to it, and what happens to the company afterwards.'</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The 150-year-old rush to live in the Golden State has swelled the population to  28.3 million, making one of every 11 people in the nation a Californian,  researchers in Sacramento said. The population estimate for the fiscal year  ending last July 1, up a record 662,000 over the year before, places California  more than 10 million people ahead of the next largest state, New York, with  17.8 million, said officials in the state Finance Department's demographic  research unit. "We just have too much to offer everyone, I guess," said John  Malson, a manager in the unit. The migration into California outstripped the  number who left, adding 372,000 to the population and accounting for 56% of the  overall increase. The other 44% in population growth was due to births totaling  504,000 and deaths 215,000.  </P></p>

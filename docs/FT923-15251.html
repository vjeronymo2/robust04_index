			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Gloom in Japan deepens PESSIMISM about growth prospects for Japan's economy is spreading among Japanese research institutes, many of which have lowered forecasts in the past two days. Nomura Research, one of the gloomiest, said yesterday the government would have to spend an extra Y9,000bn (Pounds 38.3bn) on public works if the forecast 3.5 per cent growth in the fiscal year ending next March was to be achieved. The governing Liberal Democratic party has proposed a programme for Y6,000bn-Y7,000bn in extra public spending, although the Finance Ministry opposed it. According to Nomura additional spending of Y5,000bn, along with a 0.5 per cent cut in the official discount rate to 3.25 per cent, would result in just 2 per cent growth. 'We cannot be optimistic about future sales trends among corporations because of difficulties in exports, continued caution in capital spending plans, and obvious reduction in household consumption,' it says. Yamaichi Research and Wako Research have reduced growth forecasts to 2.7 and 3.0 per cent respectively. Yamaichi expects private sector demand to rise this year by just 1.4 per cent, compared to 2.0 per cent last year. Corporate capital spending is expected to decline by 1 per cent, after last year's 3 per cent rise. The themes have also been echoed by Sumitomo Research, Mitsui Trust and Banking, and Nippon Trust Bank, which have lowered growth forecasts to between 2.6 and 2.9 per cent. Critical to all the forecasts is the timing and size of an expected government supplementary budget, as well as the timing of inventory adjustment as manufacturers reduce production to clear excess stocks of unsold goods.</p>

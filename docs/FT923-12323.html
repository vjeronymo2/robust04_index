			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Transport systems must be maximised, not penalised Sir, Significantly increasing charges to road users will not, as suggested in your leader ('No revolution for British Rail', July 15), bring about a rail revolution. That revolution will only occur when railways offer their customers, both passenger and freight, efficient, reliable and economic services. Obviously while every realistic opportunity for moving more freight by rail must be pursued, the prospects for substantially increasing the amount carried is limited. In practice increasing road charges will simply raise transport and industrial costs for the vast majority of companies who have no alternative but to use road. Fuel duties sufficient actively to discourage private motoring would have to be so high as to be politically unacceptable. The transport debate must be focused on maximising the productivity of our transport systems, not on the ways in which transport can be restricted and penalised.

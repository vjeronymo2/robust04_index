			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Van sales check fall in commercial vehicles SALES OF new commercial vehicle were 5.3 per cent lower last month than in February last year. This is the smallest year-on-year fall since the industry started its slide into recession in the last quarter of 1989. New vehicle registrations fell to 16,307 from 17,214 a year earlier, according to figures the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Sales were boosted by large fleet orders for small vans won by Ford and Vauxhall, however. Sales of light commercial vehicles up to 1.8 tonnes gross vehicle weight, which include Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra vans, were 4.3 per cent higher last month than a year before. By contrast sales of medium vans last month remained depressed and were still 10.2 per cent lower than a year ago. Truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) fell again by 7.8 per cent. Commercial vehicle sales have been falling for 29 consecutive months, with the industry suffering the steepest fall into recession since the Second World War. New commercial vehicle sales of 32,984 for the first two months were 11.7 per cent lower than a year earlier. In the past three years the UK commercial vehicle market has shrunk by half and sales in the first two months were 49.1 per cent lower than the 64,802 achieved in the first two months of 1989. Truck sales of 4,660 in the first two months of the year were 62.5 per cent down from the 12,413 achieved in the same period three years ago. Rover is the biggest loser in the small-van market. Its sales in the first two months of the year were 45.5 per cent lower than a year ago. Rover still held an 8.4 per cent share of the small van segment, but it is expected to withdraw from the light commercial vehicle market when its present Maestro van is phased out. Ford and Vauxhall already each control more than a third of small-van sales in the UK. Volkswagen is gaining ground strongly in the medium-van segment following the launch last year of its Transporter van range, while Leyland DAF has increased its van sales by 15.3 per cent in the first two months this year.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS                       JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1992  ------------------------------------------------------------------                   Volume    Volume    Share (%)    Share (%)                   (Units)  Change (%) Jan-Feb 92   Jan-Feb 91 Total Market*     32,984    -11.7       100.0       100.0 Imports           11,920    -11.6        36.1        36.1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total             10,970     -6.0       100.0       100.0 Imports            2,223    -11.3        20.3        21.5 Ford               4,256     +6.2        38.8        34.4 Vauxhall (GM)      3,860     +5.7        35.2        31.3 Rover                916    -45.5         8.4        14.4 Peugeot (incl.       721    -14.6         6.6         7.2 Citroen) Renault              529    +15.3         4.8         3.9  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Medium Vans (1.81 - 3.5 tonnes) Total             13,767    -16.7       100.0       100.0 Imports            5,467    -15.6        39.7        39.2 Ford               6,128    -23.8        44.5        48.6 Leyland DAF (DAF)  2,146    +15.3        15.6        11.3 Volkswagen           954    +22.9         6.9         4.7 Renault              834     -0.5         6.1         5.1 Peugeot (incl.       645    -29.7         4.7         5.6 Citroen &amp; Talbot Vauxhall (GM)        623    -22.8         4.5         4.9 Mercedes-Benz        612    -29.3         4.5         5.2 Nissan               499    -40.4         3.6         5.1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Trucks (over 3.5 tonnes) Total              4,660    -16.1       100.0       100.0 Imports            1,956    -19.7        42.0        43.8 Leyland DAF (DAF)  1,048    -14.7        22.5        22.1 Iveco group**(Fiat)1,016    -20.0        21.8        22.9 Mercedes-Benz        837    -12.5        18.0        17.2 Volvo                552     -4.8        11.9        10.4 Renault              207    -36.5         4.4         5.9 MAN                  204    -33.1         4.4         5.5 Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes) Total              2,525     -5.6       100.0       100.0 Leyland DAF (DAF)    470    -22.2        18.6        22.6 Volvo                460     -3.0        18.2        17.7 Mercedes-Benz        383    +43.5        15.2        10.0 Iveco group**(Fiat)  321     -6.4        12.7        12.8 Scania               292     -6.7        11.6        11.7 ERF                  257     +2.8        10.2         9.3  ------------------------------------------------------------------ *includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles. **includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and industry estimates.  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

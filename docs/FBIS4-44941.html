			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Subrata Sen: "Amendment Likely To Clip Seshan's </F> Powers"]    [Text] New Delhi, April 25--In a move apparently aimed at  clipping the wings of the Chief Election Commissioner, Mr T.N.  Seshan, the Government has decided to bring a Constitution  amendment Bill during the current session of Parliament. The  Bill is intended to make the functioning of the multi-member  Election Commission well-defined and effective.    The draft of the proposed Constitution amendment Bill has  already been finalized by the Union Law Ministry and is expected  to be circulated to leaders of all political parties soon.  Besides amending the Constitution, the Union Government is also  contemplating changing the Representation of People's Act [RPA],  1950, regarding the definition of the term, "ordinarily  resident," which makes it mandatory for a Rajya Sabha member to  belong to a State from where he is elected.    The proposed Constitution amendment regarding the  functioning  of the Election Commission consists of three points:     -  Equate other Election Commissioners with the Chief  Election Commissioner in the matter of their removal from  office    -  Provide for the conduct of the business of the Election  Commission    -  Provide for a prohibition as to the holding of office  by members of the commission after ceasing to be such members.     By these amendments, the Union Government wanted to equate  the other Election Commissioners with the Chief Election  Commissioner by making their appointments to last a full term,  unless nullified by an impeachment motion in Parliament.    The business of the Election Commission would provide  clear-cut guidelines regarding the functioning of the Election  Commissioners, who, after the amendment, could act as a check  and balance against any unilateral decision taken by the CEC  [Chief Election Commissioner].    The amendment to the RPA, regarding the redefining of  "ordinarily resident" status for the Rajya Sabha members was  necessitated as several members of the ruling party, including  some Ministers, were facing inquiries by the Election Commission  on the basis of this clause in the RPA.    That the Government has taken a decision on a Constitution  amendment Bill regarding the functioning of the Election  Commission was indicated today to some leaders of the Opposition  parties, although informally, by the Parliamentary Affairs  Minister, Mr V.C. Shukla, during an informal luncheon meeting  convened by the Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr Shivraj Patil.    The Opposition members, specially those from the Left,  objected to the Government's decision to redefine the ordinary  resident status by changing the RPA. They, however, agreed to  the proposed Constitution amendment Bill on the functioning of  the EC, provided the Government also went in for one or more  Bills to have a comprehensive electoral reform.    Sources said that the Opposition parties did not want that a  signal be sent that Parliament was eager to clip the wings of Mr  Seshan by bringing in a Constitution amendment.    The Opposition parties were also of the opinion that while a  Bill pertaining to electoral reforms was welcome during the  current session of Parliament, the process should involve all  the major political parties in the country.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TIS THE SEASON TO BE TOLERANT -- ISN'T IT?  </P> <P> While I sympathize with the feelings of isolation felt by many Jewish parents  and teachers at this time of the year ("Parents Wrestle with December's  Dilemma," Dec. 17), I must remind them that one of the themes of Hanukkah and  other Jewish holidays is tolerance of different beliefs.  </P> <P> Instead of making calls of complaint to the Jewish Federation, why isn't that  parent making latkes, playing dreidel and teaching her child's class about  Hanukkah?  </P> <P> I have never felt guilty or wanted my children to feel guilty about enjoying  the holidays of other religions. The more we know about the beliefs of others,  the more we understand each other.  </P> <P> VENIDA KORDA  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

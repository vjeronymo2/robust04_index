			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Warning of terror if Bosnia is split: Ganic urges international community to reject plan to partition his country BOSNIAN Vice President Ejup Ganic yesterday warned that Europe would face a wave of terrorism if it backed a partition of Bosnia. In an interview in the besieged capital of Sarajevo, Mr Ganic painted a picture of a Lebanon-style conflict that could result in a campaign of violence if the international community abandoned a united Bosnia. Mr Ganic and President Alija Izetbegovic boycotted yesterday's meeting of the Bosnian collective presidency to discuss the partition proposed by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and his Croat counterpart Mr Mate Boban. Bosnia's Moslem leaders have rejected the partition because it would 'legitimise ethnic cleansing' and would confine the Moslems to reservations in economically unviable micro-states. Mr Ganic predicted the war would last for 10-15 years. He lashed out at Britain and France, saying Bosnia's Moslems had 'naively' believed they would win backing from both countries. He said the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group, which has been decimated by the war, were the victims of Europe's prejudices against Islam. 'I don't want to be responsible for terrorism, but it will happen, especially in Europe. I don't want to participate in that,' he said. Mr Izetbegovic is fighting for political survival after a challenge from Mr Fikret Abdic, the third Moslem representative on Bosnia's 10-member rotating leadership. Moslem and other United Nations members have forced a public debate, probably to be held on Tuesday, on whether to lift the UN arms embargo on Bosnia and allow air strikes on Serb artillery. A draft resolution on that approach, also favoured by the US but rejected by the European Community, was approved on Thursday night for debate. The US position was unclear, though the resolution was designed to cater to President Bill Clinton's wish to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems. Sarajevo radio yesterday reported an upsurge of fighting in Zepce, Zavidovici and Maglaj, towns north of Sarajevo. It also said there were renewed clashes west of the capital. In an attempt to stave off the carve-up of Bosnia, Moslem-led Bosnian forces are trying to gain control of key towns to link up their enclaves. In Belgrade, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic cemented his hold over what remains of Yugoslavia, now comprising Serbia and its tiny ally Montenegro, when the federal parliament elected Mr Zoran Lilic as president. 'This is the sort of president that Milosevic conceived. Lilic is his Serbian puppet sitting on top of the two-republic federation,' said a western diplomat based in Belgrade. As president, Mr Lilic will also be the supreme commander of the Yugoslav army, which ensures that Mr Milosevic will have total control over the armed forces.</p>

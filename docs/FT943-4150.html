			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Stock exchange urged to diversify Stock exchanges which offer only one method of share trading, such as London, may need to diversify their range of dealing techniques or face a loss of business to new low-cost trading mechanisms, an article in the London Stock Exchange's Quarterly Review says. 'An exchange which offers only a single trading mechanism may lose out at a time when alternative investment strategies are flourishing and trading needs exhibit growing variation,' the article says. The article, by Mr Bruce Weber of New York University, does not purport to be the view of the exchange itself. But many of its members, including some on the board, have been pressing it to accommodate an 'order-matching' system alongside its existing marketmaking system. However, London's market-making firms - some of its wealthiest and most powerful - oppose erosion of the system. An order-matching system simply matches the orders of a large group of buyers and sellers with each other while a marketmaking system designates securities firms who agree to buy and sell the shares of particular companies in large quantities in all market conditions. Earlier this year the board approved funding to build the hardware necessary for an order-matching system, although it agreed to put off any decision on whether it should ultimately be built until the end of next year. Some board members fear competition from a new start-up order matching dealing system, Tradepoint, which is applying to become a regulated investment exchange in London. The article concludes that 'an exchange's best response may be to pre-empt these alternatives by offering a range or linked trading mechanisms including competing market maker quotes, limit order facilities and periodic crossing.' In his article Mr Weber says the drive towards order-matching systems, which has moved significant volumes of business away from the New York Stock Exchange, was prompted largely by the growing popularity of so-called 'passive' investment management techniques. These require investors to compile a portfolio of stocks whose performance mimics that of a particular index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and does not require the manager to buy or sell significant positions in a particular security at any particular time. Thus, the immediacy of trading offered by market makers is unnecessary, saving investors money. However, the article points out that in some instances dealing costs through order- matching systems are higher than those of market making.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> FELDHAUS WILL VIE FOR CITY COUNCIL SEAT  </P> <P> Planning Commissioner Frank E. Feldhaus Jr. has announced that he will run for  City Council in November.  </P> <P> Feldhaus, 61, a longtime Anaheim resident and businessman, is the first  candidate to challenge the three incumbents who are expected to seek  reelection.  </P> <P> A planning commissioner since 1987, Feldhaus said he wanted to get a head start  on campaigning to have time to canvass the city. He criticized candidates who  try to reach voters through mailers and other advertisements.  </P> <P> "That's buying your way into the council," Feldhaus said. "That's not what I  want to do."  </P> <P> Though he will wait until later in the campaign to detail his goals and  priorities for the city, he said personnel increases at the Police Department  will be a main theme.  </P> <P> The terms of council members Irv Pickler and Miriam Kaywood and Mayor Fred  Hunter expire in November, and the three are likely to provide tough  competition for Feldhaus.  </P> <P> Allan B. Hughes, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, praised  Feldhaus' years of involvement in the city's business community and said the  chamber's recently formed political action committee may consider endorsing  him.  </P> <P> Feldhaus estimates that a successful campaign will cost between $175,000 and  $200,000, adding that he is willing to contribute about $25,000 to launch the  effort. His first fund-raiser last week drew about 60 supporters; they donated  about $8,000 to the campaign, he said. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

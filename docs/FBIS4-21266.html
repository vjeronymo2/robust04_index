It is the Blockade Project. The idea is to uncover at  every level the activity of drug traffickers who find the region  to be a splendid home for their business. The "blockade" is  subdivided into four subprojects and will utilize a vast  information network involving the Armed Forces of Brazil and its  bordering countries, federal agencies, petroleum distributors,  aircraft monitoring systems, and a regional contingent of 200  federal police agents. The entire program has one goal: to  remove Brazil from the list of cocaine transit countries by  1996. That list, which is drawn up by the United Nations, also  includes Venezuela, Brazil's partner in the project. According  to the United Nations, neighboring Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia  form the team of producers. The Brazilian Government wants to  beef up the fight in cooperation with those countries and  increase the barriers to trafficking activities. "From now on,  it will be very hard for drugs to reach the consuming center,"  says PF/AM [Amazonas Federal Police] Superintendent Mauro  Sposito. The amount of money to be spent on the operation was  not revealed. In Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira at the beginning of  this week, Sposito participated in the Sixth Military Exchange  Meeting between the Armies of Brazil and Venezuela with only one  task in mind: to discuss the "blockade's" strategies and explain  them to the military. In this exclusive interview with A  CRITICA, Mauro Sposito said he was excited about the future. He  is convinced that this time the drug traffickers will have to  find new alternatives for keeping their business going. "For our  part, we promise to extend the barriers and put those people out  of business," he announced.    Vieira: How is the Federal Police Department going  to participate in the exchange between the Brazilian and  Venezuelan Armies?    Sposito: The problem of drug trafficking is one of  the most serious problems in this region. We border on producing  countries. Brazil and Venezuela are both regarded as transit  countries, they are faced with the same difficulties, and,  because of that, we have agreed that exchanging information is  valuable in order for us to engage in uniform repressive action.    Vieira: What activities are under way?    Sposito: We discovered that the producing center  for refined cocaine in Colombia was shipping a small part of its  production down the Amazon River, whose waters are  international. The traffickers were crossing Amazonas and even  using Brazilian ports to export cocaine hidden inside other  kinds of merchandise (black pepper, wood, cupuacu, and  pineapple). We closed off the Solimoes River in September 1993.  Since then, all boats using the river have been inspected. The  barrier relies on the element of surprise and can be set up  anywhere on the Solimoes. At the same time, we have been keeping  track of repression activities in Colombia, and that has enabled  us to tighten our controls. You see, all the laboratories they  have discovered up to now -- over the past three years -- have  been located in the Colombian Amazon Region, an area which, like  our own, escapes control by the authorities. Large areas with  few inhabitants and no roads facilitate activities by drug  traffickers. Since November, radio operations have been  monitored through the Monitinga and Monifer Project. The first  of those acronyms stands for Monitoring of Radio Frequency  Communications in Tabatinga, and the second stands for  Monitoring of Radio Frequency Communications in Tefe. Although  new, this project shows that we are on the right track because  we have an advantage over the drug traffickers. Another project  that is now in the process of being set up is CAPA (Aircraft  Fueling and Landing Control). The traffickers use small  airplanes to carry drugs. We are not in a position to police the  airspace. So we have started monitoring the flying range of  those aircraft as they leave Colombia for some consuming center  and need to refuel. CAPA is being introduced gradually because  it requires coordination with the Ministry of Aeronautics and  with petroleum distributors (Petrobras, Shell, and Esso). The  Brazilian Government will soon be using various means of control  to neutralize the traffickers' activities.    Vieira: What are the results of that range of  repressive actions?    Sposito: The entire operation is causing  traffickers to seek alternatives for getting their drugs to the  big consuming centers. In Belem, for example, which is one of  our main information gathering centers, we arrested "Cerquinho"  (Daniel Parada). A number of big shots were arrested that year  because of the work under way.    Vieira: Is exchange with Colombia complicated?    Sposito: No. The institutions there are serious.  There may be individuals within the institutions who are not  doing their jobs, but that is normal in any area of activity. In  our case, the contact is not personal; it takes place through  the Federal Police in the two countries. In that connection,  support by the Colombian PF [Federal Police] has been decisive  in ensuring the success of operations.    Vieira: How is the cocaine market divided up?    Sposito: Colombia is the world's largest cocaine  producer. It is said that 60 percent of its GDP [gross domestic  product] comes from drug transactions. The United States is the  biggest consumer, followed by Europe. Consumption in Brazil is  still in its beginning stages and is concentrated mainly in Sao  Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Most of the consumption in Manaus is  not of cocaine but of coca base, which by the way is a bigger  poison than the other poison -- it is mixed with sulfuric acid.    Vieira: With the traditional corridors blockaded,  what other routes would the traffickers use?    Sposito: They have to get the goods to the  consuming centers. We have to intercept them. They are currently  using Venezuela as a camp; they may increase their shipments  through Colombia's west coast. One thing is certain: the drug  traffickers will seek other alternatives. I can guarantee you  that they are very worried. We have even seized goods coming  from Bolivia because Colombia was unable to send the product  here.    Vieira: What other actions does the PF intend to  take to neutralize the drug traffickers?    Sposito: We are discussing a project to be carried  out in cooperation with Suframa [Manaus Free Trade Zone  Superintendency]. To combat the smuggling that has been going on  in the western Amazon Region, that agency is going to establish  a number of controls. We are working with it on that. Suframa is  interested in controlling the entry of goods, while the Federal  Police are interested in controlling what leaves. We are  combining our interests. We are providing Suframa with police  power, and it, in turn, will help us financially with that  activity. There are only two ways to enter this part of the  country: by river, meaning the Amazon River, and by land,  meaning Highway BR-364. We are going to blockade the highway at  Vilhena in Roraima and Obidos in Para.    Vieira: How many men are involved in that project?    Sposito: We have mobilized around 60 men. That is  not enough. To implement the plan in the western Amazon Region,  I need 200 men combating the drug traffic. Our goal is to  complete all phases of the project by 1996.    Vieira: What is the Blockade Project?    Sposito: We have four subdivisions within the  project. They are the Blockade Project proper, which consists of  a river police detachment based in Tabatinga and the river  police detachment based in Manaus; Rescon, or Colombian Report,  which monitors repressive operations where the problem starts --  in Colombia -- so we can decide what actions to take here; CAPA,  which is in the process of being set up; and the Monifer and  Monitinga Project. Besides those four components of the main  Blockade Project, we have an additional project called the  "closing of the Amazon Region." It will be implemented in  cooperation with Suframa. This project will affect 12  localities: Obidos, Vilhena, Ananindeua, Pacaraima, the B/V-8  boundary mark, Bonfim, Cruzeiro do Sul, Epitaciolandia in  Brasileia, the Abuna River, Humaita, Manaus, and Tabatinga.    Vieira: How do Peru and Bolivia fit into this  picture?    Sposito: Action is integrated. Our intention is  that the work will have comprehensive effects. Peru is the  world's biggest producer of coca base. In other words, Peru  produces coca base and sends it to Colombia, where the product  is refined and exported to the consuming centers. Peru and  Colombia are responsible for 80 percent of all the cocaine in  the world, while Bolivia produces 20 percent. The Blockade  Project will gradually affect all the countries along the  border. It will enter Bolivia the moment we close off the Abuna  and Vilhena. By closing the Abuna, we will shut off access  through Madeira/Mamore. In that way, we will also put obstacles  in the way of the traffic moving in the opposite direction,  which carries the chemicals necessary for refining the cocaine.  Those chemicals come from abroad, enter Brazilian territory, and  then arrive in Colombia and Bolivia.    Vieira: What is the goal behind this work by the  Federal Police?    Sposito: The United Nations classifies countries  as producing countries, transit countries, and consuming  countries. The producing countries are Peru, Colombia, and  Bolivia. Ecuador is no longer included on that list. Transit  countries are those which, like Brazil, have structures, road  networks, river systems, and airports that make it easy for  traffickers to get around inside the country and alter the goods  to come up with the final product. We want to free Brazil of the  stigma of being a "drug transit country." Brazil will be off  that list by 1996. That is what we are working toward.</p>

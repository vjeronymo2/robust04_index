			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Didier Girault: "ECU 20 Billion for a European </F> Asynchronous Transfer Mode Network"]    [Text] Research is being carried out into plans for an  immense European multimedia network. Its infrastructure will be  based on ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] technology and will  use fiber optics.    The leaders of the member states of the European Union have  just voted in favor of adopting measures recommended in Jacques  Delors' white paper to ensure that Europe is better prepared to  "enter the information era, a transformation comparable to the  first industrial revolution."    At the heart of the project is the setting up of a  high-speed  communications network. According to figures in the white  paper, its installation would cost ECU20 billion over the  1994-99 period. In spite of our insistence we were unable to  find out what this ECU20 billion would cover in practice, as all  the directors concerned were busy in Brussels. We only know  that this network should use ATM technology and fiber optics.  Its installation should be a godsend for European suppliers of  ATM equipment such as scramblers, concentrators, and access  networks.    The first stage in this project would be to set up  fiber-optic infrastructures; in this field France is the most  advanced country in the Union.    The spin-offs from this project should be at least as  important as the project itself. For example, the white paper's  insistence on the creation of information services should result  in the use of numerous database servers. As a parallel  development, impetus would automatically be given to the  widespread use of multimedia equipment (videophones, pay TV,  multimedia PC's, storage media). In general, the creation of  the European information network should boost progress on the  European telecommunications services markets, currently worth  ECU84 billion per year with annual growth of 8 percent, and in  telecommunications equipment (ECU26 billion and 4 percent  growth).    The major problem to be solved by those taking part in the  program is apparently that of network interoperability. This  should, however, be helped by the opening up of telephony  markets in Union countries in 1998.  <H5>  Emphasis on Services </H5>   Thanks to the implementation of European information  networks  allowing the transmission of data, voice, and images, access to  huge databases will be assured and telecommuting will be  promoted. This implementation will be accompanied by the  creation of new services, which in itself will generate new jobs  as happened in France with the minitel, which was behind the  creation of 350,000 new jobs in the service sector.    In voting for this project, representing an overall cost  (equipment, services, and applications) of ECU150 billion over  10 years and ECU67 billion in the 1994-99 period, the leaders of  the Union countries have shown their willingness to keep Europe  at the forefront of technology. The project to which they have  given their support corresponds to the super information highway  program dear to Bill Clinton and Al Gore (an overall investment  of ECU85 billion), and to the equivalent Japanese project  supported by Tokyo as part of its economic revival plan.    A task force working under a mandate from the European  Council will identify the consecutive steps to be taken, draw up  a timetable, and study the deployment of resources. It should  report to the president of the European Council on 31 March  1994, so that work can begin by mid-1994, following the approval  by the European Council.  <H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5> <H5>  Proposed Trans-European Telecommunications Networks </H5>   The total investment involved for the networks and services  described below is ECU67 billion.  <H5>  Advanced Interconnected Networks </H5>     -  Installation of  high-speed communications networks: This will require an  investment of ECU20 billion over the 1994-99 period. It is  deemed to be necessary for the development of multimedia  services, and will use the most advanced data transmission  techniques (ATM technology, fiber optics, etc.).    -  Consolidation  of the integrated services digital network: With an investment  of ECU15 billion over the next five years, such networks should  be found throughout the Union before the year 2000.  <H5>  General Electronic Services </H5>    -  Electronic access to  information: This will require an investment of ECU1 billion  over the 1994-99 period, and will involve the uploading of  information (administrative, scientific, or cultural) in  databases accessible to any user in the Union.    -  Electronic mail:  Also for an ECU1-billion investment, various commercial  electronic document transmission services will be developed and  made interoperable (particularly important for small- and  medium-sized companies).    -  Electronic images, interactive video  services: An ECU10-billion investment will be required to  ensure the interoperability of new, flexible services  (pay-per-view, video on demand) at the European level by 1997.  <H5>  Data Communications Applications </H5>    -  Telecommuting: There  will be Community support to the tune of ECU3 billion over five  years for pilot programs aimed at setting up a cross-border  network of human resources management.    -  Remote administration:  An investment of ECU7 billion over 1994-99 will help the  implementation of data exchanges between administrative bodies  (customs, statistical organizations) and give companies and  private individuals access to such data.    -  Distance training:  This will involve an investment of ECU3 billion and will result  in the setting up by 1996 of a network linking more than 100  universities or colleges in order to make shared teaching  modules accessible.    -  Distance health care: this will require an  ECU7-billion investment over the 1994-99 period for the  installation, between now and the year 2000, of a multimedia  network linking up the major anticancer centers, bone marrow  banks, and the principal Social Security centers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 19 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry  will not react to unofficial reports that NATO has conceded to  pressure from Russia and offered it "special relations" with  NATO alongside participation in the Partnership for Peace  programme. Ministry spokesman Vit Kurfurst told CTK no official  information on the offer had been received from Brussels.    Kurfurst reminded reporters of Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec's speech at the Charles University Law Faculty in  Prague a month ago when he "said clearly that we signed the  Partnership for Peace in the form of 16+1 (i.e. the 16 NATO  states plus the Czech Republic), and not 16+1+Russia".    At his meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy  Zlenko on March 17, Zieleniec said that if Russia insisted on a  special status in the Partnership for Peace programme, as  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had done several times,  new negotiations on the programme would have to be launched. He  said the Czech Republic was satisfied with the form of the  programme and did not regard alteration as realistic.    According to unofficial information from Brussels, NATO's  special relations with Russia are separate from the Partnership  for Peace, offered by NATO in January to former communist bloc  countries with an unspecified possibility of future alliance  membership.    Besides the Czech Republic, 17 countries have so far joined  the Partnership programme. At the beginning of the year,  Russian representatives expressed willingness to join the scheme  but later revised their view and accused NATO of not taking  sufficient account of Russia's status as a great power.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL SERIES BEGINS FIRST OF SIX NIGHTS AT FORUM  </P> <P> Professional volleyball players from indoors and out will get together for six  nights of team cup play this month, beginning tonight at 7 at the Forum.  </P> <P> A total of 32 players -- including two-time Olympians Karch Kiraly, Steve  Timmons and Dave Saunders, as well as beach volleyball stars Sinjin Smith and  Randy Stoklos -- will play on the four teams of six players and two alternates  competing in a round-robin format that concludes Sept. 23.  </P> <P> The other games will be Sunday; Tuesday; Wednesday, Sept. 19, and Saturday,  Sept. 22.  </P> <P> Sponsorship has grown since the event began five years ago. The $110,000 in  prize money this season is up 10% from the first year, but is still well below  the $200,000 in prize money offered by the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals'  final event on its beach tour this summer.  </P> <P> "I would like to be offering more prize money," said Jeannie Buss, event  coordinator. "But the players have to understand that we can't do that until  we're making money."  </P> <P> Timmons, who is married to Buss, said: "It's real important for volleyball to  stay visible between the Olympics and the beach seasons."

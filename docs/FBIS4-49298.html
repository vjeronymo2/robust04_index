			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The 13th meeting of the planning and  construction committee of the capital was held on 27 April.  Chen Xitong, member of the political bureau of the CPC Central  Committee, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, and  chairman of the planning and construction committee of the  capital, stressed that we must strictly safeguard and implement  the plan and resolutely wage the struggle against all the  phenomena of violating and damaging the plan.    Li Qiyan, mayor of the municipality and first vice chairman  of the planning and construction committee of the capital, said  in his speech: In 1983, the party Central Committee and the  State Council decided to set up the planning and construction  committee of the capital to examine, work out, and implement  short-term plans and annual plans for the overall urban  construction of Beijing; to organize and formulate urban  construction and management rules; and to coordinate the  relations of all fronts. This is extremely necessary. [passage  omitted]    Hou Jie, minister at the Ministry of Construction and vice  chairman of the planning and construction committee of the  capital, said in his speech: Big headway and great changes have  been made in the urban construction of the capital. Both  Chinese and foreign personages are satisfied at this. [passage  omitted]    In his speech, Chen Xitong expressed his welcome to the  members of the newly readjusted capital planning and  construction committee. He said: Under the leadership of the  party Central Committee and the State Council and with the  support of all departments and commissions, the capital has made  big headway in construction. However, it still far lags behind  the requirements of the central authorities and the target of  having the style and features of an ancient capital as well as a  modern, international, large city. We should make efforts in  the next decades in order to attain the target. This task is  still arduous. The main tasks of the readjusted capital  planning and construction committee are to implement the  "overall urban construction plan of Beijing" and to fulfill the  heavy trust of the party Central Committee, the State Council,  and the people.    Chen Xitong stressed: We must strictly safeguard and enforce  the plan and resolutely wage the struggle against all the  phenomena of violating and damaging the plan. The current plan  has richer contents than the previous ones. It is a blueprint  for economic and social development as well as a program to  guide construction and development. Without the plan, urban  construction will become disorganized or disorderly. Beijing  was the ancient capital of five dynasties. The predecessors'  plans were good, so does the "overall plan" revised this time.  Such a good plan in the world should fully be cherished. There  are only reasons for safeguarding, perfecting, and developing it  but no grounds for damaging or going against it. Beijing is the  capital of our great socialist motherland as well as a  shopwindow of China and reflects the image of China. So,  cherishing and safeguarding the plan is cherishing the capital.  This is the awareness of the capital.    Chen Xitong pointed out: The phenomena of going against and  damaging the plan were very serious in the past. Great  improvement has been made through the elimination of the  disorderly, scattered, and weak situation over the past years.  However, some phenomena of going against and damaging the plan  still exist. If we do not resolutely wage a struggle against  these phenomena, the fulfillment of the plan will become an  empty talk. To ensure the smooth implementation of the plan,  first of all, leaders should take the lead in strictly carrying  out the plan. All the major issues, the issues going against  the plan, or the issues concerning the necessity to  appropriately readjust the plan according to the demands of the  objective reality should be decided, according to different  conditions, jointly by the chairman and vice chairmen of the  planning and construction committee of the capital or by the  plenary sessions of the committee. No individuals have the  rights to making decisions. Second, construction units should  consciously submit themselves to and implement the plan. They  must not pay attention to only economic results to the neglect  of the plan. Third, the planning departments should strictly  make management, supervise the implementation of the plan, have  the daring to make criticisms, not be afraid of giving offense,  upgrade their quality, set strict demands on themselves, and  realistically assume responsibility for the implementation of  the plan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A reliable source in the New  Mon State Party informed PHUCHATKAN that five members of the  party's Central Committee, namely General Htaw Mon, commander of  the National Mon Liberation Army; Tainin Aung, leader of the Mon  refugees; Nai Sumi, governor of (Marid) Province; Lieutenant  General Kao; and Nai Lawin Mon, member of the New Mon State  Party's education section; have been assigned to hold peace  talks with the Burmese side.    Representing the Government during the negotiations were  Lieutenant General Khin Ngunt, secretary general of the State  Law and Order Reform Council or SLORC, and other high-ranking  military officers including Major General Kett Sein, commander  of the Burmese Army in the southeastern region. It was reported  that Nai Shwe Kyin, 81, leader of the New Mon State Party, did  not attend the meeting.    The negotiations are scheduled to begin 17 March at the  command headquarters of the Burmese southeastern army region in  Moulmein, where the two sides earlier held similar talks. The  chairman of the New Mon State Party reportedly disagreed with  the idea of holding peace talks with the SLORC because, he  believed, the latter is insincere and has no intention of  accepting conditions proposed by the Mon side.    The conditions proposed for the peace talks by the Mon  included the presence during the negotiations of representatives  of neutral nations, news media, and the United Nations, release  of all political prisoners, a nationwide cease fire, and  meetings with representatives of the DAB, or Democratic Alliance  of Burma. Rangoon could not accept all the conditions proposed  by the two factions, particularly the one calling for the  meeting to be held in Thailand, because the request was turned  down by the Thai Government.    A source in the New Mon State Party said the party has  accepted the proposal for cease-fire talks because it wanted to  demonstrate its intention to settle the conflict through  peaceful means. The success of the negotiations, however,  depends on the sincerity of the SLORC. He noted that the  party's decision to come to the negotiating table with the SLORC  should not be viewed as an act of disarmament or giving up the  struggle for the Mon national cause. As long as the military  regime is in power, the party will not give up its weapons.    A [Thai] National Security Council source told PHUCHATKAN  that the cease-fire talks between the Mon and SLORC are likely  to be successful. The two sides are expected to sign a  cease-fire agreement in April. The Karen group will reportedly  hold peace talks with Rangoon in the near future.</p>

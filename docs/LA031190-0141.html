			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY CHIEF SENDS LESOTHO KING TO TEMPORARY EXILE  </P> <P> King Moshoeshoe II, stripped of authority over his tiny mountain kingdom, left  for temporary exile in Britain on Saturday after refusing to endorse the  actions of Lesotho's military ruler in a recent power struggle.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya said in a radio broadcast that he had asked  Moshoeshoe, 51, to take "a brief sabbatical in the United Kingdom, which would  allow ample opportunity for reflection."  </P> <P> Lekhanya, who led a bloodless coup in 1986 and heads a six-member ruling  military council, took away the king's powers of assent after he opposed  Lekhanya's attempts to oust several members of the council who were accused of  insubordination and obstructing justice.  </P> <P> The general said in his broadcast that he escorted the king to the frontier to  board a plane from South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho. A source close to the  events said Moshoeshoe took a chartered flight to Botswana for a connecting  flight to London. He may take up residence at either Oxford University, where  he studied previously, or Sweden's University of Uppsala.  </P> <P> This is the second time that Moshoeshoe has gone into exile. Moshoeshoe fled in  1970 in another crisis when he was reduced to a figurehead role by Prime  Minister Leabua Jonathan, who was himself ousted in the 1986 coup.  </P> <P> Jonathan's downfall was prompted by a land blockade by South Africa, which  crippled Lesotho's economy. The military council headed by Lekhanya restored  close relations with South Africa.  </P></p>

According to the report published recently by the customs  authorities, seized imports consisted essentially of  Marlboro-brand cigarettes, fabrics, cosmetics, and automotive  spare parts. The products intended for export consisted of  Lahda-brand milk and infant formula, sugar, semolina, pasta,  household soap, table oil, and fuel.    In this respect, although their resources are very limited,  the customs were able to recover in 1993 large quantities of  price-supported staples that would have been fraudulently  exported to neighboring countries (Mali and Niger). They  included, among other things, 10,888 cartons of Lahda milk and  infant formula, 25 tons of pasta, 26 tons of semolina and flour,  3.5 tons of sugar, 5,018 cakes of household soap, 2,700 liters  of table oil, 1.5 tons of rice, and 1,970 liters of gasoline.    In addition, 222,450 packs of Marlboro cigarettes, 12,068  meters of fabric, 16,450 cosmetic items, 1,855 automotive spare  parts, and 20,000 electric bulbs, which were smuggled into the  country to be sold on the domestic market, were seized in border  zones. As a result of the seizure of these goods, 527 cases were  investigated by the judicial authorities, the report indicated.  However, according to the Tamanrasset regional director, Mr.  Abdelkader Atmouni, 1993 saw a marked decrease in the volume of  seized goods and the number of cases, compared with 1992.    This is because of increased crime and insecurity in the  region, which deterred smugglers, in addition to the closing of  the border with Niger, he said. In this context, we should also  mention a considerable decrease in population movements through  border posts.    Thus, there were 3,431 exits and 2,556 entries through the  border posts of In-Guezzam and Tin-Zaouatine. These travelers  are essentially inhabitants of border regions.    As far as barter is concerned, the Tamanrasset customs  authorities noted a marked increase in trade among Algerians,  Malians, and Nigeriens. They thus reported that over 5.7 billion  centimes' worth of goods were imported from Niger and Mali,  while 4.2 billion centimes' worth of Algerian goods were  exported to these countries.    These figures denote a rather strong export/import imbalance  which, according to customs authorities, is due to the  unavailability of Algerian products for export, especially those  that are in very great demand in neighboring countries, such as  plastic items and blankets (the exportation of which is  authorized).    We should stress that, since its creation last May, the new  Algerian customs general directorate has undertaken another  territorial reorganization. As a result, the Tamanrasset customs  regional directorate now consists of three district  inspectorates (Tamanrasset, In-Guezzam, and Bordj Babji-Mokhtar).    The latter two were promoted to inspectorates. In addition,  following the last visit of the Algerian customs general  director to border posts in the Algerian far south, measures  were taken to redeploy customs personnel, appreciably improve  agents' working and living conditions, and provide more material  resources. The objective was to make it possible to bring  smuggling under control and fight fraud so as to halt the  sapping of Algeria's economy.</p>

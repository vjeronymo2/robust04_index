			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Discriminatory UK patent licence rules overturned The European Court last week overturned UK rules on the granting of patent lic-ences because they were discriminatory. The case, which had been referred to Luxembourg by the English Court of Appeal, concerned the granting of licences of right. UK rules distinguished between the owner of a patent manufacturing the patented product in the UK and manufacturing it elsewhere in the European Community. Where the product was manufactured in the UK a licensee would be denied the right to import the patented product from a third country. But where it was manufactured elsewhere in the Community the licensee would be allowed to import it. The Court ruled that, although the restrictions applied to third-country imports and were thus not per se covered by EC rules on free movement of goods, the criteria by which the restrictions were applied affected trade between EC states and therefore fell foul of EC rules. The UK rules were discriminatory because they encouraged patent owners to manufacture patented products in the UK rather than import them from other EC countries. The court also ruled on the validity of certain rules relating to the accession to the Community of Spain and Portugal which restricted parallel imports from those countries until 1995. The Court said that national authorities in the other 10 member states were entitled to restrict patent licensees from importing patented products from Spain and Portugal as long as the EC derogating provisions were observed.

Strict interpretation of milk quota rules The European Court upheld a decision of the Irish authorities in refusing to grant an Irish dairy farmer a milk quota on the basis that he was not producing milk during the period when the quotas were set. Under Community milk quota rules only those farmers producing milk during a particular year were allocated quotas. The EC countries were allowed to choose any year between 1981 and 1983 as a reference period. Ireland chose 1983. The rules allow EC states to take into account exceptional circumstances, but only to the extent that the producer could choose another year between 1981 and 1983. The Irish farmer had been unable to work, through ill health, between 1980 and 1984 and therefore fell outside any of the available reference periods. The court said the principle of legitimate expectation had not been infringed. Reference periods had to be limited if the milk quota system were to work. C-85/90 William Dowling v Ireland, the Attorney General and the Minister for Food and Agriculture, ECJ 3CH, October 22 1992. German VAT rules for travel agents illegal German rules on VAT exemptions for travel agents were held to be invalid by the European Court because they went beyond measures set out in EC legislation. The German rules allowed no VAT to be charged on trips organised by German travel agents but carried out by non-German tour operators when the trips were either outside the Community or they involved air or sea transport which was international or outside German tax territory. Under Community VAT rules such third-party exemptions were only allowed if the work was carried out outside the EC. The exemptions for air and sea transport partly or wholly within the EC were therefore incompatible with EC legislation. C-74/91 Commission v Germany, ECJ FC, October 27 1992. Community powers in agricultural aid schemes upheld The Court upheld the Community's powers to impose a surcharge or exclude farmers completely from certain agricultural aid schemes if they were found to be guilty of irregularities when applying for aid. Under EC rules, national authorities were obliged to exclude farmers for one year from the relevant aid schemes and the Commission was entitled to levy a surcharge. The German government claimed the Community was not entitled to exclude farmers from aid schemes and that only the Council of Ministers was entitled to impose surcharges. The Court said the exclusion powers fell within the aims of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Community had the right to determine such measures and they were justified because they discouraged irregularities in aid applications. The Court also said the Council was entitled to delegate the power to impose surcharges to the Commission. C-240/90 Germany v Commission, ECJ FC, October 27 1992. Wide interpretation given to EC definition of medicine In a case involving South American herbal teas imported and sold in Holland for their therapeutic qualities, the Court ruled that, even though such products were not generally considered as medicines and their therapeutic effect had not been proved scientifically, they were still medicines under EC legislation and thus had to be registered with the public authorities. C-219/91 Johannes Stephanus Wilhelmus ter Voort, ECJ 5CH, October 28 1992. Stolen goods not susceptible to import levies A consignment of sugar to be sold outside the EC which was stolen before it could be exported from Belgium was not subject to import levies by Belgian customs on the ground that it was technically of non-Community origin, because no importation had actually taken place. C-284/91 Belgium v NV Suiker Export, ECJ 1CH, October 27 1992.</p>

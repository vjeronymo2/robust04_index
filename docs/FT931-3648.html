			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Gloom recedes on job prospects EMPLOYERS are more optimistic about job prospects for the second quarter of this year, Manpower, the employment services group, says. In its survey of employment prospects published today Manpower says there are signs of an improvement in manufacturing, but warns of pointers to a sharp fall in public-sector employment during the next three months. While 17 per cent of employers covered by the survey forecast increased staffing, 18 per cent believe there will be further job losses - a balance of 1 per cent expecting staff cuts. However, this represents a clear improvement on the balance of 16 per cent expecting cuts in the first quarter of this year and the balance of 2 per cent expecting a decrease in staffing for the second quarter last year. Manufacturers were more optimistic this year than at the same time last year, with a balance of 5 per cent expecting more jobs against 2 per cent for the second quarter of 1992. Ms Lilian Bennet at Manpower said: 'There are, encouragingly, some positive indicators in the results. This is endorsed by our experience in the marketplace where employers are using more temporary staff while assessing the strength of recovery and to give themselves greater flexibility.' The survey reports an improvement in job prospects in the electrical and electronic engineering industry, with a balance of 9 per cent of employers expecting to increase their workforces against only 2 per cent for the same period last year. However, prospects in the public sector have grown bleaker. Manpower says that 29 per cent of public-sector employers forecast job losses, while 9 per cent expect an increase, giving a balance of 20 per cent expecting a decline in staff numbers. In the same period last year a balance of 11 per cent expected cuts. On a regional breakdown, employers in only three areas forecast improvements. A balance of 8 per cent of Scottish employers expect to increase their workforces, against balances of 5 per cent in the west of England and 5 per cent in Yorkshire and Humberside. All other regions expect, on balance, that job numbers will fall. Manpower's survey is based on contacts with 1,941 companies during February.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Heseltine recruits top companies for panel: DTI will use secret data to monitor economy MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is recruiting some of the UK's biggest companies to help him turn his department into an economic powerhouse to rival the Treasury. The venture should enable Mr Heseltine to monitor economic activity independently of the Treasury, which has run into criticism over its failure to forecast the length or seriousness of the recession. The group of about 20 companies, including J. Sainsbury, Imperial Chemical Industries and Marks and Spencer, would give Mr Heseltine confidential information about their sales trends in the crucial period as Britain attempts to move into an upturn. The group - which will also include Northern Foods, TI Group and Unigate - would also advise Mr Heseltine on long-term industrial goals. The project marks another stage in the government's efforts to set up a new dialogue with industry after the Thatcher era gave it a lower priority. The Treasury's role as the dominant force in economic policy making has been made less secure both by recession and last autumn's currency crisis which swept Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism. While ICI and Marks and Spencer said they were still considering Mr Heseltine's invitation, Mr Tony Sumner, a director of TI, said his company would take part. 'The more government and industry can get together the better,' he said. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate, said his company 'will be happy to play a role', while Sainsbury and Northern Foods have also indicated willingness to participate. Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Nor-thern Foods, said: 'By gathering the anecdotal experiences of people in industry, Mr Heseltine may be able to improve on the Treasury's more academic approach to monitoring the economy.' The Treasury, which has stepped up its contacts with industry, welcomed Mr Heseltine's plan and hoped to share the information gained. A formal announcement is expected within the next few weeks. Companies in the scheme are to send DTI officials commercially sensitive sales information about important parts of their business that provide clues to economic activity, both in the UK and overseas. The data would supplement economic statistics gathered from government or industry surveys, which during the recession have often given a misleading or confused picture of economic activity. Top executives would meet Mr Heseltine perhaps twice a year to thrash out ideas about long-term industrial goals.</p>

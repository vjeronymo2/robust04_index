The revised fee schedule became effective on January 1, 1993. Fees equal to 50% of the fee schedule were charged during 1993, and full fees are being charged in 1994. The public was aware of this fee change through public meetings and other appropriate notice. However, as a policy matter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) desires to publish this Notice through the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised fee schedule has been incorporated into the Service Policy Manual for Region 7 (Alaska). The fee revision was needed so that the Service could meet Federal mandates. These mandates require fee determinations to be based on fair market values, and that the Service attempt to recover costs of administering revenue producing commercial activities on refuge lands.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This revised fee schedule was effective on January 1, 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Daryle R. Lons, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1011 East Tudor Road, Anchorage, Alaska, 99503; telephone (907) 786&hyph;3354.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service is implementing the following fee schedule for commercial guides, outfitters, and transporters that are issued special use permits to conduct commercial operations on refuges in Alaska. Fees for other non-recreational types of commercial activities that involve removing marketable resources or utilizing reserved sites will not be based on the following fee schedule. Fees for these types of commercial activities will be determined by the Service's Division of Realty and will be based on fair market analysis surveys. These surveys will be conducted periodically to assure that fees reflect current market values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service considered a number of methods for meeting the required mandates. Four alternatives were given serious consideration and were published in the May 31, 1991,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 24827) to receive public comment. These alternatives were: (1) A single fixed fee of $350 for all commercial permittees, (2) a fee schedule based on type of commercial use activity and actual client numbers, (3) a fee schedule based on permittee calculations, made after the permit use period, of 3% of adjusted gross income derived from commercial activities that are authorized by special use permit on refuge lands, and (4) a fee schedule based on permittee estimates, made prior to the permit use period, of 3% of anticipated adjusted gross income derived from commercial activities that are authorized by special use permit on refuge lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service had proposed to adopt alternative 4 because it appeared that it would be (1) equitable to all commercial use permittees, regardless of the scale of their operation; (2) charging a fair market value; (3) reasonably consistent with the fee schedule of other Federal agencies in Alaska; and (4) cost effective for the government to administer. Thirty-five comments were received from individuals, professional organizations, and state and Federal agencies in response to the published  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. After review and consideration of the comments received, the Service decided not to implement this alternative. Public comments identified several potential inequities in the originally proposed alternative and strongly supported a flat fee or a client use-day system. A flat fee was reconsidered but was not selected because the Service believes it is not equitable to all commercial operators since the scale of operations is highly variable among users. As a result of public comment, the Service is implementing the following fee system which is based on the type of activity and number of client use-days. The specific fee for each type of client use-day is based on an adjusted three percent of gross receipts figure which returns approximately 1.5&hyph;2.0 percent of the typical daily rate charged to clients by commercial guides, outfitters, and transporters in Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service's fee schedule system requires a non-refundable $100.00 administrative fee charged at the issuance of a permit and a predetermined fee for client use-days, based on the activity, charged following each session of use. Client use-day fees for all guiding, outfitting, and transporting commercial operations on Alaska refuges are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Guiding-Outfitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> A. Brown Bear_$15.00 per client use-day ($100 minimum) on Alaska Peninsula, Becharof, Izembek and Kodiak refuges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Brown/Grizzly Bear_$10.00 per client use-day on all other refuges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Moose and Dall Sheep_$10.00 per client use-day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. All Other Hunted Species_$5.00 per client use-day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. Sport Fishing_$2.00 per client use-day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. River Floating_$2.00 per client use-day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Photography/Birding/Wilderness Adventures/Other_$2.00 per client use-day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H. All Transporters_$2.00 per client use-day.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service will review and issue an adjustment to these fees every three years. Adjustments will be based on the Implicit Price Deflator Index (IPDI) which is compiled annually by the Department of Commerce and is published in February of each year as part of the ``Economic Report of the President'' for Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permittees will be required to obtain a special use permit from each refuge that they operate on and full fees will be collected by each refuge. Client use-day fees will be based on actual client use days and be in addition to the $100 administrative fee. A ``client use-day'' shall be defined as one calendar day, or any portion thereof, for each client using the refuge. If clients are concurrently participating in more than one activity during the same calendar day, the highest client use-day rate will be used for that day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The permittee is responsible for record keeping and reporting the actual number of client use-days to the refuge manager and shall be required to report actual use within 30 days of the end of the authorized use period, unless otherwise stated in the permit. The refuge manager is responsible for computing the actual fees owed the government and issuing a bill for collection within 30 days of receipt of the use report. Permittees are responsible to pay the fees within 30 days of receipt of the bill for collection. A permittee will not be issued a new special use permit until all fees have been paid. Special use permits issued for several year terms may be revoked during the term of the permit if annual fees are not paid within the required 30 day period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fees for reserved land sites (e.g., cabins, tent platforms, caches, etc.) associated with commercial operations remained at the $100 flat fee during 1993. The Division of Realty conducted a fair market value analysis survey for reserved land sites on a refuge-by-refuge basis during 1993. Revised reserved land site fees will become effective in late 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> George T.

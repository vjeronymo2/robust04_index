			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: Lenzing to cut payout after posting deficit Lenzing, the world's leading producer of viscose fibre, yesterday reported higher sales for 1993 but will post a Sch203.1m (Dollars 16.8m) deficit due to extraordinary losses at its Glanzstoff unit. Sales for the group, which has production facilities in the US, Indonesia, Brazil and Austria, rose 9.5 per cent to Sch8.74bn (Dollars 740m) from Sch7.98bn in 1992. Profits from ordinary business, including tax on income, was Sch115.4m, but it will post a net deficit because the losses at the Glanzstoff plant. The management board is proposing to cut the dividend to Sch5 a share from Sch16. The Glanzstoff subsidiary was badly hit by the downturn in the European motor industry, which caused a sharp decline in orders for viscose tyre reinforcing materials during the second half of last year. Production will be closed down later this year, and the site sold or rented. As a result of the necessary write-offs Glanzstoff posted a net loss of Sch396.9m. Sales at Lenzing Austria were little changed at Sch3.2bn, though sales improved at the main subsidiaries. Lenzing's US unit increased its market share to more than 40 per cent with sales of Sch1.4bn.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs back stance on Serbs LABOUR MPs yesterday rallied around the party leadership's calls for air strikes on Serb supply and communication lines in Bosnia - but signalled they believe still more decisive action may yet be needed, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr John Smith, party leader, won support at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party for calling for air strikes if Serbs make further advances. However, more than 50 Labour MP last night signed a Commons motion urging the UN to issue an ultimatum against the Serbs, 'and, should that fail, to take decisive military action'. Some Labour MPs continue to press for the sending of ground troops. Mr Smith has hardened his position over the last week. To the surprise of some, however, pressure for taking a stronger stance has come from leftwing MPs who were nervous about Britain's military involvement in the gulf war.</p>

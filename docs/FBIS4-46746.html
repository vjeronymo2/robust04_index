			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of </F> the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the USA and Canada,  under the heading "Criticism": "The Start of a Long Road: Is a  Partnership Between Russia and the West Realistic?"]    [Text] A number of questions were discussed during  the Russian president's visit to Germany in May. But it appears  that the main purpose of the visit was something else  altogether: to find out how seriously the FRG and the West as a  whole are about partnership with Russia. Are they not tending,  concealed by declarations of "partnership," to place Russia in  the dependent position of a "junior partner" and thereby cement  their "victory" in the Cold War? These issues have been the  subject of public discussion.    In January of this year, during a meeting in Moscow,  presidents Yeltsin and Clinton asserted "that relations between  Russia and the United States have entered a new stage of mature  strategic partnership, mutual benefit and recognition of each  other's national interests." However, the overall evolution of  relations between Russia and the United States and other Western  countries -- most importantly, practical steps in the field of  mutual relations -- indicates that the actual state of those  relations is very far from a "partnership" as that term is  understood in international usage. In fact, the West has  undertaken a number of actions -- from the bombing of Serbian  positions in Bosnia over Russia's objections, to the humiliating  refusal to invite Russia to attend the 50th anniversary of the  opening of a "second front" in Europe -- which cannot be  interpreted as anything except an attempt to "put Russia in its  place."    Correspondingly, there is no way that relations between  Russia and the West can achieve the balance, the optimum  formula, that would calm politicians on both sides and would  correspond to their objective needs. And it is unlikely that  empty talk about "partnership" will help matters any. What are  needed are practical actions that will in fact lead to an equal  partnership (if such a thing is possible), or else Russia's  relations with the West will continue to be characterized by  nervousness and unpredictability.    Therefore, so as not to mislead the public and the decision  makers, it would be advisable to think about just how justified  it is at the present stage to speak of partnership as an  accomplished fact in Russia's relations with the West, or  whether this is still just a cherished dream that is very far  from being a reality.  <H5>  There Is `Partnership,' Then There Is `Partnership' </H5>   The Americans first began seriously talking about  "partnership" as one of the key principles of their foreign  policy under President Nixon in the late 1960's. The failure of  aggression in Vietnam, the accompanying acute domestic crisis in  the United States and disarray in political circles all forced  Washington to stop regarding its allies as "junior partners" and  attempt to fashion a system of relations with them based on the  principles of partnership.    Thereupon followed years of intensive efforts to find the  most adequate forms of partnership, including active efforts by  the Trilateral Commission, which in the 1970's prepared  documents on all the main issues in international relations,  with consideration for the interests of the United States,  Western Europe and Japan, and meetings of the Big Seven  countries beginning in1975, though as a rule these took place  without a great deal of commotion or public notice. On the  whole, one must honestly admit that while the countries of the  "socialist commonwealth" were unswervingly heading for the  collapse of that commonwealth, in the 1970's and 1980's the Big  Seven countries were, on the contrary, moving toward a higher  level of cooperation and consolidation.    Russia has virtually no experience establishing that kind of  relations. Therefore there is little reason to expect that it  can immediately, within a few years' time, wade through the mass  of obstacles that objectively stand between Russia and  partnership with the leading Western states. One will be able to  speak of real "partnership" when a solid foundation for it  exists in the form of a mutual stake in economic relations and  closeness or similarity in the social base and political  structure of and cooperation among kindred parties of a  democratic, Christian or liberal orientation. When, finally,  governing circles have similar or comparable social experience.    There is not even a hint of these things in Russia's  relations with the West today, and it will take years (if our  country develops successfully) for them to begin to appear.  <H5>  The Foundations of a Possible `Partnership' </H5>   If one were to attempt to assess prospects for a partnership  between Russia and the leading Western countries, in particular  with the United States, first of all one must acknowledge the  marked inequality or asymmetry in the two sides' position.    Following the end of the Cold War the United States lost  virtually nothing in terms of its international standing. It  remains the largest nuclear superpower, its military and  political blocs have not collapsed, and it continues to play the  role of the largest provider of aid to other countries. The U.S.  economy, though experiencing some difficulties, is nevertheless  successfully weathering a technotronic era, assuming positions  of leadership in virtually every advanced technology. The United  States remains a country with one of the highest per capita  incomes and well-developed health care, social security and  educational systems. The same can be said of the FRG, Great  Britain, Japan and other Western countries. Without idealizing  their situation, in which problems do exist, one must  nevertheless admit that the West is a wealthy and developed  society with good prospects for the 21st century.    Russia comes up looking badly by comparison. The USSR has  collapsed, but virtually no one except the elites of the new  republics gained by that, with the possible exception of the  Baltic countries. As the largest country in the former Soviet  Union, Russia inherited its military status and its role as a  great power. But its economy is in deep crisis, a majority of  the population is barely making ends meet, and over 35 percent  of the population (according to various estimates) are living on  the verge of poverty. The country is characterized by  instability, and institutions of government are fighting among  themselves, unable to propose either a socioeconomic future that  is acceptable to the majority or, at the very least, a tolerable  existence. The center and the regions are in a state of constant  competition, and ethnic minorities are rebelling. A country that  has the potential to be the richest in the world is in a state  of semi-collapse.    It is clear that in this situation there is only one point  for Russia to a "partnership" with the West: obtaining a source  of funding, technology and know-how to rescue its economy from  crisis. Consequently, from the very start the West regards it as  a burden on the West's quite frankly somewhat limited available  resources, because the United States, Germany and other  seemingly "rich" countries themselves require loans and credits  to maintain production. Even prosperous Germany is having  increasing difficulty coming up with foreign aid funds as it  spends approximately $100 billion annually on reconstruction of  the former GDR.    What does Russia have to offer in exchange? Vague promises  of  future income from Russian mineral resources? Equally vague  promises to open up its capital investment market to foreign  corporations? It is hard to imagine that this is an adequate  attraction to the West, which is very well aware that even  Russian entrepreneurs, though secretly and illegally, are taking  their own capital out of the country, and that with current  taxes and laws and the reign of the bureaucracy only a madman  would risk investing his own money. These concerns increase in  proportion to Russia's internal instability: what if  Zhirinovskiy comes to power? Or the communists? What then?    The only thing that Russia can offer as an adequate  contribution to a "partnership" is cooperation in the area of  arms control and resolution of international crises. In that  regard one must admit that the real partnership that emerged in  relations between the USSR and the United States in the course  of profound changes in the international arena (this  "partnership" was first mentioned by President Bush during a  meeting with CPSU Central Committee General Secretary M. S.  Gorbachev in Malta in December 1989) could serve as a serious  foundation upon which both powers could build broader and more  lasting partnership relations.    Subsequently events took their course: at the end of 1991  the  Soviet Union collapsed, and the United States was skeptical of  Russia's attempts to replace it as a "partner." This did not  prevent the United States from signing the START II Treaty with  Russia. But that was most likely due to inertia from previous  years, because the treaty left out Ukraine, Belorussia and  Kazakhstan, which were also nuclear heirs of the USSR.    As for crises and examples of cooperation with regard to  resolving them, the Americans are increasingly disinclined to  trust the Russian Government, which is definitely not always  prepared to risk unpopular decisions (for example, supporting  the West's anti-Serbian course in Yugoslavia) and at times is  incapable of defining a given region's degree of importance to  Russia.    "Partnership" between Russia and the West, if it were  actually to begin functioning now, would most likely mean a  tremendous inequality between the partners, an inequality that  would become increasingly difficult to correct with the passage  of time.    A weak Russia that has lost its traditional image and has an  inefficient economy cannot be an equal partner for the United  States or the European Union. It will continue to ask for loans  and extension of its debt repayment schedule. Gradually there  will emerge (or perhaps already has emerged) between it and the  West a dense network of dependency that will ensnare the  country, its resources, its policy and even its culture. That is  what must be avoided at all costs. We must resolutely focus  primarily on fixing the economy, without pinning any particular  hopes on anyone curing our ills for us.    We should be oriented toward a partnership with the West,  but  only in some distant future. Entering into one now would be to  risk the free future of our nation.  <H5>  The Convergence Has Begun </H5>   Despite all these seemingly obvious facts, the Russian  Government has set itself the task of rapidly building  "partnership" relations with the West. As a rule, the response  it gets consists of polite ambiguities, vague sentiments and, at  the same time, some rather harsh demands. Moreover, those  demands apply to the realms of politics, economics, security and  even, in a number of cases, internal affairs. Very often those  demands give absolutely no consideration to Russia's specific  circumstances, and can even take the form of dictates.    One can imagine that Western politicians have too thoroughly  perceived the "smiling diplomacy" of the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs as evidence of Russia's willingness, like a  wayward schoolboy, to listen to lectures and commentary in hopes  of some unspecified reward in the future. Even in a matter in  which Russians could well take pride -- the overthrow of the  communist regime -- there has been the usual expression of  gratitude to the West for its "energetic efforts," even though  it is a well-known fact that after the end of the war in Vietnam  the West renounced "crusades" and was prepared to cooperate with  the communist Soviet Union or China, if that was in line with  its own needs.    The initial and quite naive attempts to depict Russia as  virtually a ready-made "partner" for the West have given rise to  a very incorrect reaction there. There people often forget that  Russia, despite all its internal weakness, was and still remains  a great power. There people have dared to flagrantly interfere  in Russia's internal affairs in the Baltic countries and in  Russia's relations with the CIS countries. There people have  deemed it possible to reproach Russians over Zhirinovskiy both  publicly and on an official level in a way that would be  unthinkable if the subject were any Western politician (for  example, publicly ridicule of the eccentric American millionaire  Ross Perot during the presidential campaign).    Western dictates have taken particularly ugly forms in the  area of Russian economic reforms. Threatened with the cutoff of  loans or refusal to extend debt repayment, Ye. Gaydar's  government was forced to take measures that had not been  prepared, worked out in detail, carefully considered or  discussed in public. Of course, Gaydar was not just a passive  observer; he, too, had a burning desire to create a market  economy in Russia as quickly as possible. But one would like to  think that he did realize how many objective social, political  and cultural obstacles there were to accomplishing that. And he  probably realized that without painstaking preparatory work that  could provide at least a minimal political base for reforms they  should not be adopted.    There are plenty of examples of Western high-handedness in  dealings with Russia. They include the cancelled rocket engine  deal between Russia and India, attempts to restrict the Russian  arms trade, slowness in repealing formal bans and restrictions  on trade, an obvious unwillingness to accept Russia as a member  of the Council of Europe, and many more. Among the latest acts  of a hostile nature toward Russia one could cite the infamous  NATO plan called "Partnership for Peace" and the bombing of  Serbian positions in Bosnia carried out by NATO aircraft.    One gets the impression that the nascent convergence between  Russia and the West, in which "smiling diplomacy" played such a  visible role during the first stage, has produced some not very  positive results. The foundation without which partnership is  impossible -- mutual respect for each side's legitimate  interests -- has not been laid down. The West was happy to  believe A. Kozyrev when he claimed that Russia does not have any  special, "private" interests, and concluded that it could impose  its own "values" and "ideals" on Russia as a guide to  understanding of what Russia should do in the international  arena.    These thoughts are brought to mind by the bombing of Serbian  positions in Bosnia. It should be noted that on the whole the  NATO "initiative," which arbitrarily declares former Yugoslavia  a zone under its "responsibility" (unaligned Yugoslavia never  was such) and offers its services to the U.N. as a "peacemaker,"  evokes the strongest reservations.    Simple logic says that this military and political bloc, a  creation of the Cold War, should follow the Warsaw Pact's  example and dissolve itself, as there is no real threat of a  major war in Europe. U.N. forces are fully capable of monitoring  the conflicts that do occur in Europe, such as the Yugoslavian  conflict, and there is no need to assemble huge air armadas to  resolve them. The very idea that air strikes could be used to  put an end to a highly complex ethnic conflict with a tragic  history is simply beneath serious politicians.    Nevertheless, despite the vigorous objections of Russia,  which has its own interests in the region, the NATO air strikes  were carried out. In effect Russia's interests were publicly  ignored, and no one even remembered to consult her president.    All the doubts that have been expressed about "partnership"  with the West should not be interpreted as a rejection of its  value for the international system in general and for Russia in  particular. "Partnership" has become a fairly good form of  mutual relations between groups of countries and ensures that  balance is maintained between their interests. Russia also needs  "partnership," but only the kind of partnership in which it  respects other countries' legitimate interests without any harm  to its own legitimate interests.    Then Russia's entry into the world community would not  destabilize that community, but rather would markedly strengthen  it. However, in order to achieve that level of relations both  Russia and the United States, as well as all of our country's  other possible partners, still have a long road to travel. And  that road begins in Russia, not in the West. It is only possible  to build partnership relations with other countries if we have a  healthy economy, a transparent process for the development of  foreign policy, a strong system of democratic institutions and a  clear and unambiguous image of our country in the rest of the  world.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Clinton delays Oslo sanctions President Bill Clinton yesterday said Norway's violation of an international ban on commercial whaling warranted sanctions under US law but he had decided to delay imposing them for the moment, Reuter reports from Washington. In a letter to Congress, Mr Clinton said US objectives could best be achieved by 'delaying implementation of sanctions until we have exhausted all good-faith efforts to convince Norway to follow agreed conservation measures'.</p>

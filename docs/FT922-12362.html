			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Pits face strike threat: British Coal dismisses Yorkshire miners' protest at contracting out BRITISH COAL faces disruption at its Yorkshire operations after miners in the region voted to stage selective strikes over work being contracted out to private companies. Although the majority in favour of industrial action was narrow - 5,131 to 4,984 - solidarity among Yorkshire miners is strong. It is likely that even those who voted against would obey a union instruction to walk out. Any action could provide British Coal with its stiffest industrial relations test since the 1984-85 national pits strike. Although Yorkshire miners have voted since then for industrial action over pay, a less militant stance by colleagues in other areas has prevented them going ahead. Areas outside Yorkshire have not been balloted on the issue of contracting out. Mr Ken Capstick, National Union of Mineworkers' Yorkshire vice-chairman, said the union was likely to call the action if British Coal refused to meet it or to compromise. The executive of the Yorkshire NUM, the union's largest area, is due to meet on Wednesday. The vote follows British Coal's plan to shift from the traditional 'advance' system of mining coal to the 'retreat' method at Markham Main colliery in Armthorpe, South Yorkshire. Under the traditional system, miners employed by British Coal bring coal to the surface as they advance along a coal face. The retreat method involves bringing coal to the surface only after all the tunneling development has been completed. The tunneling is a specialised job and, according to British Coal, can often be performed more cheaply and effectively by contractors. Although not a new system, the retreat method is increasingly in use, and NUM members fear it will lead to significant job losses. At Markham Main, which employs 730 workers, 35 jobs are at stake. Since the end of the 1984-85 national pits strike, the British Coal workforce in the Yorkshire area has been reduced form 38,000 to 13,000. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee relations director, said the vote among NUM members was as sad as it was futile. He said: 'The days have long past since there could be any reward for industrial action. If action takes place at any colliery it will threaten still further an already uncertain future. 'The proposals British Coal has made are essential if Markham Main is to have any opportunity to continue in the future.' Operations at Markham Main have shown a loss of Pounds 30m in the past five years.</p>

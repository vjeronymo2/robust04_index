			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Currencies The striking aspect about yesterday's dollar fall is that the effect did not spill over into bond and equity markets. This may be partly because the main movement was against the yen, and can be considered a spe-cific response to Japan's political crisis. But it also looks as though fears that the US may raise interest rates sharply to defend the dollar are abating, despite the upward revision to first-quarter growth. It would be unlikely, though, for the problem to go away as easily as that. The pressures which brought about last week's turbulence will have to be addressed eventually.</p>

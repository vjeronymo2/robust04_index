			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / People: Daks Simpson Daks Simpson, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, has made two new appointments to its board as part of the continued reorganisation since its takeover by Japan's Sankyo Seiko in 1991. Colin Campbell, who joined Daks in 1975 and became group company secretary in 1976, has become a group director with responsibility for legal, administrative and personnel matters. Don Ruffle, who joined Simpsons of Piccadilly in 1961 as a buyer and was latterly marketing director of the group's Invertere casual and rainwear division, has become group merchandising director and a board member. Daks says the appointments reflect the desire to have all important group functions represented at board level. Wim Van Overdijk, an outside director since 1989 who advised Daks on design and technical matters, has resigned to pursue his other design and manufacturing interests, including his company Design House in the Netherlands.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Paris Club losing patience with Brazil CONTINUING delays in talks on a new accord with the International Monetary Fund are jeopardising Brazil's agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors. The Paris Club agreement, for the refinancing of Dollars 21bn (Pounds 14bn) official debt, was signed in February 1992 shortly after Brazil had successfully negotiated a standby loan with the IMF - an essential condition of the deal. The subsequent collapse of the IMF accord forced Brazil to seek a waiver from the Paris Club in January, which expired three weeks ago. The Paris Club will meet tomorrow to decide whether to grant Brazil a new waiver or declare the country in default. On Monday Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's new finance minister, met ambassadors from Group of Seven industrialised countries to ask for 'understanding and support' in the wake of his new economic plan. He pointed out that a technical team from the IMF was due in mid-July to reassess the economic situation and that Brazil was still on track to complete a Brady-type deal with its commercial creditors in November. Although Paris Club members are unhappy about Brazil's poor record with the IMF, they are thought unlikely to declare default, particularly as 11 of the 13 countries have now signed bilateral agreements with Brazil.</p>

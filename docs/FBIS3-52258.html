			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Our talk yesterday should have dealt with the  phenomenon of extremism and revanchism [al-salafiyah] in Islam,  in view of the danger, difficulty, and [word indistinct] that  such radicalism poses to the noble Islamic religion. The rapid  succession of events prevented this, however. At the same time,  my personal closeness to these rapid events during two full  nights and two full days in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan's  [PUK] operations rooms provided a motive for writing this  commentary.    PUK leaders ran the operations with a presence of mind that  demonstrated wisdom, experience, and political, military, and  psychological competence. The telephone did not stop ringing,  and there was an endless flood of volunteer fighters. Everyone  in the operations room, particularly the PUK leaders, were  emphatically determined that no harm should befall venerable  al-Sulaymaniyah and its dear citizens, especially the women and  children.    The sight of veteran peshmergas, those who fought in the  difficult battles of the past, streaming to the place with their  weapons in hand was unforgettable. I even saw among them a  group of elderly men and others in suits and ties who came late  at night to take up arms.    Women, children, and innocent men were killed or wounded  when  the terrorists turned their mortar fire, katyushas, and Grads  against peaceable homes. Doctors and nurses hurried to help the  wounded at all hours of the night and day, spurred on by their  professional sense of duty and patriotic and humanitarian  sentiments. Their honorable and humanitarian action is  difficult to forget.    This is only a small part of what I saw.    On the subjects of war and politics, we declare: What  happened was not a war between the PUK and the Muslims. Before  the matter was settled decisively, as we have seen, the PUK made  strenuous efforts on all levels to resolve the issue peacefully.    Political parties in the Kurdish liberation movement made  valuable efforts to salvage the situation and safeguard the  citizens' lives. However, the extremist, terrorist, radical  movement sought a war of extermination. We can see now how the  consequence was the end of the terrorists' extremism. We have  seen how citizens, normally uninvolved in politics, participated  in deciding the issue for the good of Kurdistan and its people,  not merely for the good of the PUK.    Yes, it has been a national victory. We have driven off the  specter of fear and danger that threatened our country and our  people. Nevertheless, the PUK must continue to be wary of  falling victim to vanity. In the future, the PUK must be even  more humble than it is now. It must conduct its transactions  with other parties in a humble manner, with the wisdom of the  victor and the knowledge of one conversant with all things.    Yes, the momentous event has demonstrated the Kurdish  people's support for the PUK and how the veteran peshmergas and  veteran PUK members backed their triumphant party, just as they  have always supported it during good and bad times.    At this point, we want to comment on an astounding feature:  Thousands of Grad missiles were found in the extremists'  warehouses. Even the united army of Kurdistan does not possess  such missiles. The kinds of weapons that are only used in  sophisticated battles were also found. Hallowed houses of  worship were used as trenches.    It was a wise and splendid thing that dear al-Sulaymaniyah  and other cities of Kurdistan were protected from devastation.    To enable our nation to live in security and peace and to  build up Kurdistan, let us all rise to the level of events and  future contingencies. Let us reinforce our fraternity and  mutual trust. Let all the parties of Kurdistan focus their  efforts on bringing happiness to the people and defend them  against terrorism.</p>

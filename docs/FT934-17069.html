			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Let's hear it for Sir Sid - Proposals for a new way to invest at Lloyd's THE bandwagon of corporate capital for the Lloyd's of London insurance market has begun to roll. Those brave enough to wade into controversial waters may soon have an innovative new way to invest. Tentative proposals have been announced for at least 16 corporate capital vehicles (CCVs). More detailed information is now beginning to circulate, and indicates a number of significant differences between the products on offer. Traditionally, investment in Lloyd's has come from the individual Names (people who pledge their personal assets against the underwriting business written by syndicates on the market). The problem has always been that Names have unlimited liability. If the syndicates lose money, Names are required to pay up - not just to the value of the capital they pledged initially but pro rata to the total value of the loss. As a result, many people have become insolvent in the past few years, particularly those in syndicates forced to pay out for natural disasters and environmental clean-ups. The CCVs now being proposed waive the unlimited liability risks. The idea was mooted in the Lloyd's business plan, put forward in April as a way to complement the traditional unlimited liability business of Names. Corporate capital funds would be required to pay out losses only up to the total amount they pledged. On the other hand, the traditional advantage of membership of Lloyd's remains: that the individual's assets can be used twice, pledged to the insurance market in the event of losses but, at the same time, available to invest elsewhere. Many of the CCVs are geared around investment from financial institutions and will not be available easily to individual investors - except to those who have large sums managed directly by investment houses. But others are being targeted, at least partly, at individuals. As the adviser to one fund says (referring to the mythical investor in the British Gas privatisation): 'We are not looking for Sid but, maybe, for Sir Sidney.' The CCVs include the CLM Insurance Fund (advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd) and CLM Advisers, part of Sedgwick, which aims to raise about one-quarter of its funding from individuals; and the Premium Underwriting and Premium Trust planned by Noble &amp; Co. with Martin Currie and Wellington, which wants to raise about 30 per cent of its Pounds 30m from individuals. Private investors are also to be encouraged towards Syndicate Capital Trust, being launched by Raphael Zorn Hemsley with Insurance Analysis and John Govett; and to a fund-of-funds from Johnson Fry. Details of several others are still to emerge. Potential investors need to consider several elements in making a choice. The structure of the funds varies between conventional investment trusts, funds-of-funds, and the split capital arrangement proposed by Noble. The choice of advisers varies, too, with some tied to a particular members' agent and the syndicates it favours and others opting for independent advisers. Investment strategies also vary widely in terms of the number of syndicates chosen and the nature of the business they write, and the ratio of capital pledged to total underwriting capacity. Lloyd's, meanwhile, has proposed a number of safeguards to reduce the risk of large losses. These range through new regulatory requirements covering the whole market to specific measures aimed at the corporate funds, such as a conservative maximum ratio of 2:1 of underwriting capacity to capital pledged. It also requires all the corporate funds to work with professional advisers with knowledge of the market. The arguments for investing in Lloyd's now include the new opportunities for investment at a time when premiums are rising in response to the poor results in the past few years. A number of uncertainties remain. Most importantly, Names still have to approve the introduction of corporate capital. Many - particularly among the loss-making dissidents - have concerns about corporate capital and how it will change their own role in the market. Dissenters were defeated at an extraordinary general meeting they held in July which ratified the idea of corporate capital. But, in an attempt to pre-empt further objections, Lloyd's itself has called another for October 20. No final approvals for funds can be given until after then. The stock exchange and Lloyd's itself must approve the funds. Just as significant, so must the Inland Revenue. There is still some question about whether the funds will qualify for the tax status of an investment trust.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS, LEFT OUT OF NCAA EVENT, HEAD FOR TEXAS  </P> <P> Not selected as one of the 48 teams in the NCAA tournament, the San Diego State  women's basketball team was chosen Sunday as the No. 1-seeded team in the 21st  annual eight-team women's National Invitational Tournament in Amarillo, Tex.,  March 23-25.  </P> <P> "We thought perhaps that we should have been one of the teams in the NCAA, but  the committee didn't feel that way," SDSU Coach Earnest Riggins said.  </P> <P> "We feel that we're a better team than we showed in the last six or seven  ballgames. Certainly, our overall record (23-8) was good enough but losing five  of our last seven hurt us."  </P> <P> The Aztecs will take on eighth-seeded Radford (23-6) at 1 p.m. March 21 in the  first round of the single-elimination tournament. The top-seeded team has been  defeated in the first round three consecutive years.  </P> <P> DePaul (22-8), the fourth-seeded team, is the first defending champion to play  in the tournament in 16 years.

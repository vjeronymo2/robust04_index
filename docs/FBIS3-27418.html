			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, February 23 (XINHUA) -- A commander of the  Russian peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina said today  that his forces would remain neutral while conducting  peacekeeping operations and observing the ceasefire.    He told XINHUA reporters that the Russian troops will not be  on the side of the Bosnian Serbs, but will treat all sides  equally.    He said his forces have not yet begun their mission, and  were  now familiarizing themselves with the complicated situation and  environment in the Serb-held areas.    The commander said that the peacekeeping forces, as well as  the civilian population, require security guarantees.    He added that his battalion would stay as long as the UN  peacekeeping force commander in Sarajevo and the Russian  Government so desire.    Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs, intervened in the  Bosnian crisis on the eve of the NATO ultimatum deadline  threatening air strikes against the Serbs.    Some 400 Russian troops stationed in Croatia arrived in  Sarajevo Sunday evening to enforce and monitor the cease-fire.    The Russian troops, along with French forces, are deployed  along the dividing line between Serbs and Muslims, and are led  by French Brigadier General Andre Soubirou, the commander of UN  forces in Sarajevo.    The commander said his forces will continue to carrying out  their peacekeeping mission and monitor the cease-fire.    Since the cease-fire agreement signed two weeks ago the  22-month-old war has subsided, as local people try to resume a  normal life.    A Sarajevo resident told XINHUA reporters that he felt much  safer now than ten days ago, and sees a gleam of hope for  Sarajevo "after Russia's efforts to solve the Bosnian conflict".</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Kozyrev to have talks in S Africa MR Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, is to visit South Africa later this week to discuss the normalisation of relations and boosting economic co-operation, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Kozyrev will meet President FW de Klerk, Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign minister, and Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, during a two-day visit on Friday and Saturday, a Russian foreign office spokesman said. The official added that economic co-operation between Russia and the South African republic had great potential. After decades of hostility, South Africa established consular ties with the former Soviet Union last November. It recognised Russia in December after the Union was abolished, but the two have yet to seal full diplomatic links. Mr de Klerk was due to go to Moscow in December, but political turmoil forced the postponement of the visit. Mr Kozyrev will visit Angola tomorrow and Thursday en route to South Africa and will have a day of talks in Egypt on Sunday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "NO": "Minorities as an Appendix of the State? </F> Hungarian Civic Party on Slovak-Hungarian Relations"]    [Text] Bratislava--The editorial office received a  statement from the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] yesterday that  states, among other things, that what is absolutely lacking is  an institutionalization of the solution to the problems of the  national minorities. Quite the contrary, the solution to these  problems is being transferred to extraparliamentary forums.  Individual components of power, political parties, and cultural  and social organizations mutually interfere in their powers.    MOS considers it alarming that leading government and  parliament representatives have endorsed the demands of the  assembly of Slovaks from southern Slovakia held at Surany on 2  January, which contain elements that are incompatible with the  principles of parliamentary democracy and whose spirit and tone  are reminiscent of the pre-1989 period. MOS does not identify  with the appeal issued by the Association of Towns and Villages  of Zitny Island because some parts of the appeal are not in  conformity with the party's program.    The statement observes that present power holders regard  ethnic minorities merely as an appendix of the state. All  citizens, including members of the minorities, are a source of  the sovereignty of the Slovak Republic, and, therefore, they  rightly demand legal and institutional guarantees of the  preservation of their distinctive identity.</p>

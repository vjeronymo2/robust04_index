			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Radio for new world order: The changing role of Voice of America When Voice of America, the radio service established and financed by the US government, began broadcasting on February 24 1942, the news was almost all bad; Japanese armies pressed onwards in the Pacific, and Germany moved deeper into Russia. Fifty years later, the news is good: the US has declared victory in the Cold War and Voice of America can claim at least part of the credit for what American politicians describe as a victory over 'imperial communism'. In its hour of triumph, however, VOA must face a new debate over its role, its usefulness and its cost. As new, independent broadcasters start up in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the need for the US to maintain its broadcasts is questioned by American critics, mainly from the right of the political spectrum. They always found it anomalous that the ideals of the free market should be spread by a Voice of America controlled by the US government. VOA, according to Mr Robert Coonrod, its deputy director, is already adapting both its programming and the way it delivers its message. 'It is clear to us from the anecdotal information we get that what audiences need and want is quite different today from what they were looking for three or four years ago,' he says. According to Mr Coonrod, basic news on what is happening on a day-to-day basis is being satisfied by the local media. He sees Voice of America's role as supplying interpretation, analysis and context. He cites a recent series on 'Democracy in Action', designed to provide practical information for citizens of a new democracy. At the same time, VOA is building on its traditional short-wave broadcasts into eastern Europe and seeking to reach a larger audience by providing higher quality FM broadcasts. To achieve this, it is developing affiliations with local broadcasters, which it supplies with programmes. But is VOA, which has never quite shaken off the image of being a weapon of the Cold War, ideally structured to meet these new needs? Like its UK counterpart, the World Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation, VOA is financed by the government. Unlike the BBC, it is administered by a government department, the US Information Agency. Mr Kim Elliott, director of VOA's research department, acknowledges that in many markets the BBC's reputation beats that of his own service. 'The BBC is considered a more reliable source of news than VOA,' he says. But Mr Coonrod believes this perception is based on a misunderstanding. He complains that VOA's critics confuse its news broadcasting, which is impartial and independent, with its editorials. In fulfilment of its charter, VOA must 'present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively'. It does so by means of a daily signed editorial, which is vetted beforehand by the State Department. In many markets the reputation of an international radio service is also linked to the strength of its radio signal. In the past, VOA has concentrated much of its effort on eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. It is much weaker than the BBC in regions such as the Middle East and Africa - where it lost its principal transmitter during the Liberian civil war. It is in the Far East, however, that the next main battleground may lie. Since the Tiananmen Square uprising in the spring of 1989, US politicians have sought ways of bringing more independent news to the airwaves of China. The argument has been over whether this should involve stepping up VOA's Chinese services, or setting up a new station like Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty. These stations, like Voice of America, are funded by the US government. But they provide more detailed news of the countries they broadcast to and are intended to act as 'surrogates' for the local radio stations. The State Department has argued that a Radio Free China would unnecessarily antagonise the Chinese government. VOA, meanwhile, argues that it could provide a much expanded coverage with the money needed to set up a new radio station. In December, a presidential taskforce chaired by Mr John Hughes, a former VOA director, came down in favour of creating a Radio Free Asia, principally targeted on China but also broadcasting to countries such as Burma and Vietnam. The proposal draws an enthusiastic response from Mr Malcolm S Forbes Jr, the magazine editor who, as chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting, oversees and allocates funds for Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe. 'We can have a tremendous impact for what amounts to pennies per person,' he says. But while the proposed Radio Free Asia may be seen as VOA's rival in the battle for pride of place in the broadcasting onslaught on China, Mr Forbes urges politicians to provide money for both. 'Some day, policymakers may understand that this is a very effective weapon that has been grossly underused. If the US wants to avoid another round of isolationism, this is an extraordinarily cost effective way to do it.'</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL ADDITIONS  </P> <P> Your roundup of hotels in my hometown, Manhattan, prompts me to submit a couple  of my own: the Salisbury Hotel, 123 West 57th St. -- pleasant surroundings,  prompt room service and a staff that caters to the clientele. Also the Gramercy  Park Hotel, 2 Lexington Ave. (at 21st Street), has Old World charm among the  skyscrapers.  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

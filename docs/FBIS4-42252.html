			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Over the last weekend in May Stockholm  DAGENS NYHETER in Swedish and Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in  Swedish published their respective opinion polls for May on  voter support for Sweden's political parties.    DAGENS NYHETER published on page A7 of its 28 May edition a  Dick Ljungberg article outlining the results of its poll, the  major findings of which it summarized as follows:    "The Green Ecology Party qualifies for representation in the  Riksdag, while New Democracy is on its way to being counted out  in DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's poll on party standings for May. The  four-party government coalition is losing ground now that less  than four months remain until the election."    The article goes on to provide the following percentage  figures for party standings:    ``The poll was carried out in the period 18-26 May and  comprises 1,014 telephone interviews.    ``Results, with changes since May in parentheses:    ``Moderate Coalition Party 20.0 (minus 1.5), Liberal Party  7.5 (unchanged), Center Party 6.0 (minus 1.5), Christian  Democratic Party 5.0 (plus 1.5), Social Democratic Party 50.0  (minus 1.0), Left Party 4.5 (plus 1.0), New Democracy 1.5 (minus  0.5), Green Ecology Party 4.0 (plus 1.0), and other parties 1.5  percent (plus 1.0). All changes are within the margin of  statistical error.    ``The number of undecided voters is 10 percent.''    SVENSKA DAGBLADET published on page 10 of its 29 May edition  a Sigfrid Leijonhufvud article setting out the findings of its  May opinion poll, which it outlined as follows:    ``Both the Social Democrats and the Left Party are making  gains and together the socialist bloc has a total of 55 percent  in SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo's [Swedish Institute for Opinion  Research] May poll. An election result along these lines would  at a stroke render the parties in the current coalition  government powerless.    ``In the April poll the government parties had in a month  moved up a little over 1 percent on the left-wing bloc. The  difference between the two blocs was 10.5 percentage points.  But this was clearly no new trend. According to SVENSKA  DAGBLADET/Sifo, the government parties only won 39.3 percent of  voter support in May and this widens the gulf to 15.7 percentage  points.    ``The socialist bloc strengthens its position in the run-up  to the election chiefly because the Social Democrats register  50.4 percent, an increase of 1.7 percentage points since the  April poll. It is also significant that the Left Party seems to  have broken the trend of decline since the 1991 election when  the party won 4.5 percent of the vote. With 4.6 percent in the  May poll as against 3.5 percent in the April poll, the Left  Party would clear the 4-percent threshold for representation in  the Riksdag if there were an election today.    ``When between 2 and 26 May Sifo asked its 3,708  interviewees  how they would vote if there were an election today, the  Moderate Coalition Party won 21.3 percent (22.1) of voter  support, the Center Party 7.3 (8.6), the Liberal Party 6.4  (6.8), the Christian Democratic Party 4.3 (4.2) the Green  Ecology Party 2.9 (2.9), New Democracy 2.0 (2.2), and other  parties 0.8 (1.0). Compared with the April figures given in  parentheses all the government parties with the exception of the  Christian Democratic Party have suffered losses. The Center  Party's losses of 1.3 percent are significant -- that is,  statistically reliable. Other changes reported in the poll are  not.''</p>

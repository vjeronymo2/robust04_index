			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY ON CAMBODIA  </P> <P> William Pfaff ("National Murder, In Cold Blood," Commentary, July 16) must have  had his head in the sand while in Southeast Asia.  </P> <P> I served in Vietnam on the Cambodian border from mid-1968 through mid-1970.  Before, during and after that period the North Vietnamese Army staged massive  attacks from inside Cambodia against U.S. and Vietnamese troops and civilian  population centers. The NVA forces received the bulk of their war materiel  through the port of Sihanoukville with the full approval and cooperation of  Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Thousands of American casualties resulted from  Sihanouk's assistance to the NVA. The May, 1970, incursion into Cambodia by  U.S. and Vietnamese forces saved countless allied lives.  </P> <P> MALCOLM K. KALP  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

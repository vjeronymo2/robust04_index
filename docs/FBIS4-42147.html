			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Josef Kirchengast: "Secret Meeting in Styria"] </F>   [Text] Muerzsteg -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni  spoke jokingly about a "white-brown plot." Under impressive  antlers in the Muerzsteg hunting lodge, the Austrian president's  summer residence, Thomas Klestil on Sunday [29 May] at noon  shook hands with his official guest, Museveni, and Sudanese  President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir shook hands.    The extremely serious background of the meeting, which was  kept secret until the last minute, was the civil war in southern  Sudan, where the Muslim central government has fought against  rebel troops for more than 10 years. The south, where  Christians and believers of natural religions live, has resisted  the policy of islamization that has been enforced by the north  in recent years. In Sudan, the Muslim law, the Shariah, is in  force.    According to estimates, between 500,000 and 1 million people  were killed in the war. According to Museveni, there are  approximately 300,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda. All peace  initiatives and mediation efforts, for instance in the framework  of the IGADD (Inter-Governmental Authority on Draught and  Development), have been unsuccessful. Members of the IGADD,  which deals with the consequences of draught and development  problems, are Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya.  <H5>  Excursion to a Mountain Pasture </H5>   Museveni said on 29 May that the meeting in Muerzsteg had  come about at the initiative of "friends in Uganda and Sudan."  Al-Bashir had arrived at the hunting lodge on 28 May in the  afternoon at the head of a government delegation, shortly after  Museveni. Several rounds of talks were held, and they had  dinner. On Sunday morning [29 May], the three presidents made  an excursion to a mountain pasture. According to unofficial  statements, the negotiations were very tough.    Al-Bashir told newsmen that there had been "productive  discussions on all areas of bilateral relations." They had  agreed to continue the talks within the framework of the IGADD.  Museveni said agreement had been reached on the framework of  the next negotiations.    In northern Sudan, which is primarily Muslim, the Shariah  also applies to non-Muslims. In the south, al-Bashir's  government has formally renounced this. Answering a question by  DER STANDARD, the Sudanese president said: "It is a fact that  the Shariah is not applied in the south. This could be the  basis of a peace agreement." He said the West was launching a  "negative campaign" against Sudan, and the West was uninformed  about the real situation in the country. Klestil hinted  subsequently that both sides had made "considerable progress" in  Muerzsteg. Austria's federal state structures were to a certain  extent viewed as a model. The next step should now be "to get  the rebels to the table."    The southern Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) is  divided into two wings, the "United" under Riek Machar and the  "Mainstream" under John Garang. Machar advocates full  independence for southern Sudan. Garang has meanwhile also come  closer to this position.    Museveni considers the secession of the south the "last way  out," whereas his foreign minister, Paul Ssemogerere, says it is  the "only solution."</p>

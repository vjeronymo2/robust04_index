			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Asian TVs may face EU dumping duties Provisional anti-dumping duties on colour television sets from five Asian countries and Turkey are likely to be announced shortly by the European Commission, in a move that threatens to raise prices for European consumers. The decision follows an investigation launched almost two years ago into small and portable television sets from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Turkey, and big screen sets from those countries plus China and South Korea. Industry officials say the level of anti-dumping duty could range from around 20 per cent for certain sets from Malaysia and South Korea to 30 per cent for sets from China and Thailand. The companies affected are the Japanese-owned Hitachi, Funai and Sanyo and the Korean-owned Goldstar and Samsung. The UK vigorously opposed the move, saying it was not in the interests of Europe's consumers. However, the European Commission can take a provisional decision on the issue without a vote by member states. The investigation was triggered by complaints from Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France, Europe's largest consumer electronics companies. They believed the manufacturers from the five Asian countries had increased EU market shares by pricing sets below the levels charged in their home markets. The commission has four months to complete its investigation from the moment it imposes provisional anti-dumping duties, though it may request a further two months if necessary. It must then either close the investigation or - if it decides dumping has occurred - ask the Council of Ministers to authorise definitive anti-dumping duties. These may vary from the provisional duties and may be applied retrospectively. Offending exporters may settle anti-dumping cases by agreeing to raise prices voluntarily. The council's voting rules were changed this year to require only a simple majority vote to impose dumping duties, instead of a qualified majority vote. The change was made at the insistence of France, which believed it would make it easier to protect European industries against low-priced imports. Critics of anti-dumping policies have alleged that the methods used to compare prices in the EU and in exporters' home markets are opaque and arbitrary, allowing wide scope to determine that dumping has taken place and injuring local manufacturers. According to Electronics Times, the trade magazine, the provisional duties on television sets will affect most of the countries under investigation. However, some companies will be exempt, including those which co-operated with the Commission's inquiries. European-owned manufacturers of television sets still dominate the EU market, though Philips and Thomson produce sets in Asia as well as in Europe.</p>

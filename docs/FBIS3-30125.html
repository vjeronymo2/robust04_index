The outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense  policy  since 1976, calls for the government to maintain security  arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up  Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale  invasions.    Aichi told a news conference that the panel will review the  outline in line with the debates of a similar advisory panel to  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which will hold an inaugural  session on Monday.    Aichi said, "We must review the outline from both the  medium-  and long-term points of view."    The Defense Agency panel, chaired by Aichi, comprises  parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Natsuo Yamaguchi, Vice  Defense Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama, four top uniformed officers  and two administrative officials, officials said.    Hosokawa's nine-member group will discuss ways to adapt to  the changed international situation following the end of the  Cold War.    Since his inauguration in August last year, Hosokawa has  advocated that with the Cold War now ended, Japan should trim  the size of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and review the outline.</p>

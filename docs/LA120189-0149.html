			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WBA FUND REACHES OUT TO JOE LOUIS' INDIGENT WIDOW  </P> <P> Martha Louis, the penniless widow of boxing great Joe Louis, is the first  recipient of alms from the World Boxing Council's Friendly Hand Foundation, a  new fund for old boxers and their families who have fallen on hard times.  </P> <P> "The often heard complaint against boxing is that the sport quickly abandons  its champions whose careers are over," said Stephen Crosson, treasurer and U.S.  spokesman for the Mexico City-based WBC.  </P> <P> "The actions of our foundation will demonstrate to the world that we are  serious about taking care of our own," Crosson said.  </P> <P> Martha Louis, an indigent patient in poor health at a Detroit nursing home,  will be wired $5,000 today, Crosson said.  </P> <P> "Part of this money will buy her some false teeth. It's a terribly sad  situation she is in. She is in her 80s and very sick. She has absolutely not a  cent to her name," Crosson said by phone from his Dallas home early today.  </P> <P> Crosson said he would wire the money to Dr. Stuart Kirschenbaum in Detroit, who  will be in charge of administering the funds. Kirschenbaum is the chairman of  the Michigan Athletic Commission and a WBC judge, Crosson said.  </P> <P> "One of the things we are considering is moving Mrs. Louis to Las Vegas, where  she has some friends," he said.  </P> <P> Louis held the world heavyweight boxing championship longer than any other man  -- from June, 1937, when he knocked out James Braddock in the eighth round,  until he retired in March, 1949.  </P> <P> He successfully defended his title 25 times -- 20 by knockout. He later failed  in two comeback attempts.  </P> <P> Crosson said that Louis had bad financial handlers throughout his career and  when he died on April 12, 1981, his widow was left with almost nothing.  </P> <P> Their story is not an unfamiliar one, the WBC said.  </P> <P> "Many other great champions of the world are now in the streets of cities all  over the world," Crosson said. "They had such bad money managers that they went  broke, especially in the '40s, '50s and '60s. There are some real horror  stories about great athletes who end up in rags on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> "I think in the last 15 or so years, boxers have realized they need to take  better care of their money."  </P> <P> The WBC Friendly Hand Foundation -- also known as the Martha Louis Fund -- is  based in Dallas and is soliciting nominations from its eight WBC continental  federations. It will distribute $125,000 to old boxers and their families in  1990, the WBC said.  </P> <P> Crosson said he has nominated Sandy Sadler, who won the world featherweight  championship in 1948, for a grant next year. Sadler, he said, "was found this  year walking the streets of New York in a very bad way."  </P> <P> "We want to help all those great former champions that gave all of us so many  thrills over the decades," Crosson said.  </P> <P> The WBC also established a pension plan which went into effect in November.  </P> <P> The WBC, organized in 1963, recognizes world titles in 16 weight divisions and  ranks the top 30 contenders in each. It also sanctions certain title fights.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirements of ADAAG 4.1.3(8) apply only to new construction. Alterations to existing buildings are covered by ADAAG 4.1.6 (Alterations) and alterations to qualified historic structures are covered by ADAAG 4.1.7 (Accessible Buildings: Historic Preservation). No changes have been made to either section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed guidelines for restricted and secured entrances in judicial, legislative, and regulatory facilities, and in detention and correctional facilities. The NPRM asked whether there were other types of State and local government facilities which have restricted and secured entrances, and if so, whether the guidelines should require that one or more of the restricted or secured entrances in those facilities be accessible. The NPRM also requested information on the cost impact of such a requirement. Commenters recommended several facilities where restricted and secured entrances should be accessible such as colleges, universities, museums, libraries, performing areas in auditoriums, laboratories in research facilities, police stations, social service offices, and National Guard weapons storage areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The restricted and secured entrances of the facilities recommended by the commenters generally are public entrances already covered by ADAAG 4.1.3(8) (Entrances) and are addressed by existing requirements for accessibility. Additionally, some of the commenters were referring to interior doors and accessible routes, not exterior entrances covered by this section. The interim final rule contains appendix language recommending that accessible entrances be distributed among all types of entrances. Additional appendix material has been included to clarify some of the different types of entrances that should be considered. Specific requirements for restricted and secured entrances are addressed in ADAAG 11.5 (Restricted and Secured Entrances). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM asked whether the guidelines should include a distribution requirement for accessible entrances and, if so, should such a provision require that an accessible entrance be located on each side of the building where entrances are provided. The NPRM suggested a requirement based on criteria such as proximity to elevators, information centers or public streets, and asked whether a distribution requirement should apply only to buildings above a certain size. Finally, the NPRM asked whether such a distribution provision should apply to all types of State and local government facilities and what additional cost, if any, would be associated with such a requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters were divided on the question of whether a distribution requirement should be added to the guidelines. Several of the commenters favoring a distribution provision stated that accessible entrances should be provided on each side of a building where entrances are provided. Some commenters stated that accessible entrances should be provided close to exterior facilities and building amenities and services. Other commenters stated that the function and occupancy of a building should be the determining factors in the location of accessible entrances, and that architectural programming should be used to determine those locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of commenters stated that size should not be a determining factor for such a requirement and that any requirement for distribution should apply to all State and local government facilities. Very few commenters offered specific criteria for determining the minimum size of a building to be included in such a provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ADAAG 4.3.2 (Accessible Route: Location) currently requires that an accessible route connect public transportation stops, parking, passenger loading zones, public streets and public sidewalks to an accessible entrance and accessible spaces within a building. ADAAG 4.6.2 (Parking and Passenger Loading Zones: Location) requires that parking spaces be located closest to an accessible entrance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous variables must be considered when establishing a distribution requirement. These variables include: the size of the building, planned entrances on more than one side of the building, the distance between accessible entrances, the distance from entrances to exterior facilities, and the distance from entrances to interior amenities and services. The provision for principal public entrances may achieve distribution of accessible entrances around large buildings with multiple entrances. Appendix language has been added recommending that accessible entrances be included on each side of a facility where entrances are planned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1.3(16)&blank;Building Signage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM asked whether State and local government facilities should be required to provide tactile or audible directories, audible signs, or other wayfinding devices for persons with vision impairments. Comment was sought on the types of facilities that should provide such directories and signs. Additionally, cost information and information about the reliability of currently available technologies was sought. The majority of commenters supported providing equal access to information about the accessible services, activities and facilities for persons with vision impairments. However, there was no clear consensus on the best means of achieving access. Numerous commenters, including individuals with vision impairments and sign manufacturers, considered tactile directories impractical. Commenters noted that although audible directories and audible signs for wayfinding may be viable options, there may be capital and maintenance costs associated with this technology. Commenters raised concerns regarding vandalism, maintenance, and updating temporary information, as well as the time required to read tactile directories. Very little cost data was received. Some manufacturers and researchers responded that the technology for providing effective communication is available and it has many applications such as listing stations in new transportation facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A majority of commenters suggested that alternatives to requiring audible or tactile directories such as providing a fully staffed information or security desk, a telephone in lieu of an accessible directory, and a hand-held Braille directory should be included in the guidelines. Commenters representing State and local governments, local organizations representing people with disabilities, and design professionals suggested that establishing a performance standard for providing effective communication would provide greater flexibility. In their view, a performance standard would permit a number of options to be considered depending on the type, level of public access to, and use of buildings and facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a number of groups representing persons with vision impairments suggested that no further requirements should be added. They commented that merely asking directions was the most efficient and convenient means of obtaining needed information for both blind and sighted individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although commenters favored various options which may have the potential for providing effective communication, no provisions for audible directories, audible signs or other wayfinding devices are included at this time. The Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA require State and local governments to ensure that persons with vision impairments can obtain information about the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities unless it can be demonstrated that such action would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. See 28 CFR 35.163(a) and 28 CFR 35.164.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM asked about individuals' experiences with raised and incised characters on tactile signs. An overwhelming majority of commenters, including signage manufacturers, stated that raised characters are more readable than incised characters and the guidelines should not be revised to include a provision permitting incised characters. Persons with vision impairments stated that incised characters are very difficult to read.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Foundation for the Blind was concerned that changes to the technical requirements for tactile signage were being contemplated solely on the basis that raised characters, as opposed to incised, may be more costly. In the view of designers, certain manufacturers, State and local governments, and persons with vision impairments, the technical requirements for tactile signage should be based on the readability of signs. A commenter representing the engraving industry encouraged the Board to sponsor further research to evaluate appropriate technical specifications for incised characters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM also asked questions regarding the impact of current ADAAG requirements on engraving businesses that primarily manufacture building signage. Comments from industry representatives indicated that the technologies for producing tactile signs are readily available and that the acquisition costs are not prohibitive, even for small to medium-sized business. A number of manufacturers pointed out that they could supplement or modify existing equipment to produce tactile signs for $50 to $2000, and that minimal training was required. With respect to the signs, one commenter estimated that the costs of certain custom tactile signs with raised characters could equal or double the cost of the same sign with incised characters. Building owners and design professionals commented that signs with incised characters are more difficult to maintain than signs with raised characters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

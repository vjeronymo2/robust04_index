"The treaty of friendship, good neighbourly relations and  cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Georgia which is expected to be signed during the first official  visit to Georgia by the Russian president on February 3-4 will  be epoch-making for Georgia," Georgian Ambassador to Russia  Valeryan Advadze said.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Advadze said "we  have gone a long way while preparing the treaty. We have  overcome many obstacles on our way. But today we are on the  last lap. This has become possible due to the efforts of  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard  Shevardnadze."    He stressed that Yeltsin's visit to independent Georgia will  signify that "it has been recognised by the great neighbour."  "The upcoming visit of the Russian president to Georgia will  help restore human relations between the people of the two  countries," the ambassador said.    During the visit, the two leaders also plan to sign  agreements on trade and economic cooperation, on the status of  Russian border troops in Georgia, on cooperation in  transportation, on the resettlement of refugees and other  documents.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Italy bows to foreign bankers over Efim debt THE Italian government yesterday gave way to sustained pressure from foreign bankers over the handling of L3,500bn (Pounds 1.65bn) worth of debts of Efim, the state industrial holding put into voluntary liquidation in July. The government backed down on its proposal to cover Efim's borrowings by issuing bonds in lire or Ecus at interest rates below the market. This would have meant creditors receiving about 80 per cent of their principal and interest otherwise due. Instead the Amato government, in an effort to restore its credibility in the international markets over the two-month-old Efim saga, offered to pay interest at the same level as when the debts were contracted. Foreign bankers were angry at the lack of original information when Efim was placed in voluntary liquidation with debts totalling L8,500bn. This latest development occurred as the holding company's accounts for 1991 were released showing the financial health of Efim was deteriorating faster than publicly admitted before the government's decision to place the group into voluntary liquidation. Losses for 1991 were L1,181bn against the previous year's loss of L374.2bn; while estimates up to mid-July suggest losses running at L900bn. Efim at one stage had talked of the 1991 results holding losses down to L271bn.</p>

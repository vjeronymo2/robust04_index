"The ban on flights over the F.R.Y. is still in force for  some Turkish airlines, but the talks are underway and we hope  the matter will be resolved to mutual satisfaction," said Branko  Bilbija, the director of the Federal Flight Control Office.    He said that several national airlines tried to avoid paying  the office's service fees by invoking international sanctions  against the F.R.Y.    In the overall debt of millions of dollars incurred to the  Federal Flight Control Office, Macedonia's share is said to  amount to 2.5 million dollars.    Bilbija underscored that no U.N. Security Council's  resolution banned flying through the F.R.Y. airspace, using or  paying for the services of the Belgrade flight control.    He said that charging the airlines for their services was  the  only source of the office's income, which they spend on  equipment and wages. Owing to that, he added, they maintained  very high technical, technological and security standards.    The Federal Flight Control Office report said that during  1993, 150,000 aircraft owned by 150 world airlines had used the  F.R.Y. air routes.    In May 1992, the U.N. Security Council banned international  flights of the Yugoslav JAT Airlines.</p>

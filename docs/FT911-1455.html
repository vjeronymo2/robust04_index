			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Riders on images of reality: Advertising's switch from the glitz of the 1980s ADVERTISING is usually attacked for making life look artificially attractive. This week, though, the Nalgo public-service union has been berated for running advertisements that allegedly make life seem unrealistically unattractive. The Nalgo campaign, which focused on public-sector issues such as education standards and hospital funding, caused a furore among the union's political foes. During prime minister's question time Mr John Major criticised it for using 'phoney pictures and fake statistics'. The crux of the criticism is that Nalgo's advertisements, created by the BMP DDB Needham advertising agency, used models rather than real people to illustrate political arguments. One advert showed a picture of a man with Down's syndrome above the slogan: 'One of the 480,000 people made homeless last year.' The man - or so the tabloid press told its readers - actually lives at home with his mother. Nalgo, which can barely disguise its glee at getting so much free publicity, claims it simply used standard advertising techniques to discuss real social troubles. The controversy could be dismissed as yet another bout in the battle between the political parties, but it comes at a time when the use of 'realistic' imagery is becoming increasingly important in advertising. Traditionally, advertising has been anything but realistic. Agencies have painted pictures of an impossibly perfect world - full of middle-class mums with whiter-than-white washing - to which consumers could aspire if they switched shampoos or bought a new brand of dog biscuits. Images of 'real life' mainly appeared in campaigns for public-sector advertisers such as trade unions, political parties or charities. Agencies generally used realism in their work for conventional clients as a shock tactic. Last summer Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, which sees itself as one of the most iconoclastic London agencies, deliberately focused a campaign for Fuji film on racism and mental handicap because it knew those issues would be controversial. Now realism is creeping into mainstream advertising. Sometimes it takes the form of a focus on the negative aspects of life, as does the Nalgo campaign. A recent television campaign for Bisto gravy broke away from the 'nuclear family' stereotype of traditional advertising by featuring a soap opera-style saga of a divorced couple and their son. The new Kleenex tissue campaign, which starts on Monday, is directed by Mike Leigh, the doyen of kitchen-sink television dramatists, and reflects the more mundane side of family life. Another form of realism is to use real people rather than models in adverts. In the past the only 'real' people to appear were celebrities but, in growing numbers, campaigns now feature 'ordinary' people. The current Wrangler jeans commercial stars the Rev Bill Shergold, the motorcycle-mad vicar who founded the 59 Bikers' Club, clad, of course, in Wrangler denim. The new Midland Bank campaign is composed of a series of snapshots of Midland account holders as they describe how their financial fortunes have fluctuated through their lives. A recent commercial for Radion soap powder used footage from people's home videos. BMP, the agency behind the Nalgo adverts, uses home movies depicting domestic dramas and disasters in its commercials for Scottish Amicable insurance. Mr Marcus Hayes, BMP's account director for Scottish Amicable, believes the growing use of realism is a reflection of consumers' disillusion with the glitzy values of the bullish 1980s. Aspirational advertising, he says, is no longer as effective at a time of economic recession and of growing concern about environmental issues. Realism may be more in tune with the mood of the moment, but it is also more vulnerable to criticism than the old school of aspirational advertising. Some advertisers have come under fire for exploiting social ills for commercial ends. Fuji was accused of manipulating the plight of the victims of racial oppression and of the mentally handicapped to sell film. And, as Nalgo discovered, the question of accuracy becomes highly sensitive when advertisements deal with real social issues. As the political parties polish up their advertising strategies in preparation for the next general election, the controversy over realistic advertising seems set to run and run.</p>

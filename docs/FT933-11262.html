			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Sounds of the cinema The success of Steven Spielberg's film Jurassic Park has brought reflected glory to a three-year old Belfast technology company. Audio Processing Technology, which has a staff of just 20, is providing the vital component in the cinema sound system which gives digital, rather than analogue, dinosaur roars. APT has developed a way of compressing the soundtrack of the film so that it can be put on a compact disc which is synchronised to play alongside the film. The idea for digital sound first came from Spielberg himself, who wanted to explore the idea of a superior soundtrack to accompany his blockbuster. Spielberg, along with Universal Studios and others, was instrumental in setting up the Californian company Digital Theatre Systems which builds the cinema playback systems which incorporate APT's technology Demand for the sound systems has grown to such an extent that APT's managing director Stephen Smyth believes that there will be more than 5,000 cinemas using the system by the end of year - as far apart as the US, Japan and Europe. The compression algorithm squeezes the sound into one quarter of the space usually needed by removing the redundancy in the soundtrack. This means the six-channel stereo soundtrack can be supplied on CD. The technique is not dissimilar to that used by Sony to compress music on to its mini-disc system. Smyth points out the chips can also be used in the transmission of calls over the latest digital telephone lines or the preparation of soundtracks for television programmes. Cinemas not equipped with the digital system can still show Jurassic Park because, as is conventional in film recording, each film has the analogue soundtrack of blood-curdling screams and the pounding of prehistoric feet optically recorded alongside the pictures. A further advantage of this, reassures Smith, is that should the latest digital equipment break down, the projection would automatically revert to the analogue soundtrack.</p>

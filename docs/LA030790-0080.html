			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS SATISFIED WRIGHT IS MAN FOR THE JOB;  </P> <P> MISL: ZORAN KARIC'S FREQUENT RUN-INS WITH COACH RON NEWMAN, CONCERNS ABOUT  UPCOMING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND LACK OF DEFENSE SPURRED TEAM TO DEAL  SECOND-LEADING SCORER TO CLEVELAND.  </P> <P> At the very least, Socker Coach Ron Newman's headache is a little smaller now  that forward Zoran Karic has been traded to the Cleveland Crunch for Paul  Wright.  </P> <P> Karic and Newman never got along. Wright and Newman do. Karic never wanted to  play Newman's brand of soccer. Wright does.  </P> <P> Yet the trade, the final wrinkles of which were ironed out Tuesday by Socker  President Ron Cady, does beg the question of whether Wright can pull the same  weight on the field as Karic, who departs with 36 points (22 goals, 14  assists), second only to Branko Segota's 41.  </P> <P> Perhaps that is why Newman's reaction is guarded.  </P> <P> "Very pleased," he said. "Mixed emotions at the same time. We spent a lot of  time on Zoran, and I've always respected his ability. But I was very  disappointed last year when we lost Paul Wright."  </P> <P> Wright, with 15 goals and 11 assists in 37 games, is not yet as dangerous  offensively as Karic. But Wright has the capability and, perhaps more  important, is willing to run the length of the carpet and play defense, a  deficiency of Karic's.  </P> <P> The Sockers have great respect for Karic's skills, evidenced by Cady's  insistence that the deal include a clause stating Cleveland would not trade him  to a Western Division team before the conclusion of this season.  </P> <P> "We wanted to make sure this was not part of a three-player trade, and he would  end up in St. Louis or Tacoma as part of a larger deal," Socker owner Ron  Fowler said. "That was finally worked out."  </P> <P> Karic could not be reached for comment, but Cady said Karic's reaction was one  of surprise, not bitterness.  </P> <P> A factor in the trade, said Fowler, was Karic's salary. Sources say he makes  about $50,000 and is looking next season for a significant increase, which  would put him ahead of veterans Brian Quinn and Kevin Crow.  </P> <P> "I'm not about to move somebody over them," Fowler said. "We felt we weren't  going to be able to sign Zoran for next year based upon the numbers he was  looking for."  </P> <P> Karic's repeated clashes with Newman didn't help his cause. Newman kicked him  out of practice last week for refusing to participate in training drills and  probably would have suspended him if the Sockers weren't desperate for healthy  bodies. To Newman, Wright is an attractive alternative.  </P> <P> "It's so hard to know exactly what kind of performance you're going to get from  Zoran," Newman said. "We felt we were making headway with him, then he'd come  out and make this crazy statement that he didn't want to do any extra training.  That irritates you.  </P> <P> "With Paul, you know exactly what you're going to get."  </P> <P> Wright, whose contract runs through the end of this season, appears happy with  the trade.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful to be back," Wright said in a prepared statement. "I think I've  matured as a player here in Cleveland, and I look forward to coming back to the  San Diego fans."  </P> <P> Used exclusively as a forward in the past, Wright's role might soon change.  Newman said he will try him at the midfield position and possibly move Segota,  a midfielder, to forward. That would allow Segota the opportunity to take more  shots and make use of Wright's defensive strengths.  </P> <P> Whatever the tactical changes, Fowler said he hopes Wright's arrival will  provide a spark for the Sockers (16-21), currently six games out of first.  </P> <P> "I'd like to have less conversation and more productivity," Fowler said. "I  think this puts a number of people in the position to put up or shut up."  </P></p>

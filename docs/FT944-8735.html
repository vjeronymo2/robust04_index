			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Personal View: Time to adjust our sets again UK broadcasting in the 1990s was to be about competition, choice and quality, according to the government which put this trinity on the cover of a white paper published six years ago this month. Almost half way through the decade, what do we think of it so far? There is certainly more competition, most notably in the sale of advertising between ITV and Channel 4, but the firm grip of the BBC/ITV duopoly is far from broken. A fifth terrestrial channel was conceived in 1990 as the single most important initiative the government could take to introduce market disciplines. But arguably the only competition Channel 5 has created to date is between the departments of national heritage and trade and industry over what to do with it. The contrast with the carefully-considered and well-timed introduction of Channel 4 is stark. As for choice, the continued absence of Channel 5 means that 85 per cent of UK viewers still have only four channels. The 15 per cent who enjoy cable and satellite would have done so with or without a Broadcasting Act in 1990. On ITV, it seems that most viewers, advertisers and the Independent Television Commission, the channel's watchdog, would agree that, despite its strong popular drama, the channel has become less diverse - longer series in fewer genres, no single plays, less investigative reporting, and so on. Was it really for this that Britain's television industry had to endure the trauma and disruption of the 1990 Broadcasting Act that followed the white paper? It looks scant reward for the thousands of jobs lost, businesses broken up and training schemes closed down. If the outcome has short-changed viewers and set back the global prospects of what should be a leading British industry, can anyone honestly be surprised? The main beneficiary of the 1990 Act has been the Treasury, which has cleaned up like some great croupier in Whitehall. It raked in almost Pounds 360m in 1993 as rent on the ITV franchises - roughly 25 per cent of ITV's 1993 revenues, and equivalent to 75 per cent of the industry's annual pre-tax profits after bid payments. It should do even better this year. No wonder ITV companies put shareholders second and viewers third. Some advocate a fresh Broadcasting Act to undo the damage. Others want another auction of ITV franchises in 1998, to replace the existing arrangements that will allow current licensees to negotiate 10-year extensions. I do not share these views. What is done is done. It would have been better in 1989 if the government had introduced a modest Bill and then left the competent regulatory authorities to get on with the job, but it did not and the industry has moved on. What I would now like to see, with one exception, is pragmatic regulatory change rather than new legislation. There is a need, for example, to protect the five regional stations, from Channel to Grampian, following the government's decision to relax unilaterally the rules on mergers between ITV stations. No such protection is afforded by the Broadcasting Act and they may soon be required by the larger companies to contribute to network costs in proportion to their share of advertising revenue. I doubt any of these small broadcasters would then be viable, and the regulator needs to be free to make arrangements to ensure the survival of diverse services. The one exception needing legislative change is the widely discredited ownership rules in the 1990 Broadcasting Act that are unnecessarily restricting British investment at home and discouraging UK multi-media companies from competing in world markets. A large number of interested parties is seeking significant legislative changes that can affect readers, viewers and listeners nationwide. The Department of National Heritage has already canvassed views and should share its findings soon. The key may be to frame cross-media ownership rules that recognise that UK markets consist of many audiences by type and location. These audiences could then be assessed for the influence upon them of various media, with appropriate and more liberal thresholds being applied to ensure that they are offered adequate choice. Stephen Dorrell, national heritage secretary, should publish a white paper in the new year, legislate as soon as possible - and then leave the broadcasters and regulators to go in search of the competition, choice and quality that the 1990s were supposed to be about.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the  state of Palestine and PLO Executive Committee chairman, has  demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails  and deployment of international observers in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip before 4 July in accordance with the agreement signed  by the PLO and Israel on 4 May.    At a meeting last night with ambassadors of the European  Union states in Tunis, brother President Abu-'Ammar called for  lifting the restrictions imposed by the Israeli forces on the  movement of Palestinian officials on the crossings that link the  West Bank with the Jericho area and Gaza.    Informed Palestinian sources said brother President  Abu-'Ammar emphasized the importance of realizing these demands  before his return to the Palestinian self-rule areas, and the  importance of expediting the assistance promised by the donor  countries for reconstruction and construction in these areas.    He said he cannot return to Gaza and Jericho before  receiving  this assistance.    The source said the ambassadors of the European Union  promised, at the meeting which was held at their request, to  convey the demands of brother President Abu-'Ammar regarding  assistance to their governments.</p>

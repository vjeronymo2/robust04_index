			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H5>  THE CITIZEN </H5>   ANC Instigates kwaZulu Showdown -- "KwaZulu is heading, we  are afraid, for a showdown instigated by the ANC [African  National Congress] and its allies," points out the page 6  editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25 March.  Justice Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral  Commission (IEC), "whose visits to Bophuthatswana preceded the  toppling of Mr Mangope, has descended on Ulundi to demand the  cooperation of the kwaZulu Government in the running of the  election." "Clearly the ANC is plotting what it calls a popular  uprising to get rid of Chief Buthelezi; the government is  sending more troops into Natal in case of trouble; Mr Justice  Kriegler is intent on getting the election run the TEC  [Transitional Executive Council] way, and Chief Buthelezi and  the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] are making concessions, but not  enough to stave off intervention" from the TEC.  <H5>  THE STAR </H5>   Zwelithini Can Establish Cooperation in Kwazulu --  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28 March in a page 14  editorial believes the "dire situation in kwaZulu/Natal has come  about primarily because Buthelezi and his Cabinet will not use  their power to ensure a free vote and a free boycott. The chief  minister's reassurances to the contrary are mocked by armed  supporters occupying stadiums; the situation is untenable.  Something is going to have to give, and the question is not  whether an election will take place in the province, but at what  cost." THE STAR believes Zulu King Zwelithini can establish the  "requisite degree of stability and co-operation" in kwaZulu "if  he were to make an independent and visionary intervention,  persuading his subjects to allow those who want to vote to do so  freely, and those who wish to stay away to exercise the same  freedom of choice, peacefully."  <H5>  BUSINESS DAY </H5>   TEC Must Intervene 'Legally' in Kwazulu Issue --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 March in a page 6  editorial says "KwaZulu seems likely to have freedom imposed on  it this week. The question will be whether government and the  Transitional Executive Council can do so legally and relatively  peacefully before ANC revolutionaries do it for them." "It is  probably too much to hope that the TEC will admonish ANC leaders  for their increasingly militant threats to take matters into  their own hands. It is not just the hotheads in the ANC Natal  leadership who are threatening to overthrow KwaZulu leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi. And Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's senior TEC  representative who announced the decision to depose the  Bophuthatswana administration, leaves no room for doubt that the  ANC's demand is free political activity or else." BUSINESS DAY  believes Buthelezi's continued rule in the "kwaZulu homeland  will depend on the degree to which he, his administration and  his party assist the democratic process." However, securing  political freedom in Natal should be through orders "given by  civil authority, not militants and revolutionaries."    Eroded Police Morale, Need for Restructuring -- "Police  morale is being eroded on two fronts -- at the top, where  long-serving, mostly right-wing officers worry about their  future under a new government, and in the lower ranks, where  policemen are frequently killed or injured in the many-sided  political conflict," notes a second editorial on the same page.  Now, if the Goldstone interim report implicating senior  policemen in gun running and hit squad activities are is upheld  by the international inquiry, "the way will be open for a purge  and substantial restructuring." In the restructuring there are  "strong reasons to support the suggestion by Institute of  Defence Policy executive director Jakkie Cilliers that the  police's public order function should be transferred to a  separate arm of the new national defence force. The SAP [South  African Police] can then devote itself to community policing and  fighting crime, which have been badly neglected because of the  force's quasi-military role in the political turmoil."  <H5>  SOWETAN </H5>   De Klerk Must Take Necessary Steps in KwaZulu Issue --  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 28 March in a page 12  editorial says President de Klerk is "naive" to believe the mere  assurances of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi will ensure free and  fair elections in kwaZulu and the rest of Natal. "The IFP's  political options have been reduced to the far-fetched concept  of a sovereign Zulu kingdom and the hope that international  mediation would deliver on its constitutional demands. A  successful poll in Natal next month would mean a guaranteed ANC  victory and a power shift away from Ulundi. The wrecking of the  elections in Natal is therefore an imperative for the IFP." "De  Klerk's political dilemma is understandable. He does not want  to be seen as a pawn in an alleged ANC scheme to make kwaZulu  ungovernable. His responsibilities as head of Government,  however, demand that he takes the necessary steps to ensure free  and fair elections and end the bloodshed in Natal."</p>

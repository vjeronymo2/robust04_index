			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Bentsen calls for single bank regulator Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday he would press on with plans to bring all responsibility for bank regulation under a single body, despite harsh criticism of the plan from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr Greenspan had claimed that the plan, which would strip the Fed of direct involvement in bank regulation, would make it harder for the central bank to carry out its other functions. In response, Mr Bentsen said yesterday: 'Bank regulation is not essential to the conduct of monetary policy.' Under the Clinton administration's proposed new regulatory system, the Fed would 'retain its existing authority over the discount window and payment system,' he added. The Fed fears that, if stripped of regulation, it will no longer have immediate first-hand knowledge of commercial banks' activities, making it difficult to judge how banks are responding to changes in monetary policy. Mr Bentsen said, though, that the proposed new Federal Banking Commission would make all information available to the Fed, allowing it to do its job unhindered. 'We have carefully considered the Fed's arguments, but we find them unpersuasive,' he said.</p>

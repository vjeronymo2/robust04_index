			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Farming land investment brings higher returns Investment in agricultural land last year generated the highest returns for fund managers in 14 years, according to a survey by Savills land agents. Institutional investors saw a 16.3 per cent return from agricultural holdings, which includes profits from the sale of land. Mr Jim Ward, head of agricultural research at Savills, said the rate of investment income from agricultural land had outperformed commercial property by 5 percentage points over the past six years. However, property returns are still well below those in the equity market, where pension funds earned 28 per cent last year. About 30 per cent of Britain's farmland is owned by large landowners such as the Church of England, the National Trust and the Queen, with financial institutions holding about 1 per cent. Financial institutions moved heavily into farmland investments in the 1970s when inflation was high and farm incomes were rising rapidly. But most have since been seeking to reduce their holdings. Most fund managers are concerned that land values will drop over the long term as a result of Common Agricultural Policy reforms which will cut farm produce prices. Savills believes institutions sold 45,000 acres of farmland last year. The survey is drawn from a sample of 49 financial institutions which between them own 202,000 acres of agricultural land - down from a peak of 550,000 acres in 1984. Mr John Clamp of Combined Actuarial Performance Services said: 'A fair number of funds are seeking to reduce their exposure to property.' The small significance of farmland in many institutional portfolios can mean that fund managers devote little time to improving its value, Mr Ward said. Mr Henry Richards, director at the Land Improvement group, a company specialising in rural investment which owns 24,000 acres of farmland, believes that the way to make the investments profitable is to spend a lot of time boosting land values by gaining planning consents. 'A lot of institutions see agricultural land as an income stream, but you must look at it in a more imaginative, creative way to make it pay a dividend,' he said. Land prices are 20 per cent lower in real terms than they were in 1980, but land values rose slightly last year with the upturn in farmers' earnings. Institutional purchases of farmland dried up last year and fund managers bought only 2 per cent of farm properties compared with 38 per cent in 1992. 'The improvement in farm incomes means that tenant farmers are now very keen to buy farmland, and over 40 per cent of sales were to tenants last year,' said Mr Ward.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: Vard plans to spin off ferry division Vard, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, plans to spin off its ferry division into a separate company with an Oslo bourse listing and put the company up for sale. Vard said the reason behind the move was to help run down the interest-bearing debt of the holding company, estimated at about Dollars 185m. In 1993, the holding company, which owns the ferry division, spent NKr73m (Dollars 9.9m) on debt servicing, down from NKr107m in 1992. It received bareboat hire payments from the ferry division of NKr118m, against NKr114m in 1992. The company said it did not intend to retain any shareholding in the new company - in contrast to an earlier plan in which it planned to maintain a stake of up to 30 per cent in the ferry business. Vard has appointed Elcon Securities and Sundal Collier, two Norwegian stockbrokers, to find buyers for the ferry division. Vard reckons it could take up to three months to complete a disposal. In 1993, the ferry division saw pre-tax profits, after bareboat hire payments, decline to NKr78.6m from NKr123.4m in 1992.</p>

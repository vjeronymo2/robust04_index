He claimed that, since his overthrow by the Army on 30  September 1991, the repression has led to over 5,000 deaths.    "The putschists and their international allies want to  condemn the Haitian people to a slow death," the president  continued. Speaking at a press conference, Father Aristide  stated that these "international allies" were in fact "narcotics  traffickers" who were supplying the putschists with money and  arms to maintain their "narcotics regime." According to the  Haitian president, some 40 to 48 tonnes of cocaine pass through  Haiti each year, with a street value of $1.2 billion.  <H5>  Omnipresent Army </H5>   Army chiefs and the Haitian police must leave "immediately,"  Father Aristide told the Commission. For the putschists, the 67  percent of the population that elected him into presidential  office "must be reduced to a group of men and women condemned to  accept neocolonialism or death."    With 7,000 men, the Army "absorbs more than 40 percent of  the  national budget." In the opinion of the deposed president, the  legal system no longer functions because the weapons of the  putschists are "constantly aimed at" the judges. Journalists  have been forced underground.    "The colonization that followed in the wake of Christopher  Columbus led to the genocide of the American Indians. Ninety  million of them were lost in the first 100 years following the  arrival of the explorer from Genoa. In Haiti the genocide is  continuing," added president Aristide. "Some 300,000 Haitians  are displaced in their country. Moreover, Haitian political  refugees who try to enter the United States by sea are arrested  just off the coast of Haiti and are delivered to the putschist  murderers or die at sea," Mr. Aristide continued.    President Aristide told journalists that he was opposed to a  UN Security Council draft resolution that would considerably  strengthen the embargo against Haiti with the cooperation of all  parties but which did not explicitly mention the deposed  president. He intends to raise the matter with UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Saturday in New York.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Pakistan rethinks bearer bond sale THE State Bank of Pakistan, the country's central bank, has cancelled plans to sell bearer bonds in the US and is deferring their sale in other countries after fears the bonds could be used to launder drugs money. The bank's advertisements for the foreign currency bearer certificates, which appeared last week, said bondholders would not have to pay income tax or wealth tax. The advertisements also said: 'No questions asked about source of funds' and 'No identity to be disclosed'. These ads prompted Senator John Kerry of Massachussetts to write to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr Richard Breeden, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking that the sale of the bonds be stopped because they could be used to launder money. An aide to Senator Kerry said the SEC was considering moves to prevent the sale of the bonds in the US. It was also learned that Fed inspectors are examining records at US branch offices of the National Bank of Pakistan. A source at the Pakistan State Bank said yesterday the bonds, due to go on sale today had been withdrawn from the US. The sale elsewhere had been deferred to ensure compliance with local laws. The bonds, denominated in US dollars, D-Marks, sterling and Yen, went on sale in Pakistan on March 15.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Tec sets up one-stop shop for training and recruiting BIRMINGHAM Training and Enterprise Council is setting up an independent company to run a one-stop shop catering for the training and recruitment needs of manufacturers in the city. The move, seen as innovative in Tec circles, follows an agreement reached not only with the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands and Birmingham City Council, but also with leading industrial employers in the area such as GKN, IMI and Rover. The one-stop shop, agreement for which was finally reached yesterday, is designed to provide a focus for industry. An employer wishing to recruit would be able to establish quickly the availability of skills, while people looking for work could find out what training courses were available. The shop, which will be set up at the Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Small Heath, will also offer training services to employers seeking to develop their business. The shop will become the base of the industrial activity of Birmingham Tec - one of the largest in the UK with an annual budget of Pounds 45m  - in an attempt to avoid the fragmentation of training caused by the large number of companies and training organisations active in the sector.</p>

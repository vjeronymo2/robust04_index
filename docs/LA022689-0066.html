			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT WON'T RUBBER-STAMP DEATH PENALTIES  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court, which had one of the nation's highest reversal  rates for death sentences when liberals were in the majority, now is well below  the national average.  </P> <P> That should not surprise anyone who remembers the 1986 elections, when Chief  Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two colleagues were voted out of office mainly  over death penalty reversals. But what may surprise some members of the public  is that the new, conservative-dominated court is still finding errors in a  substantial number of death penalty cases.  </P> <P> The court, under Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, has overturned 19 of 66 death  sentences, or 28.8%, since appointees of Gov. George Deukmejian gained a 5-2  majority in March, 1987. Sixteen of the 19 were unanimous.  </P> <P> The Bird court, in about seven years of death penalty rulings, reversed 64 of  68 death sentences, or 94.1%.  </P> <P> The average for death sentence reversals by all state courts is about 41% since  1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld death penalty laws in a number of  states, said the NAACP Legal Defense Fund Inc., which tracks capital cases. The  reversal rate for 1988 was 40%.  </P> <P> The report also showed that some Southern states have had 12-year reversal  rates much higher than that of the current California court, even though nearly  all of the post-1976 executions have been in the South. For example,  Mississippi courts have overturned 51.58% of the death sentences, Florida  45.87% and Alabama 47.31%. The lowest reversal rate listed was 9.43% in  Virginia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Factors at Work  </P> <P> The figures suggest that death penalty reversals are affected by other factors  besides the ideology of a state's highest court, such as the relative ease or  difficulty of getting a death sentence at trial, the quality of trial judges  and lawyers and the peculiarities of a state's law.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers say that many of Florida's reversals, for instance, involve  cases in which a judge has imposed a death sentence over the jury's objections,  an option that does not exist in California.  </P> <P> The statistics do not include later reversals of state court rulings by federal  courts. Lawyers say that 40% to 50% of state death sentences in the last decade  have been set aside by federal courts, which have yet to review any substantial  number of California cases.  </P> <P> The California figures, on the other hand, support the view that a conservative  court is much more likely to uphold a death sentence than is a liberal court.  But the statistics, and examinations of individual cases, also indicate that  the Lucas court has not entirely repudiated the Bird court's work.  </P> <P> For example, the most frequent reason for reversals by the current court, cited  in seven cases, has been a judge's instruction to jurors that the governor has  the power to commute a life-without-parole sentence, the alternative to death.  That instruction was ruled invalid by the Bird court in 1984 and the Lucas  court has followed that ruling, while narrowing it somewhat.  </P> <P> The justices have also followed a Bird court precedent in reversing three death  sentences because the prosecutor told jurors that they could put their moral  convictions aside, or allow "the law" to replace their personal judgment, in  deciding on a sentence. In other cases, however, the current court has given  prosecutors considerable leeway in jury arguments.  </P> <P> Other Lucas court reversals have involved errors that, in hindsight, looked  obvious. In two cases, trial judges failed to hold hearings on a defendant's  mental competency, after a hearing had been previously ordered. One judge  neglected to hold a sanity hearing, sent the jurors home, and then recalled  them after a second jury had deadlocked on sanity. In another case, the defense  lawyer's representation of another client in a civil case inhibited his  questioning of a key prosecution witness.  </P> <P> The gap between the two courts can be attributed partly to philosophy, but  lawyers on both sides of the issue see other reasons. One is that many Bird  court rulings involved trials soon after the passage of the current death  penalty law, a broadly worded 1978 initiative.  </P> <P> "It's my suspicion that any state court system at the start will probably be  reversing more than it's affirming, only because it's setting the parameters  and defining the issues," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette, death penalty  coordinator for the state Department of Justice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Past the Early Bugs'  </P> <P> "Now, trial courts are past the early bugs in the system and should know how to  do it right, and you would expect to see a larger number of affirmances."  </P> <P> Michael Laurence, director of the Death Penalty Project of the American Civil  Liberties Union of Northern California, generally agreed.  </P> <P> "The fact that we are getting many affirmances now can be due to the Bird  court's reversing a case several years in the past," forcing trial courts to  change their procedures, Laurence said.  </P> <P> One point of comparison between the old and new California courts is the six  death sentences reversed by the Bird court and then granted reconsideration by  new court appointees before the rulings became final. Five of the six sentences  have been upheld by the Lucas court.  </P> <P> Much of the difference between the two courts' rulings in capital cases can be  traced to a single ruling, a 1987 decision by the Lucas court that intent to  kill was not required for most death sentences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question of Intent  </P> <P> Bird court decisions in 1983 and 1984, reading an intent-to-kill requirement  into the death penalty law, were the court's most frequent reason for reversing  death sentences. One justice who had joined those rulings, Stanley Mosk,  shifted his stance and wrote the 1987 decision; the sole dissenter was Justice  Allen E. Broussard, author of the earlier decisions.  </P> <P> The other major difference between the two courts is more subjective and  involves the concept of "harmless error," flaws in a trial that a reviewing  court concludes were not serious enough to overturn the verdict. The Lucas  court has applied that concept far more broadly than the Bird court.  </P> <P> In perhaps the most striking example, the current court concluded that the jury  may have been misled into disregarding the evidence against a death sentence  offered by lawyers for Billy Ray Hamilton, convicted of a triple murder in  Fresno. But over Broussard's dissent, the court ruled the error was harmless  because none of the evidence would have persuaded a reasonable juror to vote  for a life sentence.  </P> <P> Gillette said the current justices, six of whom are former longtime trial  judges, have "a more practical approach" than the former court, and are "less  willing to assume that jurors are automatically influenced by every erroneous  thing that occurs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Institutional Bias'  </P> <P> In the Bird court, he said, "there may have been an institutional bias against  the death penalty" and therefore a greater willingness to find errors to be  grounds for reversal.  </P> <P> The ACLU's Lawrence said the justices look at a terrible murder and may not be  able to conceive how a juror, regardless of errors in the trial, could have  imposed any sentence other than death. "But that's the role of an appellate  court," he added.  </P></p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: These willows are not for weeping  -A look at an agricultural enterprise involving rapid growth Lionel Hill was within four days of installing Pounds 4,000-worth of straw burning equipment, plus associated pipework, to heat his 12 roomed Victorian brick farmhouse when he heard about willow. Not the ornamental sort, nor the type cultivated for cricket bats, but biomass varieties - clones specially developed for their fast-growing qualities and ability to provide timber for burning. 'What on earth is biomass?' he asked engineer David Wilks, the old friend who introduced him to the idea. Wilks explained the principle of wood grown specifically for burning and put him in touch with the Long Ashton Research Station near Bristol, whose willow expert, Ken Stott, visited him. As a result, Hill threw out the straw boiler idea and opted instead for a Pounds 5,000 Scandinavian woodchip boiler. And in the last eight years, he has become one of the small but increasing number of farmers growing biomass material on their land, on his 72-acre farm at Feckenham near Redditch. 'Ken initially drove up from Bristol because he wanted to find a quarter of an acre on a site well away from Long Ashton where he could plant a number of willow clones for trial purposes,' said Hill. 'I agreed and allowed him the use of a quarter acre of rather poor land above an old tip. Ken persuaded me to spray and plough it in the winter of 1986 and I knew I was getting interested when he came a few months later with boxes of cuttings for planting and persuaded me to let him use two of my men for three days for marking out the plots and planting. Not only was all this free, but Ken also managed to extract money from me for the specimens we planted - 26 different clones of willow and eight clones of poplar. The total cost to me was Pounds 1,225.' Before long, Hill was putting more money into the enterprise - planting, spraying against weeds, and buying and maintaining machinery. He reckons work on the trial plots alone - initially it started as a spare-time activity - cost him Pounds 3,200. 'I was at first happy to regard it as a pastime, subsidised by the farm and the plant hire business I had started in Bromsgrove 23 years previously and which had been highly profitable in the early years,' said Hill. 'My initial interest, if I am honest, was as much in providing cover for the birds that seemed to be disappearing at an alarming rate, as in serious experimentation. By the time I was hooked on willow growing I had outlayed well over Pounds 10,000 and seen virtually nothing back. 'I knew that arable coppice, as it is correctly called, was an uncertain enterprise but my wife Helen and I both found it fascinating.' The numbers of farmers following Hill's lead are still small. 'However I know they must be growing as our sales of biomass material have risen from Pounds 7,650 in 1991-92, when we started in earnest, to Pounds 9,500 in 1992-93, to Pounds 22,500 in 1993-94. This year we sold materials to the value of Pounds 19,000 in our first three months.' 'Materials' include cuttings ('sticks') for planting; long willow wands, which they sell at Pounds 125 a ton for the stabilisation of motorway embankments and other forms of bio-engineering; and chippings for burning. In 1990 the Hills had to buy in wood to burn for heating the farm (their uprated burner is now a 150kW model and heats the outbuildings as well as the farmhouse) but the tree growth has been so fast that by next year they reckon they will have to seek new outlets for woodchips. 'I anticipate selling woodchips to the garden trade for use as a mulch,' Hill said. Cropping is on a one, two or three year rotational basis - the whole process is known as SRC - short rotational cropping. A big expenditure last year was on a Pounds 7,500 prototype automated cutting machine. 'It is perfect for cutting straight into a large stand of young willows and removing long rods, but it is tractor-drawn and we may have to spend more to adapt it to be self-propelled, mounted on tracks,' Hill said. Another expenditure was the cold store needed for cuttings taken in the winter dormant period that might be sold at any time during the following year. Helen Hill, who looks after the books, reckons that after eight years they are just at break-even point with the willows. 'We would not even have got this far if it had not been for grants of Pounds 550 an acre in 1991, 92 and 93 from the government's Farm Woodland Grant Scheme,' she said. 'The grants almost covered the cost of planting,' said Lionel Hill. 'But up until this year we have not been too bothered about cost as it started as a hobby. Really we didn't even imagine it would grow into a business, but once we started taking it seriously we knew it would be a few years before business built up. 'However, if we carry on as we have been doing so far this year we shall turn over about Pounds 45,000 by our year-end next January and that will easily exceed the turnover of the farm. 'If we continue at the present rate I shall reduce the acreage given over to stock - at present it is Charolais cattle and Suffolk sheep and a little feed - and increase the biomass land. We are already going to plant another 15 acres of willow and poplar this year. 'From the business point of view the next five years will be the most important for the biomass crops. We have to be careful not to rest on our laurels. The game now is to keep finding sources of new clones - currently we have 60 clones of willow and 27 of poplar - to buy in and experiment with. 'Speed of tree growth is all-important in this business. I am predicting that other growers will catch up with us after five years, so we must make the most of our lead now by selling all we can. When the big companies start buying into set-aside land for growing biomass, or some of the big farmers get going, we shall not be able to compete. So we must now go flat out to develop our market. 'My guess is that as growers we shall be out of it in five years. I shall be 62 by then and I will probably finish up as a consultant. But it's going to be a very interesting five years.' By 1992 the Hills had built up 20 outlets for sales of mainly unrooted cuttings and rods. The current number of outlets is 80. 'It's all happening with willow - and its all so new,' Hill said. 'Who knows, the way things are going there might be whole buildings constructed from willow, in which case I reckon I shall still be in a growth market.'

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Toyota blames strong yen and poor sales for 25% fall The severity of the downturn in Japan's car market and the impact of the sharp appreciation of the yen were highlighted yesterday as Toyota, the country's largest car maker, announced a 25 per cent decline in unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the year to June 30. Toyota's pre-tax profits fell to Y214bn (Dollars 2.7bn) from Y286.4bn in the previous year on sales 10 per cent down at Y8,155bn compared with Y9,031bn. The company cited the yen's rise against other currencies and sluggish demand in its home market and Europe as important factors behind the disappointing performance. However, analysts commended the company's results which were in line with, if not better than, expectations and forecast that Toyota would see a rebound after cost-cutting and as the Japanese economy picked up. The company saved Y150bn - Y110bn from improvements at the design stage. The remaining Y40bn came through cost cuts at production facilities and in distribution. However, the benefits of these measures were eclipsed by the rapid rise of the yen. Toyota said the yen's appreciation cost it Y160bn in operating costs while slower sales cost Y70bn. In the domestic market, Toyota vehicle sales fell 4 per cent to Y3,215bn from Y3,346bn while exports declined by 21 per cent to Y2,055bn fromY2,612bn, although this was in part due to increased overseas production. Consolidated sales were down 8 per cent at Y9,362.7bn against Y10,210.7bn. Group pre-tax profits declined 27 per cent to Y236.5bn from Y322.2bn while net income fell 29 per cent to Y125.8bn from Y176.5bn. The dividend is unchanged at Y19 per share. Toyota is forecasting a 7.5 per cent increase in the current fiscal year due to the introduction of models which satisfy increasingly cost-conscious customers as well as a recovery in Japan and Europe. It believes the Japanese market will rise to 5m units in 1994 from 4.89m in 1993 and Toyota expects its sales to increase to 2.13m units from 2.07m. It is moving its year-end to March and forecasts pre-tax profits of Y200bn and net profits of Y100bn on sales of Y6,200bn for the nine-months.</p>

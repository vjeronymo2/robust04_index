			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri by Gaby Nasr; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] [Nasr] How can a high-flying international  businessman such as you have the determination, or even the  patience to head the government of a country that is  "ungovernable" to say the least?    [Al-Hariri] Let us just say it is difficult to govern. As  you know, Lebanon is a country that just emerged from a long  war. I agreed to become its prime minister because I knew that  I could make a difference. Today, one and a half years after  taking office, I can consider that the government achieved many  of its goals and that as such, it has already made a difference  as compared with those that came before.    [Nasr] So you consider that your action brought positive  results, overall?    [Al-Hariri] Indeed. Very positive results, and this is a  statement based on fact. First there was the stabilization of  the Lebanese pound's exchange rate. Only a few years ago, the  national currency's standing with respect to foreign currencies  was a prime concern for the Lebanese. Regularly, and in every  single news bulletin, there were special items monitoring real  time variations in the local exchange rate.    Today, the Lebanese pound is stable and therefore is not an  issue any more. This is already very important inasmuch as a  stable foreign exchange market is the very foundation of the  economy. Without it, there cannot be a successful reconstruction  plan.    [Nasr] The economy may have pulled out of the hole, but  recovery is still some way off!    [Al-Hariri] I never said you could rebuild an economy all at  once and just wave away war's every disaster. However, results  achieved so far are very promising. When I came into office,  the reserves of the Bank of Lebanon were an estimated $450  million. Today, they exceed $1.5 billion. Not to mention our  balance of payments which shows a surplus. This is what gives  Lebanon its almost unique character worldwide, and will let it  become a large economic hub once again.    [Nasr] But all this does not seem to have had any immediate  impact on daily life. I think in particular of the unavoidable  threesome: electricity, water, and telephone, not to mention  the awful roads.    [Al-Hariri] I am perfectly aware of people's impatience. But  these are tasks that require very careful planning. We do have  a plan, and this plan is being carried out according to a  specific schedule. Every sector is concerned, including  services, Beirut's international airport, which was in an  unbelievable mess; we just finished straightening it up, and  electricity, which, unfortunately cannot be supplied on a  24-hour-a-day basis for at least another 17 months.    Any such enterprise takes time. You need to plan, call in  experts, establish preliminary requirements, issue invitations  to tender, negotiate prices... These are stages you cannot  bypass, especially in a country like Lebanon, where each  official has his own prerogatives. Bids from the various  companies interested in the rehabilitation of the telephone  network alone weigh in at 500 kg... Now this is what I call  working!    [Nasr] Are not the connections between yourself and the  reconstruction project for downtown Beirut a little too close  for comfort? Is not this project a kind of "insurance" that  would guarantee that you remain "indispensable?"    [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you right away that in a democracy,  no one is indispensable. Institutions remain, and officials are  hired or fired as part of this very specific framework. I would  remind you, however, that my group became involved in downtown  reconstruction well before I was appointed prime minister.  Furthermore, I consider the government duty-bound to take an  interest in this. No state could remain passive when the core  of its capital is in ruins, it could not remain aloof and  unconcerned just to avoid being charged with doing business.    [Nasr] Your very business-like style of government does not  go down well in traditional political circles.    [Al-Hariri] Well, I would say that this is democracy. I  became prime minister by being a member of Parliament. My  political opponents are trying to do the same. This is the name  of the game. Not only in Lebanon, but in all countries ruled  through democratic institutions.    [Nasr] A major factor preventing Lebanese capital from  flowing back and international investors from regaining  confidence is indisputably the huge influence of Syria. Have  you made a deal [last word in English] with the Syrians to  retain some maneuvering space?    [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you one thing in all sincerity: I  can assure you that since I became prime minister, the Syrians  have not contacted me once on any issue directly connected with  internal affairs. Before I took office, like everybody else, I  was hearing that you could not appoint a civil servant or set up  a project without Damascus' imprimatur. I am not in a position  to comment on the way my predecessors did things, but as far as  I am concerned, there is no truth to all this.    In fact, our relationship with the Syrians is based on two  unchanging features: cooperation in internal security matters  -- and I think all the Lebanese can see it is effective -- and  coordinated foreign policies.    [Nasr] You happen to be a naturalized Saudi citizen, a  privilege seldom granted an Arab national by the Wahabite ruling  family. As the Lebanese prime minister, do you ever find  yourself caught between Damascus and Riyadh's conflicting  interests?    [Al-Hariri] Contrary to popular misconceptions, Lebanon can  never find itself in an unpleasant situation with respect to  Syria and Saudi Arabia, for a simple reason: Its relations with  these two countries are very different in nature.  Geographically, Syria could not be closer to Lebanon. We have  common interests that cannot be dissociated. The two countries'  populations are very close, and there are many obvious family  ties. Moreover, many Lebanese people own land in Syria, while  others work there. This is nothing new; ties between our two  nations go back a long way.    Such is not the case for Saudi Arabia, which has no special  interest in Lebanon. Riyadh has a very clear foreign policy  which is limited to its sphere of influence. On the other hand,  the Saudis help friendly countries, including Lebanon.  Insisting that there is a power struggle between Damascus and  Riyadh in Lebanon is ludicrous. I would even add that to my  knowledge Saudi Arabia has never attempted to exert any  influence on our country.    [Nasr] You visited France several times, meeting its top  officials, not to mention businessmen, of course. Were tangible  promises made with respect to funding specific reconstruction  projects?    [Al-Hariri] Relations between France and Lebanon date back  hundreds of years. The French have a special relationship with  Lebanon, and so do the Lebanese with France. When a Lebanese  says he is going to Europe, chances are he will end up in  France. The reverse is just as true. When a Frenchman comes to  the Middle East, you just know he will stop over in Beirut.  There is indeed a very special relationship.    As far as tangible promises are concerned, on meeting French  officials our requests were very specific. For the most part,  these related to new equipment for internal security forces, the  provision of spare parts for military equipment, and the  construction in northern Lebanon of a 450-megawatt power plant.  Furthermore, we reached an agreement in principle for  increasing the capital of Middle East Airline.    [Nasr] Is there currently a will to renegotiate the  agreement  entered into by Paris and Beirut as regards General Michel 'Awn?    [Al-Hariri] To tell you the truth, I fail to see how that  could be. You know that the agreement was concluded before I  came into office. To my knowledge, none of the parties which  developed it has shown any desire to have it renegotiated so far.    [Nasr] In the Washington bilateral talks, the Lebanese and  Israelis still cannot seem to agree on anything. Jerusalem and  the PLO entered into an agreement last September, while Jordan  seems to be headed in the right direction. If this goes on, all  Arab countries will end up signing a peace treaty with Israel,  with the exception of Lebanon and Syria, which will be left  alone in seeking an "overall solution." Is not Beirut mostly  waiting for Damascus' "green light" before it forges ahead?    [Al-Hariri] Now listen carefully, I will say this only once:  there can be no peace settlement in the Middle East that  excludes Lebanon. This is no empty slogan; it is a fact. Even  if all our Arab neighbors enter into a peace agreement with  Israel, such an agreement will no be viable without our  participation. The reason for this is obvious: All opponents  to the agreement will converge here and will not sit still until  they have wrecked it.    Beside, there is no reason for Lebanon to rush at a time  when  the Syrians themselves do not oppose the notion of a peace  agreement with Israel. Why should we be in a hurry while  Damascus has formally entered the process and has been overtly  negotiating with the Israelis?    All that we ask for at this stage is full enforcement of  Security Council Resolution 425, which provides for the  withdrawal of Israel's army from the border zone it has been  occupying in southern Lebanon. The Israelis will not hear of it  and want us to rush into a peace treaty. However, there is  nothing in Resolution 425 that requires Lebanon to conclude a  peace agreement.</p>

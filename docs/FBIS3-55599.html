			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvia's Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs told the  BALTIC NEWS SERVICE news agency today that the United States had  offered the Baltic states to replace the possibliity of becoming  NATO member states with the possibility for cooperation which,  although does not give guarantees of security, however, taking  into account the results of the elections in Russia, the Baltic  states can expect from NATO more stable guarantees of security  in the nearest future [sentence as received].    Only NATO can give the Baltic states guarantees of security.  That is clear to all NATO member states.    According to Georgs Andrejevs, the joining of NATO by Latvia  will be determined to a great extent by foreign policy of larger  NATO member states in the nearest future. Latvia, similarly to  Lithuania and Estonia, has expressed the wish to join NATO in  the future, on the occasions of meetings of both prime ministers  and presidents of the Baltic states on 15 December 1993.  However, Latvia has not yet considered the possibility of  passing a separate document on joining NATO, stated Georgs  Andrejevs.    In a letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner,  signed  by the Lithuanian president, there is a request to send to  Lithuania a commission of NATO experts who will determine  whether Lithuania can be admitted to NATO. But according to  Andrejevs, Lithuania is not ready for admission to NATO.  Latvia, for its part, has to tackle the issue of the withdrawal  of the Russian Army from Latvian territory before it invites a  commission of NATO experts.    As Andrejevs admitted, cooperation within the framework of  the Partnership for Peace program, as the United States has  envisaged it, already means the conclusion of bilateral  agreements with NATO, and depending on the readiness of each  state this agreement also envisages the opportunity to become a  fully-fledged NATO member state. Thus, NATO can itself offer to  join this organization, if cooperation within the framework of  the peace program is successful and a country meets NATO's  conditions in the military sphere.</p>

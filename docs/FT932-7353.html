			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Business Post plans flotation for July BUSINESS POST, the UK's biggest independent parcel and express mail company, is planning a flotation in early July, expected to capitalise it at more than Pounds 50m. It is the latest in a long line of public offers, which include RPC Group, the rigid plastic packaging company, and Carpetright of London, to be brought forward before the mid-July sale of the government's remaining BT shares. Business Post was formed in 1971 by Mr Peter Kane, chairman, who along with family trusts, owns 85 per cent. He was joined three years later by his brother Mr Michael Kane, managing director, who owns the remaining 15 per cent. Around 25 per cent of the new share capital will be placed with institutions by Baring Brothers and UBS. The group expects to raise up to Pounds 15m, of which Pounds 3m will go to the Kane brothers. A further Pounds 12m is to be invested in three new national hubs, in Manchester, Bristol and Leeds, bringing the total number of hubs to 14. The latest results show revenue rose to Pounds 33m at the end of March 1993 with a forecast of Pounds 44m by the end of 1994. The group made operating profits of Pounds 3.2m at the end of March 1992. The Kane brothers have recruited Mr Dudley Fishburn, the Conservative MP, as a non-executive director and plan to appoint a second. The group is expected to concentrate on expansion within its parcels business.</p>

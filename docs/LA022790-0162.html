			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: ROONEY CONTROVERSY HAS CBS ON THE DEFENSIVE  </P> <P> CBS HAS been backing up to the hairbrush over the Andy Rooney controversy which  came to be a much stickier nettle than anybody at that network wanted to grasp.  It was like the "Jumping Cholla" cactus of Arizona; CBS was closer to the sting  than they thought. This recent incident, wherein Andy insulted, first, gays and  then, according to the gay magazine The Advocate, went on to insult blacks, had  Rooney apologizing for the former, but denying doing the latter. CBS headman  David Burke suspended Rooney for three months anyway. And now, feeling and  thinking souls at CBS -- crawling under an avalanche of mail and protests that  run 90% in Andy's favor -- want Burke to bring a quick end to it.  </P> <P> HERE ARE some facts and thoughts you might have missed. At first, Burke fired  Rooney straight out, totally. Andy was "out the door," as they say. The issue  wasn't so much whether Rooney had made biased statements but that he had  behaved in an insubordinate manner. Burke has had to take the heat for  suspending Andy and not taking Rooney's word for it that he hadn't done what  The Advocate said he did. But, in reality, Burke was in no position to state  publicly what his action was for without more embarrassment.  </P> <P> Those denizens of "60 Minutes," Don Hewitt, Mike Wallace and Ed Bradley, all  went to bat for Andy, who they do not believe is a racist. They talked Burke  into making the punishment something less than a firing. At first Burke changed  it to a six-month suspension, then downgraded that to three.  </P> <P> THE PUBLIC majority wants Andy back even if he made mistakes or didn't use good  judgment or expressed himself sloppily. And some want Andy back no matter WHAT  he said or did. You can whomp up a good and maybe even important argument these  days about Andy Rooney and "free speech." And whether a man hired to give  opinions on the air is allowed to have opinions.  </P> <P> The interesting comment on all this is by writer Peter Davis of Newsday. He  says that blandness flourishes on the Big Three networks and that the "dirty  secret" of CBS is that an all-white, male-dominated hierarchy is extra  scrupulous about not offending gays, blacks, women or other minorities. They  don't intend to hire importantly from such groups if they can avoid it and so  hope bending over backward takes off some of the heat.  </P> <P> As Davis puts their philosophy, it is "See how fair we white males are -- we  even kick people out who say anything about the rest of you guys."  </P> <P> ANDY ROONEY has been asking, in effect, "How do we get out of this mess?" He  takes the blame heaped on him -- and the praise -- to heart. He has been mea  culpa-ing all over the place in private. He knows he didn't handle any of this  well. Burke's problem, however, is not to be perceived as a weak manager, a  wimp, an executive who doesn't mean what he says.  </P> <P> It may be said there are no winners in this mess. But actually there can be. If  gay radicals could believe more in "educating" the public in their favor rather  than in dire punishments for all who offend them, they can see Andy back on the  air as a chastened man who saw the light. Public consciousness HAS been raised.  On the issue of racism, I think we should accept the word of a 40-plus veteran  journalist that he didn't say those things. And he'll be watching his step in  the future on this issue too.  </P></p>

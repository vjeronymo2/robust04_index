			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Observer: Flight of fancy One unfortunate side-effect of Asil Nadir's sudden flight from British justice is that it has made the more self-important members of the legal profession feel it is their duty to call British Airways boss Sir Colin Marshall as soon as they lose sight of the opposition. This unfortunate habit was highlighted earlier this week when lawyers for the defendant in a civil claim arrived at the High Court only to find lawyers for the plaintiff, wigs and gowns flying, shouting down mobile phones for the managing director of British Airways. Next thing they knew the opponents had obtained an order to halt an airborne BA flight to the Middle East, on the grounds that the defendant was on it. Luckily for the passengers, BA refused because its jet was well beyond Frankfurt. And where was the defendant? Sitting in his solicitor's office helping draft his defence.</p>

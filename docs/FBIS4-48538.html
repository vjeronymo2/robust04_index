			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Themba Molefe and Lulama Luti] </F>   [Text] President Nelson Mandela's extension of the  Indemnity Act by a year secures further immunity from  prosecution for Cabinet members including first Deputy President  Thabo Mbeki.    Mandela signed the proclamation in Umtata on Tuesday night  which gives a further period of temporary immunity from  prosecution for politically motivated "crimes".    The proclamation was published in a Government Gazette  Extraordinary the same night after the Minister of Justice  requested the President to extend the terms from yesterday until  May 17 1995.    Returned exiles who re-entered South Africa and whose names  appeared in three government notices published in May 1993 and  February and March 1994 will be covered in the proclamation.    The previous indemnity period, authorised by former State  President FW de Klerk, expired on Tuesday.    Its objective was to allow exiles who admitted to "political  crimes" committed before October 8 1990 to return to South  Africa to engage in constitutional negotiations.    First promulgated in 1990, the Act became the Further  Indemnity Act after it was amended in 1992.    However, the new dispensation will not cover those who have  committed criminal acts, whether political or not, since May  1993.</p>

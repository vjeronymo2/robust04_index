			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Legal challenge to Amstrad The legal challenge brought by an individual shareholder to the planned buy-out of Amstrad by its chairman Mr Alan Sugar has been brought forward to tomorrow, writes John Mason. A High Court judge said the appeal by Mr Edward Northcote, an accountant owning 1,000 Amstrad shares, should be heard this week to avoid confusing shareholders about whether next Thursday's meeting, when approval for the plan will be sought, would go ahead.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hani al-Hasan and 'Abbas Zaki, members of the  Fatah Central Committee, and al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, the  Palestinian ambassador to Jordan, arrived in Amman this morning,  to represent the Palestinian leadership in the funeral of Her  Majesty Queen Zayn al-Sharaf and to extend condolences to His  Majesty King Husayn on this solemn occasion.    [Begin al-Hasan recording] We we were all shocked by the  death of the queen mother. The Palestinian leadership  immediately decided to form a delegation to extend condolences  to His Majesty King Husayn. Today we come to fraternal Jordan  in the name of the Palestinian people to offer condolences from  the bottom of our hearts. In any case, who gave birth to His  Majesty King Husayn remains alive.

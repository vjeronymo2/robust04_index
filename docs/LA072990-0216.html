			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: GARRIDO II MIGHT PLAY IN FULLERTON  </P> <P> Potentially, the Great Fred Roggin/Augie Garrido Hoax represents an important  breakthrough in electronic journalism: Next month's news today.  </P> <P> Roggin, KNBC's local sports anchor, erred when he aired a report Thursday  evening that Garrido had signed a two-year contract to return and coach  baseball at Cal State Fullerton. Erred badly. Roggin went with the story, facts  unchecked, after talking to someone identifying himself as Fullerton sports  information director Mel Franks and claiming Garrido had just signed for an  annual salary of $90,000.  </P> <P> Two things immediately should have tipped Roggin that this phone call was  bogus.  </P> <P> One, the story was not on the wires.  </P> <P> Two, when's the last time any school hired a coach and volunteered the terms of  the contract? Especially at Fullerton. Especially at $90,000 per.  </P> <P> Fred Roggin at 6 came away looking like Chili Davis in right, but there's a  chance history will exonerate him. Garrido II is not on the marquee yet, but  the sequel, as they say up the freeway, is in pre-production.  </P> <P> Saturday afternoon at the Goodwill Games, where he is serving as an assistant  baseball coach for Team USA, Garrido said a recent conversation with Fullerton  associate athletic director Steve DiTolla convinced him that a return to the  Titans was "realistic" and that he would formally apply and interview for the  job.  </P> <P> "I did talk to Steve (Friday) about what they're looking for, what kind of  commitment they're willing to make, and I was surprised," Garrido said. "Within  the resources they have, and I know they're limited, they're doing the best  they can do. They're making a hell of an effort.  </P> <P> " . . . At this point, it's safe to say I will apply. They seem genuinely  interested in turning the Fullerton baseball job from a stepping-stone position  into a permanent position, which is what I needed to hear. Now I can take the  next step -- and that's to formally interview with them."  </P> <P> Clearly, Fullerton baseball is at a crossroads. For more than a decade, it has  been the university's prestige sport -- two NCAA championships at Fullerton; it  still boggles -- but now the man who built the program, Garrido, and the man  who sustained it, Larry Cochell, are both gone. With Cochell taking Vern Ruhle,  the prized pitching coach, and several Titan recruits to Oklahoma with him, the  program has nowhere to go but down -- unless the program can revitalize itself  with one dynamic stroke, a hire that could galvanize interest on campus and in  the community.  </P> <P> If that's the goal, Fullerton's top three candidates for baseball coach ought  to be, in order:  </P> <P> 1. Augie Garrido.  </P> <P> 2. Augie Garrido.  </P> <P> 3. Augie Garrido.  </P> <P> Already, it has been established that Fullerton is keenly interested. It wasn't  until Friday, however, that Fullerton and Garrido got together on the same  page.  </P> <P> Having served there once, Garrido admittedly had his doubts.  </P> <P> "I needed to know if the program now was going to be any different from the one  I left," he said. "Why would I want to return to the same problems I left three  years ago?"  </P> <P> Garrido always wanted to host an NCAA regional at Fullerton. He never could  because hosting an NCAA regional at rickety Titan Field, Ol'  Scaffold-N-Splinters, would be like hosting an Olympics in Blythe.  </P> <P> Now, with a new on-campus, multi-sports facility due at Fullerton by 1992,  Garrido might have a chance.  </P> <P> Garrido always wanted to schedule home series against the best teams in the  country -- Arizona State, Oklahoma State, Miami, Texas. One year, he got a  verbal commitment from Texas, then the defending national champion. But  Fullerton officials nixed the plan because of the financial guarantee it would  have taken to bring Texas to Orange County.  </P> <P> Now, with a more baseball-friendly administration, Garrido believes he would  have a chance. Garrido always wanted some help when it came to raising money  for such frills as uniforms, scholarships and stadium lights. In his first  go-round, Garrido says, "it was a one-man mom-and-pop store. . . . For me, the  fund-raising aspect was so time consuming, by the time I got to the field to  coach, it was like taking a break."  </P> <P> Now, Garrido says DiTolla assured him "the administration is willing to assume  some of the responsibility for developing a baseball budget."  </P> <P> Talk, of course, is cheap, much cheaper than the cost of operating and  maintaining a top 10 baseball program. Initially, Garrido thought talk was all  Fullerton could offer. "They're dipping into pretty small pockets," he said.  Initially, it seemed to be little more than a face-saving gesture -- Fullerton  would make Garrido an offer he could refuse, announce that it tried to get the  best man for the job and then begin interviewing candidates it could afford.  But then DiTolla talked to Garrido Friday and the outline presented to the  coach was, in Garrido's words, "surprising."  </P> <P> "There have been some changes," Garrido said. "They're building a stadium.  They've got a new president. Fullerton . . . wants to maintain the high level  that baseball has had.  </P> <P> "I have to be realistic. I know they can't get into a situation where they're  robbing Peter to pay Paul, giving things to me when other coaches and programs  are fighting for their lives. "I'm not a martyr. But if my family is able to  function, money isn't everything. I really care about the Fullerton program.  There are a lot of opportunities there. It sounds like they're trying to get  something done."  </P> <P> More than mouths to feed, Garrido also has an ego to feed. That's why the  possibility of returning to Fullerton with the title of associate athletic  director interests him. That's why all the commotion about his potential  return, Roggin prank included, excites him.  </P> <P> "I went to the Angel-Mariner game last night and some of the Angel coaches said  they wanted to see me back," Garrido said. "I talked to (Seattle pitcher) Mike  Schooler, one of my old players, and he thought I should go back. Today, I  heard guys in the stands yelling, 'Augie, let's get these guys fired up, like  the old Fullerton days."  </P> <P> The irony isn't lost on Garrido.  </P> <P> Three years since he left for Illinois, his popularity around Fullerton has  never been higher.  </P> <P> Fullerton has set next Friday as the deadline for baseball applications, with  interviews to begin the following week. Garrido is committed to Team USA  through Aug. 19, through the end of the world championships in Edmonton, but  said he would request permission to leave for a day once a formal interview at  Fullerton is scheduled.  </P> <P> "It's a real interesting challenge," Garrido said. "You know, I've got a lot  invested in the new stadium already. I'd like to see it happen.  </P> <P> "It's one thing to start a ranch. It's another when you were there at the very  beginning, clearing out the trees and the rocks."  </P></p>

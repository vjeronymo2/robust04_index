			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim waits for US outcome IN THE absence of Tokyo, trading in the Pacific Rim was influenced by the US presidential election, writes Our Markets Staff. Some markets dipped on fears that a Clinton victory would make exporting to the US more difficult. HONG KONG was pulled below 6,200 by a sell-off in China Light shares after the power company reported lower than expected earnings. The Hang Seng index shed 33.73 to 6,197.44, and turnover was unchanged at HKDollars 2.58bn. China Light fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 35.75 and was the second most active stock, topped only by HSBC Holdings, which lost 50 cents to HKDollars 63. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index closed at an all-time peak for the fourth consecutive day, up 4.01 at 653.07. Profit-taking was evident in the afternoon but it was well absorbed. Volume rose to a record 267.9m shares from 205.7m. SINGAPORE retreated on profit-taking after the recent sharp gains. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 11.67 at 1,405.87 in volume of 156.7m shares, against 133.6m. F &amp; N fell 50 cents to SDollars 9.80, Sembawang Shipyard slipped 30 cents to SDollars 7.55 and Keppel eased 15 cents to SDollars 5.95. SEOUL fell for the first time in seven sessions on profit-taking, the index receding 16.45 to 605.52. Turnover dipped to Won483.4bn from Won678.6bn. Kepco and Posco, both heavily weighted, shed Won200 to Won19,000 and Won900 to Won26,500 respectively. AUSTRALIA closed mixed after thin trading, due to the Melbourne Cup holiday in Victoria. The All Ordinaries index finished 2.7 up at 1,412.8 after an intraday low of 1,403.9. Turnover was ADollars 152.1m. BHP lost 8 cents to a 20-month low of ADollars 10.74 after Moody's Investors Service said that BHP's controlling stake in Foster's Brewing had weakened its financial position. NEW ZEALAND was steady as softness in Lion Nathan before its annual results, due today, cancelled out slight firmness in other stocks. The NZSE-40 capital index ended just 0.18 firmer at 1,372.20 on turnover of only NZDollars 17m. Lion dipped a further 4 cents to NZDollars 3.69 in spite of analysts' forecasts that the brewer will report a profit before extraordinary items of NZDollars 100m to NZDollars 115m, up from NZDollars 70.98m a year ago. TAIWAN ended narrowly mixed in sluggish trading, with the weighted index a mere 0.15 higher at 3,559.66. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 7.97bn. MANILA retreated after last week's advances, the composite index losing 8.88 to 1,352.52 in combined turnover of 140.7m pesos, after Friday's 289m. The market was closed on Monday.</p>

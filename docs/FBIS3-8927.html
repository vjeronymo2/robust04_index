This week it was not necessary to travel that far in order to  reach a world in which fantasy and reality meet. The second DPS  [Democratic Party of Socialists] congress was the place in which  the desired and the twisted world in which we live, led by the  DPS and its leaders, were equalized.    DPS members said in the congress that they were devoted to  democracy, but at the same time they use wiretaps and physical  threats and misuse the media, which are more brutal than the  communist television during the last 50 years. They claim to be  establishing a constitutional state and torture people in  prisons. They make statements in which they point out that they  pursue the politics of peace and friendly relations with their  neighbors, but they have obviously forgotten that they led a war  outside Montenegro and sowed 250 graves over the country for  Montenegrin youngsters who died in that war. They pretend to be  developing a civilized state, while supporting ethnic cleansing  not only in Bosnia, but also in Boka Kotorska and in northern  Montenegro. They support political pluralism and parliamentary  democracy but they arm their political followers. They boast  about the safety Montenegro citizens allegedly have, but they  "forget" to mention the act of kidnapping in Strpci, in which  they were involved. They are trying to convince us that their  foreign policy is constructive and assessed positively by the  whole world, but their plane can only fly to Greece in order to  buy furniture for their new apartments there. They are open to  all democratic ideas, but "their attitudes are completely  identical" with those of the fascist Zhirinovsky. They  conducted a "secret" poll about public matters and invited the  manager of an "independent" institute of an "autonomous"  university to the party congress in order to read what they  wrote for him. Their bells [the state media] were ringing two  days long telling us that according to that objective poll more  than 70 percent of the 1,000 respondents support Yugoslavia, but  they did not say that less than 5 percent supported an alliance  of Serbian states, called Yugoslavia, into which they want to  push Montenegro, too.    Momir Bulatovic and Milo Djukanovic revived the idea that  Montenegro and Herzegovina should merge. They did not state the  reasons, so we cannot think of their opposite in order to know  what their real motives are, but let us mention two possible  reasons in order to make things clearer. One of the reasons is  to offer the greedy and disoriented Montenegrins the chance to  spread to Herzegovina. In this way they would be silenced --  they would not dare oppose the process of making Montenegro a  Serbian province. They would perhaps not become a national  minority, but a weak majority in their own state. The second  reason reveals that the constructors of a greater-Serbia in  Bosnia have difficulties. If the Muslim-Croatian federation is  accomplished, there are good chances that the territories along  the Drina River in Eastern Bosnia will be annexed to it,  regardless of the fact that they are ethnically clean now. If  Serbs oppose the tripartite federation and if Bosnia enters two  confederations, with Croatia and Serbia, there is the  possibility that Serbian territories in Bosnia be divided into  two separate parts. In this case, Herzegovina would be  connected with Serbia through Montenegro as a member state of  the alliance of Serbian states.    The DPS, led by Bulatovic and Djukanovic, keeps on denying  Montenegro as a state. In the alliance of Serbian states,  although its name might be Yugoslavia, there is no place for  Montenegrin individuality, there are no conditions to cherish  the national, cultural, religious, and other authentic  Montenegrin traditions. The Serbian Institute for the  Protection of Monuments was given the task of renovating the  Romanesque church of Sveti Luka in Kotor. After the renovation  the original dome without a square pedestal was turned into the  Raska School type dome with a high square pedestal. This example  illustrates how dull the (post)communist Montenegro is. It also  shows the Serbian attitude toward Montenegrin cultural heritage  and its future in any union of Serbian states.    The DPS members who gave standing ovations to the university  assistant from Podgorica, should know that they are participants  in the crime being committed against Montenegro on their behalf  and with their own hands.    The fact that this is interpreted as the people's wish does  not change the essence.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ernesto Samper, presidential </F> candidate of the Liberal Party, by program host Dario Arizmendi  in Santa Fe de Bogota; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast --  live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] Last night EL ESPECTADOR and the "CMI  Newscast" released the results of a poll, the first on Colombian  voters' intentions for the runoff election. You have an  4-percent advantage; what does this tell you?    [Samper] I am very pleased with these results because they  are the first figures to appear after Caracol's exit poll on  election day. The poll clearly indicates the trend favors my  candidacy for the runoff election; it also shows that the people  who most likely voted for other candidates before have now  decided to support my proposals. Obviously, then, I am very  pleased with the results.    [Arizmendi] How should we interpret the statements you made  yesterday? You said you would not accept any bureaucratic  alliances with any minority group, with those who managed to  secure minor percentages, including Antonio Navarro Wolff's  movement, Miguel Maza Marquez' political group, and so on.    [Samper] The whole intent behind a runoff election was never  to have the process following the first election become some  sort of bureaucratic free-for-all to see who could offer more to  this or that candidate to form an alliance. I have a clear  program with a strong social content, as the public already  knows. Whoever wants to vote for my government program, be they  Liberal supporters or otherwise, is more than welcome to do so.    I am not willing to sit down to a bureaucratic negotiation  or  to accept anyone asking me how much I am willing to offer to  secure the support of any candidate from the first election;  instead, I believe we should be thinking in more broad terms in  Colombia. Colombia needs the ideals of the majority working on  the more significant issues of its future. That is where I  stand, and those who would like to accompany me are welcome to  do so, but not in exchange for any kind of bureaucratic offering.    [Arizmendi] Does that mean you have ruled out any kind of  talks with Antonio Navarro or Miguel Maza Marquez?    [Samper] All types of negotiations are ruled out. I can  converse with anyone now but I am not going to become involved  in any bureaucratic negotiations or agreements in order to  allocate pieces of the government beforehand in exchange for  support. I have, essentially, a liberal candidacy and there are  other independent sectors that have joined us. I hope many  other independent sectors decide to support the proposals I have  made for Colombia. I also hope others decide to leave the  mistaken road of abstentionism and actively participate. With  their support, I am sure, as the poll indicates today, I can win  the runoff election.    [Arizmendi] What political changes will you make as a  strategy to secure the support of the Liberal Party members  around the country?    [Samper] Although the Liberal movement responded well in the  election -- I have no major doubts about that -- the truth is  not all Liberals were summoned and not all Liberals voted in  many regions.    During this second phase of the campaign, I am going to  concentrate more convincingly on reaffirming the Liberal nature  of the message I have been presenting: equality, tolerance, and  social justice. Second, I am going to try and convince the  independent sectors that ours is the better alternative.    The country wants to take the social leap I have proposed.  It wants the government to concentrate on health, education,  and employment. This is why I am convinced my message must get  to those Liberals who can still support my name. I call on them  now and on all those independent sectors, no matter what party,  that are looking for the right alternatives to support me.    [Arizmendi] What is your position on radio and television  debates with presidential candidate Andres Pastrana Arango and  between the vice presidential candidates?    [Samper] I am sending Pastrana a letter today inviting him  to  use the two hours of television time provided by law to hold two  debates on issues of national interest. The campaign organizers  would jointly select the topics.    I believe Colombians want to see what differences there are  between Pastrana and myself. I am convinced I have an  alternative for Pastrana's proposals. Pastrana represents a  conservative and respectable candidacy, given the nature of the  party supporting him. He has several economic proposals that  differ from mine. I represent, however, a liberal option that  enjoys the support of independent sectors. If we expect the  public to choose on election day, then I believe they have the  right to know from what they have to choose. They have the  right to know what their options are. One word says it all:  election, and we must choose one of several options.    [Arizmendi] Andres Pastrana Arango was here at the main  studios of Caracol Network yesterday. He agreed to appear on  this program, "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast, within the next  few days for a debate with you on an open agenda. Would you  accept this same invitation?    [Samper] Of course. I believe this stage of the campaign  should be for Colombians to learn what makes each of us  different from the other; that is why the Constitution  establishes a runoff election. In that way, the people can vote  on 19 June with a full knowledge of the two alternatives.    [Arizmendi] What does your security plan include exactly?  You mentioned it yesterday outside an Immediate Attention  Center in Bogota where there were a large number of citizens  protesting against a gang of criminals who had spread fear  throughout the capital.    [Samper] In addition to the country's problems with the  guerrilla movements, there are also serious problems with the  public security system, something which is true for Medellin and  other cities as well as Santa fe de Bogota. Colombian cities  have almost become the most unsafe in the world; this is why we  have had a group of experts at campaign headquarters working on  a civil protection bill for the past few months. That is what I  presented in Santa Fe de Bogota yesterday, and I am on my way  now to present it in Medellin. In essence, it states the  following:    1. We have to increase the number of policemen on the force.  Security will undoubtedly improve with more policemen;  obviously, the police force must be more committed to the  community and it must be a more moralized force. We must  realize we cannot cover all of our cities with the current  number of policemen.    2. We have to improve the communications network of the  police force. A police force without a communication network is  ineffective anywhere in the world; in addition, their  communications network must extend even further to include other  options. In Santa Fe de Bogota, for example, taxis have agreed  to link their network with the police, making each cab a  civilian patrol car. There are 10,000 taxi drivers with their  eyes on the city.    3. We must create an elite police force to counter those  crimes that hurt the community the most. Just as we have  special forces for abductions and drug trafficking, we need a  special force to fight rape, murder, and muggings.    4. The bill also proposes a restoral of penalties for  certain activities. We propose penalizing actions that have  nearly institutionalized juvenile delinquency. Given we can  only arrest a juvenile for a crime involving more than 1 million  pesos, these criminals have been vigilant in remaining below  that ceiling, and they do as they please. We must restore the  penalties for crimes such as these while including  rehabilitation programs.    5. The proposed civil protection bill also provides for  community involvement. If the community does not become  involved in the problem, there is no way to effectively protect  the cities. There are several new ways of organizing the  community.    [Arizmendi] You said you are going to Medellin. The Liberal  Party leaders, legislators, and political heads have issued a  statement in which they ask you to reinstate the debate system  in Antioquia Department to include acting senators, deputies,  and council members; furthermore, they have asked that the  Liberal Party's ideology and symbols be used more enterprisingly  during this second phase of the campaign. What will your  proposal or your response be to the Liberal Party's leaders in  Antioquia Department?    [Samper] I am preparing that response now. I do believe we  must make a more Liberal presentation of our message; after all,  I am the candidate and a director of the Liberal Party, but I do  not believe we should send that message out without any kind  direction. We must make a commitment with Antioquia Department.    What are we going to do about insecurity in Medellin? How  are we going to deal with unemployment in Medellin? They have  one of the highest rates in the country. How can we provide  Medellin and Antioquia Department in general with a modern  infrastructure that will give them access to the Atlantic and  Pacific Coasts? How will we go about completing the highway to  Puerto Berrio? What plans do we have to save the education  system in Antioquia Department? Antioquia Department was looked  up to as a model for the country 10 years ago, and now they rank  22d in the student aptitude testing program; thus, this is not a  matter of telling the Liberals to vote for the Liberal Party  but, rather, for a Liberal proposal for Antioquia Department  instead. That is precisely what I will present in Medellin  today.</p>

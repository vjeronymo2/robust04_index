			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lower after uncertain session THE RECOVERY of confidence in the UK stock market was jolted yesterday by the turmoil in European currencies and a series of unfavourable economic data on the US economy. After edging higher at first, the London market crumbled away in late trading as Wall Street came in with a loss of around 30 Dow points in early deals. Downward pressure increased when a New York house sold bond futures strongly in London. With sterling only slightly easier, the UK stock market was shielded from the worst of the developments in the currency markets. The Bundesbank's moves to discourage speculation of an impending cut in German interest rates calmed some of the optimism for a further reduction in UK base rates, which are now recognised as more closely linked to domestic political factors. Equities opened firmly on the back of Wall Street's fresh advance overnight but soon topped out at Footsie 2,867.4 as tensions increased in the currency sector. The stock market quickly moved into negative territory and remained there for the rest of the day. Attempts to rally, as successive hopes of interest rate cuts circulated before being choked off by the Bundesbank's actions in the German money markets, proved of limited success. Wall Street's reaction to economic data threatening inflationary pressure undermined London, which closed at the day's low in sharply increased trading volume. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,849.3 for a net loss of 11.5. But the focus on the Footsie-listed blue chips masked the continued rise in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which finished 6.9 ahead at 3,151.9, within three points of its closing peak. During the day, the Mid 250 broke through its previous closing high, reaching 3,156.8. Share volume, boosted by heavy trade in Shell Transport following good first-quarter figures, rose to 797.6m from the 773.6m of the previous session. Non-Footsie stocks maintained their daily average of around 62 per cent of the Seaq total. The rise in Shell was worth about 4 points on the Footsie on a weak day, and shares in BP were also busy. ICI, however, was much less active, with the share price finally pulled down by Wall Street's weakness. Company statements from other sectors might have made more impact but for the underlying currency and transatlantic uncertainties. The stock market continues to look to Britain's boardrooms for testimony of economic recovery. Property shares, the most recession/interest rate-sensitive area, responded strongly to higher net asset valuation figures and an increased dividend from Land Securities. But the broad range of consumer stocks made little response to results from Grand Metropolitan and Burton Group. The revival of inflation fears in the US has followed comment in London that global markets could be open to a correction phase. Demand for gold and gold-related shares rose again yesterday, underlining suggestions in some quarters that investors might be looking for either cash or defensive instruments. However, NatWest Securities maintained yesterday that the prospect of a '10 to 20 per cent worldwide correction' in equity markets still seems some way off.</p>

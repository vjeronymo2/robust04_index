			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse loss hits Dollars 1.29bn WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.18bn and full-year loss of Dollars 1.29bn as it took a large and previously-announced charge to cover the disposal of its troubled financial services business. However, its fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations was also down, due primarily to a decline in earnings at its electronic systems operations and the dilution of earnings per share through a preferred stock issue. Mr Paul Lego, the chairman, warned that the group's first quarter results might be below those for the same period of 1992, due to lower-than-expected order rates. He said the aim was to have better results than in 1992 for the full 1993 year, with improvement coming in the second half of the year. The fourth-quarter net loss worked through at Dollars 3.44 a share and compared with profits of Dollars 171m, or 51 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues were little changed at Dollars 2.35bn, compared with Dollars 2.36bn. The company took a special charge of Dollars 1.28bn for the disposal of its financial services business, which has been a financial mill-stone for the past two years. It announced plans to shed the business last November. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter totalled Dollars 91m, or 22 cents a share, compared with Dollars 137m, or 41 cents a year ago. For the full year, Westinghouse reported net income from continuing operations of Dollars 348m, or 93 cents, compared with Dollars 265m, or 84 cents, in 1991. Its net loss was Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 3.81 a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.46 a share in 1991. The company said operating profits for electronic systems were down substantially in the fourth quarter because of reduced sales to the US military and a previously reported charge for job cuts.</p>

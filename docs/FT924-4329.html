			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Kuwait to investigate investors KUWAIT's parliament is to appoint a nine-member committee to investigate management of the Gulf state's overseas investments and the affairs of the London-based Kuwait Investment Office (KIO). The investigation, the second into its foreign investments, is a measure of the concern over suspected improprieties in the management of Kuwait's previously abundant foreign holdings. Meanwhile, the KIO's public relations advisers in Spain yesterday added to the confusion surrounding the Office's intentions there by announcing that trial lawyers had been appointed to study and execute ways to prosecute the former management of Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish holding company. Some argue that it is still far from clear that the KIO's legal advisers have been able to identify charges that could be made with any likelihood of success in Spanish courts. The value of Kuwait's foreign investments, which stood at around Dollars 100bn before the Gulf war, is now believed to have shrunk to nearer Dollars 30bn after a sell-off to pay for the costs of the Gulf war. Mr Nasser Abdulla al-Rhodan, the finance minister, told parliament on Tuesday that Kuwait would have to continue liquidating its foreign investments to finance the government's budget deficit.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GUY FORGET GETS SWEEP IN FRANCE  </P> <P> Third-seeded Guy Forget of France earned the second tournament victory of his  career, defeating seventh-seeded Michiel Schapers of the Netherlands in the  final of the $130,000 Lorraine Open Sunday at Nancy, France.  </P> <P> "Guy had very good serves," said Schapers, who lost, 6-3, 7-6. "My legs were a  little slow and he was faster than me on the court. That makes all the  difference."  </P> <P> After wrapping up the first set easily, Forget had to rally to win the  second-set tiebreaker. Schapers moved ahead, 4-1, in the tiebreaker, but Forget  tied it, 5-5, before winning, 7-5.  </P> <P> Forget's only previous tournament victory was in Toulouse, France, in 1986.  </P> <P> Steffi Graf coasted to her third title of the year with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over  Ann Henricksson in the final of the U.S. women's hardcourt championships in  chilly weather San Antonio, Tex.  </P> <P> Graf, the world's No. 1 ranked player from West Germany, did not lose a set  during the tournament.  </P> <P> At 2-2 in the second set, Graf got a service break after extending Henricksson  to six deuce points. Henricksson held serve the rest of the match, but was  unable to break Graf.  </P> <P> Asked if she believes she is playing better than her last year, the 19-year-old  Graf said, "I think I am, but it's hard to show that the last two days (because  of the adverse weather). But I felt it earlier in the week."  </P> <P> Led by twins Tami and Teri Whitlinger, top-ranked Stanford took the women's  national indoor collegiate team championship with a 6-0 victory over No. 2  Florida in the U.S. Tennis Assn./ITCA tournament at Madison, Wis.  </P> <P> Tami, playing at No. 1 singles and ranked No. 1 nationally, defeated Nicole  Arendt, 6-0, 6-4.

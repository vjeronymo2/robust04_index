			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE WAGNER IS DEAD AT 54  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Andrew G. Wagner has died after a lengthy illness, court  officials said Thursday. He was 54.  </P> <P> Wagner, a family law expert who served as a judge for about three years, died  Wednesday night at his home after a months-long fight with cancer, court  officials said.  </P> <P> "Andy will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him," said Judith McConnell,  the court's presiding judge. "We treasured his sense of humor, and he was an  extraordinary judge."  </P> <P> Wagner's death leaves the 71-member Superior Court with two vacancies. Judge  Don Martinson retired Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Wagner was appointed to the bench April 29, 1987, initially handling family law  matters at Vista Superior Court. Later, he supervised the civil law and motion  department at the downtown San Diego courthouse and also heard criminal cases.  </P> <P> In recent months, Wagner was one of nine San Diego judges serving on a special  program designed to speedily resolve civil cases. Under the program, control of  a case is assigned to a single judge, a departure from the traditional system  under which a case floats from judge to judge as it moves toward trial.  </P> <P> Before taking the bench, Wagner practiced law for 18 years with the San Diego  firm of Milch, Wolfsheimer &amp; Wagner. He practiced four years before that  with the firm of Prochazka, Conaway &amp; Wagner.  </P> <P> From 1969 to 1987, Wagner also taught family law at Western State University in  San Diego. When he was appointed to the bench, he was a director of the San  Diego County Bar Assn.  </P> <P> Wagner earned his law degree in 1964 from Cal Western. He graduated in 1963  from San Diego State University.  </P> <P> Wagner is survived by his wife, Municipal Court Judge Marge Wagner; three  children, Alison Ann Wagner, Holly Jennifer Bryan and Melissa Stephanie Bryan;  his mother, Edna Wagner of Milford, Conn.; a sister, Joan Matosko of Stratford,  Conn., and a brother, John Jaeckel of Paso Robles.  </P> <P> A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at United Methodist Church in  Encinitas, court officials said.  </P> <P> Flags at the county courthouses will be lowered to half-staff in Wagner's honor  for a week, McConnell said.  </P></p>

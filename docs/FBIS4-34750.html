			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Tomas A. Granados: "Miami After </F> Cartagena"]    [Text] [No dateline as received] After organizing four  summits through their own initiative to discuss matters of  cooperation and integration, and without relying on the United  States whatsoever, later this year Latin American leaders will  go to a meeting convened by President Bill Clinton in the city  of Miami.    According to an announcement from U.S. authorities, the goal  of this event will be to establish the rules of the game for  what the White House has called "a new era in inter-American  relations."    The last time a U.S. president met with the presidents of  the  hemisphere was in 1967 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, when  Washington sought political loyalty at any cost, fearful of the  gradual advancement of communism in this region in the years of  East-West confrontation.    Times have changed, however, and, although the loyalty of  the  hemisphere continues to be of paramount importance for the  United States, it appears to be inclined to offer new incentives  to continue to enjoy that loyalty. Michael Skol, who is second  in charge of Inter-American affairs in the State Department,  says that the countries south of the Rio Grande now have the  opportunity to become First World members jointly with the  United States.    "We want to consider two topics: First, how to strengthen  our democracies, defending them as a group and improving our  administration; and second, how to promote economic growth,  while promoting a sustained development strategy that will  protect the environment and alleviate poverty," Clinton said  when he formally convened the summit at a brief ceremony on 11  March at the White House.    At least this is the emphasis that has been placed on  preparations for the hemispheric summit, which is scheduled to  be held the first half of December in the city of Miami.    The meeting convened by Clinton will take place six months  after the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias,  Colombia. Some foreign ministries of the continent have ruled  out the possibility that Washington has an interest in offering  an alternative to such summits.    Nobody, however, has been able to explain Washington's  decision to choose Vice President Albert Gore to make the  announcement of the proposed hemispheric conference during his  late 1993 visit to Mexico -- the country that hosted the first  Ibero-American summit held in July 1991 in Guadalajara.    Professor Henry Raymont, a Latin American expert at the  University of Boston, was surprised by the person and venue  chosen for the announcement of the planned summit. His first  conclusion was that the White House had made a mistake, because  it lessened the impact of the initiative, but in politics and  diplomacy, nothing, or virtually nothing, happens by chance.    The hemispheric summit in Miami appears destined to become  the forum that will permit the United States to guarantee its  own interests in the region through new practices that promote  the cooperation of Latin America and the Caribbean. This will  be done within the limits of an initiative based on three  pillars of Washington's foreign policy: economic development,  national security, and promotion of democracy worldwide.    Nevertheless, there are still lingering old prejudices of  the  Cold War in the handing out of invitations to governments  accepted as democratic by Washington. The Clinton  administration, moved by the old ideological differences with  authorities in Havana, has excluded Cuba.    "If Cuba is excluded, one might question the sense of the  meeting," according to Jose Serrano, New York Democratic  representative and leader of the group of U.S. legislators of  Hispanic origin.    "The U.S. Government speaks of holding a summit with all of  the leaders of democracies in America. I think the best way to  hold such a dialogue in this part of the world is by including  everyone, regardless of what government philosophy they might  have," he added.    According to the Clinton administration, Miami was chosen as  the site of the summit because of the active interaction of that  city with Latin America and the Caribbean. Still, there might  be other reasons.    One is that many of the governments that were invited  maintain normal relations with the Havana authorities and do not  support the U.S. economic blockade policy against Cuba.    Therefore, Miami appears to be an ideal site for Washington  in order that no one who wants to avoid conflicts with the  influential extremist sector will dare speak of lifting the  blockade against Cuba, much less hint -- even remotely -- of the  need for a negotiated settlement of differences between  Washington and Havana.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak National  Party (SNS) parliamentary group will back a government bill on  large privatization in a form submitted by the ruling Movement  For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slovak Premier and HZDS  Chairman Vladimir Meciar said today. Unlike the government  bill, an opposition proposal by the Democratic Left Party (SDL)  provides for separation of the post of privatization minister  and that of chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM)  presidium, now being taken by Meciar. It also seeks the  separation of the posts of finance minister and chairman of the  FNM supervising council, now being occupied by Julius Toth.  After today's SNS-HZDS talks, Meciar said that from the  economic viewpoint it is right that constitutional  representatives be linked with the FNM.    SNS honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes said that it is  impossible  that one person take decisions and the other bear responsibility  for the results of privatization.    If the opposition submits a proposal to recall Minister of  Transport and Telecommunications Roman Hofbauer, the HZDS and  part of the SNS deputies will reject it, Meciar said. The  attempt to dismiss Hofbauer is caused by his insensitive  approach to the removal of bilingual (Slovak and Hungarian) road  signs of villages in southern Slovakia (where the majority of  the 560,000-strong Hungarian minority reside) and his  interference in broadcasts of the Radio Station Free Europe on  the Slovak territory.    Out of a total of 150 deputies in the National Council of  the  Slovak Republic (parliament), 66 seats are occupied by the HZDS,  28 by the opposition SDL and 14 by the coalition SNS.</p>

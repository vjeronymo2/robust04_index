			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAUREEN O'CONNOR  </P> <P> Please don't use your valuable and limited space to cover such peripheral  topics.  </P> <P> Los Angeles also continues to suffer the same civic ills set forth:  homelessness, choked roads, aging library and sewer systems, undermanned police  force, drug- and gang-related troubles, trash-disposal crisis and multiple  airports, each crowded and dangerous. (None, in all honesty, as much as San  Diego's.)  </P> <P> The "Maureen" article was up to your usual good standards; please direct that  same attention and skill to topics closer to home.  </P> <P> MICHAEL YOUNGER, Toluca Lake  </P></p>

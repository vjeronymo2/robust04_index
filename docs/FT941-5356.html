			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Digital cuts 6,000 jobs in Europe Digital Equipment, the troubled US-based computer manufacturer, is to cut up to 6,000 jobs in Europe over the next 12 months. The cuts represent about 20 per cent of the workforce and are twice as large as anticipated earlier this year. The redundancies are key to a regeneration plan being put in place by Mr Vincenzo Damiani, who took over as head of Digital Europe in January. Letters were being sent this weekend to staff throughout Europe, explaining the rationale for the plan. The company, once second only to IBM as a computer supplier, is suffering from declining sales and unsustainable overheads. About 50 per cent of its revenues derive from European operations and it has been hit hard by the recession. In common with other large computer manufacturers, Digital was slow to appreciate the importance of personal computers or to anticipate the emergence of networks of small computers as replacements for expensive, high margin, mainframe systems. The smaller systems command low gross profit margins. For the six months to January 1 this year, Digital reported a net loss of Dollars 155.3m (Pounds 106.3m) compared with a loss of Dollars 334.4m in the same period the year before. Mr Damiani, formerly a senior executive at IBM, said that on arrival he had put in place project teams to analyse the company's business model. The teams had now reported and their conclusions were the basis of the decision to cut numbers from approximately 29,000 in Europe to under 25,000. Mr Damiani said that, commercially, Digital had failed to work coherently with its business partners - software companies, systems integrators and distributors, who sell Digital computers directly to customers and who add value in the form of special software. The new strategy is designed to avoid competition for customers between Digital and these partners. The company's 500 key European accounts will be covered by dedicated account executives: 'They will be measured on the percentage that Digital takes of the customer's total information technology spend, no matter what channel is used,' Mr Damiani said.</p>

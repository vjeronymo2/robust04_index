			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Andrey </F> Krasnoshekov, and Andrey Shtorzh]    [Text] Paris, 27 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev had talks with his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic  during the international conference on stability in Europe that  has been held here. The Russian minister told the ITAR-TASS  correspondents today that the sides exchanged views on the  prospects for an end to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  analyzed the work of the Contact Group working on a Bosnian  settlement, which has been meeting representatives of the  warring sides in the French town of Talloires over the past few  days.    "The work of the Contact Group is coming up against great  difficulties, but everything is turning out reasonably well:  Gratifyingly, we managed to get the Serb side to take part in  the group's session," the minister pointed out. "Our western  colleagues have also fulfilled the promises they made in Geneva  in mid-May, and have got the Bosnian Muslims and Croats to the  negotiating table."    Andrey Kozyrev said he had information that the Muslim and  Croat sides are virtually ready to accept the plan proposed for  the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This plan  allots 51 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina to a  Croat-Muslim federation, and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

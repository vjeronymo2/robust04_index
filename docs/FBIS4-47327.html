V. Davidovich; UDC 621.372.8] </F>   [Abstract] Complex discharge modes of hollow multimode  waveguides with a multilayer case are studied with a rigorous  electrodynamic method based on joining of field segments and the  resultant dispersion equation in a complex plane. The waveguide  case is composed of magnetodielectric materials with losses. By  varying the thicknesses and permeabilities of the layers and  their depth in the case, one can achieve a significant broadband  improvement in mode selection at high frequencies. One can also  achieve this by reducing losses in the main mode at low  frequencies. The figures show run losses of the first few fast  modes of a cylindrical multimode dielectric waveguide with a  hollow channel for various configurations of complex  permittivities and permeabilities and different numbers of  layers. The effect of resonant and nonresonant materials on  self-filtering are explained. Figures 6; table 1; references 19:  14 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

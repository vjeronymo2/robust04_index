Along with the  across-the-board diminished stock of merchandise, monetary  emission took place in a number of Commonwealth countries in  January. In Belarus the money supply increased 5.7-fold as  compared to January of last year; in Kazakhstan--fivefold; and  Uzbekistan--17.3-fold. In Russia, 313.5 billion rubles [R] were  taken out of circulation, and in Tajikistan--R117.7 billion.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   January 1994 is characterized by a further decline of  industrial production and rising prices for the  sector's output.

Production of finished rolled ferrous metal  declined in January 1994 as compared with the corresponding  month of last year in Russia by 20 percent and in Kazakhstan by  24 percent. The output of steel pipe in Russia declined by about  one-half.    There has been a substantial decline as compared to January  of last year in machine building. The output of  metal-cutting machine tools declined in Belarus by 41 percent,  and in Russia and Kazakhstan by 47-48 percent. Russia produced  62 percent fewer drop-forge machines. Production of automobiles  in Belarus fell by 60 percent; in Russia, the output of trucks  fell by 60 percent and of passenger cars by 71 percent. Tractor  production declined in Kazakhstan and Belarus by 38-39 percent,  and in Russia by 77 percent. Uzbekistan practically ceased to  produce them.    The lag in the production of chemical products is  increasing. In January 1994, the output of mineral fertilizer in  Russia dropped by 26 percent, in Uzbekistan by one-third,  Belarus by 44 percent, and Kazakhstan by two-thirds. In Russia,  production of chemical filament and fiber, as well as of  calcinated soda, declined by 46-47 percent, and that of tires  declined by 37 percent. Production of synthetic tar and  plastics, chemical filament and fiber, and tires dropped by half  in Belarus.    In most Commonwealth states there has been a decline in  production of construction materials. For instance,  the output of cement declined by one-third in Uzbekistan, by  40-45 percent in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, and by 57  percent in Belarus.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   In most Commonwealth states, the decline in animal  husbandry continued.

In Uzbekistan the size of the herd  of sheep and goats dropped by almost 1.5 million head, and in  Uzbekistan--by 142,000. Herd reductions occurred mainly at  agricultural enterprises, while their number at the population's  private plots increased. However, the increased share of herd  owned by the population has not made up for its decline at  agricultural enterprises. Changes in the size of the livestock  herd as of 1 January 1994 as compared to 1 January 1993 at  agricultural enterprises and those owned by the population  (including private farms) in individual Commonwealth states are  characterized by the following data (in percents):                  Horned cattle                 Including cows                Swine                         Sheep and goats                 agricultural    population    agricultural    population    agricultural    population    agricultural    population                enterprises     and private   enterprises     and private   enterprises     and private   enterprises     and private                                farms                         farms                         farms                         farms   Belarus       93              100.5         98              102           94              103           61              96   Kazakhstan    90              110           96              107           87              113           96              109   Kyrgyzstan    80              107           82              106           62              82            72              97   Russia        90              105           93              107           86              103           79              95   Uzbekistan    96              102           103             102           73              84            95              102   Ukraine       94              106           97              108           89              106           89              114      In January of this year, there was a decline in  production of animal husbandry products at  agricultural enterprises.

In most Commonwealth states in January (1 February as  compared to 1 January), inventories of goods in the retail trade  network increased, calculated on the basis of one-day turnover  in January of this year. In Russia as of the beginning of the  year, the inventories were sufficient for 36 days of trading,  and as of 1 February--47 days; in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Armenia,  and Kazakhstan--correspondingly 41-54 days and 59-62 days; in  Ukraine--43 and 50; in Uzbekistan--63 and 72 days; and in  Turkmenistan--82 and 93 days.    Over the elapsed month as compared to the same period of  last  year, the physical volume of for-fee services  declined in all Commonwealth states, and very significantly,  even as compared to the already low level in January 1993.

Over the past two years (January 1994 as compared to January  1992) the physical volume of services rendered to the population  by officially registered enterprises in this sphere fell almost  by half in Ukraine, declined almost by a factor of three in  Russia, fell by about 40 percent in Uzbekistan and Belarus, and  declined by almost a factor of four in Kyrgyzstan and Moldova.    Prices and rates for all categories of for-fee services for  the population went up in January. As compared to December of  last year, they increased most in Armenia (by 172.7 percent) and  Azerbaijan (by 66 percent), and the least in Uzbekistan (by 12  percent) and Kyrgyzstan (by 16.1 percent).    Fees for municipal services went up over the month by 3.9  percent in Turkmenistan, by 5.6 percent in Kyrgyzstan, and  4.6-fold in Armenia; passenger transportation rates--by 3.6  percent in Uzbekistan, by 89.0 percent in Moldova, and 2.7-fold  in Armenia. The greatest increase of communications services  rates in January as compared to last year December occurred in  Azerbaijan (by 216.8 percent) and Armenia (by 181.7 percent),  and the smallest--in Kazakhstan (by 2.8 percent). Moldova,  Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan kept communications services rates  at last December's level.    Fees for attendance of preschool facilities went up in  Azerbaijan by 668.3 percent, Armenia--by 300 percent,  Moldova--by 10.2 percent, Turkmenistan--by 15.5 percent, and  Uzbekistan--by 16.3 percent.    The cost of a stay in a sanitarium or resort went up by 80.8  percent in Belarus, by 61.5 percent in Kazakhstan, by 56.5  percent in Uzbekistan, and by 13.8 percent in Turkmenistan.  <H5>  The Labor Market </H5>   In January, 1.3 million unemployed were registered  with employment services of the Commonwealth states, which is  1.5 times as many as during the corresponding period of last  year.

In Ukraine, jobs were found for 7.5 percent of  unemployed.    The diminished proportional share of persons placed in jobs  in January 1994 was caused by a decline in requests for workers  filed with the employment service: For instance, in Belarus,  Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan their number declined by a factor of  1.5; in Moldova--by a factor of 1.2; and in Russia--by a factor  of 1.1    The number of those who received the formal status of  unemployed increased in Azerbaijan 2.9-fold, in  Armenia--1.7-fold, in Belarus--2.3-fold, Kazakhstan and  Ukraine--1.2-fold, Kyrgyzstan--1.6-fold, Moldova--1.1-fold,  Russia--1.4 fold, and Uzbekistan--1.3-fold.

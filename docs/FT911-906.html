			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Politicians ride nationalist tiger in Croatia WHEN Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, came to London earlier this week he had few kind words to say about the Serbs. They belonged to 'a different civilisation,' he said. Their Orthodox faith and centuries of Ottoman domination set them far apart from the Catholic Croats, who had been part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. His disparaging comments about the Serbs and other ethnic groups in Yugoslavia will serve only to strengthen the already deep sense of suspicion between the country's two largest peoples. Some 600,000 Serbs live in Croatia - 11 per cent of the republic's population. They settled there following waves of migrations from the south which started in 1690 when Serbs fled from Turkish domination. In Croatia, they played a key role in protecting the frontiers from the Turks, a point omitted from Mr Tudjman's London lecture. The Serb minority assimilated, as much as was possible given their different cultural traditions. The Serb script is Cyrillic, their religion Orthodox; the Croats' script and religion are Latin and Catholic. The two ethnic groups have retained their dialects of the Serbo-Croatian language, which Croats today are accentuating to emphasise their distinctive cultural identity. But it was the events of the Second World War which poisoned relations between the two groups. After tens of thousands of Serbs were killed by the Nazi-backed Croatian Ustasha movement, and others sought refuge in the Partisan movement, Tito gave the Serbs a much greater political prominence in Croatia. Proportionally, Serb influence in the Communist party, the security forces, and the Croatian administration was excessive. Tito often used the Serbs as a kind of watchdog over the Croats, particularly after 1971, following his brutal suppression of the Croatian nationalist movement which wanted greater autonomy. For these reasons many Croats are seeking revenge for past injustices - perceived to be perpetrated by Serbs - through the creation of an independent Croatia, or a Yugoslavia which is not dominated by Serbia. A section of the Serb minority in Croatia is determined to resist this. Led by Mr Milan Babic, a staunch nationalist and proponent of a 'Greater Serbia,' militant and largely peasant Serbs from around Knin have declared Serb-inhabited regions autonomous from Croatia, and aspire to union with Serbia. They constitute a very small percentage of the Serb minority. But their militancy has incensed the republic's government, and has tapped latent Croatian nationalism, centred in the Dalmatian port of Split. Non-militant Serbs in Croatia, who have held talks with the republic's government, fear becoming the target of Croatian nationalists. If Croatia becomes independent, they feel they will become underdogs. The Croatian government could allay their fears by starting negotiations with the militants. But this appears extremely difficult since Croats believe Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Communist/nationalist president of Serbia, has supported the militants in Croatia in order to quash the republic's plans for independence. The danger now facing both republics is that nationalism has assumed its own momentum; it is out of the hands of the politicians.</p>

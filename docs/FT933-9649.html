			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Retailers lead field in deals abroad RETAILERS based in the UK dominated first-time expansion in the north-west of continental Europe last year, research by Management Horizons, the retail research group, has indicated, Neil Buckley writes. UK retailers accounted for 25 per cent of deals in which retailers were expanding into a north-western European market for the first time. Retailers in France, the Netherlands and Switzerland each accounted for less than 15 per cent. The UK companies included Tesco, which acquired the French supermarket chain Catteau, and Sears, which bought the Dutch mail order operator Ter Meulen Post. The UK, France and Germany each accounted for 20 per cent of first-time expansion activity in Europe as a whole. European Retail Expansion.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party on Thursday refuted a U.S. State Department  statement confirming Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for  East Asia and the Pacific Tom Hubbard's recent remarks calling  on Seoul to repeal its National Security Law as the official  U.S. position.    Emerging from a staff meeting presided over by Chairman Kim  Chong-pil, Party Spokesman Ha Sun-pong issued a statment  rebuking the U.S. State Department statement.    Noting that the National Security Law's abolition has been  one of North Korea's consistent demands, Ha said the question of  repealing this law must be dealt with carefully because North  Korea has not yet guaranteed the transparency of its nuclear  program and because the North's military threat still exists.    Chairman Kim said, "I don't think Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State Hubbard made such remarks with any knowledge about  North Korean laws... I can't understand why he raised such a  sensitive issue at this point of time."    Secretary-General Mun Chong-su called Hubbard's remarks "an  intervention of domestic affairs" and criticized the opposition  party for its support of the comments.    Chief Policy-maker Yi Se-ki supported Mun, saying the  opposition party should take a stand against such remarks.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Moscow bank saved from closure MOSCOW NARODNY bank has satisfied the Bank of England that it has adequate capital, following the injection of new funds from Vnesheconombank, the former Soviet trade bank. The new funds have prevented the possible closure of MNB, which has been threatened by the mounting economic crisis in the former Soviet Union. Vnesheconombank has transferred Pounds 70m to Moscow Narodny, raising its total capital to Pounds 190m, an increase of 58 per cent. The injection follows a commitment by the Russian government at the end of November to provide sufficient financial support for MNB to meet its obligations. This followed talks with the Bank of England, which was concerned about possible withdrawal of deposits by western banks in response to the economic crisis in the former Soviet Union. The new funds will allow MNB to make additional charges against loans to the former Soviet Union and eastern European states. 'We are raising capital to guard against contingencies,' Mr William Newman, assistant general manager of MNB, said at the weekend. MNB's shareholders have already channeled new funds to the bank. In June 1990 it received Pounds 17m and in February 1991 it received Pounds 26m to help write off its Bulgarian debts. MNB is 51 per cent owned by Gosbank, the former Soviet central bank and Vnesheconombank, which is under the administrative control of the Russian central bank. Talks are underway about the transfer of the Vnesheconombank and Gosbank stakes to the Russian central and foreign trade banks. The Russian government has made a commitment to central banks to provide backing for the Soviet-owned Banque Commerciale de l'Europe du Nord in Paris, the Ost-west Handelsbank in Frankfurt, the East West United Bank in Luexmbourg and Donau Bank in Austria. These banks were required to clarify their position with their regulatory authorities under an agreement by the Group of Seven industrial countries to defer Soviet debt repayments. The G7 was concerned that a liquidity crisis at one of Vnesheconombank's western subsidiaries would damage the west's financial system. MNB, which has operated as a Soviet-UK trade bank in London since 1919, is thought to have a continuing role in financing trade and investment for Russia. At the end of 1990, it had deposits of Pounds 1.5bn, roughly divided between Vnesheconombank and western banks.</p>

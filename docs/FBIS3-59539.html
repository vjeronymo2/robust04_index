Its present capital is 3.96 billion francs  [Fr]. The operation will reduce the nominal value of the stock,  pending a capital contribution of Fr8.6 billion by the state,  that is to be effected in two transfers of funds, one at the end  of this year and the other during 1994. Technically, its capital  will first be reduced by Fr3.5 billion in two stages. The first  stage will consist of a consolidation: Ten Fr20 shares will  become one Fr200 share. In the second stage, the value of this  share will be divided by 10, reducing it to Fr20. This  reduction, combined with the withdrawal of Fr3.4 billion from  the "issues, mergers, and contributions" reserve account, will  lower Bull's (still) negative balance brought forward, from  Fr9.44 billion to Fr2.44 billion. Bull's capital stock is owned  to the extent of 72 percent by the state, 16 percent by France  Telecom, 5.6 percent by IBM, 4.4 percent by NEC, and 1.7 percent  by the public. Over the past nine months, Bull's revenue has  declined by 8.6 percent (Fr18.24 billion).</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Romanian privatisation agency chief resigns MR Aurelian Dochia, head of Romania's privatisation agency, has resigned, becoming the third well-known reformer to leave the government in the past two weeks. Western businessmen and diplomats in Bucharest said his resignation added to uncertainty over the commitment of the left-wing minority government to reform and rapid privatisation. Mr Dochia's departure follows the resignation of Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister responsible for economic reform, and the dismissal of Mr Emilian Ijdelea, president of the Romanian Development Agency, the government's foreign investment arm, last month. Both Mr Dochia and Mr Ijdelea reported to Mr Negritoiu, an independent, who was considered the cabinet's most important reformer. Mr Dochia said the state had so far sold only 1 per cent of the equity of the 6,280 state companies earmarked for privatisation, even though the 1991 privatisation law stipulated that 10 per cent should be sold each year. He said the best solution would be to bring the State Ownership Fund, the 70 per cent owner of the commercial companies, under government control. Before his resignation, Mr Negritoiu had begun to make the SOF, conceived as an independent body, more accountable to government but had run into political opposition. The SOF's board has been dominated by members of the ruling Social Democracy party since it won last September's general elections. The party, which includes many senior former communists, has encouraged SOF to give priority to privatisation through management or employee buy-outs. The board has allowed the SOF to invest the proceeds in other state firms with the aim of giving them a better chance of survival once privatised. Opposition parties say this is not permitted under the 1991 law. The SOF should make efforts to attract foreign investors and sell off state companies as quickly as possible, they say.</p>

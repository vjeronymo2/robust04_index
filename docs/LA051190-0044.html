			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / VIDEO: 2 FILMS ON FAMILIES WORTH A LOOK  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Who says there aren't any family films anymore? Well, at least there are still  some movies about families. This weekend at the video store you can choose  between two recent theatrical releases, one about a family ("Dad") and the  other about a potential one ("Immediate Family").  </P> <P> "Dad" (MCA, priced for rental, PG) is a comedy/drama about growing old in  America and the relationship between a father (Jack Lemmon) and son (Ted  Danson). If that reminds you of "On Golden Pond," it should -- "Dad" has the  same mix of smart lines and sentimentality. One more "family" element: Gary  David Goldberg, from TV's "Family Ties," wrote, directed and co-produced.  </P> <P> In "Immediate Family" (RCA, $89.95, PG-13), a couple (Glenn Close, James Woods)  considers adopting the child of a pregnant, unwed teen-ager (Mary Stuart  Masterson). The drama, also starring Kevin Dillon, was directed by Jonathan  Kaplan.  </P> <P> (Actually, your best bet is to skip the videos entirely and head for a theater  where the sweet and sassy and very funny family comedy "Daddy's Dyin' . . .  Who's Got the Will?" is playing.)  </P> <P> Maybe you don't want a family film. You can't get much more non-family-oriented  than "Drugstore Cowboy" (IVE, $89.95, R), a gritty, critically acclaimed 1989  look at a drug addict (Matt Dillon). TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

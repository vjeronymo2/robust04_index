			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Western Cape National Party premier-elect </F> Hernus Kriel by correspondent Barbara Folscher at the Parade in  Cape Town -- live]    [Excerpt] [Folscher] Good evening. At the Parade here in  Cape Town, a large group of people has gathered. It is clear  they are from the National Party and from the ANC. But before  we return to them, we earlier spoke to Mr. Kriel and during the  run-up to the election there had been a lot of criticism against  the National Party's campaign, particularly from the ANC. It  was said that the campaign was a racist one, and that there were  fears in the Colored community that this aspect was being  exploited. We asked Mr. Kriel about this.    [Kriel] We did not take advantage of people's fears. We  fought a hard election campaign against the ANC. We did not  spare them, they did not spare us. As far as my vision for the  Western Cape region is concerned -- the Cape of Good Hope as I  always call it -- I think that the first thing that we have to  do is to initiate a process of reconciliation. We have to leave  the petty politics behind, we have to take hands, we have to  plan jointly how to improve the quality of life, especially that  of the poor people in the region.

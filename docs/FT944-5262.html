			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Xerox offers to manage facilities Rank Xerox, the international document company, has joined forces with cost management consultancy Currie &amp; Brown to launch a new company in the growing facilities-management market. The market has grown rapidly over the past few years as companies have cut costs by concentrating on their core businesses and farmed out more peripheral services to specialist organisations. CBX, which is to be launched today, will be capitalised at Pounds 500,000 and be held equally by Rank Xerox, Currie &amp; Brown and the management of CBX. CBX was formerly the British services division of Rank Xerox. Traditionally, companies operating in the market have tended to concentrate on managing one particular aspect of an organisation's operations, such as property management. However Mr Alan Berry, managing director of CBX, said the company would integrate the operations of buildings, including property management, facilities operations and project management. Facilities management has developed along a number of paths. It is well entrenched in the computer industry, where companies outsource hardware and data processing, while in the property sector the concept has centred on the management of buildings and building services. The public sector has also moved in this direction, with compulsory competitive tendering, privatisation and market testing opening up a diverse range of contract opportunities to private-sector companies. The expansion of the sector means reliable figures are scarce and it remains an ill-defined market with huge variations in the estimates of its size.</p>

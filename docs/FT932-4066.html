			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Kohl backs Ukraine in fight for EC markets: Pro-Russian stance denied during visit to Kiev GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday promised to push for greater Ukrainian access to the markets of the European Community. Speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Kiev, he said: 'I will absolutely say at the European Community meeting in Copenhagen that the markets of Europe must be open to Ukrainian goods.' Mr Kohl, whose country boasts one of the strongest relationships with Ukraine of any western power, vowed to 'put forward Ukraine's interests' at the July meeting in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. Mr Kohl's trip to Ukraine, his first visit there since it achieved independence nearly two years ago, was designed to allay Ukrainian fears that their country is being overlooked by western powers trying to forge close links with Russia. Mr Kohl told reporters: 'There can be no question of either/or, there can only be relationships with both.' The assurances come at a time of escalating disputes between Ukraine and Russia over issues such as the contested Black Sea Fleet. Mr Kohl also said he had received clear assurances from President Leonid Kravchuk that the Ukrainian government remains committed to its earlier non-nuclear policy. 'I noted with great pleasure the statement of the Ukrainian government that it will continue to speak forcefully for the ratification of the Start 1 treaty and the Lisbon protocol,' Mr Kohl said. German diplomats added that Mr Kravchuk also promised to push for accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would entrench Ukraine's status as a non-nuclear state. The assurances echo promises Mr Kravchuk to the Mr Les Aspin, US secretary of defence earlier this week. But it is parliament, not the president, which must ratify the arms pacts. After the Ukrainian prime minister's popular call last week for Kiev, at least temporarily, to keep some of its nuclear weapons, the Ukrainian parliament seems unlikely to ratify speedily the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which would enshrine Ukraine's status as a non-nuclear state. About 10,000 coal miners of the depressed Donbass region went out on strike on Wednesday. The highly Russified Donbass has been a hot-bed of political protest since the first miners' strikes in 1989. In the current strikes, the miners have added demands for regional autonomy and Mr Kravchuk's resignation to their standard call for pay increases. Last night Mr Kravchuk urged the miners on television to return to work and he endorsed their call for new elections. He also promised further economic reforms.</p>

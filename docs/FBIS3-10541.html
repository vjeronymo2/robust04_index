			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gandi Montoya; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Eduardo Colindres, Christian Democratic Party  magistrate to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], has denied  the accusation by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  [FMLN], adding the Armed Forces will only provide assistance and  certain facilities after the 20 March elections are over.    [Begin recording] [Montoya] Magistrate Colindres has denied  the TSE wants to include the Armed Forces in an electoral  organization on election day as denounced by the FMLN.  According to Colindres, the Armed Forces will not be assigned  to transport voting supplies or survey roads, but some of its  units will provide assistance once the elections are over.    [Colindres] We have told the FMLN we were only planning to  use an Air Force helicopter to ship electoral certificates for  the vote count.    [Montoya] Colindres has said the Army's participation in the  elections will be at a minimum, and, primarily, it will be  supervised by other people.    [Colindres] The helicopter will carry only the pilot, the  copilot, a representative of the UN Observers to El Salvador, a  member of each from the departmental and municipal electoral  boards, and a TSE representative who will bring the certificates  to the heliport that will be set up in front of the Presidente  Hotel.    [Montoya] Colindres believes the FMLN has played dirty by  accepting a situation and later denouncing it as a violation of  the laws; in this regard, Colindres has said the FMLN's  dishonest behavior could be only the result of a propagandistic  campaign.

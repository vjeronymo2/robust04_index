			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the occasion of the Vietnamese lunar new year, a  VNA correspondent interviewed Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet on the  struggle to practice thrift and oppose corruption and waste,  which he emphasized recently at the Ninth National Assembly's  fourth session and at the government meeting in Ho Chi Minh City  in early January.    Regarding efforts to practice thrift and oppose waste, the  prime minister said this is a major issue that will have a  direct impact on production, business, and the daily life of  units and laborers. According to the prime minister, the task  must be carried out from the top down to the lowest levels.  Efforts must be made to showcase good examples from among the  cadres and party members, while measures must be taken to  improve the organization of agencies and motivate the people to  abide by the law.    The prime minister urged sectors and agencies to strive to  promote thrift and oppose waste in production and business at  each organization and enterprise, and to make this a widespread  and far-reaching movement among the people during the new stage.  He said: Efforts must be made to save capital in order to  achieve industrialization and modernization. This is part of  the cause of building a prosperous people, a strong nation, and  an advanced society. He contended that it is time for all  localities to practice thrift. The mass media should commend  good deeds and denounce waste and lavish spending. He said that  the mass media plays an important role in this regard, and that  the results of these tasks should be reviewed periodically to  draw on experience and formulate measures to carry out work more  effectively. Efforts should be made to renovate work styles and  design additional concrete measures, while opposing feasts being  organized to celebrate anniversaries or welcome high-ranking  officials when they visit the provinces and municipalities. He  stressed that this will save the people's time, energy, and  money.</p>

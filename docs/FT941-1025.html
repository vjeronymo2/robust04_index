			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / When a chapel is made redundant: Heritage It is not just Britain's fine old parish churches that have had a hard time attracting congregations in recent years. Many nonconformist chapels find themselves in the same position. However, to some eyes, not many of the 4,000 chapels that are listed buildings are as architecturally appealing as their Anglican counterparts. This means plans to make them redundant, in the same way as churches, have to be tempered with the fact that few would be likely to attract a steady stream of visitors. Generally, most chapels that are declared redundant are put to other use. In a small number of cases a building has been considered to be of such architectural merit that to convert it into a house or business premises was deemed inappropriate. Most of these higher grade buildings are recognised by having a grade I or grade II* listing, which in itself presents a problem. If the building is a fine one, but no longer in demand for its original purpose, what do you do with it if you are not allowed to convert it to another use? Since last summer this problem has been laid at the South Kensington door of Jennifer Freeman, a former secretary of The Victorian Society, and the first director of the Historic Chapels Trust for England. She has the task of finding teams of local 'friends' willing to take the finest redundant chapels under their wing on a care and maintenance basis and to arrange for groups of visitors to tour them when they wish. Occasionally, this meant formalising an already existing arrangement. But in the case of buildings such as the Friends Meeting House, at Farfield near Bradford, West Yorkshire, it is very different. The chapel, a grade II* stone building built in 1689, has not been used regularly for religious meetings since the beginning of the last century. In 1957 three members of the congregation bought the building to prevent it from being converted into a house. They are now elderly and have agreed to hand the building over to the trust, which will arrange for a new set of carers to take the building under their wing. A similar case is the splendid Unitarian chapel at Todmorden near Halifax, West Yorkshire. This is a grade I listed building dating from the 1860s capable of seating 450. For many years services were held in the nearby church lodge, which was large enough for the average weekly congregation of between 20 and 30. Two years ago, however, the congregation was disbanded and the trust, soon to be owners of the building, has the task of finding a group of local volunteers that will care for it. The other two buildings likely to be acquired this year are Walpole Chapel, Suffolk, a 19th century Congregational building closed more than 20 years ago, and the Baptist Chapel at Cote, near Witney in Oxfordshire. Both are listed grade II*. The Cote chapel dates from 1604 but has not been used for regular services since 1980. The local congregation worships at a newer building in a nearby village and has great difficulty maintaining the old chapel. As well as nonconformist chapels the trust is hoping to take on a handful of Roman Catholic chapels of architectural merit that are no longer used for regular worship. Freeman would also like to add a synagogue to the portfolio. The trust receives an annual grant from the Department of National Heritage. It has also launched an appeal to assist with its work which has attracted sponsorship from several large companies. Individual membership of the trust costs Pounds 10, joint membership Pounds 15, and life membership Pounds 250. The Historic Chapels Trust, 4 Cromwell Place, London SW7 2JJ. Tel: 071-589 0228.</p>

It also has 15 distribution depots and a dairy farm. In the float which valued it at Pounds 63.7m, Wiseman raised Pounds 14.5m cash for the company. The Wiseman family retained a 74.8 per cent stake. Wiseman said Juronom had net assets of Pounds 3.2m at January 1, and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 338,000 on sales of Pounds 45.8m in the year to that date.</p>

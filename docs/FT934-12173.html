			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Hurd rejects Maastricht 'paradise' BRITAIN yesterday warned its European Community partners not to treat the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty next month as a 'passport to paradise'. As France and Germany tabled a joint initiative to give substance to the European union established on November 1, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said it was time for EC governments to refocus on the concerns of their citizens. Speaking to British MPs ahead of tomorrow's summit in Brussels, the foreign secretary insisted that Britain was winning the argument for a more flexible, decentralised Europe. 'Those who want to go down the old road to greater centralisation have learned something in the last two years,' the foreign secretary said. Mr Hurd did little to disguise Britain's view that the summit, called by Bonn to celebrate Maastricht, was unnecessary. But since it was taking place the leaders should spend the time discussing European competitiveness and employment rather than issuing 'blasts of trumpets' to usher in European union. Mr Hurd added that the summit should recommit the EC to the conclusion by December 15 of the Uruguay round of the Gatt world trade talks. However, he indicated that Britain would not seek to 'corner' France in Brussels over its refusal to accept the EC-US deal over farm subsidies. Looking ahead to the next inter-governmental conference in 1996, the foreign secretary said that the entry of Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway would involve further changes in the Community's institutions. He said present arrangements, under which two large and one small countries constitute a 'blocking' minority, must be preserved when the Community's membership increases from 12 to 16. That result would allow a proportionately smaller group of states to veto decisions of the majority. The British government also wanted to reduce the number of commissioners once the Community was enlarged. Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the Commission, had agreed that the 21 commissioners at present implied by the entry of four new members was impracticable. But Britain was so far alone among the large EC countries in voicing willingness to reduce its representation from two to one.</p>

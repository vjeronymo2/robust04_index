John  Bell said. The officers gave chase until both cars pulled to the curb.  </P> <P> Goins, a passenger, got out and began walking toward the second car, Bell said.  When the officers saw the driver pass a gun to Goins, Bell said, they  identified themselves and told the suspect to drop the gun. After the youth  allegedly "put his hand to his waistband," one of the officers fired.  </P></p>

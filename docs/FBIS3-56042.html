An End to a  Currency Paradox?"]    [Text] At yesterday's trading session of the Moscow  interbank currency exchange the dollar reached its highest rate  against the ruble since 23 September 1993 -- 1,293 rubles [R]  per dollar. The September record the dollar hit two days after  the parliament was dissolved was R1,299 per dollar.    Experts attribute the R19 increase in the currency exchange  rate on Tuesday (following Monday's R15 rise) to "uncertainty  over the government's economic policy and the possibility of a  government reshuffle." What is noteworthy are the pace of the  ruble's slide and the Russian Federation Central Bank's line of  conduct at the two latest trading sessions.    Compared with the first trading session in the new year on 5  January, the ruble dropped 3 percent. The speed of the currency  exchange rates' movement was effectively in line with last  year's typical inflation rate, which was determined by the scale  of the creation of credit and money.    Hence, there would have been nothing extraordinary in the  dollar's behavior on the Russian currency market after the New  Year, had the country's population not become used to the fact  that the exchange rate fluctuates regardless of how many rubles  are printed.    But the situation of the second half of 1993 -- a stable  ruble accompanied by a 30-percent semiannual inflation in  July-December -- is characteristic only of economies in  transition at a time when prices change significantly and  currencies' purchasing power parities come closer to their  exchange rates. This paradox was bound to end sooner or later,  and it cannot be ruled out that the ruble's fall yesterday was a  symptom that a normal, quantitative interrelation between  inflation and currency exchange rate dynamics was finally being  restored.    If this is so, the general political and economic background  to the events at the Moscow interbank currency exchange  ("uncertainty of economic policy" and the possibility of a  reshuffle) is merely a pretext for reversing the currency  trends. Maybe the Central Bank, too, has a similar view on the  situation as it nodded agreement to the dollar's new exchange  rate figures (according to some banks, yesterday the Central  Bank offered for sale a meager $16.5 million).</p>

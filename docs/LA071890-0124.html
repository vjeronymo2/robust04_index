			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ADULT MOVIE SHOWN BY ACCIDENT ON CABLE  </P> <P> Comcast Cablevision officials are blaming a malfunctioning television switcher  for the accidental screening of an adult film on its preview channel.  </P> <P> The non-rated movie, "Cecil Howard's Foxtrot," was shown on Comcast's Channel  36, which normally shows short segments of upcoming movies on the cable  service's pay-for-view channels.  </P> <P> The film, which shows several explicit sex acts, aired on the preview channel  for almost an hour beginning at 9 p.m. before technicians yanked it off the  airwaves.  </P> <P> The film was supposed to be shown on Channel 39, which shows non-rated and  R-rated movies, said David Barford, general manager and vice president of  Comcast Cablevision in Orange County.  </P> <P> "We are still investigating what happened," Barford said. "We believe our  switcher malfunctioned and put the movie over Channel 36."  </P> <P> Barford said the switcher prevents viewers from getting channels that are  scrambled. Comcast has three pay-per-view channels that are scrambled,  including Channel 39.  </P> <P> Normally, viewers cannot get programming from the scrambled channels unless  they pay about $4 a program, Barford said.  </P> <P> "We're extremely upset that this happened," Barford said. "We certainly are  taking measures to make sure this doesn't happen again."  </P> <P> The station reported that it received nine complaints about the screening.  </P></p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (4): Last year's profits flowed like wine - The banks have proved resilient in the face of increasing competition THIS month's gala reception in the spa town of Mondorf-les-Bains was a glittering occasion for the Grand Duchy's leading bankers. Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg's prime minister, was present; so was Crown Prince Henri. The wine flowed almost as fast as the past year's profits. This has been an outstanding year for Luxembourg's banks. The industry proved much more resilent than expected in the face of increasing competition and the sharp economic downturn among its neighbours, particularly Germany. Yet behind the story of steady expansion, there are nagging concerns. Fresh efforts to introduce an EC-wide withholding tax threaten one of the cornerstones of the industry. At the same time, there may be less to the surge in 1992 profits than meets the eye - it was almost certainly inflated by the influx of German savings seeking a safe haven from the Bonn government's tax net. The Luxembourg Bankers Association (ABBL), the principal organisation representing the industry, has grasped the danger of being branded a tax haven whose principal strength lies in exploiting fiscal anomalies within the EC. It has come up with a three-pronged counter-attack. First, the ABBL argues that the Grand Duchy may be ready to strike a deal on withholding tax, but only if the new arrangements cover OECD countries. This means Switzerland, as well as tax havens such as the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, Lichtenstein and Monaco. Second, the ABBL has launched a campaign to convince the rest of the world that Luxembourg's investment in technology, innovation and training means that its status as a leading financial centre is secure, even if Europe's politicians choose to tinker with the tax rules. Third, the Association is trying, with some success, to reduce the industry's high cost base. This means introducing much more flexibility into salaries to reflect responsibility and performance and break the traditional link with inflation. Occasionally the campaign errs on the over-optimistic side. A recent survey by Arthur Andersen, the international management consultants, concluded that Luxembourg's banking industry was entering a period of consolidation; but it also reported a remarkable confidence among executives working for the Grand Duchy's financial institutions. Looking ahead to the year 2000, the survey cheerfully predicted that the amount of funds under management could reach Dollars 750bn; operating profits could amount to Dollars 5.3bn; and staffing would be about 20,000. Meanwhile, the number of banks was likely to rise from the present 220 to more than 250. Yet the survey also acknowledged that these headline figures assumed an unchanged fiscal and regulatory environment. Some may disagree that this is a 'reasonable' assumption; others would concede, however, that the industry has matured over the past 10 years as it has developed new services in private banking, custodial services, and financial instruments. During this period, there has been a steady move away from reliance on interest income, where margins are being squeezed by competition as a source of revenue. In 1992, net interest income grew by 8 per cent only; it also dropped as a share of gross results to 70.8 per cent, the lowest level ever recorded - a shift which can be explained largely by highly profitable foreign exchange and securities trading. Like London and New York, Luxembourg knew how to exploit the recent upheaval in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Chris Cottrell, head of the Fleming Flagship Fund, whose total net assets passed Dollars 1bn this year, says that Luxembourg's chief attraction lies in its proximity to the French and German markets and its ability to implement legislation without delay. This was true of the investment fund law in 1989; but it will also apply to the new USITS unit trust legislation scheduled to come into force next July. Flemings employs 120 staff from 14 different countries. This same multilingual, multinational spirit infuses leading local banks such as Banque Generale de Luxembourg. 'We hire good young people,' says Mr Paul Meyers, a senior executive, 'and we invest heavily in information technology.' Banque Generale's development shows how it has diversified from its more traditional business of supporting local industry, as shown by its continuing minority equity stake in Arbed, the steel-maker. The Luxembourg bank recently set up the Northumberland Group in the UK which employs 40 people specialising in Personal Equity Pensions; and it has expanded its expertise in fund administration to the point where it has 295 compartments managing more than 100 funds. Among US banks in Luxembourg, Chase Manhattan offers an example of the development of private banking services. Chase's target market is the individual with a minimum of Dollars 1 million capital. (Exceptions are made if the client has Dollars 500,000 and has good prospects of quickly hitting the Dollars 1m mark). Many of Chase's clients are owners of small and medium-sized businesses in neighbouring Belgium, France and Germany. Mr Pierfranco de Vita, general manager of Chase's private banking branch, which reports to a head office in Geneva, says that clients are attracted at the prospect of being able to tap into Chase's other services such as corporate finance. 'Most of the clients are already offshore, so it's not new money,' he says, 'but we are offering all-round services.' Chase's self-styled 'Know Your Client' policy is a useful marketing tool in the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce (BCCI), whose operations remained for a long time a mystery not only to Luxembourg authorities but also to the Bank of England. Mr Pierre Jaans, the head of the Luxembourg Monetary Institute, (IML) the Grand Duchy's financial regulator, says the authorities are now much better equipped to deal with rogue banks such as BCCI. Last April, the second EC banking directive and the money laundering directive passed into law - supported by IML circulars on solvency ratios and so-called 'own funds'. Mr Jaans argues that BCCI was a legacy of a much more lax regulatory environment in the 1970s, which was true of Europe as a whole.</p>

The 26-year-old Kourosh said "his real aim was to overshadow  the joy of people at the start of the `ten-day-dawn'  ceremonies," which marks the 15th anniversay of the victory of  the Islamic revolution.    He fired five bullets into the air while President 'Ali  Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani was addressing a large gathering of people,  among them foreign guests.    He was immdiately disarmed by the crowd and handed over to  the law enforcement forces.    Major Panahi, a law enforcement commander for southern  Tehran, told IRNA today that the person under arrest carried a  revolver, from which the bullets were fired. The handgun is a  U.S.-made low-caliber revolver, he added.    Major Panahi quoted the culprit as saying "he did not plan  to  assassinate any specific person. Rather, he meant to terrorize  people and spoil the celebrations."</p>

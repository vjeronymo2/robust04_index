			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Atlas Copco moves ahead 14% ATLAS COPCO, the Swedish tool manufacturing group, saw profits after financial items rise 14 per cent in 1992 to SKr1.03bn (Dollars 134m) from SKr902m in 1991. The group said it benefited from restructuring and higher interest rates which more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes. An unchanged dividend of SKr8 per share is proposed on a 22 per cent increase in earnings per share to SKr16.90. Atlas forecast unchanged earnings for the current year, but it noted that the weak sales trend which it experienced towards the end of 1992 had continued into 1993. Group sales rose 7 per cent last year to SKr16bn from SKr15bn, largely reflecting the acquisition of AEG's electrical power tool operations at the start of the year. Operating profits after depreciation climbed 7 per cent to SKr1.13bn. There was increased demand for drilling equipment, but low metal prices and large inventories depressed demand in the mining sector. In industrial markets, European demand was generally weak, apart from Germany. Orders received rose 4 per cent to SKr15.88bn, but adjusted for comparable units, the level dropped 4 per cent. The group's construction and mining technique business area turned round a SKr53m loss in 1991 to produce a SKr157m profit last year, despite a drop in sales to SKr4.25bn from SKr4.49bn.</p>

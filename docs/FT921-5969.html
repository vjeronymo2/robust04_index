			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / A deafening bang, silence then the screaming began One of 28 people injured by yesterday morning's rush-hour bomb at London Bridge station is lifted into an ambulance. The 2lb device went off in a lavatory minutes after a coded warning that bombs had been left at unspecified BR stations. The bombing, described by George Churchill-Coleman of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch as a 'criminal and callous act carried out by the Provisional IRA', closed mainline and Underground stations for several hours. Four of the injured were seriously hurt. IT WAS just another Friday morning. Up at 7am, blue pinstripe, red tie, pink FT. The 7.50 from Surbiton, via Wimbledon, Clapham Junction and Waterloo (six minutes late into Waterloo after an unexplained halt). Fellow commuters checked their watches and tut-tutted. Just another Friday morning. Over the concourse to Waterloo East, I waited for the train from Charing Cross, walked down the platform to avoid the crush of hardened travellers. I stepped off the train almost opposite the gents' toilet on Platform 4 at London Bridge, dawdling towards the exit. There was a deafening bang about 30 ft away. Not a rumble, just a sharp, brittle retort like a supercharged firecracker, and a gust of hot air followed by the sound of glass falling. After the bang, the silence. Shocked faces turned to where a plume of dirty grey smoke rose a few yards down the platform. Three or four human forms lay huddled amid the dust and debris on the platform's edge. And then the screaming started. 'A derailment,' I thought for a split second. Then: 'No, a bomb.' I checked the station clock - 8:27:31. Precisely. A middle-aged chap in a grey overcoat stood next to me, mouth agape. He looked as though he might start crying. 'It's a bomb,' I told him, confidently, and started walking back up the platform to the victims. An afterthought checked me: there might be a second blast. There was blood, mainly seeping from noses and ears, and from cuts caused by flying glass. A black-coated man in his mid-forties held a handkerchief to his nose. I took his arm, led him to a nearby seat and checked him over. No cuts, nothing broken. 'It's probably the concussion from the blast,' I improvised. 'You'll be OK.' He did not reply. A train pulled in to Platform 4 on the Kent arrivals side. Several passengers waved it through, but it stopped. Passengers leapt out, charged, wavered, then broke ranks. Some stopped in shock. Many more walked straight past. If the train had arrived 15 seconds earlier .. Several people were still lying where they had fallen, surrounded now by helpers - mainly women. I patted a few backs and offered a few words of comfort. Some young girls were still screaming. Otherwise the scene was strangely still, as if running in slow motion. The middle-aged chap in the grey coat caught up with me and grabbed my arm. 'Did you see it?' he gasped, his grip very tight. 'I'd just walked past there. Jesus Christ. You passed me. I saw you. I'm going home. I'm going home. Jesus Christ.' Another businessman overheard us. 'What's the point?' he asked, bitterly, waving his arms at no one in particular. 'What's the bloody point?' We all knew what he was referring to. 'Bloody IRA,' he said. 'Bloody pointless.' He stalked off, head held high. Urban Man, grim but undefeated. Sirens wailed in the distance. The first blue ranks of police charged up the platform, ordering people to clear the area. There was nothing more to do, so we left. The bombed platform and those next to it were sealed off. The main entrance was blocked by commuters from other lines, some trying to leave, some trying to get in. Few realised what had happened. Outside, ranks of fire engines and police cars arrived. It was 8.36. A young man carrying a sports bag surveyed the scene glumly. 'I've got to get over the (London) Bridge,' he said. 'I'm not taking the Tube after this lot. Where is bloody London Bridge, anyway?' 'You're almost standing on it,' I told him, pointing to the bridge a few yards away where lines of City footsoldiers marched towards the Square Mile. We laughed, nervously. If it isn't staff shortages, it's snow; if it isn't snow it's leaves. And if it isn't leaves, it's bombs. It was just another Friday morning.</p>

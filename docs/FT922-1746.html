			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where to use your cards IF YOU are planning to leave home with your credit cards, you should know where you can use them. Acceptance varies significantly from country to country. If you need money in an emergency, all the major credit cards (Visa and MasterCard) and cash cards (American Express, Diners Club and Link) offer you cash withdrawals. Interest accrues just as it does if you use a credit card in a UK cash dispenser, so they are best regarded as a last resort. Check before you leave to find if interest dates from the transaction or the first statement after it. The typical transaction charge for each deal is 1.5 per cent. A recent survey by Which?, the magazine of the Consumers' Association, found dispensers were three times more likely to cause problems - either by rejecting cards or refusing to dispense money - than other transactions using plastic cards. But their record still was good. Which? found no cases of cards being swallowed by a foreign machine, and no significant differences between brands of card. Cards require a personal identification number (PIN). Many people do not bother to keep this but issuers can send you a reminder. You should ask for your PIN a few weeks before you leave, but do not write it down unless you have to. Next, check the limit on cash withdrawals for the card; usually, it will be different from the limit for purchases. Also, it can be wise to take out card protection insurance, as risks of theft increase when you go abroad. This should cost less than Pounds 10. Finally, keep cash receipts - interest can mount up and you need to have records to check the charges. Availability is as follows; American Express has 43,000 automatic teller machines (ATMs) world-wide but they are concentrated, as you might expect, in the US where there are 28,000. There are 4,500 in Spain, 1,800 in Portugal and 1,500 in France, but you can probably afford to leave home without the American Express card if you are going to Greece, where there are only 100 machines, or Germany (50). Diners Club has access to 40,000 ATMs world-wide, mostly in the US and Canada. It also has widespread facilities at airports, thanks to a link with British Airways, and claims greater strength than its rivals in Africa. MasterCard, generally known as Access in the UK, now has more than 95,000 ATMs. Its main strengths are the US and Europe, where is known as Eurocard. By the end of this year, it plans to have 10,000 ATMs in Spain, 8,000 in Germany, 6,000 in France and 3,000 in the Netherlands. It will also have more than 1,000 outlets in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy and Portugal. There are, however, none in Luxembourg. Link, offered by a number of building societies and smaller banks, is something of a maverick network. Not all Link-offerers in the UK have cards which can be used internationally. Those which do include Abbey National Co-operative, Girobank, and the Britannia, Norwich &amp; Peterborough, Portman and Yorkshire building societies. Link cards from these companies and a few smaller building societies, as well as Diners' cards, allow you access to the Plus system of 70,794 ATMs. Plus is weak in Europe (it has only 3,000 machines, all in Spain), but better in Latin America (where the 809 machines include 585 in Mexico and 157 in Puerto Rico) and the Asia-Pacific region (where there are 10,622, including 511 in Australia, 291 in Hong Kong and 262 in Japan). The cards also come in useful in North America - there are 10,622 ATMs in Canada and 46,689 in the US. Visa has the world's largest ATM network: 110,000. These include 15,625 in Spain, 1,360 in Portugal, 7,160 in France, 1,030 in Italy and 39,885 in the US. But it has only 536 in Germany, a much weaker position than MasterCard.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Rice-transplanting has  begun in the countryside of Korea.    Co-operative farmers have brought up sturdy rice seedlings  despite the unfavorable weather in spring this year.    They do farming on a scientific and technical basis as  required by the chuche method. This year, too, they have  started rice-transplanting when the right time came.    Rice-transplanting, one of the most important farming  processes, begins in early May and is carried out in 20 odd days  by intensive efforts.</p>

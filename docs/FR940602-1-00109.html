			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Pre-HSWA Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Part 270_Hazardous Waste Permitting.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of today's proposal that would affect the permitting and permit modification procedures for combustion units (BIFs and incinerators) are proposed under pre-HSWA authority. These provisions include revised &sect;&sect;270.22(a) and 270.19(d) which clarify allowable circumstances for using the ``data in lieu of trial burns'' in connection with permitting combustion units; proposed &sect;270.74, and revisions to &sect;&sect;270.62 and 270.66 for permitted units, which would add new procedures for public involvement in the trial burn planning and trial burn phases for both permitted and interim status combustion facilities, make interim status procedures more equivalent to permitted, and require interim status facilities to comply with performance standards during the post-trial burn period. In addition, the proposed amendments to the permit modification provisions of &sect;270.42 (to distinguish further between the shakedown and trial burn phases when modifying permitted combustion units) are also based on pre-HSWA provisions. These provisions of the proposal, since they are based on pre-HSWA authority, will apply immediately only in those states that do not have RCRA authorization. In authorized states, these requirements will not apply until the states revise their programs to adopt requirements under state law that are at least as stringent and have these new requirements approved by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Part 124_Public Participation Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA desires to provide for, encourage and assist public participation. This proposed rule would establish procedures to promote better and more timely information sharing between the public, the state, EPA, and the facility applicant. The following is required under the part 124 regulations to comply with new public participation requirements: A pre-application meeting, a notice of application, and an information repository. However, these provisions, since they are based on pre-HSWA authority, will apply immediately only in those states that do not have RCRA authorization. In authorized states, these requirements will not apply until the states revise their programs to adopt requirements under state law that are at least as stringent and have these new requirements approved by EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Procedures Applicable to Pre-HSWA Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 271.21(e) requires that states that have final authorization must modify their programs to reflect federal program changes and must subsequently submit the modifications to EPA for approval. The deadlines for state modifications are set out in &sect;271.21(e)(2), and depend upon the date of promulgation of final rules by EPA, announcing the program changes. For example, if a final regulation based on this proposal is promulgated by EPA before June 30, 1995, the deadline by which the states must modify their programs to adopt this regulation would be July 1, 1996 (or July 1, 1997 if a state statutory change is needed). These deadlines can be extended in certain cases (see 40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)). Once EPA approves the modifications, the state requirements become RCRA subtitle C requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similar to those proposed today. These state regulations have not been assessed against final federal regulations to determine whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, similar provisions of state law are not considered to be authorized RCRA requirements until they are submitted to EPA and evaluated against final EPA regulations. Of course, states may continue to administer and enforce their existing standards as a matter of state law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States that submit their official applications for final authorization less than 12 months after the effective date of final standards are not required to include standards that are at least as stringent as these standards in their application. However, states that submit final applications for final authorization 12 months or more after the effective date of the final standards must include standards that are at least as stringent as these standards in their applications. 40 CFR 271.3 sets forth the requirements that states must meet when submitting final authorization applications. Because the proposed public participation requirements in &sect;270.74 represent a significant upgrade to the combustion unit permitting process, EPA strongly encourages States that have not yet adopted the BIF rule (56 FR 7134, February 21, 1991) to adopt these new public participation procedures concurrently with their BIF rules, rather than deferring their adoption to the much later deadline that would apply under the Cluster Rule to this new regulation. It should be noted that in situations where EPA retains permitting authority for BIFs (because the State has not yet received authorization for BIFs), EPA may implement both the permitting and public involvement procedures described in today's proposed rule. In this joint permitting situation, EPA would be the responsible Agency for the BIF permitting requirements in unauthorized States that are not authorized to issue BIF permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the overall effect of this proposed regulation would increase the stringency of the RCRA permitting processes. Therefore, all authorized states will be obligated to modify their programs to adopt these requirements when they are finalized by EPA, unless their existing state programs and laws are deemed by EPA to be equivalent in effect. For those states which are obligated to modify their programs to adopt these requirements when they are finalized by EPA, &sect;271.21(e) deadlines for state modifications will apply accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing today's proposed regulations, EPA was sensitive to impacts on existing State programs. The proposed requirements may be viewed as performance objectives the Agency wants States to meet. It is not EPA's intent to restrict States from using similar activities that accomplish the same objectives. Therefore, EPA will allow latitude and room for interpretation when reviewing state modifications for adopting these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

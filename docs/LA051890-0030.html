			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> USTINOV TRIES TO EXPLAIN 'THE MOZART MYSTIQUE'  </P> <P> Like Peter Ustinov? Then you'll probably like "The Mozart Mystique," airing  tonight (9:30 p.m. on Channel 28, 9 p.m. on Channels 15 and 24).  </P> <P> Ustinov carries the two-hour program with characteristic zest, acting out both  sides in Mozart's correspondence with his father, lecturing sternly or  marveling over the mystery of genius.  </P> <P> He says, "Mozart was a genius both ingenuous and sophisticated, both trivial  and profound, not by turns but at one and the same time." Something much the  same could be said of this show, written by Israela Margalit and directed by  Jochen Richter.  </P> <P> There are attempts to summarize and elucidate the titular mystique at the  beginning and end of the program, but generally Margalit and Ustinov settle for  a straightforward biography, recounted chronologically.  </P> <P> Performance clips are frequent, and run a wide stylistic gamut. A two-hour show  probably ought to have whole movements or arias, but the music is all  excerpted, and identified only by the complete work. The stellar crop of  conductors -- Georg Solti, Helmuth Rilling, Colin Davis, Jeffrey Tate -- and  the lesser-known but talented soloists are named only in the rush of credits at  the end.  </P> <P> Ustinov tells us little about the actual music, and what he does say is often  vague, tautological or misleading. The program does not illuminate Mozart's  music; rather, the music -- which follows the biographical chronology -- seems  chosen to illustrate Mozart's life. Along the way Ustinov does some useful  debunking. He rescues Salieri from the "Amadeus" mire of mediocrity and murder,  and reminds us that Mozart was not quite so poor in his last days as legend  would have it.  </P> <P> "The Mozart Mystique" may not go far toward explaining the phenomenon of  Mozart's genius, but Ustinov communicates the wonder of it admirably.

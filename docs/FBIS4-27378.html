			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 May  publish editorials, reports, and articles on President Clinton's  decision to renew China's MFN status.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word  editorial entitled "The Recovery of U.S.-PRC Relations." Noting  that the United States decided to seek "practical interests"  instead of "moral obligations" on the human rights issue by  renewing China's MFN status, the editorial says that the  solution of this problem, which might possibly have caused not  only "tension" in relations between the United States and China,  but also a "negative impact" in the Northeast Asian situation,  is very "fortunate." Explaining the background of granting MFN  trading status to China, the editorial stresses that if  U.S.-China relations were to be strained by the withdrawal of  MFN status, "dark clouds" would be cast on the overall situation  in East Asia. The editorial points to China's "important role"  in the region, including a role as "mediator" for a solution to  the North Korean nuclear issue. The editorial assesses that  President Clinton's recent decision is a "positive step" for  U.S.- China relations and for the overall situation in the  region. The editorial adds that U.S. human rights diplomacy  "has not retreated" because China itself is showing "gradual  improvement" on the issue and is being watched not only by the  United States but also by the entire world.    The editorial predicts, however, that with the United  States'  "invigorated advance" into Chinese markets, ROK exports to China  would accordingly suffer a blow. Nevertheless, the editorial  predicts that in the long term, "stability" in East Asia and the  promotion of ROK-PRC relations will even "broaden" Chinese  markets for ROK commodities. In conclusion, the editorial  expresses hope that since China has acquired a "concession" from  the United States, China will play a role in resolving the North  Korean nuclear problem as demanded by the international  community.    TONG-A ILBO also publishes on page 7 a 1,000-word article by  Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun under the headline,  "Human Rights Policy Pushed Aside by Seeking Practical  Interest." Describing the U.S. decision to renew China's MFN  status as "the last resort," the article points out that the  United States can no longer "ignore" the political and economic  "influence" exerted by China and that "economic retaliation"  against the United States by China if the MFN status had not  been renewed would have a serious impact on the U.S. economy.  The article notes, however, that with the recent decision to  renew MFN status, domestic criticism of the U.S.  administration's "appeasement foreign policy" will certainly  "expand."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a  1,300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi  Chong-yon, entitled "The Choice of Practical 'Economic Profits'  Rather than 'Human Rights.'" Explaining the background of  granting MFN status to China, the article points out that  various "interested organizations" in the United States,  including large U.S. business groups that advanced into China,  demanded that President Clinton put an end to "diplomatic  friction" with China over human rights because it is believed  that heightened U.S.-China "diplomatic tensions" will be "more  unfavorable" for the United States than for China. The article  views that the U.S. decision for renewal was prompted by the  Chinese Government's "hardline" position on opposing U.S. policy  to link China's human rights with the renewal of MFN status, and  by the "inevitability" of the U.S. "appeasement diplomatic  policy" toward China in its efforts to resolve the North Korean  nuclear issue, which is the greatest "diplomatic headache"  facing the Clinton Administration, by asking China to exercise  influence on North Korea for a solution to the nuclear issue.    Pointing to "strong criticism" raised by "progressive  pressure organizations" within the United States on the Clinton  Administration's "inconsistent human rights policy," the article  says that President Clinton may have to revise his human rights  policy toward Asia, and concludes that the recent MFN renewal  step for China has certainly caused "damage" to U.S. "diplomatic  prestige."    The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO on page 6 publishes articles  by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok and by  Beijing-based correspondent Yu Tong-hui on "impressions" in the  United States and China seen after the decision to renew China's  MFN status. Concerning the U.S. "impressions", the article  points out that this decision has caused an "enormous shock" in  both official and civilian quarters within the United States,  because this decision is not merely for the "extension" of the  status, but signifies an "epoch-making" step in U.S. Government  policy not to link human rights with trade any longer. The  article explains in detail a few points that made President  Clinton change the policy, including the U.S. "economy  first-policy" and the inevitability of regarding China as a  "regional partner" for maintaining stability in Asia. Pointing  to the "immediate criticism" of President Clinton's decision by  U.S. human rights organizations and some U.S. congressmen, the  article notes that contrary to this, U.S. business circles  "heaved a sigh of relief" and expressed satisfaction with the  possibility of increasing exports to the Chinese markets.    Concerning the Chinese side's "impressions", the article  notes that China "welcomed" the U.S. decision and accepted it as  a "wise decision." The article writes, however, that China  predicts that in an attempt to appease criticism within the  United States for President Clinton's "violation of his election  pledges," the President will demand "greater economic  concessions" from the Chinese side.    The moderate SEOUL MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN on page 6  publishes a 1,300-word article by Washington-based correspondent  Kim Kyong-su entitled "U.S. Choice of Practical Interest--the  Background of U.S. Renewal of MFN Status for China." Explaining  the background of the U.S. decision, the article views that  "trade relations" between the two countries was "a decisive  factor" for drawing this conclusion, and notes that U.S. exports  to China have tripled over the past 10 years and China has  become the seventh largest trade partner of the United States.  Another factor leading to this decision was the Clinton  Administration's view of China as "the only neighbor" who can  persuade North Korea for a solution to its nuclear problem.    The article, however, points to "a certain degree of  criticism" of President Clinton's decision within the United  States for the "result of completely ignoring the human rights  issue," and to "differences in views" even between diplomatic  teams and economic teams within the government in connection  with the linkage of human rights with the renewal of China's MFN  status. The article writes that the Clinton Administration's  decision clearly shows its "trade- first" policy as seen in  recent economic negotiations with Japan and Vietnam.    The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 4 a  1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi  Kyong-hyong entitled "U.S. Choice of Practical Interest Rather  than Moral Obligations for the Human Rights Issue." The article  notes that this decision was prompted, in part, by President  Clinton's assessment that the policy of linking human rights  with trade is "no longer effective," and by "pressure from  interested organizations" within the United States which are  striving to promote trade relations with China. Pointing to the  increase in U.S. exports to China and to new employment  generated by trade with China, the article writes that President  Clinton stressed that China shares "common interests" with the  United States for attaining "stability" in the Northeast Asia,  including the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The  Clinton Administration's withdrawal of the policy of linking  human rights with trade does not necessarily mean the  "abandonment" of its foreign policy on human rights, and its  decision to ban the import of Chinese-made weapons and  ammunition is a "symbolic pursuance of moral obligations" to  human rights diplomacy. The article predicts that the U.S.  human rights policy will turn from a "linkage strategy" to a  "broad-range interference strategy," including support for  Chinese organizations which are devoted to human rights and  democracy, and strengthening the activities of "Voice of Free  Asia" and "Voice of America." The article adds that the recent  step, on the other hand, will also negatively affect Americans'  trust in President Clinton's leadership and policy.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 5 a  1,400-word article by reporter O Yong, entitled "The U.S. Choice  of Practical Interest Suggests Great Change in U.S. Policy on  Asia." Noting that U.S.-China negotiations over MFN status have  ended with "China's victory," the article says the current step  by the Clinton Administration can be regarded as a "change in  policy" having "impact" on overall U.S. policy toward Asia.  Analyzing a few factors that led to this decision, including  "enormous market potentials" in China and "fierce criticism" at  home and abroad of the policy of linking human rights with  trade, the article notes that with the current decision, the  United States is assigned a task to "amend" its Asian policy,  and its "rough relations" with China in the past will "heave a  sigh of relief." This step will, the article says, also exert  "positive influence" on China's joining the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, with the human rights issue being excluded as  a separated issue.</p>

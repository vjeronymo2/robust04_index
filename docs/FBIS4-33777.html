			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 9 June (EFE) -- The OAS  decided on 9 June to draft a report on juridical regulations  that block hemispheric integration.    In a resolution approved on 9 June by the 24th OAS General  Assembly, the OAS asks its Permanent Council -- made up of  ambassadors from each OAS member country appointed to Washington  -- to draft a report on juridical regulations that block  integration and to submit a proposal on how to overcome them.    According to the OAS, the work's objective "is to make an  inventory of legislation that must be repealed to achieve an  effective continental integration."    The OAS, which defines integration as "an appropriate tool  for achieving new economic and social realities that will help  eradicate extreme poverty," believes it is necessary to  eliminate all obstacles blocking hemispheric economic  integration.    Moreover, the OAS recognizes that it is greatly interested  in  promoting a greater cooperation and strengthening of ties with  "regional and subregional integration mechanisms and  organizations."    The 24th OAS General Assembly, which has been going on since  6 June in the city of Belem do Para in the Amazon of northern  Brazil, approved a resolution stating that its mission is to  conduct several juridical studies to assist these organizations  in their integration efforts.    In the last few years, the countries of the Americas have  negotiated regional and subregional agreements. They have  established different economic blocs, such as NAFTA, the Common  Market of the South (Mercosur), the Andean Pact, the Group of  Three and the Amazon Integration Treaty.    According to Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranbiar  Quiroga, true hemispheric integration is tantamount to  "encompassing all countries of the Americas in NAFTA."    In its resolution, the OAS also recommends that its  Permanent  Council "duly coordinate issues pertinent to the development of  legislation promoting integration with the activities of other  OAS organizations and offices to promote economic integration."    Other organizations that work with the OAS in the  integration  process are the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI)  and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Protest call over off-peak trains LABOUR yesterday demanded a 'mighty uproar' from commuters over new fears that off-peak train services might be at risk after rail privatisation. Mr Brian Wilson, an opposition transport spokesman, said remarks made by a minister meant private operators would be free to abandon loss-making services outside peak hours. Mr Wilson will challenge the government to reverse what is seen as a breach of pledges already given. The row erupted after Mr Roger Freeman, the public transport minister, told the Commons standing committee on the railway privatisation bill: 'The number of trains run in the off-peak, their frequency and their attractiveness must depend in the last instance on the views of the operator.' He also said: 'The concept of peak and off-peak relates primarily to commuting services, including those in the Passenger Transport Executive areas - certainly in London - where little use is made of off-peak services, so it is not reasonable to stipulate hard and fast services.' Mr Wilson said yesterday: 'Communities which value evening and weekend rail services must make their voices heard sooner rather than later. There must be a mighty uproar from commuter areas to end this threat to off-peak rail services.'</p>

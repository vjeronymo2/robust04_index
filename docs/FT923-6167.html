			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Management: The pop star lifestyle of a busy banker - The diary of a Deutsche Bank boss In Germany there are few more prestigious jobs than being a main board director - a Vorstand - of one of the big banks. Most prestigious of all is to be a Vorstand of the Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank. There are thirteen of these individuals, who tower above the German business establishment, and sit on the supervisory boards of its largest industrial companies. In Germany they are treated like pop stars. When they appear in public together they are mobbed by photographers. When they go abroad, they go as unofficial ambassadors for Germany, living symbols of its post-war economic success. Getting to meet a Deutsche Bank Vorstand can be difficult. Rolf Breuer, 54-year-old head of securities and asset management at the bank and a Vorstand since 1985, says his diary is booked up until early 1994, meetings scheduled for every hour of every working day, from 8.30 am to 7 pm. How does he manage his workload? He sits on the board of around 60 companies. He is responsible for the bank's securities activities, and for its business in the Stuttgart region and in the Near and Middle East. He also finds time to promote Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre, to sit on a committee for comic opera, and he is treasurer of the International Bach Academy in Stuttgart. His personal staff consists of only five people - two secretaries, two personal assistants and a chauffeur. Pre-planning is what allows him to cope with the workload: 'You have to rely on your associates,' he says, 'you can't do all these things in too much detail. That isn't your job - what you should do is organise your work in advance so that you can be sure that things are under your control.' Breuer's commitments can be mapped out well in advance. Every Tuesday the Deutsche Bank holds a board meeting at which the bank decides on its strategy. The dates of the board meetings of the 60 or so companies with which Breuer is associated can also be inked into the diary months ahead of time. Likewise with overseas visits and official functions. It is the job of his two secretaries to help Breuer with the unexpected: shuffling his commitments. Weekdays can always be expanded by meeting over breakfast or dinner, although often several evenings a week are taken up with functions. He reserves one day of the weekend for office work, preparing himself for the Tuesday board meeting, but also coping with what could not be dealt with during the week. His commitment to work is total. During the four weeks holiday he takes every year he reads the Financial Times and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and remains in touch with the office. Although he has one free day a week when he plays golf with friends who have nothing to do with the bank, he says he never switches off. 'Unfortunately I am always contactable,' he says, 'much to the distress of my wife'. Given the magnitude of the job, there is little scope for private life. What there is of it is circumscribed by the need for tight security, a need brought home to Breuer and colleagues in December 1989 when Alfred Herrhausen, the bank's visionary chief executive, was assassinated by terrorists. Unlike some senior German businessmen, Breuer is not himself armed, but his bodyguards are. His house is watched by guards and protected by sophisticated electronic surveillance equipment. 'Of course the family suffers,' Breuer admits. 'I do not have enough time for my family. I can't help this - and fortunately they are nice enough not to mind.' Ironically, for a job which requires so much planning, Breuer counsels that it is impossible to plan to get on to the main board. 'If you start at the bottom of an organisation you can make a calculation about what sort of level you are likely to reach through being ambitious and capable,' he says. 'To make it further than that you need a lot of luck. If you happen to be the right age when a vacancy on the main board comes along, then you might get the job. By the time you are fifty, you are too old, no matter how good you are.'</p>

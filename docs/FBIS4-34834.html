			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mexico City, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Mexican President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari today appointed Jorge Madrazo Cuellar,  president of the National Human Rights Committee (CNDH), the new  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in the State of  Chiapas, which is in southeastern Mexico.    Madrazo Cuellar will replace Manuel Camacho Solis, who  resigned 16 June claiming that his work had been criticized by  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, presidential candidate of the  ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.    "The government's purpose has been clear: to transform the  armed conflict into a political dialogue, which will overcome  differences," Salinas said upon announcing the appointment of  Madrazo Cuellar, who will ask the Senate for a leave of absence  to quit the CNDH. [passage omitted]    Salinas said the measures adopted by the government,  including an amnesty law, a cease-fire, and the creation of the  post of peace commissioner in January, were to "try to resolve  within the framework of the law" the demands for dialogue in San  Cristobal, 780 km southeast of the Mexican capital.    "It is not through violence that one achieves democratic  progress, welfare, and justice. We are committed to having  Mexico grow in peace, with more justice and sovereignty," the  Mexican president stated. The government is determined to make  additional efforts to maintain the dialogue and promote a  political solution to the conflict, he said. He recognized that  the political parties are committed to the advancement of  democracy.    Camacho Solis was appointed by Salinas on 10 January to find  political solutions to the Indian insurrection that broke out on  1 January in Chiapas. Camacho Solis met with the rebels between  23 February and 3 March in San Cristobal de las Casas to offer  solutions to their demands. Despite the cease-fire that has  been in effect since 12 January, the conflict in Chiapas is at  an impasse after the Zapatist guerrillas turned down the  government's offer and ended their dialogue with the government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS news analyst Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 15 TASS -- The importance of U.S.  President Bill Clinton's official visit to Russia on January  13-15 was outlined in the most general form in remarks made by  his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin at a joint news conference  in the Kremlin: the two powers' relationhip have finally entered  the stage of mature strategic global partnership in very respect.    This originated during the Vancouver summit in April last  year. It was not fortuitous that the word "Vancouver" was  pronounced repeatedly in Moscow these days. And still, the  Moscow dialogue of the two presidents has its own value:  intentions and promises predominated last year, whereas this  time the two sides stated that they begin to work.    This is of importance in itself because not every intention  gets rapidly translated into life, which has been evidenced, in  the opinion of the Russian side, by its experience of contacts  with the Group of Seven (G7) as a whole. Out of all G-7  leaders, Boris Yeltsin believes, only Bill Clinton fulfilled all  his promises to Russia.    Mr Cliton also attained the goals of his current trip,  according to his own estimates: To reaffirm partnership  relations between the U.S. and Russia and express U.S. support  for economic and political reforms in Russia. Singled out among  subjects of discussion can be economic reforms in Russia, a  European security system in the post- cold-war era, disarmament,  and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.    Partnership is the leading idea of the Moscow declaration --  the central document signed by the two presidents. It is stated  in the declaration in particular that "the two presidents  announced that they would direct the detargeting of strategic  nuclear missiles under their respective commands so that by not  later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be targeted.  Thus, for the time in nearly half a century, virtually since  the dawn of the nuclear age, Russia and the United States will  not operate nuclear forces, day- to-day, in a manner that  presumes they are adversaries."    In a joint statement, the two presidents undertook jointly  to  seek ways to strengthen guarantees of security for states which  renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and strictly observe  their obligations.    The January 14 signing of a Russo-american-Ukrainian  agreement on the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine's  Territory became a real breakthrough in this respect. President  Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, who had arrived in Moscow by air  expressly for this purpose, described this as a historic moment.    Ukraine in actual fact agreed to become a non-nuclear  country. In exchange for that, Kiev received guarantees of  security and compensation for getting rid of nuclear arms in the  form of fuel- grade uranium which Russia together with the U.s.  will produce by processing weapon-grade uranium, and the removal  of obstacles to the development of Ukraine's economic relations  with foreign countries.    Support for Russian reforms was, perhaps, the principal aim  of Bill Clinton's mission. Only provided there is a stable and  democratic Russia with a free economy, it is possible to build a  new world order in the post-cold-war era on the basis of those  values which are close to America and other civilised nations.    Previously, Washington declared its support for the  liberalisation of the Russian economy in general -- the quicker  the better. This time Bill Clinton placed social problems  related to the transition to a free market economy almost in the  centre of attention.    Although Clinton, during the Ostankino teleshow, jokingly  remarked that he was not going to give up Alaska, in response to  pronouncements by another well-known hero of live broadcasts,  everything seems to indicate that the leader of the country with  the classical liberal economy has come to realise the essence of  the problem: disregard for social welfare development may cost  one dear.    Mutual understanding was also reached to the effect that  Russia does not count on U.S. direct assistance in this respect  but suggests opening the U.S. market to Russian commodities and  technologies and lifting trade restrictions, proceeding from the  assumption that Russia itself, according to Boris Yeltsin, will  seek ways to resolve social problems upon effecting an economic  restructuring.    Among the 12 documents adopted during the summit, there are  those which mark the beginning of the removal of cold-war  obstructions in the trade-and-economic sphere.    With the consent of other countries concerned, the U.S.  announced the Export Control Committee (COCOM) -- the body which  hindered the export of high technologies to Russia -- would be  dissolved not later than March 31. Discriminatory restrictions  on the export of Russian uranium have been lifted.    The understanding of the role of Russia as a great power,  the  position of which has a decisive influence on the development of  events in the world, on peace and security, also manifested  itself in the fact that the U.S. president brought with him to  Moscow the "Partnership for Peace" concept which had been  endorsed by NATO leaders during the Brussels summit. The day  before in Prague, those former Warsaw Pact countries which seek  to join NATO as soon as possible had also agreed with the  concept.    Boris Yeltsin supported the concept which makes it possible  to avoid the division of Europe again into two camps but this  time along the border of the former Soviet Union. America's  reaffirmation of the role of Russia as a great power also  manifested itself in the fact that the influential group of  seven economically most developed countries may soon become G-8.  Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton will meet next time precisely at  a G-7 summit in Naples in July.    The problem of Russia's relations with the Baltic states was  discussed as well. Although a joint Russian-U.S. statement on  human rights contains rather general formulas, Bill Clinton  publicly warned "other countries" that they should respect the  rights of ethnic Russians and with this end in view promised to  have talks with the leaders of Latvia and Estonia. In response,  Washington expects that those states and Russia Conclude  agreements as soon as possible on the withdrawal of Russian  troops from there.    Of course, a lot of differences were revealed during the  Russian- U.S. summit talks, in views on a settlement of the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. But the two  presidents pointed out that there was a basis and goodwill to  look for joint solutions. Herein is the chief result of the  Moscow summit.</p>

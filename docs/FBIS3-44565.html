			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese legal experts  pointed out here today that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's  recent allegations against the mainland of China are completely  groundless and slanderous.    On December 27, 1993, the spokesman for the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office of the State Council (HKMAOSC) stated that  the British-Hong Kong three-tier political structures, namely  the Legislative Council, district boards and two municipal  councils of Hong Kong, should be disbanded upon the termination  of British rule over Hong Kong on June 30, 1997.    At a press conference held two days later, Hong Kong  Governor  Chris Patten accused the HKMAOSC of having pre-empted the right  of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee to  interpret the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region, saying that HKMAOSC's statement violated the Basic Law  itself, for instance, the article 160.    Experts who took part in drafting the Basic Law pointed out  that it is certainly the NPC Standing Committee's right to  interpret the Basic Law, and this is defined in the Basic Law.    However, they argued, the spokesman of the HKMAOSC was only  reiterating the contents defined clearly in the Sino-British  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and was not executing the  right to interpret the Basic Law.    The experts pointed out that both the forward of the Basic  Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulated clearly  that the government of the People's Republic of China will  resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1,  1997 and Britain will terminate its rule over Hong Kong. With  the termination of British rule, the British political  structures in Hong Kong will also be terminated and disbanded.  Why should it be necessary to interpret this again? they asked.    Xiao Weiyun, professor of the department of law of Beijing  University, stressed that it is the internal affair of China and  within state sovereignty to decide which institutions and  organizations should be retained and which ones should be  abolished according to the concrete situation and the principle  of the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Chris  Patten has no right to make indiscreet remarks on this.    Professor Xiao, who took part in the whole process of  drafting the Basic Law, recalled that the Chinese government has  tried to follow the principle of keeping the social and economic  systems and the people's living style in Hong Kong unchanged and  making as little change as possible in the legal and political  systems of Hong Kong. This is aimed at maintaining the  stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and ensuring a smooth  transition of the city. These are precisely the wishes of the  compatriots in Hong Kong.    With this purpose, Professor Xiao said, the Chinese  government has done its utmost to work sincerely during the  Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/95  elections. However, Chris Patten unilaterally decided to  gazette the electoral bill and submit it to the Legislative  Council before any agreement was reached between the British and  Chinese sides in their talks, thus completely destroying the  basis of further Sino-British cooperation on the issue.    Under such urgent and complicated circumstances, Professor  Xiao pointed out, the HKMAOSC spokesman made the above mentioned  statement. The statement showed the firm attitude of the  Chinese government toward the Hong Kong issue and reiterated and  safeguarded the spirit of the Basic Law rather than violation of  the law.    Article 160 of the Basic Law reads: "Upon the establishment  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative region, the laws  previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adopted as laws of the  region except for those which the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress declares to be in contravention of  this law. If any laws are later discovered to be in  contravention of this law, they shall be amended or cease to  have force in accordance with the procedure as prescribed by  this law. Documents, certificates, contracts, and rights and  obligations valid under the laws previously in force in Hong  Kong shall continue to be valid and be recognized and protected  by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, provided that  they do not contravene this law."    Some experts pointed out that article 160 talks about the  issue of law while the HKMAOSC spokesman was talking about the  issue of state sovereignty and the termination of British rule  over Hong Kong. The British-Hong Kong authorities have no right  to extend their political structures into the period after 1997.    The experts noted that what Chris Patten said was beside the  point, which showed that Mr. Patten is ignorant about the basic  law.    The experts pointed out that it is the British-Hong Kong  authorities that have made improper interpretation of the Basic  Law. For example, they have demanded that the formation of the  preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Committee should be the result of Sino-British consultation and  that China should promise to adopt universal suffrage in  election of the Hong Kong Legislative Council in 2007.  Actually, these will all be the internal affairs of China and  are no business of Chris Patten. Many people have advised the  last governor of Hong Kong to read the Basic Law more carefully  so as to make fewer funny mistakes.</p>

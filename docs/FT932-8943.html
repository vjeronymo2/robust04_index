			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A kiss for Europe I CALLED in at Conservative Central Office in London this week, which is not my typical habitat. The royal box at Ascot, certainly. An anti-whaling conference, naturally. Or any meeting whose declared purpose is to raise the status and self-confidence of womankind. But Tory Central Office? In fact, they were happy to see me. With morale as it is at present, they are happy to see anyone. So in I cheerily strode, and made towards the bookstore. There was a man behind the desk. 'I was wondering,' I said pleasantly, 'whether you had anything in stock that was extremely pro-Europe - in fact, pro-federal - because that is where I'm at, aggressively pro-federal. I believe in a federal Europe. As I remarked some time ago, I want peace and prosperity for all the people of Europe. I want one army, one navy, one air force, one queen, one president, one chief executive, one flag (very small), one currency, one language, one set of tax laws, one summer sport and one winter sport, one way of cooking estouffade a la provencale, one way of spelling Cologne, one BBC, one archbishop of Brugge, one motoring rulebook, one price of petrol, one railway gauge, one opera house (which is probably one too many), and one school curriculum. 'I see a federalised Europe as the precursor of world government, which would solve most of our troubles at once. So what have you got on your shelves that will pull it all together for me? I need some ammunition. Ammunition is what I lack.' The man studied me. 'As a matter of fact,' he said, 'material of that nature, extremely pro-Europe, let alone pro-federal, is remarkably thin on the ground. But I'm expecting some stuff next week. Perhaps you will call again, Sir?' I said that I probably might. Yet I could not leave it there. I have been so nauseated by Britain's disgracefully slow progress in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on closer Euro-integration - let alone by the government's refusal to countenance a national referendum on the issue - that I am striking out on my own. I am changing my mannerisms. With luck, I hope to take on the appearance of a true European, just waiting to go federal. I am far too Englishly, even though I have lived abroad for a quarter of my adult years. I wear drippy, unstylish clothes. I am inhibited and diffident. I am not particularly tactile. When I kiss, I suck and go 'mwah]' (it is called vacuum-kissing, and is done to conceal embarrassment). And I am always absurdly punctual. I am a bit of a prat, actually, although I do not believe I am odious, what a hurtful thing to say. To help me with my mission, I am dipping in and out of an upcoming book, Foreign Bodies: A Guide to European Mannerisms, by Dr Peter Collett, a research psychologist at Oxford University. According to Dr Collett, the study of European mannerisms presents a special challenge, partly because they are so diverse and partly because Europe is in the throes of upheaval. 'On the one hand,' he says, 'there are centripetal forces bringing nations together in an attempt to exorcise the past, and create a unitary structure with a common identity, while on the other hand centrifugal forces are at work, with local identities being asserted, people being flung in every direction, and states being torn apart.' He says that mannerisms are important because they form the basis of social exchanges between people, and because they can very easily give rise to misunder-standings. We are often tempted, says Dr Collett, to assume that mannerisms are somehow less important than values or attitudes, or what people say to one another. 'This simply is not the case. The way that people behave is crucial, not only to the sort of impression that they make on each other, but to how they feel about themselves.' In remodelling my mannerisms, I shall start with kissing. I want to kiss like the French, the champions of Europe. All I ever do is go 'mwah]' and then 'mwah]' I want to be as unpunctual as the Spanish, as comfortable with intimacy as Italians, as rollicking as the Dutch, as sexy as the Scandinavians, as perfidious as the Greeks and as humorous as the Germans. (I say they are humorous). I am in for a sea-change. Foreign Bodies will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on May 27 at Pounds 14.99.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: Londoners facing dangers of increasing disenfranchisement Sir, It is indeed the case that, increasingly, many of us in London local government are looking to the rest of Europe for inspiration as we ponder the bleak future for the town halls on offer from the government ('Too many bodies spoil the broth', March 29). Taking the Channel tunnel rail link terminus as just one example, Camden Council, the planning authority for the area, suggested at the outset that the viability of St Pancras should be studied along with other options. A joint planning process might well have brought us to what seems now to be the current conclusion without several years' delay and costs incurred. But the government continues to combine extreme centralist tendencies - London policy co-ordinated by a secret cabinet subcommittee - with an ironic embrace of corporatism in London First and London Forum, and quango-isation. Quangos with minimal elected membership now control Pounds 7.5bn-worth of public money in London and nationally administer more public resources that the local government sector. The government opposes council representation on London Forum despite the fact that it will take under its wing the London Tourist Board, which receives Pounds 300,000 annually from local authorities through the London Boroughs Grants Committee. Police authority proposals further weaken council representation, and the important Maastricht measure specifying seats for councillors on the committee of the regions was dismissed by ministers as a 'technical' issue only. Where should Europe point us? Towards public-private partnership at local level, towards decentralisation and 'subsidiarity', but above all towards a recognition of the role of local government as more than a collection of agencies for Whitehall administering nationally funded services. In Britain we are too afraid of pluralist decision-making, of the complexities created by recognising the rights of representation, democratic accountability and open government. But the dangers of disenfranchisement are greater, and all Londoners will be the worse for it. Julie Fitzgerald, leader, London borough of Camden, Euston Road, London NW1 2RU</p>

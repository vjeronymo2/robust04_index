			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / London office market revives THE OFFICE property market in central London improved considerably in the past three months, international surveyors Richard Ellis said yesterday. The revival of interest was due mainly to a surge in investment activity, it said. But increased occupancy rates were also beginning to underpin confidence. Mr John Slade of Richard Ellis said the lack of new development could result in an undersupply in the mid-1990s. The survey also found that: Availability of office space is falling sharply, with total space on the market down from 25.3m sq ft 12 months ago to 21.8m sq ft. The vacancy rate in central London has declined from 14 per cent three months ago to 12 per cent. Rents are stabilising. Top 'rental value norms' in the West End, the City and Holborn have remained stable since the end of June. Investment activity has increased this year.</p>

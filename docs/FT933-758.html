			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Joint appeal for global trade deal IN AN attempt to put pressure on trade negotiators, the heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Gatt yesterday urged immediate action to conclude the Uruguay Round. Appearing together, Mr Michel Camdessus, Mr Lewis Preston and Mr Peter Sutherland warned that failure to conclude the Round would unleash a cycle of greater protectionism and loss of confidence which would destroy jobs and put at risk the new democracies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. However, while full of dire warnings, the unprecedented joint statement from the three did not single out any country or group as causing the current impasse in the trade talks. But Mr Sutherland said later that the main responsibility for bringing the talks to a conclusion lay with the European Community and the US.

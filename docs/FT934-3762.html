			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Further polls for German state Dozens of towns and villages in the eastern German state of Brandenburg will vote in a second round of local government elections on December 19, after many candidates failed to secure a majority, or because of irregularities. However, officials from the Social Democratic party, which governs Brandenburg, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, yesterday said provisional results were expected to remain unchanged. The party that gained the most from a 61 per cent turnout - which clearly reflected disillusionment with the established political parties and particularly Mr Kohl's governing coalition, led by the CDU - was the reformed Communists. The Party of Democratic Socialism gained 21 per cent of the votes, 10 percentage points more than in the December 1990 federal elections in Brandenburg. The SDP increased its share by 2 points to 34 per cent, and the CDU saw its share of the vote fall nearly 14 points to 20 per cent. The PDS is even in a strong enough position to clinch Potsdam, the state capital, in the run-off. Mr Rolf Kutznutz, a one-time self-declared informer for the Stasi, or former east German secret police, obtained 43.5 per cent, leading Mr Horst Gramlich, the SPD incumbent, with 30 per cent. Interestingly, support for Green/Bundnis 90 - a loose collection of democratic opposition parties - was nowhere near the party's sharply increased backing in the western states. It received 6 per cent, an indication that environmental issues are far less important in the east. Also curious is that the greatest support - so far - is for an independent candidate. Mr Wolfgang Pohl was elected mayor on first count for Frankfurt/Oder, one of the four most important cities in Brandenburg, after receiving 61 per cent of the counted votes. Final results were expected late last night. Officials admitted the counting was 'a bit slow', but added that three sets of elections had to be counted: elections to the councils, elections for mayors, and elections for Oberburgermeister, the equivalent of England's Lord Mayors.

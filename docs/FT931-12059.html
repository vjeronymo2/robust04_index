			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic data fail to give spur to Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices moved in a narrow range yesterday as investors struggled to find interest in stocks in spite of some further good economic data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.78 at 3,31 .03. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.15 firmer at 438.81, while the Amex composite finished 0.59 higher at 411.08, and the Nasdaq composite closed up 1.67 at 696.34. Trading volume on the NYSE was 248m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1000 to 805. The day's economic news should have been positive for the market. New factory orders for durable goods, a notoriously volatile and unreliable indicator, surged 9.1 per cent in December, the largest monthly gain in more than a year. Other data showed that personal income rose by 1.0 per cent and personal spending climbed 0.5 per cent last month, both solid increases. Although the figures were all stronger than analysts had expected, they were not enough to encourage much buying of stocks. Investors, it seemed, had decided to take their cue from the bond market, which fell during the morning on the data. Although bond prices later recovered, investor enthusiasm for stocks remained muted. Among individual stocks, Xerox jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 85 3/4 in spite of news of a Dollars 736m net loss in the final quarter of last year, compared with a profit of Dollars 91m a year earlier. The shares held up well because earnings were affected by special one off charges, and because the company issued positive statements about the outlook for this year. Pfizer eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 65 in busy trading after broking house PaineWebber downgraded its investment rating on the stock due to uncertainties surrounding a class-action lawsuit that might be filed against the company alleging that a unit of Pfizer manufactured defective artificial hips. Airline stocks rebounded from news earlier in the week of bad fourth quarter earnings. Delta rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 63 1/8 , and UAL climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 123 1/2 . Cellular telephone companies remained under heavy pressure over speculation that use of the telephones causes health problems. Motorola slumped Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 51, and on the Nasdaq market, McCaw Cellular dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 32 1/2 and LIN Broadcasting fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 78 1/4 . Canada TORONTO SHARE prices ended the week little changed in active trading. According to preliminary data, the 300 composite lost 2.45 points, or 0.0 per cent, closing at 3,305.47. Advancing issues led declines 352 to 265, volume fell to 40.73m shares from 46.16m shares yesterday, and trading value was CDollars 363.9m compared with CDollars 458.4m. Northern Telecom fell 2 1/4 to 54 7/8 . The company said its president and chief operating officer, Jean Monty, will replace</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Milk prices will be set by auction MR ANDREW DARE, chief executive of Milk Marque, yesterday said that an annual auction of milk supplies will be used to set prices when the Pounds 3.3bn market is liberalised next April. The first auction will take place next month. Mr Dare's proposals for a 'rolling' auction are the first indication of how dairy pricing will work in the free market. He has been widely criticised in the dairy industry for promising higher prices to farmers following the abolition of the Milk Marketing Board, the government's compulsory purchasing scheme. Milk Marque, a voluntary co-operative and the board's successor, says auctions will allow the free market to determine prices. But because the UK produces only 85 per cent of its needs, pressure on supplies is likely to push up prices. Mr Dare estimates that consumers could pay up to 8 per cent more if dairy companies pass these price rises on. Milk prices are currently set by a committee of board and dairy industry representatives. Mr Dare said the auction was 'an open and fair system and yet one in which customers have to compete with each other for the milk supplies they want, thereby helping farmers to receive full market value'. Dairy companies wanting to buy supplies from Milk Marque will be asked to indicate quantities wanted and prices offered. Once the bids are received, a market price will be allocated. Prices may be squeezed upwards if there is strong demand, or customers may scale back demand. Milk left over from the allocations will be sold at lower prices or on the spot market.</p>

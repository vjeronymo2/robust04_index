			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Marks of distinction - International glossary ISO, the International Organisation for Standardisation. Set up in 1947, the ISO is a federation of 96 member countries which appoint committees to establish international standards. More than 8,600 international standards have been created. Responsibility for heading each standards committee is allocated to a country with experience in that area, with the result that seven members carry out 90 per cent of the work. Germany leads with 24 per cent of standards work, Britain with 23 per cent and France with 22 per cent. If the ISO creates a standard this takes precedence over national or European standards. The only area where the ISO is not active is in the electrical industry. Electrical standards are the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical Commission, set up in 1907. International standards carry the ISO prefix. CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation. CEN groups the national standards bodies of the 12 European Community member countries and the six members of the European Free Trade Association. A further eight countries, mainly from eastern Europe have affiliate status. CEN was established in 1961 but had little to do for its first 24 years because standards setting was dominated by the national organisations or ISO/IEC. But in 1985 the European Community instituted a new approach to standard setting because it needed standards to back up the directives it was starting to produce for its single market initiative. CEN attempts to avoid duplicating the work of other organisations, so where possible its standards are based on national or international ones. They carry the EN (Euro-norms) prefix. CEN has just published a book describing its work and the system of European standards. CEN Standards for Access to the European Market costs Ecu38 (Pounds 31) plus postage from CEN, Rue de Stassart 36, B-1050 Brussels. Tel: +322 519 6811. In common with ISO, CEN has no responsibility for the electrical industry. This is handled by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation, while telecommunications standards are dealt with by ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. The European Organisation for Testing and Certification (EOTC) was set up last January following a two-year pilot. Its aim is to establish the mutual recognition by certification and testing organisations in Europe of each others' work so that companies do not need to obtain certification in each country. The CE Mark. Is probably best known to the general public because it appears on the packaging for toys but is applicable to a wide range of products including construction products and gas appliances. Partly because of its use on toys it has come to be seen as a general consumer guarantee of quality or safety. In fact it is intended to show that a product meets the minimum specification required by the underlying EC directive. In some cases this is underpinned by independent certification, in others it hinges only on a manufacturer's declaration. The BSI Kitemark is perhaps the most widely known UK seal of approval and is awarded, or licensed, by BSI to companies which produce goods to accepted national or international standards. Compared with the nearly 12,000 British Standards in existence there are fewer than 1,800 Kitemarks and lesser known Safety Marks. This is because Kitemarks apply to products and not services or procedures, while some of the older product standards would need to be revised to make them suitable for kitemarking. The launch of the CE mark is a possible threat to the Kitemark and has prompted BSI to consider how to promote its 'label'.</p>

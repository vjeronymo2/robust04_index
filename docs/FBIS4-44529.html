			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Zichen (1728 1311 5256): "The Ministry of </F> Agriculture Points Out That the Task of Prime Importance To  Achieve Higher Grain and Cotton Yields Is To Ensure Planting  Areas"]    [Text] What is China's current grain- and cotton-production  situation? A recent Ministry of Agriculture [MOA] summary  shows that a higher grain yield will be hard to achieve, with  recovery of our cotton output being very difficult. MOA notes  that to achieve our 1994 targets of stabilizing our grain output  and increasing our cotton output, the task of prime importance  will be to take steps to ensure their planting areas. The major  immediate problems are:    -- The planned area sown to grain is likely to be below the  warning line. The planned-area figures reported by the farm  sector from all areas show that the area sown to grain in 1994  will be 1.64 billion mu, down 11 million mu from the  actually-sown area in 1993, and below the 1.65-billion-mu  emergency-warning line. This includes a drop of about 10  million mu for the 15 northern provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions; by variety, the sown area will be down  around 7 million mu for wheat, and 13 million mu for early rice  in the south. While a recovery-type expansion of 2 million mu is  expected, it will be hard to achieve a larger pickup.    -- While the area planted to cotton is up, a large gap with  plans remains. Since the cotton-purchasing price was raised,  the initiative to cultivate cotton in cotton-growing areas has  picked up somewhat. But while the cotton area is up 6 million mu  from 1993 to 81 million mu, there is still a clear gap between  this area and 1994 plans, making the conflict between production  and marketing hard to ease.    Faced with such a grim grain- and cotton-production  situation, MOA holds that the current priority is to emphasize  the planting of "two large areas."    1. While consolidating our northern grain area, the 1994  grain area and output stability throughout China will be largely  dependent on a large part of the burden being borne by southern  paddy rice. We need to guide and encourage qualified areas to  expand their "two-hybrid" grain areas, actively disseminating a  new combination of high-yield, quality, hybrid rice, in an  attempt to sharply recover the planting area in 1994 for paddy  rice, particularly early rice.    2. We need to fight a "tough battle" to recover our cotton  area in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The  cotton output of these three provinces makes up about one-half  of China's. As our national cotton area in 1993 was down 30  million mu from 1992, with 75 percent of the drop being in these  three provinces, the implementation of the cotton-planting area  in these three provinces in 1994 will be of key importance to  our national output. We need to plant well and fully existing  bare and leftover spring areas, with qualified areas  appropriately increasing their summmer cotton, by actively  cultivating cotton on wasteland. All areas need to better  oversee and manage agricultural capital goods markets, strictly  curbing arbitrary price rises, and firmly cracking down on the  production and sale of fake and shoddy agricultural capital  goods, to safeguard peasant interests and stimulate peasant  initiative to plant cotton.    In an attempt to reach state targets for 1994 cotton-area  recovery to 90 million mu and gross output of 97 million dan,  certain cotton-producing provinces have taken a series of stiff  steps. In addition to emphasis by the leadership, their  increased fund input and prompt provision of the goods and  materials needed for spring planting have played a key role in  expanding the area sown to cotton. A recent itemized report by  the responsible state sector shows that the following provinces  have won initial successes.    Jiangxi Province has completed its 1994 planned task of  planting 2.6 million mu, up nearly 700,000 mu from 1993 (and  similarly hereinafter); Hubei Province has expanded by 200,000  mu, for an overall area of 7.5 million mu, mainly in  two-membrane early cotton; the two provinces of Hebei and  Shandong have initially increased their areas by more than 10  percent, with Hebei's plans for a cotton acreage of 8.45 million  mu implemented down to prefectures and counties. Liaoning  Province has increased its area by 390,000 mu, and Henan's  planned acreage is up 600,000 mu.    The pickup in cottonfield acreage in the above provinces was  due to the following two practical measures.    1. These provinces increased their fund input in cotton  production. For instance, Hebei provided financial allocations  of 51 million yuan in support of cotton planting. Meanwhile, the  Agricultural Bank and the credit-cooperative system raised 280  million yuan in special loans focused on cotton-planting  preparations. The provincial government also decided to set  aside 2 million yuan as a cotton-incentive fund; Shandong  continued to spend 4 million yuan for high-yield cotton  development; the Jiangxi provincial government decided to take  12 million yuan from cotton-incentive funds assigned outside of  the province in 1993 to use for cottonfield water conservancy;  Shandong's Dezhou region supported 30 priority cotton townships  with 100,000 yuan each in revolving funds.    2. They actively organized goods supplies, promptly  providing the materials needed for spring cotton planting and  the whole year's production. In Jiangxi Province, where more  than 5 million kg of cotton seeds were needed, they took steps,  such as importing improved varieties, providing adequate seeds,  as well as the fertilizer and loans to households needed for  cotton planting; certain counties and cities in Hubei have  supplied peasants with related items, such as fine seeds, dual  film, herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizer; Hebei has  supplied 45,000 tons of farm-use diesel oil at parity price in  the first quarter, with priority going to cotton planting.</p>

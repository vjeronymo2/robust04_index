			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / An optimistic wake-up call from the cosy pink sofa: Raymond Snoddy previews what morning viewers can expect from GMTV ON SCREEN, commercial breakfast television is a world dominated by cosy domestic interiors, the colour pink and optimistic wake-up presenters. The set of Good Morning Television, which replaces TV-am at 6am on January 1, will have a similar pink cosiness and, in spite of dire financial predictions, optimism is starting to spread backstage. Earlier this year Mr Bruce Gyngell, chief executive of TV-am, forecast that GMTV, which bid Pounds 34.6m a year for the franchise and must also pay 15 per cent of advertising revenue to the Treasury, would be 'bust' within 18 months. In more measured terms, stockbrokers James Capel warned that the company would not reach operational break-even until 1995 and would have to wait until 1997 for its first pre-tax profit, put at Pounds 1.5m. But Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director of GMTV, expects at least to break even by the end of the company's first year on air. He says it has already booked more than enough advertising revenue to cover the bid and probably the 15 per cent to the government as well. Mr Stoddart says that the company, based in London Weekend Television's South Bank headquarters by the Thames, has just passed its first Pounds 50m in advertising revenue. City analysts' forecasts for first-year revenue range between Pounds 65m and Pounds 80m. In spite of the recession GMTV expects to reach the upper end of the forecasts, and perhaps even exceed them. 'We are ahead of schedule in selling terms, compared with where TV-am would have expected to be at this time of year. TV-am expects Pounds 78.5m by the end of the year,' said Mr Stoddart, who learned about cost-effective television by running CIS, the satellite company that provides horse-racing coverage to bookmakers. Start-up costs for GMTV - jointly owned by LWT, Scottish Television, Carlton Communications, Walt Disney and The Guardian - are Pounds 8m, 15 per cent below the business plan figure. The station will have fewer than half the 400 staff TV-am had in the run-up to the competitive tenders for new licences. The total includes a 70-strong news team on contract from Reuters Television, formerly Visnews. TV-am spent Pounds 14m a year on news alone. GMTV has integrated news and programming departments, with a total programming cost of Pounds 30m a year. The programme will be unashamedly populist, including a feature called Healthy Hunks, introduced by former Page Three model Linda Lusardi, advice on what to do about such problems as 'wobbly bottoms' and a trivia quiz featuring Jeremy Beadle. After the morning rush, the last 35 minutes of the programme from 8.50am will, the station says, feature fashion, real-life love stories and health and sex advice. The company says top national and international news stories will be covered, but domestic news with human interest is likely to be emphasised. 'We will definitely be more Washington County Durham than Washington DC,' says Ms Lis Howell, director of programmes. News is promised on everything from education and politics to the royal family 'when topical'. The regional ITV companies will supply local news and weather. GMTV promises its audience a 'bright start and a warm welcome to the day' with a 'relaxed, informative and entertaining' programme. 'We will be bringing you (the viewer) up to date with what's happening in the world and preparing you for the day ahead,' the company promises. To begin with, audience ambitions are modest - to hold on to the TV-am peak audience of about 2.5m, then build slowly. Ms Howell, former managing editor of the 24-hour satellite channel Sky News, says of GMTV: 'Populist to me means that it is something that will appeal to everyone. It is not Newsnight, it is not The Money Programme, but it will have something that appeals to people of all intellectual levels.'</p>

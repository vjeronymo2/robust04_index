			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Nacods loses safety challenge Nacods, the pit deputies union, yesterday failed in a High Court attempt to block the introduction of new mining safety regulations. Lord Justice Simon Brown, sitting with Mr Justice Morland, ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the challenge. Nacods had accused the government of bringing in measures which threaten the standards of safety in the coal mining industry. Counsel for the union said expert views on safety the government had relied on were 'shot through with errors of law and fact'.</p>

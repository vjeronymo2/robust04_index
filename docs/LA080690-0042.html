			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UNSER JR. WINS FASTEST 500-MILE RACE EVER  </P> <P> Al Unser Jr. out-raced and had more luck than teammate Bobby Rahal on Sunday to  win the fastest 500-mile race in history, the Marlboro 500 at Michigan  International Speedway.  </P> <P> Unser and several competitors drove laps in the 224-m.p.h. range, and he won  $172,684 for averaging 189.727 m.p.h. despite eight caution periods. That was  faster than the previous 500-mile mark of 186.288 set by stock-car star Bill  Elliott at Talladega in May 1985.  </P> <P> It easily outdid the Indy-car mark of 185.981 by Arie Luyendyk in May in the  Indianapolis 500.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's fast enough," Unser, 27, said. "I think we can go  quicker."  </P> <P> It was Unser's first 500-mile victory, second victory in a row, fourth this  season and 13th of his career. He dedicated the race to his father, a four-time  Indy 500 winner who is recovering from injuries sustained here Thursday in a  crash during practice.  </P> <P> "I was lying in bed last night, hoping we could do this," Unser Jr. said. "This  was for you, dad. I wish you were here."  </P> <P> Rahal, who lost his chance at victory when Unser made his final fuel stop  during the final caution period, finished second for the fifth time this  season.  </P> <P> Engine problems eliminated several top challengers, including Luyendyk,  pole-winner Emerson Fittipaldi, who dominated the first half of the race,  Michael Andretti and Rick Mears.  </P> <P> Unser took the lead on a restart on lap 212 following the seventh caution  period. Rahal regained the top spot on lap 216, lost it to Unser on 218, got it  back on 219 and lost it to Unser for the final time on lap 235, just 16 laps  from the end, when Rahal pitted for fuel.  </P> <P> The crowd, estimated at 55,000, was on its feet and screaming when Rahal drove  onto pit road and took just 12.1 seconds to head back toward the track, a bit  more than 31 seconds behind his teammate.  </P> <P> Just as Unser was ready for his fuel stop, rookie Jon Beekhuis blew his engine,  bringing out the final caution period on lap 240.  </P> <P> Unser managed to overtake Rahal before the two reached the flag stand, putting  a lap on Rahal and making it virtually impossible for him to win the race. He  won by 25.459 seconds.  </P> <P> Mario Andretti, Michael's father and teammate, finished third, a lap behind.  </P> <P> Dale Earnhardt led every lap in a victory at Michigan International Speedway  that brought him the championship of the International Race of Champions  series.  </P> <P> Earnhardt, from NASCAR, fought off challenges from fellow Winston Cup drivers  Mark Martin and Terry Labonte, as well as two-time IROC champion and CART  Indy-car star Al Unser Jr.  </P> <P> Martin Brundle of England, a road-racing specialist who came into the third and  final IROC event of the season leading both Earnhardt and Unser by two points  in the standings, fell from the lead at the start and lost a lap when he spun  off the two-mile, high-banked oval on the 31st of 50 laps.  </P> <P> Earnhardt, who also won the IROC opener in May on the high banks at Talladega  and finished fifth in the road race last month at Cleveland, wound up the  series with 60 points and the winner's share of $175,000. He averaged 153.316  m.p.h.  </P> <P> Gary Ormsby spoiled Chris Karamesines' chances of becoming the oldest Top Fuel  driver in history to win a NHRA Winston Series event by winning the Northwest  Nationals at Seattle International Raceway in Kent, Wash.  </P> <P> Karamesines, 61, was appearing in his second final of the year. He lost to  Ormsby at the Grandnational in Montreal in June. This time, Ormsby's Castrol  GTX dragster covered the quarter-mile in 5.098 seconds at 282.39 m.p.h.  Karamesines's chances ended when his dragster's engine exploded.  </P> <P> Bob Glidden earned his first Pro Stock title in six months, his 78th overall  and second of the season. He drove his Motorcraft Ford Probe past Mark Pawuk's  Oldsmobile in the finals, 7.388 at 187.14 m.p.h. to 7.435 at 185.18.  </P> <P> Mark Oswald, driving a Ford Probe, got his second 1990 Funny Car victory,  running 5.401 seconds at 275.98 m.p.h., while Ed McCulloch's Oldsmobile  trailed, 5.492 at 261.55 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Kevin Schwantz of Paige, Tex., edged world leader Wayne Rainey of Downey to win  the British 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle race at Castle Donington, England.  </P> <P> Starting the race 30 points behind Rainey, Schwantz, on a Suzuki, won by two  seconds with former world champion Eddie Lawson of Upland, third.  </P> <P> Rainey, riding a Yamaha, still has a 27-point lead in the overall standings  with four races left.  </P></p>

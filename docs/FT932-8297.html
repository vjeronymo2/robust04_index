			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (5): Red tape and sealing wax - Richard Evans tries to unravel the great UK parcels sell-off mystery THE long term structure of the parcels industry remains unclear following further delays by the government in reaching a decision on how to privatise the Post Office and float off its Parcelforce division. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has yet to decide whether to sell off the Post Office as one unit or break it up into three - the Royal Mail, Post Office Counters, and Parcelforce. No clearly preferred option has yet emerged. Mr Edward Leigh, the trade and industry minister with direct responsibility for the post office, is a strong supporter of privatisation, but he is understood to have accepted that the measure might have to be delayed until next year or beyond. The sale of Parcelforce could still proceed without primary legislation, though. Under the British Telecommunications Act, 1981, Mr Heseltine has the power to sell Post Office subsidiaries, but he is thought unlikely to take a decision on this part of the privatisation process until he has decided on the overall form of the sale. This caution comes as a great disappointment to the senior managers of Parcelforce following Mr Heseltine's announcement last July that he intended to privatise the post office division. However, two weeks later, Mr Heseltine made a further announcement of a fundamental review of the future status of the Post Office. The two have been inextricably linked ever since and the future seems as unclear as ever. Mr Heseltine said that financial support would be made available so that management and employees could bid for Parcelforce, but private sector groups have also expressed an interest. Mr Malcolm Kitchener, managing director of Parcelforce, is philosophical about the delay, although he would clearly like the uncertainty to end as soon as possible. 'We have been in limbo and it has not been an ideal situation. It is unsettling and it is harder to win new business when people know there is a big decision in the offing,' he says. Nevertheless, Parcelforce has held its own in the very difficult trading climate created by the recession. It currently holds nearly 30 per cent of the non-urgent market and about 25 per cent of the total market including express services. This makes it the largest UK parcels delivery organisation with an annual turnover in excess of Pounds 500m. Considerable progress has been made in knocking the organisation into shape for privatisation as, in contrast to the Royal Mail division, with its monopoly in letters delivery, Parcelforce has made substantial losses in the past. It notched up a loss of Pounds 131m in the year to the end of March, 1991 but this was reduced the following year to Pounds 24m with a programme of cost cutting, voluntary redundancies and the introduction of high-tech equipment and support services. In the financial year just ended more progress has been made with a reduction of costs of another Pounds 14m. 'It obviously gets harder all the time, but we will get there. What we need to do is get on with our business plan as that is where further benefits will come,' says Mr Kitchener. He joined Parcelforce from Fisons pharmaceuticals division early in 1991 as finance director and became managing director in August last year. The business has taken great steps to distance itself from the Post Office and the nationalised image it represents. It began with the setting up of a separate parcels division within Royal Mail in 1986, the change of name to Parcelforce in 1989, and finally the dropping of the Royal Mail prefix entirely last year following success in establishing a separate identity. Parcelforce makes commercially based payments to the Post Office for the use of its services, such as access to Post Office Counters and delivery to rural areas, and although it does not charge value added tax on its own services, Parcelforce is in turn is unable to reclaim an estimated Pounds 12m a year for costs incurred on items such as petrol or overheads. A five year Pounds 250m investment plan was launched last year to upgrade the network of depots covering 23m UK addresses in the UK, the 10,000 strong vehicles fleet, and information technology. It is investing Pounds 15m in a high-tech sorting centre at Liverpool due to be fully operational next year. 'Our overall strategy is geared to improving both cost and quality in all areas of our business,' says Mr Kitchener. 'We have invested in high-tech equipment and have undertaken a restructuring and upgrading of all our services to meet the growing demand for guaranteed next day delivery and one-stop shopping.' It is the guaranteed next day delivery that has been the weak link in Parcelforce services until now. The organisation delivers over 180m parcels a year, but mostly in the two or three day 'non-urgent' market, even though around 95 per cent of customers come from the business sector. Research shows there is a trend towards time-guaranteed services, and it is estimated that next day services could soon account for over 40 per cent of the market. It is this potentially more lucrative area, at present led by Securicor, that Mr Kitchener is anxious to attack. At present Parcelforce takes only a small slice of this sector, although volume growth on its next day service increased by 50 per cent in 1992-93, and so far this year it has secured Pounds 10m in extra revenue from its 24 hour express service. It now offers a network of three time-guaranteed services, Parcelforce Datapost, Parcelforce 24 and Parcelforce 48. These ensure delivery by 10am or noon the next morning, close of business next day, or two days respectively. Mr Kitchener and his colleagues now await some form of privatisation with impatience. They do not believe it would make a big difference to the way the business is already conducted in a highly competitive environment, but it would end the uncertainty and allow business plans to be fulfilled.</p>

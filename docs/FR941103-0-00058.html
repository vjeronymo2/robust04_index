			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By proposing conditional approval on this action, EPA is agreeing to defer final, full approval on the revised SIP until the State has conducted a study of the impact of the LMW on the I/M program's emission reductions. The May 26, 1994 letter and the July 21, 1994 submittal commit to completing this evaluation no later than January 31, 1995. It should be noted that the State's authorizing legislation currently sets a deadline of January 15, 1996 for completion of this evaluation, and the State's commitment to complete the report by January 31, 1995 represents a significantly expedited schedule. In the event that the above evaluation shows that the State's use of LMWs causes it to fall short of the enhanced I/M performance standard in actual practice, the State has further committed to securing the necessary legal and regulatory changes to eliminate LMWs in time to submit a corrected I/M SIP no later than September 1, 1995. To fulfill its commitment to meet all requirements of 40 CFR 51.360 Maine must also make the necessary regulatory changes to address the OPR issue no later than September 1, 1995. Should the State fail to meet the above commitments, the conditional approval will convert to a disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Clean Air Act Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Maine is part of the Ozone Transport Region (OTR). Section 184(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires areas of the OTR defined in EPA's final I/M rule (57 FR 52950, November 5, 1992) to adopt and implement an inspection and maintenance program meeting EPA's enhanced I/M performance standard. In addition, the I/M rule requires that all moderate ozone nonattainment areas containing urbanized areas must implement a program meeting the basic I/M performance standard. Maine is affected by these provisions in some areas of the State. Specifically, under EPA's I/M rule, enhanced I/M programs are required in the Portland area, and the Maine portion of the Portsmouth, New Hampshire area. Basic I/M would be required in the Lewiston-Auburn area. This program is being submitted to fulfill Maine's obligations to implement basic and enhanced I/M. Enhanced I/M is a more stringent program and includes all of the required components of basic I/M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reviewed the November 1, 1993, May 26, 1994 and July 21, 1994 State submittals against the requirements of the Act and EPA's final I/M rule. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. I/M Regulation General SIP Submittal Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), EPA published a final regulation establishing the I/M requirements, pursuant to sections 182 and 187 of the Act. The I/M regulation was codified at 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 51, subpart S, and requires States to submit, by November 15, 1993, an I/M SIP revision that includes all necessary legal authority and the items specified in 40 CFR 51.350 through 51.373.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

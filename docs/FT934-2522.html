			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Land bill leaves Australians unclear where they stand: An Aborigine rights law that pleases few Noel Pearson, a 28-year-old lawyer, tells a group of Australian senators why he, and fellow Aborigines, negotiated a milestone land rights deal with the government: 'It was a salvage exercise - a desperate salvage exercise.' Michael Mansell, speaking for the more radical Aboriginal Alliance Committee, tells the senators that the proposed legislation which has come out of those negotiations and could be passed into law this week, would do little to help his people. Worse, it could impede their rights in some areas. Both men are presenting their views in a Canberra committee room which, with its air-conditioning and wood-panelling, is far from the scorched red earth at the centre of this fight. There, everyone agrees, Aborigine communities with rudimentary education and limited access to information, have little hope of grasping the complex legal tussle that is going on. 'I can't say that half of Aborigines have any understanding of this bill,' says Mr Mansell. The Australian government's native title bill is also perplexing the business community. Lawyers for the nation's mining and resource-based companies have spent weeks scouring the wording and wondering whether money poured into project development would now be secure from lengthy legal battles. 'Let's put it like this. The lawyers haven't found any problems - yet,' says one mining executive, when asked about the likely go-ahead for a stalled multi-million-dollar deal. Summing up the general concern, Mr John Prescott, head of BHP, Australia's largest industrial company, has likened the legislation to 'reading porridge'. For all the confusion, its significance is difficult to understate. In simple economic terms, land-related industries are crucial to the nation's prosperity. Mining and agriculture, for example, account for about 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product and provide more than 60 per cent of merchandise exports. The native title bill represents an attempt by today's Australia to come to terms with a less than glorious aspect of its past. When European settlers first arrived in Botany Bay in the late 18th century, they worked on the premise that land was uninhabited. This was despite an evident indigenous population who were simply 'dispossessed'. This was compounded by decades of shoddy treatment meted out to the Aboriginal community. A law prohibiting racial discrimination came into force only in 1975. Unemployment is high among indigenous people and social conditions are poor. Tensions lurk close to the surface. The death recently of Daniel Yock, a young Aborigine dancer who had been arrested in a Brisbane street brawl, prompted riotous demonstrations, allegations of police brutality, and a public inquiry. The immediate catalyst for some form of native title legislation has been legal rather than moral, however. Last year, the Australian high court decreed that native title could exist where Aborigines had maintained a close and continuing relationship with the land, although it added that land titles acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be disturbed. The bill is an attempt to marry these two pronouncements. In essence it provides for a system of 'validating' existing land titles. Where this happened, and except in the case of mining leases, native title claims would be extinguished. In the case of mining leases, native title would be allowed to stand alongside an existing lease, then take over when that lease expired. However, where a genuine native title claim was extinguished, compensation would be paid by state or federal government. A system of tribunals would be set up to handle claims and adjudicate on compensation matters. Native title holders or claimants would have negotiating rights over the land in question but no veto right. The compromise nature of the legislation means that its likely practical implications please no one. On the Aborigine side, it is estimated that no more than 10 per cent of the indigenous population would have any chance of successfully asserting native title claims. In most cases, victorious claims would be levelled against vacant Crown land, the largest amounts of which lie in western Australia. This makes all important the federal government's promise of a land fund to help the majority of Aborigines who did not gain from the bill. 'The only way my people in Cape York are going to benefit is via the land fund,' says Mr Pearson, for example. But the dollar amount has yet to be spelt out. Moreover, as more radical voices such as Mr Mansell's point out, even where Aborigines do establish native title they would not get back everything which the land holds. Mineral rights, for instance, would remain with the Crown. While the mining and pastoral industries know that government would pick up compensation costs, this would not prevent long hearings to establish native title rights. In theory, the private sector should be no more than a bystander in this process; in practice, it would probably incur legal and other costs. Meanwhile, the ability of native title claimants or holders to negotiate over developments may lead to unwanted delays. Such uncertainties - and there are others - could affect the availability and cost of project finance, it is argued. The nation's biggest mining companies warned this month that the need to establish the native title position before beginning exploration would divert the industry's investment abroad. 'You'll see the exploration dollar vote with its feet,' says one executive. And for the general public, there is the big unanswered question of how much the compensation claims would cost, but the government refuses to be drawn. One Treasury official has hinted that higher taxes may be down the road. Opposition leaders have warned that the sums, including the land fund, could be considerable; the government says it is impossible to assess, although it expects that the number of successful native title claims would be limited. Judging by opinion polls, this leaves the public as wary as everyone else about the legislation's merits.</p>

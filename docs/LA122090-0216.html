			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> SCALED-DOWN PROJECT WINS FINAL APPROVAL  </P> <P> The City Council has let stand its earlier approval of a 17-acre shopping  center in the Bear Brand community, but gave final approval only after further  modifying a project that already had 34 conditions attached to it.  </P> <P> The proposed center, which will include a seven-screen movie theater and three  restaurants, has been opposed by some residents as a hulking, noisy intrusion  into their neighborhood.  </P> <P> It was the first time a Planning Commission decision has been appealed to the  City Council in this city.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 1 Tuesday in favor of the project, which Shea Business  Properties will develop on the northeast corner of Camino del Avion and Street  of the Golden Lantern. Thomas W. Wilson cast the dissenting vote and Mayor  Patricia C. Bates abstained.  </P> <P> Initially, residents opposed the center because it would obstruct ocean views.  Later objections revolved around the size of the theater, walkways in the  theater area and the attendant increase in noise and traffic.  </P> <P> In approving the project, the council ordered that the theater be reduced from  32 to 28 feet in height and that a seventh screen be added while maintaining  the overall 1,600-seat capacity. The latter provision is intended to reduce the  number of people arriving and leaving the theater at a given time.  </P> <P> The council also agreed to require that additional pedestrian pathways be  created near the theater while moving automobile traffic farther away.  </P> <P> During the approval process, the size of the project was shrunk by more than  5,000 square feet, senior planner Micki Harris said. A proposed service station  was also deleted. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

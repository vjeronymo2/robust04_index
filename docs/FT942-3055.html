			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Textiles side behind 21% rise at Hicking Pentecost Further 'excellent progress' by the textiles division helped Hicking Pentecost report pre-tax profits ahead 21 per cent for the year to the end of March. There was a slight improvement in the industrial products side. For the present year the company expects further improvement with important contributions from the recent acquisitions of Alan Paine, a knitwear company, and Barbour Campbell, the industrial thread business. For the year profits were Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 2.85m) on turnover up 20 per cent at Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 29.5m). Earnings per share were 14p (11.6p). A second interim dividend of 3.05p was declared on April 28, for a total of 4.6p (4p). The textiles division reported sales up 13 per cent and operating profits rose by 24 per cent with margins improving from 11.3 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Alan Paine contributed sales of Pounds 350,000, incurring operating losses of Pounds 136,000 reflecting the seasonality of the business. Mr John Lister is retiring as chairman at the annual meeting. He will be replaced by Mr Hamish Grossart, who has been a non-executive director since October 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [29 March] the police  increased their protective measures for ``Israeli objects'' in  Bonn.

In the next  few days, residents will have to identify themselves if they  want to get to their houses. Normal traffic is being diverted  on a large scale. According to the police, the German security  authorities have been given tip-offs that Israeli ``objects''  might become targets of terrorist attacks.</p>

A senior official commented: "We are checking the report  which is based on the contents of a confidential letter from  President Boris Yeltsin to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. We  have contacted our High Commissioner in New Delhi, Mr Riaz  Khokar and, in a couple of days, we should be in a position to  give a formal reply."    The official added that he was surprised that such a  confidential letter between two heads of state could have found  its way into a newspaper article. The view in the Foreign  Office is that if the report is true then the letter may have  been sent to New Delhi before the Foreign Secretary-level talks  between the two countries were held early this month.    According to the report in the Indian press which was  prominently displayed in the media here, Russia has expressed  its concern over grave violations of human rights and asked New  Delhi to solve the Kashmir problem in accordance with the wishes  of the Kashmiri people.    Earlier when Boris Yeltsin had visited India, he had  reportedly spoken of Occupied Kashmir as part of India which had  disturbed Islamabad. It was only after a clarification from  Moscow that Islamabad announced that there was nothing new in  Moscow's policy on Occupied Kashmir.    One view which prevailed in the Foreign Office was that  recently the United States and Russia have shown similarity of  views on many issues. "Both US and Russia want India and  Pakistan to continue dialogue and both (in the past) have  approached the two neighbours to come to the negotiating table,"  said the official. "But what we cannot tell right now is  whether there is really a qualitative change."    Earlier, a senior US official Robin Raphael had visited  Moscow after a visit to Islamabad and the growing US concerns in  the region were a topic of discussions. Later, during Bill  Clinton's visit to Moscow recently a joint statement spoke of  peace in the region.    Before waiting for any formal reply from the government, the  All Parties Hurriyat Conference in a press release has hoped  that the Russian advice would convince India to stop its reign  of terror. While applauding the Russian stance on Kashmir, the  statement said that the change was due to advent of democracy in  Russia which resulted in this human and conviction-oriented  stand.    Meanwhile, the official at the Foreign Office said that  there  was some indication that the six non-papers that India had  promised to send to Pakistan would arrive here sooner than  expected. "Earlier, the Indian Foreign Office had said that they  would send them after nearly four months," commented the  official.    The Foreign Office says that New Delhi had to do so because  Islamabad had seized the initiative and sent them two non-papers.</p>

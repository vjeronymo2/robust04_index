Profit Sharing Plan (the Plan) Located in Puyallup, WA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Application No. D&hyph;9414] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Exemption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the sale for cash of certain limited partnership units (the Units) from the Plan to Cascade West Sportswear, Inc. (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The fair market value of the Units is established by an appraiser independent of the Plan and the Employer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Employer pays the greater of $131,560 or the current fair market value of the Units plus an ``opportunity loss'' of no less than $171,000;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The sale is a one-time transaction for cash; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Plan pays no commissions or other expenses in relation to the sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Facts and Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Employer is engaged in the business of outerwear garment manufacturing. Eric Hilf, a 50-percent shareholder of the Employer, is the trustee of the Plan. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which had approximately 119 participants and total assets of $221,364 as of December 31, 1992. The board of directors of the Employer voted in 1992 to terminate the Plan. The last contribution to the Plan was made for the Plan year ended December 31, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In July 1980 the Plan acquired the Units which represented a 28.6 percent interest in the Good Sam Investors limited partnership (the Partnership). Following its formation, the Partnership acquired an undeveloped parcel of real estate (the Property) near downtown Puyallup, Washington. The Plan initially paid $51,667 for the Units. Since the purchase of the Units, the Plan has contributed additional amounts to the Partnership for its share of the carrying costs of the Property. The Plan also borrowed money from an unrelated commercial bank to pay off the Plan's share of the original seller-financed acquisition of the Property by the Partnership. The Partnership has made a distribution to the Plan totaling $49,028. Net of such distributions, the total amount expended by the Plan in regard to acquiring and holding the Units (including the above $51,667) was $239,730 as of December 31, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Plan acquired the Units because they originally appeared to represent a good investment. The applicant represents that neither the Employer nor any of its officers has invested separately in the Partnership. The other investors in the Units are unrelated parties. The Property is not adjacent to any property owned by the Employer and has not been used by the Employer or any other party in interest with respect to the Plan since the time of the purchase of the Units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several business and residential developments in the area near the Property were underway at the time the Partnership was formed. The Partnership consulted with real estate and engineering firms during the early 1980s to determine the requirements to make the Property salable at an attractive price. However, the City of Puyallup later withdrew a determination statement which would have permitted development of the Property. In 1986 the Partnership sold a portion of the Property to an unrelated party for $180,000, resulting in the above mentioned distribution of $49,028 to the Plan. Since then the Partnership has listed the Property on three occasions with three different real estate brokers but has been unable to sell the Property. A significant portion of the Property has now been classified as wetlands and cannot be developed without substantial additional expense. Plan fiduciaries have concluded that the Property could not be sold to an unrelated party without a substantial price concession or considerable additional expense. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department expresses no opinion as to whether plan fiduciaries violated any of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of part 4 of title I of the Act in acquiring and holding the Units. Section 404(a)(1) of the Act requires, among other things, that a plan fiduciary must act prudently and that plan investments must be properly diversified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Plan obtained an appraisal on the Property dated March 12, 1993, from Roger D. Ockfen, MAI (Ockfen), a real estate appraiser located in Tacoma, Washington. The applicant represents that Ockfen is independent of the Plan and the Employer. Placing emphasis on the comparable sales approach to value, Ockfen estimated the fair market value of the usable land area of the Property as of February 18, 1993, to be approximately $460,000. Based on this amount, the value of the Units representing the Plan's 28.6 percent interest in the Partnership totaled $131,560.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The applicant represents that there is no market for the Units and that they are not expected to appreciate in value. However, the Plan cannot make liquidating distributions to its participants without first selling the Units. Accordingly, the Plan proposes to sell the Units to the Employer. The Employer will pay the Plan the greater of $131,560 or the fair market value of the Units as of the date of sale, based on an updated independent appraisal of the Property, in addition to an ``opportunity loss'' of approximately $171,000. The ``opportunity loss'' amount, to be adjusted at the time of sale, was calculated assuming a six percent annual rate of return on the Plan's investment in the Partnership since the initial time of that investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total payments to the Plan will thus exceed the Plan's original acquisition and subsequent net carrying costs of the Units (which totaled $239,730 at the end of 1992). The sale of the Units will be a one-time transaction for cash and the Plan will pay no commissions or fees in regard to the transaction. The applicant represents that any amounts received by the Plan as a result of the proposed transaction which are in excess of the fair market value of the Units will be treated as a contribution to the Plan. However, such contribution will not exceed the limitations of section 415 of the Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) The fair market value of the Units will be established by an appraiser independent of the Employer; (2) the Employer will pay the greater of $131,560 or the fair market value of the Units on the date of sale plus an ``opportunity loss'' of approximately $171,000; (3) the sale will be a one-time transaction for cash; and (4) the transaction will remove from the Plan an investment which is not liquid and which is not expected to appreciate in value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Tax Consequences of Transaction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

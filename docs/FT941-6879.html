			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / McGuinness demands pledge on veto The IRA would suspend its campaign of violence if the British government made clear that unionists did not hold a veto over the political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's national executive, said yesterday. Mr McGuinness, identified by sources in Whitehall as IRA chief of staff, told the Financial Times that events were possibly 'close to a dramatic breakthrough' which could enable early talks involving the government and Sinn Fein to take place. However last night, in a further setback for the peace process, Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said his party would not take part in talks on the same basis as in the last round-table table talks, which broke up in 1992. 'We will not let ourselves be tied down to the three-strands process where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.' This did not imply the party would not enter a talks process but 'at present there is nothing on offer in strands two and three' he said, referring to the talks involving Dublin. The party will today publish proposals for devolved government in Northern Ireland in a move likely to increase tensions surrounding attempts to find a political settlement. Today's document is expected to dismay nationalists by arguing that a blueprint for devolved government in Ulster is needed before progress can be made on cross-border co-operation. At the end of Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin Mr McGuinness said it was 'crucially important' that Britain confronted uncertainties surrounding the question of Irish self-determination. He pointed out that Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, had repeatedly said the unionists did not have a veto on political progress. In private communications with Sinn Fein, Mr Reynolds had also pointed out that Downing Street had never contradicted him. Mr McGuinness added: 'The implication of what Reynolds is saying to us is that if they have not contradicted him they must agree with him. If they agree with him, tell us about it and we are in business. We are moving.' Asked if a ceasefire would then be possible he said: 'A dramatic statement from the British government on the issue of the veto will deserve a dramatic response from the IRA. And that means a suspension of IRA operations.' Mr McGuinness said all sides would have to make concessions to break what Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, described as the present 'stalemate' in the search for peace. Mr Adams said on Saturday that the government would have to withdraw political support from the unionists. But London is pledged, with Dublin, to press on with the peace process and insists that before Sinn Fein is admitted to talks the IRA must renounce violence. Today's Ulster Unionist document is expected to underline the gulf separating participants in the political talks by arguing that north-south relations should be maintained by ad hoc meetings between Irish ministers and representatives of a devolved Ulster assembly, rather than by separate institutions. The document is expected to argue that most legislative power should remain at Westminster, at least until any new assembly has found its feet.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Guidelines released on auditing at Lloyd's GUIDELINES released yesterday on auditing at Lloyd's should help to open it up to a larger number of accountancy firms, Andrew Jack writes. The notes, the second set from the Auditing Practices Board, are not designed to lay down new standards but to spread existing best practice. They cover the functions and duties of firms auditing brokers, syndicates and managing agents, and stress that the auditors are responsible above all to the individual Names. Mr Graeme King, general manager at Lloyd's regulatory services group, called the notes 'a cartel-breaking document' that should lift themystique surrounding auditing at Lloyd's and would help to expand the number of auditing firms recognised by Lloyd's from the present 15. The notes stress that it is vital for auditors to examine the strength of syndicates' internal controls and the statistical techniques used to calculate reinsurance.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KARATE TEACHER EXPECTED TO FACE MOLESTATION CHARGES  </P> <P> A Dana Point karate instructor has been arrested on suspicion of sexually  molesting two of his young male students, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said Alfonceo Vito Gaunchii, 44, was  arrested Thursday afternoon at his residence in the 24000 block of Sherwood  Way, where he teaches about 40 karate students in his garage.  </P> <P> Olson said Gaunchii is expected to face charges of one count of oral copulation  and three counts of child molestation. All involve incidents that allegedly  took place at Gaunchii's home, Olson said.  </P> <P> The two alleged victims are 12-year-old and 14-year-old boys, Olson said.  </P> <P> The investigation began after members of the sheriff's sex crimes unit learned  about allegations involving the 14-year-old. That led to a court-approved  warrant to search Gaunchii's house on Wednesday. Investigators say they found  some evidence at the home to corroborate information from the 14-year-old, but  would not elaborate.  </P> <P> However, it was during this investigation that they learned about the  12-year-old, Olson said.  </P> <P> Gaunchii was arrested Thursday afternoon without incident at his home, where  two other youngsters were present for a karate class.  </P></p>

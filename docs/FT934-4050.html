			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Alliances usher in new era: The challenges faced by phone regulators The speed of change in the telecommunications world is posing unprecedented challenges to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. For Europe, the international link-up set to be announced tomorrow between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the French and German state operators, will pose them in acute form. The pressure comes from three sources. Liberalisation. A decade ago, the UK and the US started the global trend towards open competition. In the US, 'Ma Bell' was broken up into American Telephone and Telegraph and seven regional operators; AT&amp;T was left with the long-distance business but subject to competition. In the UK, privatisation of British Telecommunications went hand in hand with the licensing of Mercury as a long-distance competitor. Since then the UK has allowed in further competitors, including US regional operators building cable television and telephone networks. In June the European Union agreed that all EU national telephone operators would be obliged to allow 'voice' competition from 1998 - with extensions for four poorer states. There is widespread concern that a Franco-German link-up before 1998, bringing together the world's second- and third-largest operators, will 'sew up' much of the European market in advance of 1998. Apart from banning any alliance, the European Commission has two other options. It might make consent conditional upon an acceleration of competition. And/or it might extend competition to infrastructure, so that competitors can build their own networks and not be obliged to buy capacity from existing national operators. Under the June accord, the Commission is not even obliged to publish a proposals on the infrastructure issue until January 1995. Alliances. The era of telecommunications companies as national monopoly utilities is rapidly waning. In their place is what Mr Iain Vallance, chairman of BT, calls the 'complex hybrid' - part national utility, part international competitor, in an increasingly vigorous market to challenge operators in their home countries and provide cross-border services to transnational companies. The industry believes alliances are de rigueur for the complex hybrids, particularly in Europe with its patchwork of medium-sized and small operators. Three European alliances already exist: BT has teamed up with the US operator MCI; Unisource brings together the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch state operators, with the Spanish joining as a kind of associate member last week; and Eunetcom will link France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. AT&amp;T is also looking for a European partner. How close should the alliances be allowed to become - particularly those between the larger operators? And who should police them? The EU has no equivalent of the US Federal Communications Commission. If the French and Germans are allowed to team up, say the critics, their governments, nervous about competition, are unlikely to strive hard for open access to their home markets, while the EU will find itself in a weak position to monitor their activities. Convergence. Meanwhile, the worlds of telecommunications, computing, and entertainment are rapidly converging. Three spectacular alliances in the US - AT&amp;T with McCaw, US West with Time Warner, Bell Atlantic with TCI - have been formed in the past six months alone, while BT proclaims itself anxious to join the same game if UK regulatory hurdles are lifted. From this perspective, the Franco-German alliance might be seen as a conservative, almost irrelevant step in the global telecommunications industry. Constructing bigger telephone and data networks may matter less than developing innovative multi-media services to carry over them. Perhaps, but for the European Commission grappling with the Franco-German alliance, today's world will be challenge enough. And that means developing an open, coherent structure for competition - whether in 1998 or before.</p>

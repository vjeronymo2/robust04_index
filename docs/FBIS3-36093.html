He said that the results of the presidential elections had  "confirmed the orientation to economic and cultural cooperation  with Russia."    The referendum on independence to be held next March is  expected to put Crimea's economic independence on a juridical  footing, he continued.    "Crimea must be an independent and full-fledged member of  the  CIS economic system," said Meshkov.    Asked about Kiev's possible negative reaction to the results  of the presidential elections, he said that the more than one  million votes cast in his support were the guarantor which no  decree or political statement can shake.    Speaking about the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, he said:  "The fleet must be indivisible and Russian, and must be based in  Sevastopol -- an inalienable part of Crimea."    He said that the other serious problem facing Crimea was the  problem of the Crimean Tatars. He said he favored the idea of  compensating the Crimean Tatars for the state damage inflicted  on them. He believes that Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, the  countries where part of the deported Crimean Tatars now live,  must finance their return to their historical homeland.    Asked if he would use the white Lincoln given to him by the  Crimean billionaire Sergey Shuriga, he said: "I don't think I'll  use it very often. But it won't hurt to have a Lincoln for  welcoming Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk or Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin."</p>

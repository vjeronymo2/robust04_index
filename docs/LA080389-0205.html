			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NBC RERUNS WIN NETWORK SWEEPS  </P> <P> NBC-TV won the July sweeps in what amounts to a battle of the network reruns,  according to figures released today.  </P> <P> The July sweeps, because of the preponderance of repeats, are considered the  least significant of the four sweeps periods each year, in which the ratings  companies measure the viewing habits of audiences in 200 markets. The other  sweeps periods are November, February and May.  </P> <P> This marks the sixth consecutive sweeps victory for NBC, and the fifth July  sweeps win in a row. For the period from July 6 to Aug. 2, NBC had a 10.9  rating and a 21 share. ABC was second with a 9.0 rating and a 17 share, barely  edging out CBS, which had an 8.9 rating and a 17 share. Fox Broadcasting had a  6.4 rating and a 13 share.  </P></p>

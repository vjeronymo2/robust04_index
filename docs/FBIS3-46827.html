			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito by </F> NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] Japan's diplomacy is expected to be  forced to go through fundamental changes in the post-Cold War  international community. I would like to ask you about a  typical post-Cold War case. Would you give your view and  analysis of the situation in the DPRK?    [Saito] The DPRK is the only nation with which Japan has yet  to settle post-war issues. There is no change in Japan's desire  to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK. There is a  possibility, however, that the DPRK, a geographically close  neighbor of Japan, is developing nuclear weapons and this is a  serious issue. Japan cannot tolerate DPRK development of nuclear  weapons. We strongly hope that suspicions about the DPRK's  development of nuclear arms will be cleared up in the U.S.-DPRK  talks. We hope the talks will settle the DPRK nuclear issue one  way or another.    [Reporter] It has been pointed out that any crisis in the  Korean peninsula will inevitably lead to a change in Japan-U.S.  security arrangements.    [Saito] Japan-U.S. security arrangements will not be  affected by any crisis on the Korean peninsula and we are not  concerned about that. The military threat to Japan has not yet  disappeared (even following the end of the Cold War). Japan  cannot protect itself from various crises by its own power  alone. The significance of Japan-U.S. security arrangements  will remain unless a change occurs in Japan's ability to protect  itself. Japan-U.S. security arrangements keep other Asian  nations free from security concerns and their effect will remain  unchanged.    [Reporter] Looking at Japan's security, there are China and  Russia, both of them political and military superpowers.    [Saito] Japan will host the ASEAN regional forum next year.  I think it is right ASEAN foreign ministers and their  counterparts from China and Russia hold talks to discuss the  regional security issue. Japan will urge both China and Russia  to hold security talks with Japan. Japan should promote these  security talks and the ASEAN security talks simultaneously.    [Reporter] Regional security considerations aside, will the  Asian and Pacific region not move toward forming an economic  bloc?    [Saito] The region may move toward forming such an economic  bloc. It is to be expected that European nations will watch  closely the strengthening of relations between the United States  and the member nations of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation  Conference [APEC], but there is nothing for them to worry about.  The European Community (EC) wants to maintain its relationship  with APEC whereby it attends APEC conferences as an observer.  Japan supports this.    [Reporter] With the Cold War behind us, Japan's bid for a  seat on the UN Security Council is becoming more realistic.    [Saito] I believe Japan is qualified to join the UN Security  Council as a permanent member. If an international consensus  forms on Japanese membership, Japan should go along with it. We  must not be impatient, however.    [Reporter] There is also the question of participation by  the Self-Defense Forces in such UN and multinational forces that  fought in the Gulf war. Should the government not make clear  its view on this before the question comes up again?    [Saito] The best thing would be to have the issue debated  and then a decision made once conclusions from the debate have  been drawn. In any case, however, it is clear that Japan can  only take actions are permitted by the Constitution, even if it  is admitted to the UN Security Council as a permanent member.  If Japan becomes a permanent member of the UN Security Council,  the UN body cannot ask Japan to do what is prohibited by the  Constitution. I do not mean Japan cannot join the UN Security  Council before deciding the limits of its participation. As far  as the multinational forces are concerned, my personal view is  that it would be difficult for Japan to join them.    [Reporter] Other nations hope Japan will participate in the  UN peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia.    [Saito] Some argue that as Yasushi Akashi has been appointed  the UN peacekeeping operations representative in the former  Yugoslavia, Japan should do something. I cannot agree with the  argument, though. It is clear, however, that if the situation  there is left uncontrolled, it could get worse. A political  decision will be made on Japan's participation in UN  peacekeeping operations after we are clear whether Japan's  participation is compatible with the Peacekeeping Operations  Cooperation Law. I mean the government will begin examining the  possibility of participation if it conforms to the Peacekeeping  Operations Cooperation Law and the United Nations makes a  request to that effect.</p>

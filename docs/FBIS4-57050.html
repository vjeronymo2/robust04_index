			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 11 May (DPA) -- The government  today lifted the state of internal disturbance it decreed on 1  May to prevent the release from prison of some 840 inmates  charged with drug trafficking, subversion, and kidnapping. The  state of internal disturbance was decreed at that time because  the arraignment deadline for suspected criminals was about to  expire.    Different political sectors welcomed the exceptional  measure,  which was expected to last only 10 days, although they asked for  reforms in the judicial codes so the government would not have  to resort to this mechanism to prevent the release of accused  criminals.    Although it lifted the state of internal disturbance, the  government extended for another 90 days the judicial emergency  decreed under the exceptional measure for the purpose of  extending the deadline to allow prosecutors to gather evidence  against the defendants or to arraign them.    The lawyers for the 840 defendants affected by the measure  criticized the government, noting that if the Prosecutor  General's Office was unable to prove the guilt of their clients  in the time allotted, their continued detention was a "violation  of their human rights."    The extension of the processing deadline only affects those  charged with terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping --  offenses that fall within the jurisdiction of "faceless" judges.  The proceedings for individuals charged with other kinds of  offenses are continuing along their normal course.    The state of internal disturbance is included in the 1991  Constitution, and, so far, it has been enforced three times --  twice to prevent massive prison releases and once to cope with a  violent terrorist offensive by communist guerrilla groups and  drug trafficking mafias.</p>

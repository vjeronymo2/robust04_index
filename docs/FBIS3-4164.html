At a working conference of the Civil Aviation Administration  of China (CAAC) held earlier this month in Beijing, it was  announced that the CAAC plans to invest 3.58 billion yuan  ($411.5 million) this year in improving airports, 59.4 percent  more than in 1993.    The conference mapped out detailed airport construction and  expansion schemes around the country. But the status of the  expansion of Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport and construction of a  second airport in the Pudong New Area were left vague in the  CAAC's documents, which merely say "preparations should be  continued."    A source at the Hongqiao Airport told Business Weekly that  airport construction in Shanghai faces two uncertainties that  may hamper development.    First, it is unclear whether expanding Hongqiao or building  the new airport is more beneficial to the city.    Since the chances of starting both at the same time are  slim,  supporters are fiercely lobbying for each scheme.    Government officials are leaning toward the Pudong airport,  and Business Weekly has learned that the Japanese Government may  finance the project.    The second uncertainty is over who will take charge of  Hongqiao Airport.    About two years ago, the CAAC decided to hand control of  airports over to local governments. By gaining full rights to  administer airports, local authorities also assume  responsibility for raising construction capital.    Progress in this reform has been slow. In Shanghai, in fact,  the CAAC still manages Hongqiao Airport.    Because of this, both the CAAC and the Shanghai government  hesitate to inject money into airport renovation.    Aviation experts don't expect these two uncertainties to be  resolved for at least half a year. But by then, Hongqiao  Airport must be operating at full capacity.</p>

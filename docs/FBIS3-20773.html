			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article including interviews with the chairmen of </F> the Party for Democratic Prosperity by Numan Sallaj; place and  date of interviews not given]    [Excerpts] [Sallaj] The split in the Party for Democratic  Prosperity [PDP] recently reached its culmination. The two  conflicting currents, instead of holding a united Congress,  remain separate, so for all practical purposes the PDP is split  into two parts. The "joint" delegates who were in the Palace of  Culture for their Congress elected Arben [Arber] Xhaferi as  chairman while the part of the party which was transferred to  the Tetovo Commune Committee elected Dr. Xheladin [Djeladin]  Murati as chairman in a parallel Congress. Immediately after the  congresses, the two chairmen claimed that they were legitimate,  on the basis of the fact that they had a sufficient number of  delegates. We talked with the two chairmen about this  competition and asked them the same questions.    [Sallaj] After its second Congress, which was held ahead of  schedule, the PDP has been split into two parts: parallel party  organs and two chairmen have been elected. Which chairman is  legitimate and why?    [Murati] There is no doubt that the first Albanian political  entity in Macedonia has split. This is a permanent split. The  status-quo that existed has been eliminated. Points of agreement  have diverged once and for all. It is a question of legitimacy.  The early Congress of the PDP, which was attended by the  majority of those representatives in whom the people placed  their trust, has the natural right to legitimacy. I am referring  to the deputies, the members of the Central Assembly and of the  Central Presidency who have resigned, the PDP ministers in the  government, where, together with the delegates elected at the  Congress, they reviewed the overall work and activity of the PDP  between the two congresses. An activity report was presented  which objectively expressed the problems and dilemmas, the  deficiencies and shortcomings, the successes and failures  through the prism of a clear view of the work and activity of  the party in the future and the advancement of the status and  course of full equality. Which chairman is legitimate? This is a  provocative question. There is one chairman and one Congress.  The others are only an informal group and a self-proclaimed  chairman. Time and the future will prove this; now we can only  be anxious. This will be addressed by others, the membership,  those who look at the PDP objectively, and not those who view  the PDP unilaterally, superficially, and with contempt. The PDP  Congress, of which I am the chairman, does not have careerist  aims. It does not close the circle of our collective activity;  it does not desire to place a political protectorate over those  who think differently. We are carrying on an indigenous party  policy; we are not directed by others and we are not the puppets  of others; we are in favor of genuine cooperation with every  political entity; we respect dialogue and we express the  aspirations of the people whom we represent. We are open to all  who struggle for equality, peace, and understanding, for the  well- being of the Albanian people in Macedonia and their  state-forming status. This is the truth and our consistent  commitments are our legitimacy and my personal legitimacy.    [Xhaferi] The PDP was not permanently split into two parts  at  its early second Congress. The Council of the Congress, which  was formed on the basis of an agreement of representatives of  the two councils, which was reached earlier in Tirana, called  the Congress and it was held where it was decided at the most  recent meeting of the Council. Therefore, the PDP Congress was  held at the Palace of Culture. Documents which are normally  approved at congresses were approved there; the Central Assembly  was certified and the leadership was elected. Something which  should have been done much earlier was done; a process which was  degenerating the political substance of Albanians in Macedonia  was ended. There was a congress-like atmosphere in the Palace of  Congresses, with certified delegates, with politically important  guests, with an agenda and with documents approved in the  Council. I do not want to comment on the motives and the way in  which the other Congress, which you call parallel, was held, and  the political and ethnic results, because I do not want to  provoke any unnecessary labeling and groupings among the people.  I think that the police and judicial organs should rule on the  legitimacy of one current or another. You should not go near the  wolf in his own lair.    [Sallaj] Why did the compromise achieved by the two councils  in preparation for the Congress fail and, in your opinion, who  did not keep the agreement and what, do we suppose, has been  achieved by observing statutory norms?    [Murati] The objectives of the agreement were not achieved  because one of the parties desired, under any circumstances, to  achieve, as soon as possible, the narrow position of a voting  body, while the other party -- which was part of the council  preparing for the Congress -- wanted respect for statutory norms  and criteria. Unfortunately, the so-called Assembly of Gostivar  demonstrated that it was too rigid to show its support for the  PDP Congress which would be in the interest of all its members  and supporters.    The establishment of the Joint Council of the Congress gave  hope that the work would be over. According to what I know,  positions were not coordinated and positions were imposed.  [passage omitted] The lack of a consensus and the lack of  understanding of the meaning of compromise are two essential  factors in the failure of the agreement which was to lead to the  convocation of a congress of unity and that unity was also  fictitious. The third factor was the failure to observe the  statutory norms, that is, Article 37 of the Statute stating that  members of the Central Assembly, the resigning leadership, and  the supervisory council, the bodies which give legitimacy to the  Congress, should take part in the Congress.    [Xhaferi] After the meetings of the two councils, in Tirana,  Prishtina, and Tetovo, and after the constructive pressure of  the people and of the intelligentsia, a constructive climate for  cooperation, not to say compromise, was created. The Joint  Council which called and organized the Congress came out of this  climate. We can say, without going into political evaluations,  that all the members of the Gostivar steering council were  present at the last two meetings while the full membership of  the other council was never present. As a result, there was an  atmosphere of victory in the spirit of the Gostivar group. Some  people did not accept this superiority and organized another  Congress and left the most recent meeting of the Council.  However, one deputy minister, a commune chairman, and  representatives of the Debar and Kercovo branches stayed. So  there was a forum, with the members of the two Councils, to  approve the documents of the Congress. The program was approved  without any dissenting votes, in the presence of all, and the  Statute was approved with 20 affirmative votes and two  abstentions, after some members left the Council. The public  will have an opportunity to verify all these documents.    [Sallaj] Many people believe that the split is related to  the  civil and ethnic vision of the party. Is this accurate or are  the differences of another nature?    [Murati] The PDP is a civil party which is also fighting for  the achievement of ethnic demands which are continually denied,  disrespected, and not satisfied. The PDP is committed to work  for the natural rights of the Albanians and, for this purpose,  it carried on extraordinary struggles at various levels within  the party, within republic institutions, and on the  international level. It was committed to and it offered options  and mutual guarantees for creating full equality. Therefore, the  PDP fought, with the greatest sincerity and with persistence,  for the achievement of its planned aims, first of all, the  achievement of equal status. So, the friction, the dissension,  and, finally, the split (which someone imposed and approved) are  not the result of the civil or ethnic vision but of something  else, something more basic which I have not yet determined.  There must be a thorough analysis and certainly the analysts wil  carry it out. Albanians in Macedonia are quite divided in regard  to political options and none of the political parties has the  right to cause any new splits among the Albanians as to who is  for the civil or ethnic option. This split which somebody likes  is both damaging and ironic. We have aimed and pledged to obtain  the right for the Albanians to be a state-forming element in  Macedonia so as to advance our status. Division into civil or  ethnic camps only diminishes the power of political activity and  weakens the political force of our activity. [passage omitted]    [Xhaferi] In the old Program and in the new one drawn up the  members of the two Councils, the PDP is defined as a party of  the citizens. There is a tendency for one wing to be  characterized as ethnic and the other as nonethnic. Recently,  arguments have been increasing in this direction. Now, the  conflicts are being explained as rear guard attacks on the  program and not disrespect for the statutory norms because the  two sides both approved of the program's contents. If there had  not been this cooperation, the program certainly would have been  different. [passage omitted]    [Sallaj] The two sides claim to be heirs of the PDP. What  are  the arguments and could a court solve this mater?    [Murati] Yes, we Albanians really like the courts. I would  like this even less. Nevertheless, since we have become  accustomed to agreeing that we cannot agree, perhaps the court  is the essential instrument for resolving conflicts. The  heritage of the party is its membership, the road taken so far  by the party from the village of Xhepcishte to all the branches  in the entire world, the materials which it left everywhere it  went, the documents which it prepared and sent to institutions  inside and outside the country. Nevertheless, the heritage is  irrelevant for me. The important thing for me is the legitimacy,  legality, and validity of the Congress. The Congress to which I  belong has these three elements. Therefore, the greatness of the  Congress verifies the legitimacy of the PDP. We can reach an  agreement through democratic means of resolving conflicts...  However, it is necessary to...    [Xhaferi] I would not be the one to defend the legitimacy of  the Congress which was held in the Palace of Culture. The base,  the membership, delegates, and assembly members who voted will  make it legitimate. This has nothing to do with the courts,  since it is an internal party and political issue which has  other dimensions. Any outside interference would mean the loss  of the political integrity of the party. It would result in  delays which would paralyze the work of the party. [passage  omitted] To offer this satisfaction now, on the eve of the  census and other important activities, is political  shortsightedness. Certainly we will refuse the offer of good  services on the part of the authorities.    [Sallaj] On the basis of the reports of the commission for  the verification of mandates, it appears that both congresses  were legitimate since they had a sufficient number of delegates.  But, how do you explain the fact that in the two congresses  (taken together) there were more delegates that the number  specified for a "joint" Congress (244)?    [Murati] I was satisfied with the fact that 244 delegates  were called to the Congress but the hall of the House of Culture  has 700 seats which means that more than 400 more people were  "delegates" or guests for a specific purpose, with the exception  of officially-invited guests who were seated in the front row.  Threfore, our Congress, the legitimate congress which was held  in the modest hall of the Communal Assembly of Tetovo, and  without the accompanying solemnities, had the majority of the  delegates but not the guests. This is the basic difference which  should be respected.    [Xhaferi] Such reports are not my responsibility. They are  the responsibility of the appropriate commissions. Soon, many  things will be cleared up, whether I or anyone else like it. The  phenomena must be perceived with objectivity.    [Sallaj] Who "destroyed" the PDP and how do you see the  future of this party?    [Murati] The PDP has not been destroyed. It has been split  apart which means the formation of a new party. But I do not  think that this will be beneficial to our ethnic interests. The  others know this better than we do because they wanted it. Who  knows why? The following conclusion can be drawn: the people who  destroyed the PDP are the ones who wanted to prove to Europe and  to draw its attention to the fact that Albanians are not for  democracy, they are not for politics, they are not for the  government and the state, and that they are only terrorists,  secessionists, irredentists, who are endangering the territorial  integrity of the state, destabilizing the well-being of the  people, endangering peace and coexistence. These are dark  forces, for short-term use, whom the people identify with  anti-Albanians. Unfortunately, there are such forces and they  have demonstrated what they are. The Albanians in Macedonia do  not deserve this. But this should not sadden and demoralize us.  This enriches the variety of Albanian life and the political  structure and increases the competition of political opinions.  This is normal and it will be normal when another party Congress  confers on it a sign of distinction or a sign of recognition on  the part of the PDP. This is its future, a movement which will  provide ways and means of cooperation for the good of the  membership which it represents -- the Albanian people in  Macedonia and Albanian policy, in general. [passage omitted]    [Xhaferi] The PDP was destroyed earlier. The former chairman  of the PDP is trying to explain, in retrospect, the atmosphere  which brought about the collapse. If there had not been certain  relationships in the leadership and other party structures, no  one would have been able to destroy the PDP. This is an  objective finding which no serious person can disregard. Any  other explanation, especially the one which talks about outside  interference, only intimidates the public and stifles opinion.  Fear always obscures reason. All of us, if we do not  realistically confront the political problems and other problems  which disturb the Albanians, will be transformed into  illusionists who produce phantoms and then are frightened by  them. I must emphasize that the attempts to involve Albania as a  negative factor in this conflict are very dangerous, especially  now when the regenerating processes there are near completion.</p>

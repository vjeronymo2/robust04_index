			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Detroit's insiders tip Briton for top Ford job WILL Ford Motor, the second largest of Detroit's big three vehicle manufacturers, follow rivals General Motors and Chrysler and remake its top management team before the year is out? If so, might a British-born executive emerge as heir-apparent to the chair-man? That is one of the hottest topics of debate in the US motor industry, with some analysts suggesting Ford could move as early as this week to anoint an heir-apparent to Mr Harold Poling, the company's 67-year-old chairman and chief executive, who is due to retire next year. The favoured candidate of the Detroit rumour-mill is Mr Alex Trotman, 59, the British-born executive vice-president in charge of Ford's North American operations. Until just a few months ago, the front-runner had been widely assumed to be Mr Allan Gilmour, 58, the urbane executive vice-president in charge of worldwide vehicle operations. However, some analysts claim to have detected growing enthusiasm on the Ford board for Mr Trotman, who currently reports to Mr Gilmour. Mr Trotman's background is in manufacturing, while Mr Gilmour rose through Ford's finance operations. The financial and engineering sides of the industry have often vied for the top jobs - hence the phrase 'bean counters versus car guys'. The finance stream has tended to provide the chairmen at both GM and Ford, although recently there appears to have been a trend towards engineers, or at least finance men with operational backgrounds. Ford's board is due to hold two more meetings before the end of the year - the first is on Thursday - and analysts suggest it may decide to set a succession in motion, so as to ensure a smooth transition next year. A spokesman yesterday declined to comment. One possibility would be for Mr Trotman to be elevated to the board by taking over as president and chief operating officer from Mr Philip Benton, 63, who is thought to be near retirement. However, this theory argues that the board would also promote Mr Gilmour to vice-chairman, seeking to retain him as a key member of the management team. Mr Trotman, who joined Ford in Britain in 1955 as a student trainee, rose on the product planning side. He is the only member of the group's senior executive team to have run its vehicle operations in the three major markets  -North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific.</p>

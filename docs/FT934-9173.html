			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (6): Light at the end of the tunnel - The government says it will raise the ceiling on Korean stocks LESS THAN two years after the Korean stock market was partially opened to foreign investors, the investment limits on most prime Korean stocks have already been reached. Since January 1992, up to 10 per cent of Korean stocks has been available for foreign investment. According to In-Kie Hong, chairman of the Korea Stock Exchange, 25 per cent of companies have reached their 10 per cent ceiling, with about 200 shares at more than 9 per cent. 'That's most of the big shares,' said Sean Goldrick, chief representative of James Capel's Seoul office. The rest of the market consists of shares in companies which are not large enough to interest foreign investors. While this is proving frustrating for brokers and investors, hope is in sight. According to the Korean government's five-year economic plan, the ceiling on Korean companies will be raised some time between 1994 and 1995 and again between 1996 and 1997. However, Chang-Yull Lim, assistant minister at the ministry of finance, says he expects the ceiling on foreign investment to be raised in the first half of next year. Mr Lim said he could not predict by how much the ceiling would be raised. Most market participants are looking for a further 5 per cent, bringing the ceiling to 15 per cent. The government's gradual approach to liberalisation is dictated primarily by fears that a rapid inflow of foreign investment could fuel inflation. Even with the current limits, the inflow of foreign investment has been substantial: a net Dollars 2.6bn in 1992 and a net Dollars 3.32bn for the first three quarters of 1993, according to the ministry of finance. This means that 6.2 per cent of the market is owned by foreigners. 'The most important factor is the potential impact of foreign capital on monetary stability,' said Mr Lim. For example the Dollars 3bn of net inflow this year accounted for 21 per cent of total money supply. However, there are ways around the 10 per cent limit. One is to buy convertible bonds, or bonds with equity warrants issued in the Eurobond market. Another is to buy stocks which have already reached their ceiling from another foreign investor. An over-the-counter market has developed in foreign-owned stocks, which are bought and sold at a premium. There are 30 to 40 stocks traded in this way, usually at a premium of 3 to 4 per cent, but sometimes at a premium of as much as 50 per cent, as in the case of Korea Mobile Telecom. But, according to Philip Smiley, branch manager and director of Jardine Fleming Securities, it is 'terribly difficult to find a company (stock) in sufficient size to interest a foreign institution'. Foreign investors are often loathe to sell, because they are afraid that they will not be able to get back into the market. In any case, the performance of the Korean stock market has been disappointing, particularly when compared to other Asian markets such as Hong Kong and Thailand. Korea's relative economic slowdown and declining profitability have weighed down the stock market's performance this year. But expectations of stronger growth next year had buoyed hopes of an improvement. The introduction of real-name trading in August proved a setback for the market. In an effort to stamp out corruption, the government banned the use of false or borrowed names. False names had been frequently used to avoid tax, or to hide the origin of illegal earnings. About Won3,000bn was held in false-name accounts, estimated to account for 7 per cent of stock investor accounts. 'The market is coming out of a dip,' said Mr Smiley. 'We felt that there would be a genuine recovery in the last quarter (of 1993), but the (introduction of) the real-name system has knocked that back.' However, the real-name system has been broadly welcomed, particularly as it became clear that the set-back to the market was temporary. 'It is not such a cataclysm as it was first thought,' said William Daniel, branch manager of Baring Securities. This was partly because the government had proved flexible in its interpretation of the rules, he said, adding that it was expected eventually to help the market. 'It's a positive move and in the long term will bring greater probity,' said one broker. In the longer term, the prospects for the market's development remain attractive, not least because of Korea's strong industrial base - the second largest in Asia after Japan. Already, the foreign investor base in the market has broadened from specialist regional and country funds to mainstream institutional investors, including a surge of interest from US institutions earlier this year. However, the 10 per cent ceiling has 'put an artificial brake on our activity', said Mr Daniel at Baring Securities. 'We've made a substantial investment here. If they don't raise the limit, we'll be hurting,' said Mr Smiley. The planned introduction of stock index futures at the beginning of 1996 is likely to attract foreign investors. A study is under way to devise the form of the contract, as well as a new index. The current Korean stockmarket index, known as Kospi, covers too many small stocks to be viable as the basis for a futures contract. The new index is likely to include 100 to 300 companies, according to Mr Hong of the stock exchange. He added that the futures market would be introduced first, to be followed by options. Interest rate derivatives will be introduced later.</p>

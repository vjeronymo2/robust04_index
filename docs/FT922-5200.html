			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Aid pledges grow for southern Africa HUNDREDS of millions of dollars have been pledged to alleviate southern Africa's drought, relief officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Geneva. 'The menace of widespread suffering and death which hangs over southern Africa is no abstract issue, no idle concept,' the United Nations under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, Mr Jan Eliasson, told the opening session of a two-day aid conference. The UN and southern African nations, excluding South Africa, organised the conference to gather responses to a joint appeal they made last week for Dollars 835m (Pounds 464m) for one of the region's worst droughts. Pledges announced yesterday were difficult to sort out since some of the figures included already scheduled aid, but it appeared more than half the appeal had been met. The US announced it was giving Dollars 382m in drought relief on top of normal development assistance of about Dollars 275m. The European Community announced it was giving Dollars 276m in food aid, about half of which was in addition to normal aid.</p>

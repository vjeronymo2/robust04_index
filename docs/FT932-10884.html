			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Investors ponder a message set in gold  -Peter Martin examines some investment themes raised by global equity strategists A TOUR of equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic, in the company of people paid to have opinions about them, throws up two interesting themes. First, what is the message that the gold market is sending to investors? The FT Gold Mines index of shares in companies that mine the metal, is up 147 per cent since its mid-January low. Gold itself has risen from Dollars 326 an ounce in mid-March to Dollars 355 an ounce, a rise of 9 per cent. One message is that Mr George Soros, who moved into gold in a big way, has a lot of followers in the international investment community. There are, however, other possible reasons for taking the message from the gold market seriously. Perhaps, says Mr David Shulman, US equity strategist at Salomon Brothers in New York, gold is warning us of inflationary pressures ahead. Next year, he believes, North America, Europe and Japan will all turn in strong economic performances. This would be the first time that the three main economic centres have been growing together since 1989. 'The risk is that there may be more pressure on the system,' he says, 'rather than less'. That makes him worried that US interest rates, at least, may start to move higher - in spite of recent weak performance by US economic indicators. Offsetting those, he says, may be a surprisingly strong growth in tomorrow's US employment numbers. Optimistic views of economic growth do not necessarily translate into favourable assessments of the current levels of share prices, of course. In the US, for example, Mr Shulman believes that the market is likely to drift lower. In Europe - where the consensus view of economic growth is certainly not an optimistic one - the valuation calculations are even more fraught. That leads to the second big theme among strategists: the divide between Europe's devaluers and the continent's hard-currency bloc. In general, the economic outlook for the devaluing countries is seen as far more favourable than for their more determined neighbours. There is room for controversy, however, about whether share prices in devaluers such as Britain, Italy and Scandinavia now fully reflect the likely benefits of a lower currency - or whether, indeed, the upwards move in prices has not gone too far. The debate is most pointed in the case of Italy, where the stock market has outperformed the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 by 41 per cent since since last autumn's lows, compared with 9 per cent for the UK and 30 per cent in Sweden. This strong performance comes in spite of Italy's interlinked political and fiscal crises. With a government headed by a central banker, and revolutionary political changes apparently under way, some international investors are finding Italy still the most attractive of the devaluers. The argument is enhanced by some more mundane arguments. Mr Nick Stevenson, European equity strategist at Warburg Securities in London, says that Italian companies have recently been reporting margins back at the levels of 1986-87, the period before the ERM became a semi-fixed-rate system, and currencies like the lira started becoming heavily over-valued. It is true, he says, that in time the competitive advantages of a devalued currency will always be frittered away but wage restraint, of the sort now visible in Italy and the UK, will delay that moment for years. As a result, he says, Italian shares are very cheap by historical standards. 'We think Italian earnings are 60 per cent below trend earnings,' he says. Though the market is selling at around 25 times earnings at the trough of the economic cycle, the restoration of margins to trend levels would bring down the ratio to something closer to 10. If strategists are still bullish on some, at least, of the devaluers, they have become increasingly gloomy about prospects for the two main hard-currency countries, France and Germany. Mr Stevenson, for example, points to the vulnerability of 'commodity' industrial producers in both countries, which may take years to return to the 'normal' earnings levels of 1986-88. Mr Michael Young, based in London as Merrill Lynch's director of European investment strategy, says that for cyclical stocks in the D-Mark bloc, 'the real window of vulnerability is basically the second quarter,' as companies give up on their hopes of a second-half recovery this year. 'By the fourth quarter at the latest, I would fully expect the market will be back to anticipating recovery in 1994. But we've got to get from here to there.'</p>

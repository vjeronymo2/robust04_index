			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / People: Mathis - a bear-hug from Welch What's it like being caught in a bear-hug by Jack Welch, one of the US's most powerful corporate bosses? Not pleasant, as David Mathis, boss of financial services group Kemper, is finding out, writes Richard Waters. A 'bear-hug' is Wall Street's favoured term for the tactic employed last week by Welch, head of General Electric, to force Mathis to accept his Dollars 2.2bn unwanted advances: offer a big premium for the company, then sit back and wait for Mathis and his board to crumble to shareholder pressure and accept. The 55-year-old Mathis has every reason to feel peeved. Just two years ago, Kemper was on its knees, weighed down by bad property investments and poorly performing property/casualty and reinsurance businesses. That Kemper has bounced back is largely down to him. Mathis sold off the insurance operations (apart from the life business) and relieved much of the pressure from real estate. Followers of the company are unanimous in their praise for his efforts. Mathis could be the ultimate company man. His college education was backed by a Kemper scholarship, and he has spent his entire career at the fund management, life insurance and broking group, based near Chicago. After working his way up on the insurance side, (including starting the group's operations in Europe) he stepped up to become chairman and chief executive in March 1992, at the height of Kemper's difficulties. It must be particularly vexing for Mathis that the company's rebound caught the eye of Welch and his team before it attracted the attention of the stockmarket. His argument now that Kemper should be left alone to get on with its business rings hollow: Welch's hug is feeling tighter all the time.</p>

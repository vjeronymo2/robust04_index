			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Swalec lifts dividend by 47% - Cost reductions help pre-tax profits advance 21% to Pounds 53.6m South Wales Electricity yesterday saw its shares rise 9p to 780p as it announced a 47 per cent rise in its interim dividend. The increase, on the back of a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 53.6m, was partly the result of a rebalancing of dividends between the two halves of the year. The dividend increase was also assisted by the company's recent purchase of 7 per cent of its shares. The company said profits next year would be likely to fall following the introduction of the new regulatory regime next April. It said it hoped to keep the post-tax earnings reduction to within 10 per cent of this year's total. Swalec's pre-tax result for the six months to September 30 was achieved on turnover of Pounds 289.6m (Pounds 274.7m). Earnings per share advanced to 39.2p (31p) and the dividend is 11p (7.5p). Mr David Myring, finance director, said the underlying dividend rise was between 15 and 20 per cent. The buy-back enabled the company to lift dividends by between 2 and 7 percentage points. The rest of the increase was the result of the rebalancing. Mr Myring said the company expected the interim dividend to represent about 35 per cent of the year's total. Part of the profits improvement resulted from a 6 per cent reduction in real costs during the period. Mr Andrew Walker, chief executive, said about 100 staff would go during the year. The company was also benefiting from the renegotiation of pay and conditions which has introduced a single table bargaining system and flexible working. Mr Walker said there was more scope for cost cutting than the company had previously thought. Swalec has increased provisions by Pounds 8.5m since its March year end to Pounds 33.2m, with the restructuring element rising from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 8.9m. The company said it intended to continue buying shares up to the 10 per cent limit for which it had authority, depending on market circumstances. Mr Myring said the company would be comfortable with gearing of up to 40 per cent. COMMENT Swalec's rating in the City has traditionally suffered, in part because of its geographic circumstances - its heavily rural area is expensive to service - and because of a perception that its cost cutting is not as rigorous as that of other recs. It can do little about its geography but it is showing progress in the management of its business. The core business costs are coming down more quickly than expected and the company is getting to grips with its other businesses. It has already divested itself of retailing, something other recs are considering; contracting profits are a healthy Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 200,000) and CableTel has some promise for the future. The shares are trading on a prospective yield of 5.1 per cent, suggesting that there could be room for further share price rises.</p>

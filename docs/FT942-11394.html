			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (27): Not all the news is good - While Latin America is a rich source of business, interest rates are a concern / Forfaiting market report Export credit agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks are meeting a growing proportion of Latin America's huge appetite for capital goods. But there are still many occasions when a lack of 'capacity' among conventional financiers make the funding of exports problematic. It is then a forfaiter may step in. 'You can get export credits in countries like Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, but even then the price may not be right,' a forfaiting specialist says. 'At those times the margins offered by forfaiters are competitive and exporters come to us'. Hungarian International Bank (HIB), a leading forfaiter in the London market, reports a large number of Latin American transactions. HIB says most of these are for capital goods worth up to Dollars 5m. Heavy demand for such funding is reported from EU companies. HIB notes increased interest from UK exporters, notably into Uruguay. Forfaiters are active in countries such as Colombia and Ecuador, which lack ECA capacity, and in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil where they compete with banks offering other financing instruments. Forfaiting can answer an exporter's need to generate cash flow and avoid the payments risks. The forfaiter, usually the specialised department of a bank, buys the exporter's debt at a discount, providing the exporter with cash up-front. The forfaiter must be sure the debt is a good risk and thus worth buying. In this respect it seeks good quality guarantors (in market jargon avalisers) for the debt. Also it often spreads the risk by selling all or part of the debt in the secondary market. Forfaiters were involved in a steady flow of Latin American business even before the bond market boom made the region fashionable again. Forfaiters have re-emerged, even in Peru - an 'exotic' market in banker's parlance, where it is difficult to finance deals. In markets such as Brazil it has become much easier to do longer term deals. But all is not good news. The desirability of transacting forfait deals depends on wider market conditions and these seem more adverse in 1994 than in 1993. Forfaiters are reluctant to give details of transactions, but market soundings suggest the number of larger deals, worth over Dollars 10m each, they will be prepared to accept will be less this year than last. Deals of Dollars 500,000 to Dollars 5m remain the norm. Smaller than that and costs are usually prohibitive. While operations in Latin America give forfaiters some satisfaction, some have expressed pessimism about the level of funding they will be providing this year. There are concerns over interest rates. The forfaiting market traditionally responds negatively to higher rates because most deals are transacted at fixed interest rates. If rates rise, the forfaiters' profits are cut; if they fall profits rise.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Forfaiting rates  --------------------------------------------------------------------                     Period      DM           US dollar                     years       per cent     per cent  -------------------------------------------------------------------- AMERICAS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina               5              * Brazil                  5              * Canada                  7          6 1/2        7 3/8 Chile                   5         8 3/16        8 7/8 Colombia                5              * Mexico                  5         9 3/16        9 7/8 Uruguay                 1              * US                      7          6 3/8        7 1/4 Venezuela               1              *  -------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria                 7          6 1/2        7 3/8 Belgium                 7          6 1/2        7 3/8 Cyprus                  5         7 7/16        8 1/8 Czech Rep               5        10 3/16       10 7/8 Denmark                 5        6 15/16            7 Finland                 5        6 15/16        7 5/8 France                  7          6 3/8        7 1/4 Germany                 7          6 3/8        7 1/4 Greece                  3         7 9/16        7 7/8 Hungary                 5        9 11/16       10 3/8 Iceland                 3         6 9/16        6 7/8 Ireland                 5         6 7/16        7 1/8 Italy                   5        6 11/16        7 3/8 Kazakhstan              *              * Malta                   5        7 15/16        8 5/8 Netherlands             7          6 1/2        7 3/8 Norway                  5         7 3/16        7 7/8 Poland                  5              * Portugal                7          6 7/8        7 3/4 Romania                 1              * Slovenia                5        10 11/16      11 3/8 Spain                   7          6 1/2        7 3/8 Sweden                  5         6 11/16       7 3/8 Switzerland             7          6 1/2        7 3/8 Turkey                  1              * UK                      7          6 3/8        7 1/4  -------------------------------------------------------------------- AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Morocco                 5       10 11/16       11 3/8 South Africa            3         9 1/16        9 3/8 Tunisia                 3         8 1/16        8 3/8 Zimbabwe                1              *  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ASIA &amp;

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Renault begins the breaking up - John Ridding and Christopher Brown-Humes on the new Volvo relationship Step by step, Renault is disentangling itself from its collapsed plans to merge with Volvo. Since December, when the deal was abandoned in the face of strong opposition from Volvo's Swedish shareholders, the French state-owned company has chipped away at the two groups' industrial accords, seeking to redefine their relationship. However, yesterday's announcement - that Renault had sold more than half its equity holding in the Volvo parent company - is the first to affect the complex web of cross-shareholdings which have bound the two companies since they established their industrial alliance in 1990. It raises the question of how far the unravelling will extend and what areas of co-operation can remain. The French government's plans to privatise Renault in the second half of this year and the uneasy state of the alliance have given urgency to finding an answer. Renault yesterday described the sale of 3.2m 'B' shares in Volvo as a financial transaction. 'After the collapse of the merger we said that we would regard our holding in AB Volvo like any other corporate investment,' said the French company. 'Yesterday's move should be seen as part of that approach.' The financial incentives were attractive; the Volvo share price has risen 70 per cent since the merger plans fell through. Renault is estimated to have made a profit of about FFr750m (Dollars 128m) on the sale of its shares, a welcome addition to the balance sheet as the company endures a sharp and protracted downturn in the French car industry. Renault emphasised, however, that the reduction in its stake in the Volvo parent company leaves its voting rights at 8.76 per cent, from just under 10 per cent. It also retains a 45 per cent holding in Volvo's truck operations and 25 per cent in Volvo's car operations. These shareholdings would be much more problematic to unravel, as would Volvo's reciprocal shareholdings of 20 per cent in the Renault parent company and 45 per cent in RVI, the French company's truck and bus division. The future of these shareholdings is still under consideration by the two groups, but they need not be dissolved ahead of privatisation, according to the French government. 'There is no reason why we cannot privatise Renault with Volvo's shareholding,' said one industry ministry official. Industry observers are sceptical, however. 'Volvo could help the privatisation process. If it retains its shares then the public offer would be reduced. But after the rupture, Renault may be wary about having such a large stake held by Volvo,' said one analyst. He said the decision would probably depend on the shape of their commercial relationship. This relationship has changed significantly since the collapse of the merger and, in particular, over the past few weeks. The two companies' joint project to develop a common platform to replace the Volvo 900 series and the Renault Safrane has been shelved. Last week, Renault announced an agreement to disband the joint purchasing and quality control organisations, both of which had been at the centre of the merger strategy. But co-operation in some areas continues. Renault will, for example, receive Volvo engines for its Laguna model, which was launched last month in France. The French group in turn supplies Volvo with engines and gearboxes for its 400 series. This form of co-operation is relatively modest, however. Renault has similar agreements with other carmakers, such as Peugeot, its domestic rival. Future steps taken by the two groups are unlikely to bring them any closer. The Swedish market has anticipated the gradual unwinding of the alliance since the merger plan collapsed. The expectation has been that the two companies would continue to collaborate at a commercial level, where it is in both their interests to do so, but that the formal structure of the alliance, cemented through cross-shareholdings, would gradually dissolve. Analysts say Volvo still needs a partner long-term to share research, development and distribution costs, even though its short-term prospects are favourable. Profits are expected to rise over the next two years on the back of currency gains, cost-cutting, and a strengthening of markets in the US, UK and Sweden.</p>

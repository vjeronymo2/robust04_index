Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held a news conference  today, the last day of her visit, before her departure. During  the news conference she spoke about the results of her visit to  the country, as well as other regional and international issues.  At the outset of the news conference, the Pakistani prime  minister expressed her sincerest appreciation for His Majesty  Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, may God watch over him, and for the  Omani people, for the warm welcome and hospitality she and her  delegation were accorded during their visit to the country.    "I'd like to start by expressing my appreciation to his  majesty, the government, and the people of Oman, for giving us  such a warm welcome during the visit to your country."    The prime minister said that her visit to the country is of  a  special significance, because we, in Pakistan, attach special  importance to our relations with the Sultanate, especially since  the Sultanate and Pakistan are geographically close to each  other, in addition to the fact that they have historical  relations, she added.    Regarding her talks with His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id,  Mrs. Bhutto said:    "While I was here in Oman I had the opportunity of not only  discussing the areas that there can be economic cooperation, but  also hearing his majesty on the world situation and the regional  situation."    The prime minister said: My visit to the Sultanate was not  only to discuss economic relations, but also to hear his  majesty's views on the international situation in general, and  the regional situation in particular.    Mrs. Bhutto added that she had discussed with his majesty  the  situation in Jammu and Kashmir, and that she had briefed him on  Pakistan's stand toward the issue, and on her country's call for  reaching a peaceful settlement of this crisis through  international means. The two sides also discussed the Afghan  issue, the Yugoslav crisis, and the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Mrs. Bhutto said that his majesty briefed her on the  situation in this region, that she felt that the visit was very  useful to her, and that this visit will be followed by other  visits on the ministerial level.    Mrs. Bhutto invited his majesty to visit Pakistan where he  will be received with the same warm welcome and hospitality from  the Pakistani people.</p>

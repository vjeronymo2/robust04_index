			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Twenty per cent of Russians  surveyed said they approve of the work of President Yeltsin.  About the same number had a good opinion of local authorities  as well, according to a survey conducted by the "Public Opinion"  fund among the country's urban and rural residents.    Answers to sociologists' questions concerning the future  presidential elections revealed two tendencies. The first shows  that, no matter who the presidential candidates are, from one  fifth to one quarter of the respondents do not intend to vote.    The second trend shows that President Yeltsin still has the  highest rating among possible candidates for the presidency.  When asked to imagine that Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy were the  only candidates to pass the first round, 27 per cent of  respondents said they would vote for Yeltsin, while 11 per cent  favored the Liberal Democratic leader. In the same situation  Yeltsin came out on top of former vice-president Aleksandr  Rutskoy 21 to 11 per cent, and proved more popular than his  current prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, 15 to 8 per cent.    The sociologists' inquiry was answered by, with differences  according to the particular question, from 1139 to 2468  respondents.</p>

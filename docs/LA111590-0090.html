			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> CONFERENCE FEATURES FORD, NAKASONE  </P> <P> An exclusive Ojai country club will be the site this weekend of an  international conference that is expected to draw three former leaders of the  United States and Japan.  </P> <P> Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, former Japanese Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone, and 30 other political and business leaders are scheduled to  participate in the closed-door inaugural meeting of the U.S.-Japan Leadership  Council at the Ojai Valley Inn and Country Club.  </P> <P> "The U.S.-Japanese relationship is of utmost importance and, though it has been  good over the years, the image is that it has been confrontational," said Jon  Strom, the council's program coordinator. "What we're trying to do is create a  new level to the relationship and overcome the regular day-to-day type of  negotiating."  </P> <P> The council was the brainchild of Robert McFarlane, the national security  adviser to former President Ronald Reagan who pleaded guilty to four  misdemeanors stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal. Strom said McFarlane  continues to command considerable respect in the international community, as  indicated by the caliber of participants in the first of the council's biannual  meetings.  </P> <P> Talks will center primarily on "mutual security" of the two nations, Strom  said, including discussion of the Middle East crisis, world economic conditions  and the easing of Cold War tensions.  </P> <P> The 216-room Ojai Valley Inn is located on a 220-acre complex that includes an  18-hole golf course.CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

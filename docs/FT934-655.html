			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vulnerable but still in the field - Lasmo, badly affected by the oil price fall, is selling assets Lasmo, one of the UK's biggest independent oil exploration and production companies and one of the most vulnerable to current low oil prices, is suffering from 'a past obsession' with size, according to Mr Joe Darby, chief executive. Yesterday's sale to PowerGen of Pounds 123m worth of assets, including 5 per cent of the promising Liverpool Bay gas project, suggests that that obsession is over. Mr Darby took over last January from Mr Chris Greentree, who in 1991 engineered the Pounds 1bn acquisition of Ultramar which, with hindsight, is seen as the start of the company's troubles. The market value of the merged company fell by about half in the six months to July last year. That was partly because of the decline in the oil price but also because of a re-rating of the merged company. Since that time Lasmo's share price and market capitalisation has roughly tracked the decline in the oil price. Lasmo's overwhelming priority from the late 1980s was rapid growth and aggressive expansion abroad. It was such that the company was 'blinded to some extent' on where oil prices were heading. At the same time 'pride in being a black oil company' left Lasmo with little exposure to buoyant natural gas prices. The London market's judgment of past errors and strategy has been harsh. Lasmo's shares have underperformed the oil sector by some 45 per cent over the past year. Investors have reacted badly to deteriorating profitability and the prospect that gearing will rise from 70 per cent to 80-90 per cent by the end of 1995, despite yesterday's sale. The need to broaden the company's base and reduce its vulnerability to low oil prices will take time and could tax further the patience of shareholders. Mr Darby agrees that his 'honeymoon' with the City has been cut short by the oil price fall. He is keen not to put further strain on the relationship. Lasmo's board will consider a final dividend in March, an event which investors will be viewing with more than usual interest. Mr Darby says eliminating a recommended 2p pay-out would save only Pounds 15m plus advance corporation tax, an amount 'not very significant' to the company's overall health, especially when weighed against the message it would send to investors. According to some analysts, Lasmo's fall from favour has distracted attention from its success in cutting costs and selling peripheral assets. Development projects, which are pushing debt upwards, are not only aimed at securing lower-cost reserves, but will also boost Lasmo's production by 40 per cent from a 1993 average of 160,000-165,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day to 220,000-230,000 a day by 1996. Yesterday's asset sale should not affect that target. Personnel changes in the offing will give Lasmo's senior management a new look. The resignation in October of Mr Michael Pavia as finance director paved the way for a successor who is likely to have stronger City connections. And the resignation of Lord Rees last month will allow Lasmo to appoint a new chairman, who, Mr Darby says, will be either 'a City figure with a good reputation or a strong personality who has performed well elsewhere.' Neither position is likely to be filled until the end of March, and there is persistent speculation that Lasmo may be the subject of a takeover before any new appointees can settle in. 'We are vulnerable,' concedes Mr Darby, 'and I can't guarantee that it won't happen'. But Lasmo won't resort to poison pills or other artificial defences, he says. A takeover would be the easiest way to end Lasmo's financial pain, although Mr Darby insists that he hopes to persuade shareholders that the company can succeed in its unenvious task of 'investing against a sliding oil price'. The main element of the strategy will be continued cost cutting, including a sharp reduction in spending on exploration and appraisal wells. A maximum of Pounds 60m will be spent in 1994, compared with Pounds 85m this year. A long-standing criticism of Lasmo has been its poor record in finding new oil at a cost in line with industry averages. Mr Darby concedes that he 'has been disappointed with the quality of some of Lasmo's people' on the exploration side. But he contends that the company's new exploration team under Mr Peter Nolan, a veteran of British Petroleum, and future concentration on low cost areas in which Lasmo already has a presence should lead to improvements. The company also wants to reduce its dependence on oil. One way would be to capitalise on its experience in running one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas plants in Indonesia through involvement in a similar project elsewhere. 'It may be as a technical adviser or possibly even taking an equity position,' according to Mr Darby. Other gas projects linked to power generation schemes will also be considered, he says. Under the terms of the Liverpool Bay project, for example, 85 per cent of the price of the gas sold to PowerGen's planned Connah's Quay plant will be linked to the retail price index, rather than to oil prices. Mr Darby is sensitive that any future asset sales maximise shareholder value. Would-be buyers have played on Lasmo's weakness, but he does not 'feel under enormous pressure to sell at distressed prices'. This attitude applies to some foreign assets which Lasmo would like to sell as well as to the Markham gas field which straddles the British and Dutch sectors of the North Sea. It has been for sale since March, but negotiations with Wintershall of Germany have so far failed to agree on a price. Yesterday's sale has eased the pressure on the company, but Lasmo remains at the mercy of the oil price. And 'there are no obvious signs of improvement in the short term,' concedes Mr Darby.</p>

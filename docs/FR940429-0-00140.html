One commenter said that his school awarded $1,000 institutional scholarships to all students in the second year of their program. The commenter felt strongly that his institution should be able to include these scholarships as institutional revenues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An institution is not prohibited from including institutional charges that were paid by institutional scholarships and institutional loans as revenue in the denominator of the fraction contained in &sect;600.5(d)(1), provided that the scholarships and loans are valid and not just part of a scheme to artificially inflate an institution's tuition and fee charges. For this purpose, the Secretary does not consider institutional loans to be real unless such loans are routinely repaid by the student borrowers. The Secretary does not consider institutional scholarships to be valid if every student receives such a scholarship so that no student ever pays the claimed tuition and fee charges. The Secretary considers the above-described practice of the commenter to be a classic example of this scheme.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this connection, the Secretary will scrutinize institutions that raise their tuition and fee charges to avoid the 85 percent rule but can show no actual payment of those additional charges, or payment through ``artificial'' institutional scholarships and loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters suggested that non-need-based title IV, HEA program assistance, such as funds under the Federal PLUS Loan Program, the Federal SLS Program, and the unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan Program, should not be included in the numerator of the 85 percent rule calculation because it is unrealistic to penalize an institution whose students chose to borrow under these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The statutory provision that established the 85 percent rule, section 481(b)(6) of the HEA, provides that an eligible proprietary institution must have at least 15 percent of its revenues that ``are not derived from funds provided under this title,'' i.e., title IV of the HEA. Section 481(b)(6) does not differentiate between ``need-based'' title IV, HEA program funds and non-need-based title IV, HEA program funds. However, when determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds derived from FFEL programs or the Federal Direct Loan Program, the institution should only include loan proceeds disbursed to students. It should not include the face amount of a loan because that amount includes loan origination fees and loan guarantee fees that are not disbursed to students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters pointed out problems with the fraction the Secretary proposed to determine whether an institution satisfies the 85 percent rule. The commenters noted that the title IV, HEA program funds in the numerator were reported on an award year basis but the revenues in the denominator were reported on a fiscal year basis. The commenters indicated that when the institution's fiscal year does not coincide with an award year, the computation would not provide reliable results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a number of commenters raised concerns that the information reported in the numerator and denominator would be produced under two different methods of accounting. Several auditing organizations noted that the title IV, HEA program funds must be reported in the numerator on a cash basis of accounting (received). They further noted that the revenue figure in the denominator would be verified through the use of a financial statement audit, and in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting. The commenters concluded that it does not make sense to compare the amount determined in the numerator with the amount determined in the denominator when each number is determined under a different basis of accounting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenters about the deficiencies in the proposed rule and has made the following changes. First, the Secretary agrees that there should be a common reporting period for the numerator and the denominator. The Secretary will not require institutions to change their fiscal year to parallel an award year. Therefore, although the Secretary will be giving up a degree of oversight, the Secretary will allow institutions to use their fiscal year as the reporting period for the numerator as well as the denominator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, since institutions must report and account for title IV, HEA program funds on a cash basis, the institution must also account for revenue in the denominator on a cash basis. Under a cash basis of accounting, the institution reports revenues on the date that the revenues are actually received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An institution's computation must be verified as part of the institution's title IV, HEA program compliance audit or as part of its financial statement audit. The institution may choose which audit will include the verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 600.5 is amended as follows: institutions will report title IV, HEA program funds in the numerator of the fraction set forth in &sect;600.5(d) on a fiscal year basis and that fiscal year will be the same fiscal year used to report revenues in the denominator of that fraction; institutions will report revenues in the denominator on a cash basis of accounting; and institutional computations will be verified in financial statement audits or title IV, HEA program compliance audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that 30 or 60 days after an award year or fiscal year does not provide enough time for an institution to compute its percentage of title IV, HEA program funds because of possible year-end adjustments and because the institution's computation must be verified by the financial audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

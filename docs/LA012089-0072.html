			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ROBERT FRIPP AND HIS CRAFTY LEAGUE AT BOGART'S  </P> <P> For the last four years, Robert Fripp, the innovative guitarist noted for his  work with King Crimson, collaborations with Brian Eno and his own brand of  "Frippertonics," has been conducting seminars and offering courses under the  auspices of the West Virginia-based Guitar Craft Services. According to Fripp,  more than 600 guitarists have taken these courses, many of them playing at one  time or another in his performance group billed as "the League of Crafty  Guitarists."  </P> <P> There might have been only 14 musicians in the version of the League that  played at Bogart's on Wednesday night, but, together with Fripp, they made up  for the other 586. With all musicians maintaining Fripp's passively alert  decorum, the League produced a stimulating, often startling array of voicings.  With several guitarists doubling parts, playing tangent harmonies or utilizing  rhythmic delays, the group had an orchestral timbre, its bass lines sometimes  resembling the stops of a great cathedral organ.  </P> <P> Fripp's music is rooted in European modernism: The compositions generally  bypassed the more familiar guitar formulas (blues/country/rock), producing a  cerebral collage of repetitious minor and augmented runs. At times it had the  feel of harried insects working in a state of advanced anxiety, while other  pieces had the lyrical lilt of complicated Irish jigs. One imagines that if the  rhythms were written out, they'd resemble a sexy form of algebra.  </P> <P> Fripp and company's splendid display of interval hopscotch was techniquely  remarkable, sonically diverting and often just plain beautiful. The League's  Southern California swing was set to continue with shows Thursday at the Coach  House in San Juan Capistrano, tonight at the Japan America Cultural Center in  Los Angeles and Saturday at the Bacchanal in San Diego.

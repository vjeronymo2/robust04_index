During the talks, they  ascertained that they have similar views and the German deputy  foreign minister described allegations of tense Greek-German  relations as rumors.    The two officials discussed the former Yugoslavia,  particularly the Bosnian problem, and the Cyprus issue. Asked  about Skopje, the German deputy minister said Greece and Skopje  should talk to solve their problems. He also supported that  sentimentality, as he described it, should at last be removed  from this issue.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / New-look DTI will 'relate to industry' MR Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, yesterday set in motion plans intended to improve co-operation between government and industry and to provide him with a high-profile role in helping promote trade. The proposals, which Mr Heseltine said would enable the Department of Trade and Industry to relate more closely to industry, entail no additional government funding and no increase in staffing. They met with a qualified welcome from industrialists, who described them as an encouraging first step, but condemnation from Labour, which said they were wholly inadequate. Mr Heseltine's reshaping of the DTI includes the creation of an industrial competitiveness division which will study the performance of competitor countries. It will also aim to ensure that government policy-makers consider the impact of decisions on competitiveness. But Mr Heseltine said he was not interested in fulfilling a 'shopping list' of demands - such as lower electricity prices or improved export credit terms - which industry claims it needs to improve competitiveness. 'Sometimes I will be able to help, sometimes I will not.' Other proposals include the formation of 15 sectoral divisions to establish what Mr Heseltine called 'an informed dialogue and constructive partnership' with their respective industries. Among the industries warranting special attention are chemicals and biotechnology, steel, textiles and retailing, electronics, mechanical engineering, vehicles, aerospace and telecommunications. Others will cover energy, research and development and information technology. The DTI will also open the first of what could become a nationwide series of 'one-stop' shops to advise businesses. Mr Heseltine is understood to be especially keen to see his department help in assembling trade deals, involving British companies and banks, with former eastern bloc countries. Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said of the proposals: 'So far so good. Getting the structure right is important. But industry is more interested in strategy and that must now be Mr Heseltine's priority.' Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the IoD wanted to see how the DTI's sectoral units interpreted their sponsorship role. If they became channels for special pleading and special treatment, industry would be 'on the slippery slope' to an industrial policy which has previously failed. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the plans were 'little more than a reshuffling of desks'.</p>

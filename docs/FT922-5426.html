			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / US criticises India over missile test THE US criticised India yesterday for test firing a medium-range surface-to-surface missile earlier in the day, agencies report from Washington. Missile programmes undermined rather than enhanced security in regions with chronic tensions, it argued. India successfully test-fired the Agni missile, with a range of 1,500 miles, from a military firing range in Chandipur into the Bay of Bengal. The launch was a further display of India's high-technology ambitions and its determination to go ahead with a missile programme despite US pressure. India launched a satellite last week shortly after Washington imposed limited sanctions against the Russian and Indian space organisations. The US objected to Russia's proposed sale of rocket technology which India says is for its space programme.</p>

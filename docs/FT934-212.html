			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Union changes are welcome Sir, Contrary to the assertions contained in your report on the TUC ('Specialist unions warned over merger danger', December 23), I welcomed warmly the TUC general secretary's radical proposals for reforming some of the TUC's structures. I made no comment about the composition and powers of the proposed new executive committee. I did question the very limited time available for consultation within constituent unions. Further, I said all unions, including Unison, would want to be assured there were adequate processes, when required to consider their members' interests. This means, for example, facilities for the TUC to bring together unions representing members in local government and the National Health Service. I am not a dinosaur, I am a wholehearted advocate of radical change. Were that not the case, I would still be general secretary of Nalgo. Alan Jinkinson, general secretary, Unison, 1 Mabledon Place, London WC1H 9AJ</p>

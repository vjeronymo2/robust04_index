			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (c) ATCTs may be occupied above the level of exit discharge by only able-bodied persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) No combustible materials shall be located in, under, or within the immediate vicinity of the ATCT except necessary furniture and equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) High hazard contents shall not be permitted in the ATCT or the immediate vicinity thereof.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) ATCT exits shall be so arranged and maintained as to provide free and unobstructed egress from all parts of the building or structure at all times when it is occupied. No locks or fastening which prevents unimpeded escape from the inside of any building shall be installed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 3. General Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Permissible Means of Egress components. Means of egress shall consist only of the approved components as described in this section. Means of egress shall be constructed as components of the building or shall be permanently affixed thereto.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Headroom. Means of egress shall be so designed and maintained as to provide adequate headroom, but in no case shall the ceiling height be less than 7 feet 6 inches nor any projection from the ceiling be less than 6 feet 8 inches from the floor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Exception:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In existing ATCTs where the headroom is less than that required in this section, signs reading ``Low Clearance'' shall be placed on both sides of the obstruction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Changes in elevation. Where changes in elevation exceed 21 inches in a means of egress, the difference in elevation shall be negotiated by stairs or ramps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Means of egress walking surfaces shall provide sufficient friction to prevent slipping under normal conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Types and Location of Means of Egress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Access to means of egress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Means of egress shall be so located and exit access shall be so arranged that exits are readily discernible and unobstructed at all times.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In no case shall access to an exit be through a bathroom, or other room subject to locking, except where the exit is required to serve only the room subject to locking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Exit access shall be so arranged that it will not be necessary to travel toward any area of hazardous occupancy in order to reach the nearest exit, unless the path of travel is effectively shielded from the high hazard location by suitable partitions or other physical barriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Discharge from exits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All exit discharges shall empty directly to the street, or to a yard, court, or other open space that gives safe access to a public way. The streets to which the exits discharge shall be of width adequate to accommodate all persons leaving the building. Yards, courts, or other open spaces to which exits discharge shall also be of adequate width and size to provide all persons leaving the building with ready access to the street.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The exit discharge shall be so arranged as to make clear the direction of egress to the public way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Exterior ways of exit access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Access to an exit may be by means of any exterior balcony, porch, gallery, or roof that conforms to the requirements of this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Exterior ways of exit access shall have smooth, solid floors, substantially level, and shall have guards on the unenclosed sides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Where accumulation of snow or ice is likely because of the climate, the exterior way of exit access shall be maintained so that these accumulations of snow and ice will be regularly removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A permanent, direct path of travel shall be maintained over the required exterior way of exit access. There shall be no obstruction by railings, barriers, or gates that divide the open space into sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An exterior way of exit access, such as a courtyard, balcony, bridge, or porch shall be so arranged that there are no dead ends in excess of 20 feet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Any gallery, balcony, bridge, porch, or other exterior exit access that projects beyond the outside wall of the building shall comply with the requirements of this section (j.4.(c)) as to width and arrangement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Occupant Load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) ATCTs may have an occupant load of 20 persons per floor and not more than 80 persons total provided that the type of ATCT construction is Type I, II, III, or IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The occupant load shall be the maximum number of persons that may be in the space at any time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Where exits serve more than one floor, only the occupant load of each floor considered individually need be used in computing the capacity of the exits at the floor, provided that exit capacity shall not be decreased in the direction of exit travel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

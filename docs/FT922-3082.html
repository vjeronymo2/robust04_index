			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Full throttle for a turbulent take-off: John Plender on GPA, the aircraft-leasing company, ahead of its flotation Such is the complexity of the business of GPA Group, the world's largest aircraft-leasing concern, that a flotation would have posed problems at the best of times. As it is, the the worldwide sale of nearly 30 per cent of the enlarged ordinary share capital of this unusual company coincides with massive oversupply in the aircraft market and a shortage of credit for aircraft purchasers. The combined placing power of Nomura, Yamaichi, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers, Schroders, BZW, Swiss Bank Corporation, plus further supporting cast, will no doubt propel GPA off the ground. Depending on the striking price, which will be fixed at between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12.50 by the global co-ordinator Nomura International when all the applications are in, the group will be capitalised at up to Dollars 3.56bn (Pounds 1.94bn). Yet many mainstream investment institutions remain uneasy about this Shannon-based phenomenon, which is making no profit or dividend forecast two and a half months into its financial year. A stampede is unlikely in London before Tuesday's final deadline for UK and Irish applications for the shares. This may seem a mite ungenerous to the company and its founder Mr Tony Ryan. For an outfit that leases aircraft to predominantly Third World customers to have declared only a marginal reduction in profits from Dollars 281m to Dollars 279m (Pounds 152m) last year is a remarkable tribute to the resourcefulness of the management and just 317 employees. Nor are the frequent comparisons made between GPA's business and computer leasing very relevant. The risk of sudden obsolescence, which was the ruin of Atlantic Computers, is less worrying in a heavily regulated industry with long lead times like aircraft manufacturing. GPA's fleet consists chiefly of modern aircraft whose second hand values have held up better than those of older craft in the present market slump. That said, the strain of keeping the show on the road in difficult times is writ large across the offer document. Even allowing for the fact that GPA's international share offer has had to satisfy the tough requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for cautionary statements, the caveats are formidable. The first question mark that hangs over GPA is: how does a company with net assets of less than Dollars 2bn and borrowings of more than twice that level finance aircraft orders of Pounds 11.9bn over the rest of the decade, rising to Pounds 20.9bn if options are thrown in? The offer document bluntly states that: 'there can be no assurance . . . that adequate sources of capital will be available to fund the group's aircraft commitments'; 'the directors believe that there is limited scope for the company to arrange additional syndicated credit facilities with commercial banks'; and the decline in the number of aircraft sold last year reflects 'the relative lack of finance available for purchasers in such transactions'. Against that background the directors have only been able to say that bank and other credit facilities are enough to fund the group's requirements to June 30 1993. It is an uncomfortable fact that GPA's very rapid profits growth from Dollars 107m to Dollars 279m in the five years to March 1992 (see chart) owed much to a climate of easy credit. In the present credit squeeze the group has shifted the financing emphasis from the banking system to the markets. Not only has it issued debt and commercial paper across the world; it has even sold future amounts receivable on operating leases. The picture that emerges is one of hand-to-mouth financing - this after the cancellation and rescheduling of aircraft deliveries on undisclosed terms. The profit and loss account is under similar pressure. GPA derives its revenues from two main sources. One is leasing aircraft to airlines, which then pay GPA the equivalent of rent. The other is the sale of aircraft to groups of investors from whom GPA then leases the aircraft back before granting a sublease to an airline that operates the plane. A further 15 per cent of sales proceeds comes from sales direct to airlines. Continuing aircraft sales are essential in providing part of the cash flow to meet future capital commitments. On the leasing side the number of non-revenue earning aircraft in the fleet has gone up to more than 10 per cent of the total and lease rates are weak because of the difficult trading conditions in aviation. Margins have declined, as they have on aircraft sales, in the past year. A number of airlines which have leased aircraft from GPA are in , eight lessees were deferring payments for rent, maintenance and fees. Meantime the formal documents state that the problems of America West Airlines, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US and has 16 of GPA's A320 aircraft on sublease, could lead to a significant loss. This tale of woe is accompanied by a statement that the directors believe that these unfavourable trading conditions will continue at least until the end of the current financial year next March. This brings us to the question of the quality of earnings. GPA's leasing operations last year accounted for nearly 30 per cent of gross profits; but in reality the contribution is higher, because all the cost of interest, depreciation and certain taxes are charged to leasing. None are charged to aircraft sales, the biggest source of revenue, which last year accounted for 57 per cent of gross profit. In effect GPA is a financial intermediary between the aircraft manufacturers and the world's smaller airlines. By buying from manufacturers in bulk it takes the equivamakes a turn when it sells to investors or airlines at close to market value. But in buying aircraft, it exposes itself to several risks other than just credit risk. One is that airlines will not come forward to lease aircraft when GPA takes delivery. Another is that GPA sometimes takes on a longer head lease from the investors with whom it conducts sale and leaseback transactions than the sub-lease it extends to the airline. That is to say, there is a mismatch between the period over which GPA makes payments to the investors and the much shorter period in which revenues are receivable from the airline. In the year to March 1993 the company still has to find lessees for no less than 115 aircraft. In 1994 the figure is not much less at 97. No small challenge in present conditions. The striking feature of GPA's profits from aircraft sales, which are inevitably of lower quality than leasing revenue because of their inherent one-off nature, is that they are extremely lumpy. The offer document reveals that sales proceeds tend to derive largely from a single country or market in any given year. In 1990, for example, the single sale to investors of 12 Airbus A320s that were on operating leases with Braniff of the US, whose subsequent bankruptcy cost GPA Dollars 110m in provisions, accounted for 31 per cent of all sales revenue that year. The accountancy, though perfectly legitimate, is less than conservative. GPA takes all the profit on sale and leaseback deals up front, instead of spreading the profit over the term of the operating lease. In some sales it remains at risk in relation to the aircrafts' residual value because it guarantees to make good any shortfall on a subsequent sale by investors against stipulated values. No problem at today's values, but what might happen in future? The sales are driven, in part, by opportunities for tax avoidance, which governments are often seeking to plug. Investors are also sensitive to the fact that aircraft in the early stages of their product life are prone to developmental problems and tend to have more limited appeal for airlines than established aircraft. GPA's future orders contain a significant number of Airbus A-320s, Fokker 100s and McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, which fall into that category and may thus present placement difficulties in the short and medium term. GPA's response to questions about the sustainability of profits from aircraft sales is that it is constantly finding new ways of turning aircraft into financial assets for investors. Its final public offer document, published last week, reveals that it is close to selling 14 aircraft for Dollars 500m, equivalent to 44 per cent of last year's aircraft sales revenue, to a fund in which a single US institutional investor has taken a Dollars 100m equity stake, with the remaining money coming from public and private debt issues and placements, with GPA providing Dollars 50m-70m itself. Another such fund is planned shortly. As far as the growing importance of newer aircraft in the order book is concerned, the management argues that its skill lies precisely in judging what investors and airlines will want many years ahead. The threefold growth in net attributable profits over the past five years lends strength to that assertion. As for the current trading problems in leasing, the company takes substantial security in the aircraft that it leases to airlines. It also identifies and addresses problems early by working closely with its clients and an effective marketing network around the world means that GPA it is adept at placing aircraft with other airlines. The fact that its profits have held up so well is a measure of the management's fleetness of foot in dealing with problems. The trouble is that GPA is now of a size where this fast footwork is becoming harder to sustain, especially in adverse conditions. And there are big penalties if the growth machine goes into reverse. Under the purchase agreements with aircraft manufacturers GPA has to repay Dollars 72m of discounts and credits if it fails to take delivery of further aircraft under existing contracts. If investors' confidence in GPA's ability to find new lessees for their planes ever waned, future financing would become a nightmare. Tony Ryan and his team deserve all credit for their past achievements. But this is a high risk share issue that private investors would do well to shun, even on a maximum price-earnings ratio of 11.8. Many British institutions, meantime, will be happy to give it a wide berth and leave the Japanese to make the running.</p>

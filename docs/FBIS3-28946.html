			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yun Kuk-han: "North Korea's Moves To </F> Introduce `Chinese-Style' Opening"]    [Text] Concerning the visit to China by Hwang Chang-yop,  secretary of the North Korean Workers Party and chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly,  observers have recently affirmed that North Korea will soon  officially declare the introduction of Chinese-style opening  policy.    Such observation has persuasive power because of the fact  that toward the end of last year North Korea finalized laws  pertaining to opening up, including the law on lease of land and  the foreign investment law, and that President Kim Il-song  emphasized the trade-first policy in his New Year address.    The North Korean nuclear issue, which has been blocking  external cooperation up to now, still remains unsolved. However,  with the possibility of the resolution of the problem during the  first half of the year, the people will pay attention to North  Korea's moves toward opening up. In fact, North Korea was  reported to have been suffering from economic difficulties,  including negative growth, during the past three years. As the  result, it is likely that North Korea will inevitably take steps  for economic revitalization in any form, even for the sake of  maintaining its political system. President Kim unusually  admitted the failure in the third Seven Year Plan during the  21st Plenary Session of the sixth party Central Committee last  year.    Under these circumstances, North Korea dispatched Hwang  Chang-yop, one of the real power holders within the government,  to Beijing with a view to improving relations with China and to  grasping the real situation of Chinese-style reform. It is  believed that he visited China so that North Korea could review  its own opening up.    During his stay in China for eight days, from 15 to 22  January, Hwang Chang-yop intensively toured Zhuhai's special  economic district, an agricultural science research institute,  plants, enterprises and other major industrial facilities in  Guangdong Province.    The government-operated Beijing broadcast reported that in  meeting with Hwang Chang-yop, Chinese President Jiang Zemin  explained the reform and opening implemented by China and on  successes in socialist market economy, and that Hwang praised  the achievements made by China in building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. It was also learned that before and  after Hwang's visit to China, North Korea sent a group of  economic experts to special economic districts and other areas  in China in a bid to grasp the practical situation there.    Concerning such moves by North Korea, Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK  ambassador to China, revealed that "North Korea recently sent a  number of people to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen,  to personally learn from Chinese-style reform and opening by  touring the actual sites and spots. Thus, something appears to  be changing in North Korea."    North Korea also seems to be interested in economic  cooperation with many nations in Asia, other than China, that  have grown rapidly in recent years. Amid this situation, Kim  Chong-u, vice chairman of the External Economic Commission, who  is actually leading the economic opening up, revealed early this  month North Korea's willingness to join the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation. Kim Chong-u toured Singapore, Thailand,  Hong Kong and Vietnam last year. All these moves show that North  Korea is seeking economic cooperation with other countries.    Experts in North Korean affairs note that North Korea  already  expressed its will to open up during the Sixth Party Congress in  1980. That time, President Kim expressed for the first time the  will to expand exchanges with capitalist countries. According to  this, North Korea formulated the Joint Venture Law in 1984 and  actively attempted to induce foreign capital. However, since its  efforts were not successful, North Korea began to show interest  in Chinese-style opening up through special economic zones in  the nineties. In the earlier stage, North Korea believed that  Chinese-style economic opening up would destroy the socialist  political system at last. Therefore, North Korea tried to  distance itself from it. However, seeing the economic  development successes in the special zones in China and that the  political system remained intact, North Korea seemed to have  changed its mind.    This can be noted from the fact that President Kim Il-song  and then Premier Yon Hyong-muk made consecutive tours to special  economic zones in China in October 1991. In December of the same  year, North Korea officially designated Najin and Sonbong in  North Hamgyong Province as "free economic trade zone" as decided  by the Administration Council.    President Kim Il-song openly expressed his interest in and  support for China's economic reform during the events marking  the 9 September holiday [DPRK founding anniversary] last year.    Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Asian-Pacific Peace  Foundation  in the ROK, said that "North Korea, finally realizing that there  is a road for economic development even by maintaining the  socialist system, is advancing along this road." Thus, he  stressed that North Korea has already begun to implement the  policy of Chinese-style opening up.    North Korea is expected to attain the increase in employment  and growth in the light industry through opening up and, thus,  to upgrade the people's standard of living by revitalizing its  stagnant economy.    On the other hand, it is likely that North Korea, while  operating special economic zones in the district far away from  the central area like China does, will apply laws and  regulations pertaining to opening up only to these special zones  so that the wind of reform will not influence other areas.    The prevailing consideration is that North Korea, with not  as  vast land and as large population as China's, may be able to  prevent the wind of reform from expanding on a short-term basis.  However, overall opening up of the entire society will be  inevitable in the long run.</p>

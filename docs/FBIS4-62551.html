			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and Pavel </F> Spirin]    [Text] Beijing May 14 TASS -- Russian State Duma Chairman  Ivan Rybkin called for strengthening Russian-Chinese relations.    "I am confident that Russia will overcome the crisis in its  development. Boosting interaction with China will become one of  the factors facilitating the quest for ways to improve the  situation in the region," Rybkin said at a meeting with Chinese  Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi.    Rybkin is in China on an official visit.    "We are bound to live together by destiny and must  supplement  each other through close cooperation for our mutual benefit,"  Rybkin said. Russia is going through radical transformation and  has serious interest in Chinese reforms, he said.    The Russian leadership is determined to continue "serious  work in the interests of strengthening bilateral relations."  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit is  viewed as part of this policy, Rybkin said.    Qiao Shi shared his words, adding that "China and Russia are  neighbours. We value good neighbourly and friendly relations  between the two countries which were not easy to establish."    He pointed out that China's policy aims at developing  friendly relations with all countries, including Russia, on the  basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Qiao Shi  expressed the hope that bilateral cooperation between Russia and  China will expand and grow.    Rybkin invited Qiao Shi to visit Russia.    He also met with Deputy Chinese Foreign Minister Tian Zenpei  who confirmed that relations with Russia are one of the  priorities of the Chinese foreign policy. He noted that the two  countries have similar positions on many issues.    Speaking about recent hearings in the State Duma on  Russian-Chinese relations, the Chinese diplomat said that Duma  factions have close positions on relations with China, despite  disagreements over other matters.    He said the Chinese Foreign Ministry stands for further  development and strengthening of relations between the Russian  and Chinese parliaments.</p>

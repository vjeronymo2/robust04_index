			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP / ROCK  </P> <P> Janet Jackson Good for Kids: Janet Jackson's latest album "Rhythm Nation 1814"  is among the children's books and entertainment products commended by the  quarterly magazine Parents' Choice. The magazine issues annual awards for  books, toys, videos, rock albums, computer programs, television shows and  magazines considered of high value to kids. "The aim is to help lead mothers  and fathers to holiday purchases that have glamour and good sense,"  editor-in-chief Diana Huss Green said. "Trends this year indicate toy, video,  book manufacturers are reflecting society's and parents' concerns about  children." The list ranges from the classics of children's entertainment --  like the Disney Channel presentation of "Great Expectations" -- to newcomers  such as Jackson. ABC's "The Wonder Years" and the Home Box Office presentation  of "Babar" were among the television programs cited. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Seoul calls for peace at Hyundai SOUTH KOREAN officials yesterday appealed for an end to escalating labour disputes at Hyundai, the nation's largest business conglomerate, which threaten to derail the government's economic recovery programme. A partial walkout that began more than two weeks ago at Hyundai Precision, a container and jeep manufacturer, has since spread to six other Hyundai companies located at the group's huge industrial complex in Ulsan. Among the subsidiaries affected by the production slowdown is Hyundai Motor, Korea's largest car maker. Workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, the nation's biggest shipyard, are threatening to join the industrial action this week. The well-organised trade unions at Hyundai have usually set the pace for labour negotiations throughout the country in past years. Government officials fear that widespread industrial action at Hyundai, including the possibility of full-scale strikes or lockouts by the end of the week, could spread to other industrial groups and end the government's attempt to curb wage growth this year. Sharp rises in wages over the past five years, which have averaged almost 20 per cent annually, have seriously harmed the country's competitiveness. Prospects for wage moderation initially appeared encouraging this year. In an unprecedented accord in April, the Korea Employers' Federation and the Korea Federation of Trade Unions agreed to limit wage growth to between 4.7 and 8.9 per cent against 16 per cent in 1992. This coincided with a sttep fall in labour disputes during the first five months of 1993. But the number of industrial disputes has risen sharply this month. Vehicles are one of Korea's leading exports, with Hyundai Motors normally accounting for two-thirds of such shipments abroad.</p>

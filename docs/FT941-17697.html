			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Hopes of glory, fears of blood: As South Africa's elections approach, Patti Waldmeir takes the pulse of supporters of three different camps We could not immediately see Isandlwana, as we bumped along the dirt road, admiring the conical peaks and vast blue-green plains of northern Natal, and imagining the great Zulu impi (war party) which spilled so much British blood here in 1879. Then we saw them, descendents of the Isandlwana victors, dressed for urban battle: 10,000 Zulus in street clothes, carrying assegais (spears), knobkerries (clubs) and shields, the same weapons which humbled the British empire, used now to spill blood on township battlefields. Last month, at the site of their people's greatest military victory, Zulus heard King Goodwill Zwelithini bemoan the Zulu nation's darkest hour. Using the imagery of 19th century colonialism, King Goodwill warned of a new invasion of Zululand, not by a mighty foreign monarch, but by fellow Africans - many of them Zulus - from the African National Congress. The King, flanked by his uncle, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, called on them to 'let the valour and the honour that led to the defeat of the British in this place in 1879, rise up to claim Zulu warriors'. 'Resist, I command you, resist I implore you,' he urged the crowd, which radiated menace. 'We will not be ruled over by a constitution that we spurn. We will not be subjugated by a political party which wants to destroy us simply because it wants to rule.' Those who underestimate the power of Zulu nationalism - among them, it sometimes seems, the government and the ANC - would have done well to wander among the assegais and the knobkerries at Isandlwana. For these will be the weapons of the forthcoming election campaign, as much as the posters and the TV adverts and the candidates' debates. And these are the people who could stop elections altogether in parts of Natal and the East Rand townships of Johannesburg, unless they can be persuaded to accept the new constitution. It was a sobering image for 1994. This will be the year of South Africa's greatest glory - the first all-race elections in history, to be held on April 27. But it will probably also be the year of the worst-ever violence, as electoral passion inspires political rivals to new heights of brutality. Since apartheid's death knell was struck in 1990, some 13,000 people have died in political violence. In the latest incident, four people were shot dead and five wounded in a Cape Town bar on Thursday night. It is probably unavoidable that thousands more will perish next year, whatever the electoral outcome. Yet the ANC dismisses the Isandlwana spirit, convinced that Chief Buthelezi is a paper tiger who will crumple once his KwaZulu black homeland is deprived of both central government funding and the more nefarious support which they believe is provided by South Africa's security forces. And the ruling National party, erstwhile ally of the Chief, has thrown in its lot so irrevocably with the ANC that it too seems to downplay his importance. 'They are going to share power with the ANC. That's all they care about,' said an angry official in Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party recently. 'They won't let anything else get in the way of that. They want to humiliate us.' In truth, it is easy to offend Zulu pride, especially that of Chief Buthelezi. But after decades spent stoking the fires of Zulu nationalism, he has created a force to be reckoned with - and not, as one government minister suggested after a recent round of talks with Inkatha, by 'brute force'. Force can deal with the lunatic fringes of politics, but not with a party that probably commands a large chunk of support among the 7m Zulus in Natal and elsewhere - not a majority, though polls are unreliable - as well as a growing share among whites. South Africans must hope that the new year brings a political settlement with Inkatha; the success of the elections depends on it. * * * Natal is strewn with battlefields, whether from the last century or the last week; and on the day of the Isandlwana celebrations, South Africa's other great dissenting force, the white right wing, gathered to commemorate another Natal battle. At Blood River, some 40km across the eroded plains of Zululand, rightwing Afrikaners celebrated the quintessential victory of white over black in South Africa, the 1838 triumph of 400-odd Afrikaner voortrekkers (pioneers) over a Zulu force that swells with the telling, but probably totalled 10,000. This was the great victory of right over might, of Christianity over barbarism, of Europe over Africa. For conservative Afrikaner leaders, it has great resonance with the present battle: Afrikaners are vastly outnumbered by blacks; they believe they are fighting for Christian values against communism; and they think they can get God on their side by vowing a new commitment to a Christian lifestyle weakened by intervening decades of affluence and power. Gen Constand Viljoen, the retired army chief who addressed the volk at Blood River on that day, had planned to make a guest appearance at Isandlwana, to demonstrate the fearful might of a united Boer-Zulu front. He says practicalities prevented him from doing so; the real reason is probably not that simple. But even if Blood River did not come to Isandlwana, the union of rightwing Afrikaners and Zulus is surely the stuff of peace-loving South Africans' worst nightmares. Few think Inkatha and the rightwing white parties could fight an election campaign together (they recently formed a strategic front, the Freedom Alliance, but share few common policies); but if they choose instead to fight against the poll, unity would be easier and the threat to elections grave indeed. Not surprisingly, much ANC strategic thinking seems to be focused on ways to split the Freedom Alliance, so far without success. Even on its own, the white right wing poses a grave threat during the campaign. Not that it commands large numbers - the crowd at Blood River was perhaps one-tenth of that at Isandlwana, and its mood was several times less belligerent - but that its members are heavily armed, well trained (by the South African military, which forced all white men to do military service), and experienced in warfare. Last April, it pushed South Africa to the verge of the abyss by arranging the assassination of ANC guerrilla leader, Chris Hani. A few more well-timed murders would seriously jeopardise stability. Although the ANC despises Inkatha, it openly fears the white right. Here again, divide and conquer seems to capture the essence of ANC strategy: its leaders have been working hard at negotiations with the more moderate faction of the right to give them what they can call an Afrikaner homeland, or volkstaat. This is a bit of semantic chicanery from the ANC, which continues to use the word volkstaat while intending to offer no more than limited local autonomy for Afrikaners - not the independent ethnic state the word would imply. They know they will lose the hard right in the end; but the longer they talk, the less time the right has to mobilise against elections. * * * Hundreds of miles away in Soweto, on the same December day, Fred Khumalo, an elderly man from Alexandra township, marched proudly in the uniform of the guerrilla army to which he has dedicated his life: Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of the Nation, the ANC force. The previous day, at a shebeen (beer hall) in one of Alexandra's desperately poor streets, Mr Khumalo expressed his fears about the ANC 'self-defence units' in the township, to one of which he belongs. Criminal elements had infiltrated the SDUs, and some had run out of control. Some SDUs were working closely with police; but others were a threat to peace in a township that has struggled back from the brink of anarchy to something like calm. Elections will provide renegade SDUs with the ideal atmosphere for mayhem. In many areas, they will prevent campaigning by rival parties altogether, to the disadvantage of parties such as the National party and the liberal Democratic party, which need to extend their support base to blacks if they are to survive in the new South Africa. Perhaps Mr Khumalo should be given the last word in this survey of gloom, from Isandlwana to Alexandra via Blood River. 'I have no bitterness, I don't hate whites,' he told me, with emotion in his voice and a pleading sincerity in his eyes. He said how much he was looking forward to the elections. Even if they are only partly free and fair, they will mark a great day for South Africa. Black South Africans have waited centuries for this.</p>

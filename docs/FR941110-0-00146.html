			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;It correlates, to a greater extent than in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, specific enforcement categories from which an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement response must be selected with specified degrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It can be applied to physical environment deficiencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as to all others, and it should relieve commenters'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fears that resident rights violations and physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment deficiencies could not be considered as serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Providers will have a clearer idea of the enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences they could be subject to for specific degrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of noncompliance because, in &sect;488.408, we have correlated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement categories with levels of noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of these remedy categories will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide regulatory guidance to HCFA and the States in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selecting remedies and will necessitate that States and HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly define the seriousness of cited deficiencies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to select an appropriate remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have not accepted any of the commenters' proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions to the scope and severity scales for inclusion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the modified enforcement scheme in this final rule. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing the proposals, we concluded that, while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminology may have been different, all of the proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were conceptually the same as the scales that were published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule. In addition, those commenting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided no evidence (for example, success data)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to indicate that their respective proposed enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems would be more effective than the scales we published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule. We, therefore, have not adopted any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the commenters' proposals in place of the enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model we are presenting in this final rule. In addition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equally noteworthy, we spent considerable time meeting with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various groups representing the nursing home industry, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies and consumer organizations to discuss and seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input on the various approaches to restructure and refocus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey and enforcement processes. The resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach was presented in the notice of proposed rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as in what has been carried over into this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to concerns that repeated 1&hyph;1 deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (now referred to as isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for minimum harm) would be hard to monitor on subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys, we note that, while such deficiencies are not cited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the official deficiency statement and are not sanctioned,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their existence is maintained in the official provider file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along with the official deficiency statement. The separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing of these deficiencies is also accessible to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveying agency and disclosable to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While we intend that the enforcement scheme provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal guidance to States and to HCFA, we are including it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the regulations to provide the public, and particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated facilities and facility residents, with full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure as to how enforcing agencies will determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate remedies for providers that have been found out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of compliance with Federal participation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted a remedy to be imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for insufficient nurse staffing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The law requires that nursing homes meet all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirements. Should noncompliance with nurse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staffing requirements be identified, either during an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended survey or when a waiver of RN and/or licensed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing staffing has been requested or granted, the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be subject to an enforcement response from HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State, just as it would be for other instances of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters wanted to remove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinction between initial and secondary factors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.404 (proposed at &sect;488.208) believing that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary criteria are equally important as the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOXING LIFEGUARD ARMIJO RETURNS TO IRVINE RING AGAINST DURHAM  </P> <P> Middleweight John Armijo, a lifeguard from Huntington Beach, will fight for the  first time after a five-month layoff in tonight's main event of the monthly  boxing program at the Irvine Marriott.  </P> <P> Armijo defeated Robert Jackson May 24 to improve to 10-0-1 but suffered a cut  above his eye in training soon after and has been off since. Armijo will fight  Vinson Durham of Los Angeles in an eight-round bout. Durham is 6-2 and probably  the best opposition Armijo will have faced.  </P> <P> The first of six scheduled bouts starts at 7:30 p.m. Tickets, priced at $30,  $25 and $20, go on sale today at 10 a.m. in the hotel ballroom.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Sukhumi braced against attack: Georgian troops on alert as refugees flee Abkhazian capital REFUGEES were last night streaming out of Sukhumi, capital of the autonomous republic of Abkhazia in Georgia, as Georgian forces prepared to defend it against an all-out attack on the town. At battlelines just five miles north of the city the two sides exchanged gun fire. The panicky exodus continued as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, warned that the ethnic clashes in the region could become full-scale war. The official Itar-Tass news agency reported that Mr Yeltsin had agreed to talks next Tuesday on a warship off Sukhumi with Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia's leader, and Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, Abkhazian president. Abkhazia is attempting to secede from Georgia, although Abkhazians make up less than 20 per cent of the region's 500,000-strong population. The Georgian government is reinforcing positions around the Black Sea town, once a coveted vacation spot, in an effort to hold it against the Abkhazian forces, which have been swelled by volunteers from the North Caucasus region of the Russian federation. Georgia's military say that detachments of the Russian army using the latest T-80 tanks flown into the nearby base of Gudauta are also fighting on the Abkhazian side. Crowds mainly of women and children besiege the few aircraft which leave each day. The airport was bombed on Tuesday and a radar ship was reported damaged by shells in Sukhumi harbour early yesterday morning. The refugees wait in crowds around the runway, carrying a few personal possessions. Many claim to have been waiting up to three days. Some people were also leaving by small boats until bad weather closed that route yesterday. Mr Shevarnadze, the sole candidate for the post of parliamentary chairman in elections due to be held on Sunday, is under growing pressure to stem the tide of military defeat. In the past three days he has increasingly blamed 'reactionary circles' in Russia for fomenting war in Georgia and for interfering on the side of the Abkhazians in their bid to secede. But a Russian Foreign Ministry official was quoted by Tass newsagency yesterday as saying that Russian forces were observing strict neutrality. The small, 5m-strong former Soviet republic is now gripped with a war fever as young men throng the airport in Tbilisi, the capital, carrying rifles en route to the front. This has pushed all other issues in the election to the background - including the deepening economic crisis and the progressive breakdown of services and supplies. Mr Zurab Zhvania, a member of the ruling state council and leader of the Green party, said: 'It is absolutely certain that the Russians are trying to take Abkhazia for themselves and they are using the North Caucasian peoples who want access to the sea.' He and other Georgian politicians believe Mr Yeltsin - who warned last weekend that he would protect the Russians in Georgia and has assigned the guarding of the main railway line in Georgia to the Russian army - is now under the influence of 'imperialist' army commanders who are attempting to win back much of the former Soviet territory. Mr Levan Indrava, an influential figure in Georgian politics and an aide to Mr Shevardnadze, said that 'Yeltsin has given us an ultimatum but when he is no longer president of Russia he will be nothing. Shevardnadze is a world figure.' Tajikistan, Page 6</p>

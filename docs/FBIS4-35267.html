			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Ministry Secretary General Zafir al-Hasan  today summoned the ambassadors of the United States, Russia,  France, Britain, and China for consultations on Lebanon's call  for a UN Security Council [UNSC] meeting to discuss Israel's  kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani.    Al-Hasan said Lebanon's decision to request a Security  Council meeting will not await a response by the five big  powers. He explained that Lebanon's Permanent Representative to  the UN Khalil Makkawi has been instructed to call for a meeting  without specifying a date for it.    After the meeting, Russian Ambassador Gennadiy Ilichev said  he will convey Lebanon's request to his government for a  decision. U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley denied that he knows  anything about U.S efforts to discourage Lebanon from calling  for a UN Security Council meeting.</p>

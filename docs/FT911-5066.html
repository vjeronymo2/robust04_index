			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Threat by Scots TUC over training THE FIRST extensive union boycott of the government's employer-led training framework was in prospect yesterday when unions threatened to withdraw co-operation with training bodies in Scotland unless they were given a greater say in running them. The vote at the Scottish Trades Union Congress indicated that the Labour party might face conflict with unions about representation on Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales, and Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) in Scotland. A boycott of Lecs, and of the two training umbrella bodies, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, would involve the first clash between the government and unions about training since the abolition of the Manpower Services Commission in 1988. The tripartite MSC was abolished by Sir Norman Fowler, the former employment secretary, after unions failed to co-operate fully with the introduction of the government's Employment Training (ET) scheme for unemployed adults. Sir Norman followed up the abolition of the MSC by setting up the 82 Tecs and 22 Lecs. A majority of members of both Tec and Lec boards are private-sector chief executives, and no representation is automatically guaranteed to unions. The STUC in Dundee passed a resolution calling for Lecs to be made 'more democratic and accountable' and saying that, if union representation was not improved within a year, a proposal to boycott the framework should be drawn up. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the Nalgo public-service union, said that only four Lecs had accepted an STUC nominee. 'The sad, short history of this affair has amounted to a hefty kick in the teeth for the Scottish trade union movement,' he said. Mr Jinkinson said that he hoped Labour would keep Tecs and Lecs 'in name alone'. He said that unions should be demanding that 'as social partners, employers and trade unions are treated equally and Lecs are accountable to local needs'. Labour has said that it wants to keep the Lecs and the Lec framework, but Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, has not defined whether unions would be given a statutory right to membership of the boards. STUC leaders yesterday appeared to have avoided a debate on union representation on company boards by excluding a reference to the subject from a motion on the Scottish economy for debate tomorrow.</p>

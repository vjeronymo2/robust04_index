On the same day, NBD consented to the entry of a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (the ``Final Judgment''), without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commission's complaint except as to jurisdiction. The Final Judgment enjoins NBD from further violations of Regulation U. The Final Judgment requires that NBD disgorge $2,500, which represents its gross custodian services fees earned on Sendo's accounts. In addition, the Final Judgment requires NBD to pay a civil money penalty of $100,000. The Final Judgment also requires NBD to adopt internal procedures designed to prevent a recurrence of the violative conduct. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants have been advised by the trustees of the Funds and by Washington National that (a) the trustees of the Funds and the directors of Washington National have reviewed the circumstances pertinent to the Final Judgment, and, in the case of the Funds, have considered the prior services rendered to the Funds by NBD; and (b) after review and consideration of such factors as they deemed appropriate, a majority of the trustees of the Woodward Funds who are not interested persons with respect to applicants, a majority of the trustees of Renaissance Assets Trust who are not interested persons with respect to applicants, and the directors of Washington National have determined that the retention of NBD in the case of the Funds and of NBD Bank in the case of Washington National as investment adviser is in the best interests of the Funds' shareholders and the account holders of the Separate Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In making the application, applicants acknowledge, understand, and agree that the application and any temporary exemption issued by the Commission shall be without prejudice to the Commission's consideration of any application for exemptions from statutory requirements, including the consideration of the instant application for a permanent exemption pursuant to section 9(c) or the revocation or removal of any temporary exemption granted in connection with the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants seek a permanent order exempting applicants and their affiliates from the provisions of section 9(a) of the Act solely with respect to the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 9(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, disqualifies any person or company from serving or acting in the capacity of employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor of any registered investment company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company, registered unit investment trust, or registered face amount certificate company if such person, or an affiliated person of such person, has, by reason of misconduct, been permanently or temporarily enjoined by an order, judgment, or decree from any court of competent jurisdiction from acting as an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.3. Section 9(c) provides that the Commission shall grant an application for an exemption from the disqualification provisions of section 9(a), either unconditionally or on an appropriate temporary or other conditional basis, if it is established that these provisions, as applied to the applicant, are unduly or disproportionately severe or that the conduct of the applicant has been such as not to make it against the public interest or protection of investors to grant such application.4. As a result of the Final Judgment, NBD and its affiliated persons are subject to the disqualification provisions of section 9(a). Applicants assert that the application of such provisions to applicants is unduly and disproportionately severe. Applicants further assert that NBD's conduct has been such as not to make it against the public interest or protection of investors to grant the requested relief. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

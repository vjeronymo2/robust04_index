			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOTE YES ON MEASURE M: TAX IS WORTH THE BENEFITS  </P> <P> Those who drive around Orange County don't need a public opinion poll to tell  them what they already know: traffic is terrible. Measure M, on the ballot Nov.  7, would provide $3.1 billion over 20 years -- financed by a half-cent sales  tax -- to begin to alleviate the bumper-to-bumper traffic that mars the county  as a place to live and work. We support the measure.  </P> <P> A half-cent increase would raise the current sales tax to 6 1/2 cents per  dollar and cost the average consumer $50 to $75 per year -- not an  insignificant amount. But when weighed against the benefits, it seems well  worth it.  </P> <P> The measure would earmark 42% of the money for freeway improvements and most of  the rest for regional, transit and other road improvements. Among the projects  are speeding completion of the Santa Ana Freeway widening, rebuilding the El  Toro "Y" interchange of the Santa Ana and the San Diego freeways, building a  220-mile network of "super-streets," expanding rail service and coordinating  traffic signals, and adding lanes to stretches of Interstate 5 and the  Riverside, Orange and Costa Mesa freeways.  </P> <P> It sounds like a wish list for every weary traveler in the county.  </P> <P> The Yes on Measure M campaign, backed by developers to the tune of $1 million,  has the unanimous support of the Board of Supervisors. But, surprisingly, the  measure has also drawn support from several prominent slow-growth advocates who  usually find themselves on the opposite side of the board and developers. This  is primarily because the measure also would require cities to adopt  growth-management plans. There is little organized opposition.  </P> <P> Currently, 11 counties in California have half-cent sales taxes for  transportation, including every county contiguous to Orange County except for  San Bernardino, which now has a similar tax before voters.  </P> <P> Orange Countians soundly defeated a one-cent tax increase for transportation in  1984. A poll conducted for The Times Orange County Edition late last year found  that people are very skeptical of government's ability to use the money wisely.  </P> <P> But now, traffic is even worse and people's frustration levels are higher. And  surely we realize that in these battened-down days, the billions of dollars  needed to begin to have an impact on traffic are not sitting around unspent.  The money must come from somewhere. And the support of slow-growth leaders  indicates that Measure M has met one important standard that residents said  they wanted if they provide new tax money for transportation -- strict growth  management.  </P> <P> A half-cent sales tax increase, while unpleasant, seems the least painful way  to finance these vitally needed transportation improvements.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Ministry of Defense; place and </F> date not given]    [Text] Rwandan men and women, the Armed Forces once again  announce that, following the death of the head of state,  security has been disrupted, particularly in Kigali. This was  mainly caused by some soldiers who escaped from their barracks  in anger to attack and harm people.    The Armed Forces cannot tolerate such shameful criminal  acts.  That is why they hastened to do everything possible to maintain  security. At the same time, they searched for and arrested the  criminals so that by yesterday evening, this reckless behavior  had subsided.    The Armed Forces once again urge the people to be vigilant  and to help them stop the wrongdoers.    The other issue they are informing people about is that the  Rwandan Patriotic Front soldiers who were staying at Kimihurura  Parliament building left the building and launched an attack on  the Presidential Guard barracks. Their attack was repulsed.  They also launched other attacks in Remera district, near the  national stadium, and at King Faysal Hospital [word indistinct].    Rwandan men and women, as you can see, security has not been  properly restored, but the country's Armed Forces are doing  everything possible to protect those in trouble. You are also  requested to support the Armed Forces so that they can continue  to maintain security. Stay alert.</p>

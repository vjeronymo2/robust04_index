			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS SIGN TONY SLATON TO ONE-YEAR CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Rams got another offensive lineman into camp Saturday when reserve  center-guard Tony Slaton agreed to a one-year contract.  </P> <P> Slaton's signing eased a major concern for Ram Coach John Robinson, who  appeared headed into the exhibition season with a makeshift offensive line. But  the signing of Slaton and left tackle Irv Pankey this weekend gives the Rams  three starters and a top backup in Slaton.  </P> <P> To make room for Pankey, the team released Thor Salanoa, a linebacker from BYU.  They must make room for Slaton today.  </P></p>

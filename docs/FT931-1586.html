			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Energy users look for cut in costs INTENSIVE energy users are hoping the white paper will encourage moves that would enable them to bypass the electricity wholesale pool and to reduce their electricity costs. On Monday the British Management Data Association, an independent organisation backed by 25 companies, presented a proposal to ministers that the association says would provide British Coal with security. Under the plan large companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries, would sign long-term deals with generators for coal-fired electricity. Analysts were sceptical yesterday about whether the scheme would increase demand for coal. Meanwhile PowerGen, the electricity generator, said it had signed an eight-year deal to supply Electricite de France with power via the cross-Channel electricity link. The deal might lead to sales of more than Pounds 100m. Analysts believe it could help save one of the threatened pits. Closing each threatened pit would cost between Pounds 8m to Pounds 10m more per pit than keeping it open, says an assessment released yesterday by the Trades Union Congress. The TUC figures took into account extra unemployment benefit payments and tax losses resulting from closures. Its study challenged the government's assertions that the costs of pit closures would be short-lived and that saving pits would have a severe impact on jobs elsewhere.</p>

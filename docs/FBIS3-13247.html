Sources say that the Egyptian role is of considerable  importance at this stage because "it gives the Gulf states some  kind of reassurance that the Jordanian mediation could not  provide."    A senior source in the GPC, which is led by the Yemeni  president, has stated that "there are increasing notions about  secession among the southern brothers and I do not know whether  or not that is based on any specific calculations." He said  that local calculations have become more complex since the  introduction of the system of political pluralism, and that is  what "the secessionist desires" would face, unlike foreign  calculations "which are based on a desire to calm the situation  and avoid a military explosion in Yemen, regardless of whether  or not secession occurs."    The GPC official played down the significance of what went  on  during a joint meeting of the lederships of the GPC and the  Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], part of which was attended by the  president before leaving for Cairo. The meeting was said to  have discussed more coordination between the GPC and the YRG  with emerging inclinations to terminate the ruling coalition in  Yemen with in order to exclude the YSP from government. Some of  the conferees also called for intervention to settle the crisis  by military means.    The GPC official said that "discussions which take place in  the absence of the president are of no great importance because  no decisions are made and no clear policies are decided in such  discussions."    He added that "decisions have already been made on these  matters and the position will be determined in the light of the  solution which might result from the current attempts to resolve  the crisis."    He said that "the YSP's notions about secession are perhaps  meant to pave the way for a federal solution."    Meanwhile, the son and nephew of Yemeni Agriculture Minister  Shaykh Sadiq Amin Abu-Ras have been released as a result of  efforts made by Shaykh 'Ali Bin-Naji al-Ruwayshan, chief of the  al-Yamaniyah al-'Ulya tribe in Khawlan.

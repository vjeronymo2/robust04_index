			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In support of its proposal, Hawaii states that interest expense is a source of working capital funds, and is not paid to the bond holder until after related revenue is received. Hawaii concludes, therefore, that interest expense does not create a need for working capital. Comments are requested on the validity of the proposal to exclude interest expense from the calculation of working capital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 3: The Selection of Proxy Groups <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of parties commented on the selection of the proxy group. Hawaii indicates a concern with the criteria prescribed in selecting a comparable group of companies when the proxy group is used in determining the cost of common-stock equity. Hawaii believes that the companies in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Value Line Investment Survey  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which satisfy the Commission's criteria for the proxy group do not have business risks similar to those of Matson. Hawaii claims that these companies are generally consolidated companies; are not dominant in their trades; and do not have statutory barriers to entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marsoft states that according to its research only three marine transportation companies and four trucking companies meet the proposed guidelines for the proxy group. Marsoft does not believe that airlines, railroads, or full-load trucking companies should be included in the proxy group, because they do not provide comparable services. Marsoft states that in many cases large, geographically and operationally diverse companies will be compared to small, highly specialized private carriers. Marsoft believes that the comparison may not be credible in some cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PRMSA comments that the proxy group should not be restricted to the freight transportation business. PRMSA asserts that equity capital in the regulated carrier competes against the broad spectrum of companies in the economy, not just against companies involved in freight transportation. The nature of a business is said to be only one ingredient of business risk, not the sole determinant. PRMSA notes that as of June 1994, there were a total of 39 companies listed in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Value Line Investment Survey  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which were involved in air transport, trucking, maritime, and railroading. Allegedly, not all of these companies were involved in freight transportation as required by the proposed rule. PRMSA concludes from this that the potential list of comparable companies is highly limited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, the proxy group is selected from companies which operate and derive a major portion of their gross revenues primarily as common carriers in the business of freight transportation, and own and operate transportation vehicles or vessels. The Commission requests specific suggestions on industries other than freight transportation covered by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Value Line Investment Survey  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which have business and financial risks similar to those of the domestic carriers that may be added to the current proxy group criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 4: Deletion of Alternative Methodologies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule revises paragraph (b) of section 552.1 by deleting the provision that the methodology employed in each case will depend on the nature of the relevant carrier's operations and financial structure. Also, the proposed rule adds language to that paragraph that specifies the extent of possible alternative methodologies. Paragraph (b) reads: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (b) In evaluating the reasonableness of a VOCC's overall level of rates, the Commission will use return on rate base as its primary standard. A carrier's allowable rate of return on rate base will be set equal to its before-tax weighted average cost of capital. However, the Commission may also employ the other financial methodologies set forth in &sect;552.6(f) in order to achieve a fair and reasonable result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d) of the same section has been deleted. That paragraph provided that the Commission may use some other basis for allocation and calculation and may consider other operational factors in any instance where it is deemed necessary to achieve a fair and reasonable result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APL informs that these provisions are at the heart of a major dispute in FMC Docket No. 89&hyph;26,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Government of the Territory of Guam, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sea-Land Service, Inc. and American President Lines, Ltd.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It points out that the NPR does not give any reasons for the proposed changes to section 552.1 and contends that the changes cannot be legally adopted unless and until the FMC identifies its reasons for such a change and allows opportunity for comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the abbreviated comments it did provide, APL contends that the proposed changes can have no substantive effect on a pending complaint docket focused on a prior time period. APL further urges the Commission to ``make clear, as a general matter, that its decision in the prospective rulemaking proceeding is not intended to pre-judge issues in the retrospective complaint proceeding.'' APL contends that sections 552.1(b) and 552.1(d) merely make explicit an agency's authority that is implicit in any regulatory scheme. Further, APL questions why the FMC would want to amend a regulation in a way that might imply that it was denying itself the ability to do something necessary to achieve a fair and reasonable result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

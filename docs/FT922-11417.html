			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Poll tax bill on empty house MY DAUGHTER is in dispute with the local authority over the payment of the community charge on a property which she voluntarily surrendered to the building society when she got into difficulties with the repayments. Originally the authority was prepared to levy this charge against the society and the society was prepared to accept it, but it now seems that the society is seeking to avoid payment, claiming that my daughter, although denied access to the property or any say in its disposal, is legally responsible as the freeholder. Of what, if she neither owns nor occupies the property? We think the council is correct. Your daughter is responsible for the standard charge on the empty property until either the mortgagee or she herself effects a sale of the property. She remains the owner of the empty property, and is entitled to any surplus money if there were to be a sale at a price exceeding the mortgage loan plus interest. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

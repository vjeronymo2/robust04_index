The Year of  Censorship"]    [Text] It must be confessed that this kind of action  from the television journalists was expected. Like Kim Il-song  in spirit and form, national television has long since become  just as exotic in our country as the picturesque canvases of the  socialist realists. Who just in recent years has not "collided"  with Ukrainian television, starting with Prime Minister L.  Kuchma and ending with rank and file television viewers. But in  vain! The reigning nomenklatura is guarding the stronghold of  information supremacy and influence on the popular masses like  the apple of its eye. But now, on the eve of the elections, the  party in power, in the words of A. Lavrinovych, is trying to  take the entire information space under its control, which is  why political censorship is being toughened, but where its  opportunities are limited--an economic noose is used.    Patience ran out at the Gart youth studio. Incidentally, the  same one to which we are obligated for the rare and really  talented programs that appear on UT-1 [Ukrainian Television-1].  As a sign of protest, the collective of the editorial office  last Friday came out with this announcement right on the air:    "1. Censorship has been introduced on Ukrainian television.    "2. In particular, the "Gart Youth Studio," which has always  tried to speak to you honestly and frankly, became an object of  pressure today on the part of the leadership of the State  Television and Radio Broadcasting Company.    "3. At first, your right to receive full television  information was taken away from you, and now our right to speak  honestly from the screen is being withdrawn.    "4. Recently, critical materials concerning the situation in  the state were removed in the programs of our editorial  offices--'Business Report' and 'Gart Youth Studio.' The program  'Fanton' has disappeared from the air.    "5. `In a society in which the freedom of speech does not  exist, it makes no sense to talk about any kind of other  freedoms.' This is not our quote.    "6. We are warning that everything is being prepared in  state  television and radio broadcasting so that the reform forces do  not receive access to the air during the coming election  campaign. The sad experience of our Gart is evidence of this.    "7. Aware of what awaits us after going on the air (possible  dismissal from state television), we are deliberately taking  this step (going on the air with the announcement) as  journalists who want to preserve the honor of their profession.    "8. Therefore, the 'Gart Youth Studio' demands that the  leadership of the State Television and Radiobroadcasting Company  create conditions of work for the journalists that are generally  accepted in a democratic society.    "9. Everyone who watches and knows us--if you are with  us--we  are relying on your support."    After this, materials came out on the air that were  prohibited by the leadership of UT-1 from being shown. The  journalists who were invited to the studio became witnesses to  numerous telephone calls in which viewers expressed warm support  for the courageous act of the journalists. They were joined by  the employees of other editorial offices and services at 26  Kreshchatik Street.    On the next day at a conference of the Independence  journalists trade union, Viktor Pavlyuk, the editor in chief of  the program for youth, said: "It is senseless to talk about  freedom of speech on state television. The leadership is being  arbitrary, taking refuge in the fact that Ukrainian Television  is a governmental and presidential structure. We are deprived of  the right to speak honestly and frankly from the screen. And we  really envy our colleagues from the independent newspapers for  whom the time of censorship is in the past. We have  censorship--this is not only the removal of materials and  episodes, it is contained in all of the organizational activity  of the television company. If, for example, out of a dozen  editorial offices of our television, each had had an opportunity  to express its point of view on the GKChP [State Committee for  the State of the Emergency], then the people of Ukraine would  have heard at least several different opinions, but not  disgraceful silence. Freedom for the editorial office and  freedom for the journalists is all that we are trying to get."    "We wanted our own hour on the air," said Dmitriy Tuzov, a  Gart journalist, "to make it so that it would not be like UT-1.  It is not for me to tell you what kind of television channel  that is. You yourselves see: It is done in such an impotent way  that, in principle, it is impossible to watch it without tears.  However, this hour also stuck in the craw of the leadership."    Yelena Prygova, the studio editor, was even more  categorical:  "We are not cattle, which the former party workers and the  current leaders of the television company are trying to make us  out to be. We created this television and are proud of our work.  We are citizens, we are journalists, and we will stand to the  end."    There is no need to guess what the reaction has been of  Messrs. Okhmakevych and Kulik, the leaders of the teleGULAG, to  the demarche of those desiring freedom for the journalists. It  has already been recommended to Viktor Pavlyuk that he write a  resignation statement. There has been criticism of other Gart  employees. However, it will hardly be possible on the sly to  give short shrift to the "rebels" (the statement was signed by  18 persons; that is, almost the entire editorial staff).  Speaking in support of the Gart protest against the violation of  the freedom of speech in Ukraine were leaders of the executive  committee of the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine, well-known  political and public figures--V. Yavorivskyy, V. Chornovil, A.  Lavrinovych, L. Lukyanenko, O. Omelchenko--and the Fund for the  Independent Press of Ukraine. Deputy Vorobyev spoke in  parliament regarding Gart, and N. Spis, the chairman of the  commission on questions of openness and the mass media, advised  N. Okhmakevich not to adopt repressive measures. But the  question is, what is left for the latter to do? After all, give  journalists freedom, and it is hardly likely that any will  voluntarily want to sing prayers of praise to the president....</p>

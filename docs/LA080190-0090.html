			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITION PARTIES WIN PLACE IN MONGOLIA CABINET  </P> <P> Elections in Communist-ruled Mongolia have given opposition parties nearly 40%  of the seats in a key legislative body, according to results released Tuesday.  </P> <P> Communist Party chief Gombojavyn Ochirbat, speaking at a news conference in the  Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, said opposition representatives will be  invited to join the new government's Cabinet. This step is "vital for political  stability and national unity," he said.  </P> <P> With nearly all votes counted from Sunday's balloting, election officials  announced that the Communists had captured 80% of the seats in the 430-member  People's Great Hural, which elects the nation's president, and about 60% of the  seats in the 53-member Small Hural, which is the regularly functioning  legislature.  </P> <P> The election results mark "the end of orthodox communism in Mongolia,"  Baterdeniyn Batbayar, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said  at a news conference Tuesday.  </P> <P> "For a long time our people were under the exploitation of communism," Batbayar  said. "Now we are just coming from the darkness into a bright future."  </P> <P> The election law requires seats in the Small Hural to be allocated according to  a party preference poll that was on Sunday's ballot. This procedure helped  Mongolia's fledgling opposition parties, which were legalized only a few months  ago, to compete more effectively in the race for this legislative body.  </P> <P> The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, as the Communists are officially  known, won 343 seats in the Great Hural, election officials said. The Mongolian  Democratic Party won 23 seats, the National Progress Party won 7, the Social  Democratic Party won 4 and independents or minor party candidates won 25 seats.  New elections may be required in 28 districts, in most cases because no  candidate won a majority.  </P> <P> In the party preference poll for the Small Hural, the Mongolian Democratic  Party took 24% of the votes, the National Progress Party had 6% and the Social  Democratic Party had 5%.  </P> <P> U.S., British and Soviet observers have said the elections seemed basically  free and honest, despite some isolated problems. The voting system, however,  was weighted in favor of rural residents, who supported the Communists.  </P> <P> The elections, the first free multi-party balloting in Mongolia's history,  climaxed eight months of dramatic political change that began with dissident  rallies in December. The Communists, influenced by the wave of political  liberalization sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, responded with a  conciliatory stance.  </P></p>

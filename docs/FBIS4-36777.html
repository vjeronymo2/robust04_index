			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Majdi Qarqar: The Attacks on the </F> Brotherhood: The Salsabil Case and the Lack of Evidence"]    [Text] At dawn on the day when President Mubarak addressed  the opening session of the national dialogue conference, the  dawn visitors [secret service agents] arrested a number of  Muslim Brotherhood [MB] leaders in the organization's Guidance  Office and in various governorates. It appears that the cover  of darkness was not enough for the dawn visitors, for they  deepened the cover of darkness with the cover of national  dialogue (one layer of darkness upon another).    The security confrontations with the MB in the past three  years were characterized by partial and limited blows in various  areas (the issues of the Dar al-Wafa' Publishing House in  al-Mansurah, the Propagation Society in Bani Suwayf, the  Salsabil case, the al-Sharqiyah case, and the case of the sports  plot in Damietta to overthrow the regime by using a deflated  soccer ball). But the recent confrontation marks a change in  the security policy, because it was a comprehensive and  widespread confrontation that included a number of governorates;  it was a preparation for a bigger blow (as some are analyzing,  calling for, and preparing for in government papers and  magazines) similar to the blows of 1954 and 1965. We pray to  God to spare the nation from the evils of this sedition.    The regrettable thing is that the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR  prepared us for this recent blow several days ago in its issue  of Friday, 27 May, which went on sale on Wednesday, 25 May. The  magazine promised to publish the al-Salsabil case's documents in  its next four issues (step by step with security). In the same  issue, the magazine published what it said were documents  pertaining to the issue of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, which  it had obtained through its security or government contacts,  though the magazine's documents are not worth the paper they are  printed on.    The latest confrontation against the Islamic trend in  general  and the MB in particular began in the wake of the Lawyers  Association's general elections at the end of 1992, in which the  Islamic trend won a majority of seats. The progovernment  writers' anger was aroused, and they appealed to what they  called the "silent majority" to play a role in liberating the  unions from the "Islamists." The result was the enacting of the  "muddled" law of professional associations in February 1993.  Union elections were held in accordance with this law, but the  silent majority gave its vote to the Islamic trend and this in  turn inflamed the pro-authority writers still further, resulting  in the strikes by security forces.    Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani's case set off the recent  confrontation. The security organs used this as a pretext to  deal a blow to the MB. But their attempt failed because the  lawyers' recent action involved them all, regardless of their  political affiliations. They did so to defend their association  and the rights of its members in particular and Egyptian human  rights in general.    Going back to the Salsabil case, which was the focus of  AL-MUSAWWAR's documents and which it began to publish in its  recent edition, we find that the magazine notes that it will  publish in its next edition the MB's secret plans to establish a  party, as if the establishment of a party is a crime punishable  by law and the MB's reputation has to be blackened. The MB has  been trying through the judiciary to ascertain its legality for  more than 25 years. Obstacles are placed in its way even though  it is trying to operate publicly through a legal party it is  seeking to establish. What is the crime in that? The MB is a  major political faction and has a right to express itself  through a party. If you, the pro-authority writers, are saying  that it is a secret organization, then why do you not ask the  authorities to let it be a public organization through the  establishment of a legal party as part of the state's public  order system, especially since none of AL-MUSAWWAR's documents  indicate that the MB has used or even condoned violence?    If we accept that the MB has a right to operate through a  party that is being established, is it not also its right to  organize its ranks? Was there a need, for example, to arrest  the Nasirites before they declared that they wanted to form a  party, on the pretext that they constituted a secret  organization or a putative party? We in the Labor Party have  always advocated the right of the MB and the Nasirites to  establish their own parties. Now that the Nasirites have done  so, there remains the right of the MB to operate through a legal  party.    Since its establishment, the Labor Party has consistently  sought to renew its blood by changing its officials from bottom  to top every two years through elections. Will the National  "very Democratic" Party follow the example of the Labor Party  and MB or will it be content to use the name "democratic"  without content?    AL-MUSAWWAR talks about a document that includes certain  recommendations to the MB members should they be arrested.  Assuming that these documents are true, we would like to ask if  there is anything strange about this, particularly since the MB  has been exposed to all this coercion since the late 1940s.  What is strange about providing the MB members with certain  legal information to confront the security agencies'  fabrications and allegations?    The AL-MUSAWWAR editorial touches on the MB's plans to  penetrate the professional associations, trade unions, and  student federations. It said that the MB and the Muslim streams  are seeking to marshal their supporters so that these  associations play a correct role on the national and  professional levels. What did the ruling party do in this  respect? Definitely nothing, because the trade unions and  student elections take place in a true democratic atmosphere,  which does not suit the National "Democratic" Party.    We are writing this from the vantage point of the ranks of  the Labor Party. What we are saying is right and must be said  to back our brothers, who are working within the framework of  legitimacy and the law despite the severe harassment and  coercion facing them. Perhaps it is useful to recall what Labor  Party leader Ibrahim Shukri said in his political statement  before the Party's Sixth General Congress, and what 'Adil Husayn  said in his latest article: That the MB is the closest political  and Islamic group to us, and we have been in an alliance since  1987 under the motto "the Islamic solution program." There are  certain differences in details between us, and that is why each  party maintains its independent organizational entity.    Confrontation with the Islamic reformation trends is  erroneous and serves the schemes of the nation's enemies. The  Labor Party has encountered severe coercion. After the Labor  Party's political statement, which defined the party's Islamic  identity, was issued at the Party's Fourth General Congress in  January 1987, the security agencies began their war by trying to  torpedo the party from within. The party's members, however,  foiled the security agencies' plans and frustrated these  subversive attempts at the party's congress in 1989. The  Security agencies continued their subversive attempts,  instigating divisions in the party's ranks. They then used  certain security personnel as dupes every time the party adopted  a correct national and Islamic stance on the regime's erroneous  political positions. When the people got fed up with these  dupes, the security agencies began to change their methods: In  several governorates they began to summon the party's leaders  and newspaper writers to the prosecution's office, arrest its  members and incessantly coerce them.    This fierce onslaught and human rights are indivisible.  Therefore, all sincere national groups must confront this  onslaught. What the Labor Party and the MB are confronting today  will confront the Nasirite Party, the National Progressive  Unionist Party, and the Wafd party tomorrow, and the others  later. There is no need to recall the wisdom of the black bull,  who said he was eaten the day the white bull was eaten.    It is strange that the government is turning a blind eye to  the external enemies and is daily creating new enemies out of  the people's sons, as if all the people are its enemies or an  enemy government is ruling the people. It is a short-sighted  government that fights in all directions simultaneously: A war  against the violent Muslim groups, against the depositors in the  capital investment companies, against Egyptian workers abroad  with the new tax law, against the trade unions with the unified  trade unions law, against workers with the unified labor law,  against our kinfolk in the countryside with the mayors law,  against the university professors with the law on appointments  of deans. O ruling Egyptian Government: Don't you have one  wise man to make things right?</p>

He said that he  had been forced to take this course of action by the approaching  deadline of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia Serbs. He said that  his intention was guided by a wish that several ideas were  tabled to the international officials who could make a decision  on the issues concerned.    According to Baudys, a possible lengthy debate on the  initiative in Czech political structures would have devalued the  content of the document.</p>

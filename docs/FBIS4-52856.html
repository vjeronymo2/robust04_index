			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  have yet to decide if they will discuss resuming the trade  framework talks during upcoming bilateral subcabinet-level  consultations, a senior Japanese Trade Ministry official said  Monday [16 May].    The May 24 high-level meeting in Washington is intended to  discuss the bilateral cooperation in the environment and other  global areas, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and  industry minister, told a press conference.    Both parties are uncertain whether or not they will touch on  sectoral trade issues in the meeting, over which the framework  talks became stalled, Kumano said.    The framework talks have been deadlocked since the February  meeting of then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  U.S. President Bill Clinton.    The talks broke down when Tokyo rejected U.S. demands for  Japan to introduce numerical targets in three priority fields of  government procurement, insurance, and autos and auto parts, to  measure American manufacturers' access to these markets.    Global topics to be taken up at the coming Washington  meeting  for bilateral cooperation are also covered under the framework  talks launched in July 1993.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN AND WHALES: JUST TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT?;  </P> <P> NATURE: HUMANS MAY BE DRIVING HUMPBACKS FROM BREEDING GROUNDS. A U.S. AGENCY  WEIGHS GUARANTEEING THE MAMMALS 100 YARDS OF PRIVACY.  </P> <P> Hawaii's humpback whales, known for their lively stunts and haunting songs,  attract people from around the world. But the feeling doesn't seem to be  mutual.  </P> <P> As jet skis and motorboats crowd the west Maui coastline, the humpbacks seem to  be leaving the balmy near-shore waters they once favored as calving grounds.  </P> <P> "It's like having chain saws in your nursery," says Mark Ferrari, executive  director of the Maui-based Center for Whale Studies, which has documented a  precipitous decline in cow-calf sightings off Lahaina over the last decade. "It  keeps you from going in there."  </P> <P> With whale watching gaining popularity around the country, one question keeps  surfacing: From a whale's point of view, how close is too close for comfort?  </P> <P> The debate divides scientists and has hampered efforts to protect the mammoth  mammals from their fast-growing human fan club. But a federal agency may settle  the matter this summer by guaranteeing whales 100 yards of privacy wherever  they roam in U.S. waters.  </P> <P> The protective zone already applies in Hawaiian waters. Only scientists with  federal research permits are allowed to get closer to the humpbacks, which  migrate here from Alaska for winter and spring. Along coastal stretches of Maui  and Lanai favored by mothers and calves, the minimum distance is 300 yards.  Aircraft may approach no closer than 1,000 feet. Violators are typically fined  from $400 to $1,500.  </P> <P> The set-back regulation was imposed in Hawaii in December, 1987, by the  National Marine Fisheries Service out of concern that people were inadvertently  pushing the humpbacks from vital breeding grounds. The boisterous beasts are  among the world's most endangered whales, with a population estimated at 1,500  to 2,000 in the North Pacific.  </P> <P> Like all whales, the humpbacks depend heavily on their acoustic sense and are  sensitive to noise. When boats approach, studies show that whales may stay  underwater longer, change breathing patterns and direction and have difficulty  communicating. "They are wild animals and they need space," says Gene Witham,  enforcement agent in the Fisheries Service Honolulu office. "These whales were  hunted up until 1966 in the Pacific. It's very possible that some of the adults  can remember."  </P> <P> The agency is poised to extend the 100-yard rule nationwide, although it may  grant a few exceptions, according to Margaret Lorenz, marine resources  management specialist at National Marine Fisheries Service headquarters in  Washington, D.C. The move would unify widely varying regional guidelines and  give them the force of law.  </P> <P> That could mean big changes for some whale watch operators and other boaters  around the country. In California, the guidelines now set no minimum distance,  but simply recommend how to handle vessels within 100 yards of a whale. In New  England, they allow boats to get as close as 100 feet.  </P> <P> Bob Fletcher, president of the San Diego-based Sportfishing Assn. of  California, which includes whale watching, says his members consider the  100-yard setback a "reasonable compromise as long as enforcement agents use  common sense." Under the regulation, if a whale approaches a boat, rather than  vice versa, the operator would not be cited.  </P> <P> But the proposal alarms some commercial whale watchers in Massachusetts and a  few on the West Coast. They consider themselves a key force in educating the  public about whales and argue that the new rule could undercut that goal.  </P> <P> "I think it would eliminate whale watching," says Ronn Storro-Patterson, whose  McKinleyville-based company, Biological Journeys, runs whale tours along the  West Coast.  </P> <P> "From 100 yards, we don't see a whole lot. If that's the way whale watching is  going to be regulated, I don't think people are going to spend the money."  </P> <P> Critics also point out that imposing a blanket distance ignores the fact that  whales react differently to disturbances and that boats emit various levels of  noise. But taking such variations into account would be a regulatory nightmare,  officials say.  </P> <P> While Lorenz acknowledges that 100 yards is "somewhat arbitrary," she says  simplicity is the name of the game.  </P> <P> "We have to have something we can enforce," she said. "A hundred yards is an  easy distance for people to measure. It's like a football field."  </P> <P> Until now, the only recourse for enforcement agents has been to prosecute  people under the Endangered Species Act. To do so, they must prove that a whale  has been harassed, a tough standard to meet because it is so subjective.  </P> <P> The fisheries service plans to publish the proposed rule this summer, and allow  60 days of public comment before it is made final. "We expect a bloody fight,"  she added.  </P> <P> Despite such concerns, the 100-yard rule went over without a splash in Hawaii,  where whale watch operators carry an estimated 100,000 passengers a year.  </P> <P> Lahaina, once a support base for commercial whaling, now is a magnet for  tourists enchanted by the acrobatic humpbacks. The animals delight onlookers by  thrusting their 40-ton bodies skyward and slapping the waves with their long  pectoral fins. Some boats use hydrophones to amplify the humpbacks' complex  songs, which can last 20 minutes before repeating.  </P> <P> "People didn't squawk about the setback," says Mike Salzer, vice president of  Ocean Activities Center, one of Maui's largest whale watch operators. "It  hasn't affected our whale watching at all. We've always given the whale plenty  of berth."  </P> <P> Most violators have been private boaters. Last year, an Austrian was fined  $1,500 for gunning his Zodiac repeatedly at a pod of humpbacks. The publicity  over that and other cases has helped discourage potential violators, according  to Witham.  </P> <P> Local officials are now ready to take whale protection a step further. The  Hawaii Legislature is considering a ban on jet skis and parasails in west Maui  waters during the December-May whale season. Legislators contend that the  noisy, erratic behavior of the "thrill craft" disturbs whales, not to mention  people.  </P> <P> Researcher Ferrari supports the thrill craft ban. He remembers identifying a  calf that was playing happily, then seeing it a week later with a propeller  scar down its dorsal fin and the top of its right pectoral fin chopped off.  </P> <P> "It obviously had been run over by a boat," he said, noting that parasail boats  have unprotected propellers  </P> <P> Calves that have had such run-ins are likely to die at the hands of predators,  he said. And whether or not whales are hit directly, the loss of near-shore  habitat where mothers rest and nurse their young hurts the species' chances for  survival.  </P> <P> "The whales don't come down here so we can look at them," said state Rep.  Rosalyn Baker, who represents west Maui. "They come down here to regenerate  their species. It's very important that their activities not be interrupted if  we're serious about protecting them."  </P></p>

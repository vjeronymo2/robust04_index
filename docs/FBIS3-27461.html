			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has made  much headway in reform of the housing system, on the basis of a  four-year experiment.    The reform, begun in 1988, involves millions of citizens in  the capital, including people in government departments and army  units here.    The reform includes housing funds collection both by the  government and work units, setting up accumulation funds by  employees, raising house rents, putting houses on sale, and  building houses with cooperative funds.    Its main aim is to step up commercialization of housing.    By the end of 1993, this capital city had sold 150,000  apartments with floor space of 9 million square [sq] meters.  Some 100,000 of these were sold last year -- four times more  than the total of the previous four years.    The city has received 1.7 billion yuan (about 200 million  U.S. dollars) in all from the sales.    It has also reaped 400 million yuan (about 47 million U.S.  dollars) from raising house rents, some 120 million yuan (over  14 million U.S. dollars) of this increases being received in  1993.    The rent of houses is usually raised by over 0.4 yuan per  square meter per month, or 0.55 yuan per sq m. in suburbs and  one yuan per sq m. for new houses.    In addition, 1.5 million people in Beijing have joined a  housing accumulation fund which has collected 80 million yuan  (nearly 10 million U.S. dollars).    The city plans to further expand the housing reform in the  fields of establishment of housing accumulation funds, house  sales and rent raising in line with the cost of house building  and increases of people's incomes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan has called upon the UN Security Council to  act quickly to save the victims of Serbian genocide and  immediate withdrawal of Serbian forces from Gorazde.    In an urgent message sent to the UN Secretary General, Dr.  Butrus Ghali, today from Bonn, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir  Bhutto, said the agony of Gorazde is infinitely worsening the  sufferings in Sarajevo. She said we share the anger and despair  of the Bosnian leadership after the apathy of the UN on the  world community. She hoped the Security Council will quickly  approve Pakistan's resolution demanding air strikes against the  Serbian artillery and withdrawal of Serbian forces from Gorazde.  The Council must act quickly, she emphasized.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the world community must  wake up to the warning bell sounded by the vicious war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. She said Pakistan feels strongly that  maintaining the unjust arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina  means to assuming a share in the responsibility for the plight  of the defenseless people. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said to allow the  Serbs to succeed in Gorazde will severely and perhaps  irretrievably erode the credibility of the United Nations and  compromise its vision of collective security. She said it will  represent a leap backwards to the law of force and away from our  aspirations for a world ruled by the forces of law.</p>

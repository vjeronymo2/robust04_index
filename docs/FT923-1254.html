			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Where jobs will be cut HATFIELD: SIX DECADES OF AVIATION HISTORY The de Havilland Aircraft Company established its headquarters in Hatfield in 1930. The company was started 20 years earlier by Sir Geoffrey de Havilland in a rented field at Stag Lane, Edgware, north London. It was Hatfield that historic aeroplanes such as the Tiger Moth, Mosquito and Vampire came into existence.  But it is probably most famous for being the birthplace of the world's first jet airliner, the Comet, which entered service in 1952. By 1934 a new factory and offices had been built at Hatfield and production of Tiger Moth trainers and Dragon light transport aircraft was under way. At the outbreak of war, de Havilland turned to military aircraft and created the Mosquito - a revolutionary twin-engined, high-speed fighter-bomber made of wood.  Nearly 8,000 were eventually built. During the post-war period the Hatfield design team worked on both civil and military projects. One of their greatest successes was the distinctive Vampire jet fighter, distinguished by its unusual twin-boom tail. The aircraft and its derivatives sold in large numbers to the RAF and the Royal Navy and became the first jet fighter to fly in many of the world's air forces. De Havilland in the UK became absorbed into today's British Aerospace via a merger in the 1960s with Hawker Siddeley.  In Canada, the company's Toronto offshoot went on using the name, made famous there initially by de Havilland Canada's Chipmunk two-seat trainer. The name survives today as a subsidiary of Bombadier, the Canadian engineering and transport conglomerate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Most Eastern European  nations are still in recession with little hope of a major  recovery this year, a UN report issued today said.    The report from the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE)  said the drop in production slowed down in most Eastern European  nations and signs of recovery appeared even in a few countries  of the region last year.    But considering the gravity of the recession, certain  countries need a few more years to restore production to the  pre-1989 level, the report added.    Production in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth  of  Independent States dropped by 13 percent in 1993 compared with  20 percent in 1992, according to the report.    The ECE predicted that there is a very slim possibility of  an  end to the economic sliding in these countries this year.    The report also said the sharp rise of unemployment in  Eastern European nations since 1991 has brought about serious  social and economic problems in these countries. About 7.6  million people had become jobless by the end of 1993, it added.    The commission stressed that the international aid to these  countries at present cannot help solve the difficulties facing  them. Eastern Europeans have become ever more disappointed over  the huge gap between what has been promised and what has  actually been given, it added.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DWORKIN ON JOHN MACK  </P> <P> Andrea Dworkin in her condemnation of the brutality of John Mack and the  callousness of his defenders in Congress ("Political Callousness on Violence  Toward Women," Opinion, May 14) erred only in failing to recognize the full  reality. Some, not all, men are certainly guilty of vile conduct -- as often as  not toward other men, as well as women.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, women themselves are hardly exempt from comparable behavior.  History is replete with examples; the most recent, the doyenne of the Nazi  concentration camps, Ilse Koch. The lady fashioned lamp shades from human skin.  </P> <P> A convincing intellectual case can also be made against the economic Darwinism  so fervently embraced by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  </P> <P> There is more than enough shame and guilt to go around. Charles Schulz may have  expressed it best through Linus in the "Peanuts" comic strip many years ago:  </P> <P> "I love the human race. It's people I can't stand."  </P> <P> ALAN HARVEY  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FADING hopes of a cut in UK base rates, worries about the political situation in Russia and a higher than expected trade deficit combined to depress the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,905, 5 points below Friday's close, was the first indication of the selling that was to drive June lower for the rest of the session on the domestic economic and overseas worries. A mid-morning attempt at a rally petered out after the 11.30am release of figures showing a higher than anticipated UK trade deficit with non-EC countries. This drove June lower once again, falling to 2,861 by lunchtime. Bargain hunting saw the contract start to claw its way back from the lows after lunch, but the upward momentum once again proved to be premature for the poor opening on Wall Street led to another bout of selling of the contract. June eventually closed at 2,852, down 58 on the previous session and around an 11-point discount to the underlying cash market, with volume a healthy 12,927 lots. Traded options was also dull and saw volume of 26,130 contracts, down from a previous 30,610. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 7,385 contracts and the Euro-FT-SE 3,058. Fisons was the busiest stock option after a 'Roll Over' trade, at 3,020 lots.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Tsukhlo, Institute of Transition Period </F> Economic Problems: "Demand for Domestic Products Hits Record  Low"]    [Text] The volume of production declined sharply in  February. These are the results of a state of the market survey  of 172 enterprise directors in Moscow and the oblast. While  earlier only 50 percent of respondents mentioned production  decline (December 1993), in February 61 percent mentioned it.  The cause of the general decline in industry in February are  reports of a substantial reduction in output at machine-building  and construction material industry enterprises, where the  balance of "increased"--"decreased" replies measured -60 percent  and -53 percent, respectively. On the whole, a production  increase was registered in February only at woodworking industry  enterprises, where the balance is positive (+9 percent).    The absence of practical steps to implement the budget and  credit policy of the new government has not changed the trend,  which had materialized by the end of 1993, of the decline in  producers' normal demand for industrial output. In February  1994, 87 percent of enterprises saw demand for their products as  insufficient (84 percent in January). The share assessing demand  as normal dropped to a record low of all the surveys (8  percent). Dissatisfaction with demand exceeded 90 percent in the  machine-building, metallurgy, and petrochemical industries. In  the woodworking industry even now at least 30 percent of  enterprises see demand for their output as normal. In the summer  of 1993 the share of such assessment in the sector was 50  percent.    Low demand forces producers to first and foremost cut back  on  production: 47 percent of the respondents in this group are  willing to cut back on production and only 11 percent are  willing not to raise prices. Among enterprises that see the  demand as normal, 22 percent will try to refrain from raising  prices.    When the decline in production slowed down somewhat in  January, in the environment of shrinking demand it caused a  build-up of excess inventories of finished products. In February  enterprises already preferred to cut production rather then fill  their warehouses with finished products. The balance of  inventory estimates dropped by five percentage points and  returned to the level of November-December 1993. Nevertheless,  an increase in excess inventories was registered at enterprises  in machine-building (62 percent, in January--55 percent),  woodworking (55 percent, in January--0 percent), and food  processing (50 percent, in January--38 percent) industries.    The survey results show that enterprises forecast changes in  their production practically without taking into account the  volume of inventories of finished products. However, inventory  estimates do influence producers' price policy--16 percent of  enterprises with excess inventories will attempt to hold prices  at the same level, and only 10 percent of those with normal  inventories will attempt to do so.    In February the number of surveyed enterprises expecting  production decline was no longer increasing. The differential of  "will increase"--"will decline" answers measured -31 percent  (-33 percent in January). At the same time, only 36 percent of  enterprises hoped to maintain production volume. This is the  worst level in the past 17 months. The highest expectations of  production cutbacks are steadily registered at very large (54  percent replied "will decline") and large (45 percent)  production facilities. During the next few months production  cutbacks are most likely in machine-building (balance -42  percent), light industry (-22 percent), and the petrochemical  industry (-28 percent). At woodworking and food processing  industry enterprises the prevailing forecast for the new year is  one of maintaining the current production volume.    After the January jump in inflationary expectations, hopes  for curbing the price race rose again in February: The share of  "will not change" replies comprised 10 percent (5 percent in  January and 15 percent in December). Mainly, efforts to keep  wholesale prices at the same level will be made in light (21  percent of "will not change" and 5 percent of "will fall"  replies), machine-building (12 percent "will not change"), and  woodworking (9 percent "will not change") industries.</p>

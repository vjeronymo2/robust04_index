			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Strictly speaking, Samorukov's area of  responsibility at the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is  supercomputer components. But who works strictly according to  job description? Samorukov is also involved in LSI design and  development and in the automation of LSI design. In other words,  as Samorukov says, he takes what the logicians and experts in  computer structure and architecture have developed, combines it,  and pulls it through the physical implementation stage in such a  way that the final prototype machine will operate reliably.    [Samorukov] The point is that in specifying the  limiting characteristics of our computers, all these specialists  frequently forget to take into account the fact that Kvant is  not independently capable of implementing their designs in  hardware using existing components. We have therefore been  forced to approach collaborating enterprises in the electronics  industry and order new components from them; otherwise, we could  only dream of reaching the required level. However, these  collaborators have their own requirements: We must not only  develop a concept for a new machine and determine its  characteristics, not only develop plans for it, but also put all  of the ideas in a document of specific form; this document is  then provided to the designers of the various individual  units---to designers specializing in electric power, automation,  etc. One person needs to be able to keep track of all this in  his head. I am that person.    [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Is there any difference between  what you worried about 10 or 15 years ago and what you worry  about now?    [Samorukov] The situation is quite different now.  Before, under strict centralized government control, Kvant and  its products had high priority. We had both money and confirming  directives---in essence, guarantees. We took these directives  and hired collaborating enterprises. And we knew that this  product would come in from this enterprise and that product  would come in from that enterprise in accordance with  established deadlines, so that we could count on being able to  construct a new machine within the required time frame according  to plan, debug it, build a mockup, and present it to the  customer.    [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Weren't there failures under  this system?    [Samorukov] Of course there were. Supplies were  occasionally interrupted and development sometimes slowed down,  but the system generally functioned. It enabled both us and our  suppliers to plan. The customers had well-defined benchmarks  good to plus or minus six months or a year. It was possible to  project 5-10 years ahead with reasonable confidence.    The main customer for our high-production items has been the  defense industry. And as soon as they began to have their  budgets cut and started cutting back, the orders immediately  stopped coming in, which left the Kvant Scientific Research  Institute with much less financial maneuvering room. After all,  the need for the equipment we produced was much smaller.  Moreover, the flexibility of Kvant's supercomputer technology  enables us to include 100 or even 1000 units in a single  machine, while a commercial customer might be satisfied with a  power of 10 or 20. It turns out that we are now working (to put  it mildly) at far less than our full potential. Most  ``free-market'' entities are simply not in a position to use our  class of technology or components. This leads to wheel-spinning  and downtime.    [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Dead season?    [Samorukov] Half-dead. It is now clear that  without government support, ``high technology'' enterprises such  as ours previously oriented towards defense work will soon  experience difficulties. And this is despite the fact that many  problems in pure science requiring high-performance computers  (such as meteorological forecasting and seismic research) are  still of current interest and remain unsolved. There is  virtually no government support. The US itself, with its  extremely well-developed commercial sector which has trillions  of dollars available to it, has traditional government  investment in supercomputer programs, and the sums involved are  enormous: Last year, in 1992, the American government subsidized  a supercomputer and communications technology development  program with 600 million dollars. This is equivalent to 600  billion rubles. But our government has cast Kvant to the winds  of fate and put us out to pasture to sink or swim. That's why  we're going after any development projects at all, generally  small projects completely inconsistent with the level of  problems that the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is capable  of working on. But what can we do? We are trying to keep our  unique corps of specialists together and prevent them from  running off to commercial or other enterprises capable of paying  higher salaries than Kvant.    [KOMPYUTER MARKET] And are you succeeding?    [Samorukov] Yes, with difficulty. Many of the  young people we had the most hope in have either already left or  are thinking of leaving. We are only able to hold on to the  older staff. After all, we stall have a budgetary limit on  salaries. We even have to state this in [employment] agreements.  Only very recently have we been able to talk about indexing  salaries or graduated financing. To put it another way, it is  completely impossible for us to provide our staff with the same  standard of living that we could about ten years ago. The  problem of how to keep the Kvant staff in some sort of suspended  animation until our products are indeed needed by the country as  a whole (and not just a limited segment) will therefore be  difficult to solve. Moreover, we are now unable to invest in  development as we have for many years. All of the money received  by the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is now being eaten.</p>

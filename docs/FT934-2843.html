			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Norweb improves to Pounds 65.1m Norweb, the electricity distributor for the north-west of England, said yesterday that it intended to freeze tariffs until April 1995 as it reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 65.1m and lifted its dividend by 13.6 per cent. While other regional power companies have announced rebates for customers, Norweb is the first to say it is aiming for a 1994-95 prices freeze. Mr Ken Harvey, chairman, said the move would mean household customers would be paying less in 1995 than in 1991. The interim dividend rise, from 5.9p to 6.7p, is proportionally less than other regional companies which have lifted pay-outs by up to 20 per cent. Mr Harvey said the company was considering becoming an equity investor in 'low risk' generation projects overseas and would look at projects in western Europe, the US and the Pacific basin. The pre-tax increase from a restated Pounds 53.9m for the half year to September 30, came on turnover of Pounds 646.8m (Pounds 610.8m). Mr Harvey said that after the effect of provisions was stripped out, underlying growth was 11 per cent. Earnings advanced to 27.1p (21.9p). Mr Harvey said the main reason for the rise was a 2 per cent increase in units distributed and a 1 per cent cut in controllable costs in the electricity businesses. Industrial unit sales fell by 2.7 per cent, mainly through the loss of large customers. Unlike other regional companies, Norweb has not made staff redundant since privatisation. It expects to lose 200 employees this year through natural wastage, reducing the total to 5,000. Retailing employment, however, is growing, by 190 to 1,856 over the period, as the company expands into out-of-town stores. Retailing profit was Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.6m) but, with turnover up 35 per cent at Pounds 74.8m, margins were eroded. COMMENT Norweb is an unusual electricity stock. While most power companies are reducing or ending their involvement in stores, prompted in part by deep suspicion in the City of their ability to run them, Norweb is expanding aggressively. It has plans for 130 out-of-town stores by 1997, against its current 33. It is also strongly committed to power generation, both in the UK and, it emerged yesterday, overseas. Such boldness is often punished by the City, especially when it is practised by a utility, but not in Norweb's case. Although the shares dipped 2p to 707p, putting them on a prospective yield of about 4 per cent, that still makes them one of the strongest shares in the sector. One wrong move, whether in retailing or generation, would cause a rapid reappraisal.</p>

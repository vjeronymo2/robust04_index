			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Big Three close ranks against the club: Guy de Jonquieres argues for competition at the grocer Whenever businessmen protest about lack of a 'level playing field', consumers should be on their guard. Such complaints turn out all too often to be thinly veiled petitions for special treatment or relief from competitive problems of producers' own making. The latest aficionados of football metaphors are J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, Britain's three largest supermarket chains, which have ganged up to challenge in the High Court plans by Costco, a leading US operator of cut-price warehouse clubs, to open its first UK outlet. The supermarkets are crying foul because Costco has been granted local authority planning permission that does not classify it as a retailer. That, they argue, gives the company an unfair advantage over established shopkeepers, who must pay much higher prices for sites earmarked specifically for retailing and are subject to more onerous bureaucratic procedures. All the Big Three say they are asking for is clear rules, fairly enforced. Their high moral tone is curiously at odds with their stampede two years ago to open their stores on Sundays, in defiance of an even more confused legal situation. But it also masks a more fundamental inconsistency. For the playing field on which the large supermarkets compete - and which they have helped to shape - is far from level. Increasingly, it has been to their advantage. The Big Three have often been accused of earning immoderate profits by keeping food prices high, on the grounds that their pre-tax margins are double or more those of continental food retailers. They, in turn, have responded that such comparisons are flawed, and have insisted that they be judged by their return on capital, which is much closer to levels across the Channel. The problem with this argument is that the amounts of capital they invest are vastly greater - about five times more per square foot of store area than French supermarkets, according to a recent study by stockbrokers UBS. In a race to open ever more lavish superstores, costing as much as Pounds 40m each, the Big Three have in the past five years invested almost Pounds 10bn - about 2.5 per cent of total fixed capital formation by the private sector. Much of this sum reflects freehold property costs, which can account for half or more of the total cost of a superstore. But it is too easy just to blame a shortage of suitable land. The Big Three have also energetically bid up property prices. Their readiness to pay what other retailers regard as exorbitant figures has increasingly meant they have been the only bidders for prime sites. In effect, financial muscle has become as important as product range and marketing skills in determining the industry pecking order. Intentionally or not, high property prices have raised barriers to entry and hastened the exit of weaker players. Recent government efforts to discourage further out-of-town retail developments seem likely to discriminate in favour of those already operating by sheltering them from fresh competition. Always provided, of course, that food superstores remain as big moneyspinners as their owners hope. Their ability to do so depends heavily on continuing to achieve the exceptionally high sales volumes per square foot needed to recoup their capital costs. That in turn means enticing large numbers of affluent and mobile consumers to do more and more of their shopping - for items which have expanded to include toiletries, petrol and magazines, as well as groceries - under one roof. Increased UK competition from hard discounters, such as Aldi of Germany, which sell groceries at bargain-basement prices, poses a threat to this formula. On its own, the threat is probably containable while such stores mostly continue to sell a narrow range of goods from dingy high-street premises frequented by poorer consumers. But warehouse clubs, offering a huge array of products, from baked beans to video-recorders, at even lower prices from vast hangars, seem likely to compete for a far bigger share of superstore customers' disposable income. For the Big Three, that possibility raises the dread prospect that all the capital they have sunk in superstores will not produce a goldmine, but a bottomless pit. While they await the outcome of the High Court deliberations, the rest of us may care to ponder what kind of a regulatory regime encourages grocers to compete so strenuously to enrich land owners, and how much better off we might be if it did not.</p>

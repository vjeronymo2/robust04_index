			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSION DELAYS CONSIDERATION OF PORTER RANCH PLAN  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Planning Commission postponed consideration Thursday of a  $2-billion development proposal for the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth.  </P> <P> The hearing was rescheduled for May 25 to allow the city attorney's office time  to review whether commissioners Theodore Stein Jr. and Suzette Neiman have  conflicts of interest. Both have investments in a small housing tract about a  mile from the proposed project.  </P> <P> Thirteen of the tract's 19 homes have been sold and the remainder are expected  to be sold in the next three to six months, Stein said Thursday.  </P> <P> Porter Ranch Development Co. wants to build 2,195 single-family houses, 800  units of multifamily housing and 7.5 million square feet of commercial space in  the hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway over a 20- to 30-year period.  </P> <P> In a separate development, a group opposed to the size of the commercial  portion of the project canceled a press conference at which Los Angeles school  board member Julie Korenstein was to appear.  </P> <P> The event was canceled because the Planning Commission postponed its  consideration of the Porter Ranch proposal, said Jack McGrath, who helped  organize the press conference for the opposition group PRIDE.  </P> <P> Porter Ranch Development demanded an apology Wednesday for what it said were  deliberate misstatements that Korenstein made about the firm. Korenstein  refused, saying she didn't make the comments. A Korenstein spokesman said  Thursday that the school board member's stand against the Porter Ranch proposal  has not changed.  </P></p>

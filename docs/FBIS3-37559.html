Problems  With Financing Army and Navy Apparently Remain"]    [Text] Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of the  Russian Federation Defense Ministry Military Budget and  Financing Main Directorate, spoke yesterday at a press  conference organized by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry  Information and Press Directorate. He talked about the problems  of providing financial support for the Russian Army, which have  still not become any less acute.    Thus only 65 percent of the Defense Ministry's financial  expenditure needs last year were met, which constantly led to  delays in paying pay and allowances and wages in the Army and  Navy. As of 1 January 1994 the Defense Ministry owed 2.2  trillion rubles [R] to suppliers of weapons, equipment,  property, supply items, and other goods and services.    It was noted at the press conference that this debt was  partly cleared by the Russian Finance Ministry this February --  settlements with the national economy, including defense sectors  of industry, are already being made from the R1 trillion  deposited in Defense Ministry accounts.    But by all accounts the resources allocated are insufficient  to remove even the most acute questions from the agenda. One of  them is the financing of capital and housing construction.  Because of the lack of appropriations for these purposes it was  made virtually impossible to fulfill the 1993 tasks under the  state program to provide servicemen with housing. Of the 61,700  apartments planned for commissioning via federal budget  resources, only 50,000 or 81 percent of the plan were  commissioned. The Defense Ministry is trying to solve its  financial problems by selling released property. Last year  1,600 apartments were acquired by this means.    At the same time it is clear that the Armed Forces cannot  function normally without stable, full-blooded financing. But  studies on the 1994 military budget indicate that the Finance  Ministry is currently prepared to allocate only one-third of the  sums requested by the Defense Ministry.    Answering a question on financing and reforming the mass  media, Col. Gen. Vorobyev said that a choice has to be made in  the current very complex economic conditions: Whether to  maintain a particular military journal or give troops their  statutory pay, for which people have sometimes been waiting  months. It is a difficult choice but the second option must be  chosen.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Thai protesters vow to keep up fight PRO-DEMOCRACY demonstra-tors released yesterday from Bangkok jails vowed to pursue their campaign for the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, Thailand's unelected prime minister. After the king ended three days of violence by arranging a compromise on Wednesday night between the government and the opposition, small groups marched peacefully behind a black flag to the Democracy Monument in the city centre yesterday evening to mourn over 40 people killed by soldiers since Sunday night. The mood in the capital was one of anger and disappointment that Gen Suchinda, the former armed forces chief who became prime minister last month, had not yet been forced to quit. The government lifted a night-time curfew announced on Wednesday and withdrew orders to three anti-government newspapers to suspend publication, but a state of emergency which includes a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people remained in force. Protesters have largely ignored the ban. Other countries welcomed the intervention of King Bhumipol Adulyadej, the halt to the violence and the release of 3,000 protesters. The Foreign Office in London told British tourists that it was now safe to travel to Thailand. The Bangkok stock market responded euphorically to the deal arranged by the king. The SET index rose 9 per cent, or 60.30, to 738.67, more than recouping its losses earlier in the week. While factories and shops reopened, some business leaders said they saw little chance of an end to the crisis or the revival of investor confidence until Gen Suchinda resigned. One executive of the Federation of Thai Industries called for a general election to introduce a fresh set of politicians into parliament. Critics of the government interpreted conflicting statements from members of the five-party coalition as evidence of renewed stalling over constitutional reforms which are seen as a way out of the crisis. Speaking at an emergency meeting of the cabinet yesterday, Gen Suchinda repeated the promise he made in a midnight broadcast on Wednesday to support a speedy amendment of the constitution. The opposition is now focusing its demands on a provision that would require the prime minister to be an elected MP. Since Gen Suchinda has not been elected and has repeatedly said he does not want to be involved in what he calls sordid electoral politics, this could mean his resignation. Some members of the coalition said they would support the proposal for an elected premier and would not require a long transitional period that would allow Gen Suchinda to continue in office. One government MP was even reported as saying he should resign when parliament convenes. Stand-off in struggle, Page 6</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Patterton] </F>   [Text] Skukuza April 8 SAPA -- The summit of South Africa's  four top political leaders was still underway in the Kruger  National Park late on Friday [8 April] afternoon. The four --  State President F W de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and African  National Congress President Nelson Mandela -- began their talks  at 3.30PM and there was no indication when the meeting would end.    A large contingent of journalists were restricted to the  Skukuza area as they were not allowed into the Jakkalsbessie  Camp, the venue for the talks, government spokesman Marius  Kleynhans said.    King Zwelithini was at Skukuza on Thursday night, while Mr  Mandela, Mr Buthelezi and Mr de Klerk arrived on Friday morning.    The ANC leader and the Zulu king met from 9.30AM to 2PM, Mr  Kleynhans said.    King Goodwill's delegation included about 20 indunas  [chiefs], and the ANC was represented by Secretary-General Cyril  Ramaphosa, Executive Committee member Mac Maharaj and Communist  Party Chairman Joe Slovo.    The four leaders met to discuss the future of kwaZulu/Natal,  violence, and whether elections would be possible in the  province.    Journalists battled to file stories as only one pay card  telephone line was available at Skukuza for the media.    While the government and other delegations earlier refused  to  disclose the venue of the talks, the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] had advance notice and arrived at  Skukuza with an outside broadcast truck to provide coverage of  the event.</p>

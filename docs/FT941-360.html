			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rotork at Pounds 13m on back of new product Good sales of a new design of valve control helped Rotork lift 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.5m to a record Pounds 12.9m. The 23 per cent improvement was achieved on turnover ahead from Pounds 57.1m to Pounds 70.7m. Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said the company had been encouraged by the speed with which the new IQ valve actuator had been accepted by customers around the world in a conservative market place. Rotork's main business is designing, assembling and selling electric mechanisms to open and close valves. The IQ control is operated through an infrared system, so it can remain sealed in hostile climates. Customers included every valve manufacturer in the world, Mr Eassie said. New orders last year included controls for a large oil metering system in central Siberia, and for one of the biggest water treatment plants in China. During the year Rotork spent Pounds 3.3m on strategic acquisitions, buying its Venezuelan agent and raising its stake in its Indian agent. It also acquired the 75 per cent it did not own of Exeeco, which makes gearboxes for electric valve controls. The acquisitions accounted for Pounds 2.98m of total turnover. The instruments division, with turnover of Pounds 6m, benefited from an increase in orders for emergency shut-down systems. The analysis division made an operating loss on sales of Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. Net cash at the year end was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 14.5m). Earnings per share rose from 7.56p to 9.38p. A final dividend of 2.5p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 4.25p (3.72p).</p>

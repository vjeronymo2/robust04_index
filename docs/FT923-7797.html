			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Strong futures rally STERLING futures opened down from their previous levels yesterday as the market remained concerned by the pound's performance on the foreign exchanges. But good inflation figures in Germany and comments from a Bundesbank official boosted them in heavy trading later in the day. The September short sterling contract opened down 3 basis points, at 89.60, as dealers took stock of sterling's recent fall below DM2.8200 against the D-Mark. However, an UK clearing bank base lending rate 10 per cent from May 5, 1992 unexpectedly sharp drop in Germany's wholesale prices for July, which were down 1.3 per cent from the previous month, suggested that inflationary pressures - and the pressure on the Bundesbank to raise interest rates - may be abating. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank Vice-President, helped to make the mood more bullish by saying that the German central bank would look at the possibility of changing interest rates in two months time, putting on ice the prospect of higher German rates. The September contract rose in the afternoon, closing at 89.74, up 14 basis points from its opening level. The December contract also closed up 16 basis points from its opening level at 89.82. Both rallies were in tandem with a strong performance in Euro-Deutschmark futures: the September Euromark contract closed up 6 basis points at 90.21. One discount house trader suggested that the bearish mood of recent months might even be coming to an end. Dealers in the sterling cash market were less impressed by the news from Germany and the fall in UK inflation. Three-month money closed fractionally down at 10 7/32 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 10 1/4 per cent. Both 6-month and 1-year money ended unchanged at 10 5/16 per cent on the offered side. Uncertainties about the future of European Monetary Union continue to take their toll. Short dates softened after the the Bank of England's shortage of Pounds 750m was quickly removed. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 650m in a repurchase agreement (repo) at 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, it purchased Pounds 101m in Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The overnight rate consequently softened to 8 per cent from a previous close of 9 1/2 per cent.</p>

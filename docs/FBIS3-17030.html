			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T. Smirnova: "The Law in Camouflage Fatigues"] </F>   [Text] A naive people, until recently we consoled  ourselves: This is it; we have exhausted, through our  grandmothers and grandfathers, mothers and fathers, a full  measure of wars and revolutions, night searches and cattle  boxcars. We played hide-and-seek with ourselves: A generation  without wars, we will certainly sail into a quiet old age, will  tend to our grandchildren and contemplate eternity. Alas, one  cannot sidle into history!    The mayoralty was seized the second time. After correcting  the minor flaps that had occurred during the first try. So you  did not like the timing? You say: Why was the raid organized on  a weekend; the people were not warned; and why did you stomp the  floor, brandishing submachine guns? Our apologies--we all learn  from our mistakes. Would Wednesday, in the middle of the week,  be better for you? At 1800, after work? We can dispense with the  submachine guns, too--are there any volunteers to go against the  trained OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] guys and  their truncheons? Regarding the warning--that you also had! As  early as on Monday, authorized comrades had been trying to break  through into the mayoralty with the order to replace the  authorities. And by Wednesday the kray leadership paid a visit  to the "Gray House," with the mission of dethroning Mayor V.I.  Cherepkov and his first deputy, the city administrator V.A.  Gilgenberg. The action was carried out by kray governor's  deputies I.P. Lebedinets and A.V. Gartman, as well as kray  administration department chiefs A.I. Yegorov, V.F. Terekhov,  and K.B. Tolstoshein. A decree by acting head of kray  administration I.P. Lebedinets was read out, relieving from his  duties V.I. Cherepkov and appointing K.B. Tolstoshein as acting  head of the city administration. In short, the protocol was  observed-- according to eyewitnesses inside the building.    As to eyewitnesses outside of it, they did not get to see  much. OMON soldiers were behind the glass door, blocking it. The  clank of that same door, letting out--in batches--mayoralty  personnel. There were smiles on the faces of some ladies:  Finally, real masters have arrived! Reinforcements arrived--an  additional OMON group in camouflage fatigues.    "I managed to slip into the building several minutes before  the raid: I had been warned on the impending action," says P.M.  Dovganyuk, a former kray soviet deputy, and a candidate for the  kray duma deputy. I was in V.I. Cherepkov's waiting room. Heard  stomping feet and noise downstairs. Someone in the waiting room  ran to close the door. I interfered--it did not make sense to  close the door, it would be smashed into pieces anyway. They  agreed with me. At that very moment OMON charged in. The storm  troopers were being directed by a man in civilian clothes. He  introduced himself as Ivanov.... City administrator Vladimir  Gilgenberg behaved with great dignity...."    The closing scene of the city administrator's "dignified"  appearance before the crowd milling in front of the building  soon materialized. The door opened with a clank and Gilgenberg  was thrown out, landing at the crowd's feet.    "As of today, in keeping with the directive, I was the  acting  mayor, because Viktor Ivanovich is sick," Vladimir Gilgenberg  began his street interview to the surrounding journalists. "As  usual, we were busy with work on that day. Adopted an additional  decision on procedures for use of public transportation--free  for city residents. Were putting the final touches on financing  with respect to sanitation cleanup of the city. There were  numerous financial documents, directives, important papers on my  desk. And suddenly-- the raid; my office is broken into, door  kicked off hinges, and a rude "hassle" begins.... They dragged  me out of the building head down.... Among the things left in my  office were documents, my passport, personal effects, 400,000  rubles issued to me for the election campaign as a candidate for  kray duma deputy, plus an advance I had received...."    Dusk was enveloping the city. Temperatures dropped to  freezing. Many of those gathered at the mayoralty steps were  stomping their feet, made short jogs to keep themselves  warm--the cold was getting to people through spring-season short  coats and jackets. Many were hatless but were afraid to leave.  Against the background of the darkened building, the tenth floor  was brightly lit. In his office, Mayor V.I. Cherepkov was  bedridden, hooked to an IV. His wife was keeping watch at his  bedside. The full "illumination" in Gilgenberg's office was easy  to explain: A search was still under way there. The eyes of the  people on the street were glued to this strip of light at the  top. Cars with special license plates were lurking here and  there around the building. An ambulance with the "03" telephone  number on the hood. Minivans with tinted windows-- "Black  Nellies," picket members suspected.    In those moments, many felt themselves lost, helpless,  and.... unneeded. What do you do--shout in the middle of the  night, in the center of the city getting ready to turn in for  the night? Demand somebody or something? Deputy mayors, heads of  rayon administrations were here; together with everyone else,  shivering in the wind, these people stood outside their office  building--now unemployed. They had been dismissed from jobs  without any explanations, practically across the board--new  bureaucrats, or to be precise, bureaucrats who had formerly held  these jobs--already had been appointed. The circle had closed;  the system had regenerated itself, rejecting a "foreign  body...." Someone in the crowd kept repeating in amazement: "But  why Tolstoshein? He had nearly the lowest rating during the  mayoral elections--the people rejected him.... How can he,  without blinking an eye, take the place of a person still  there!" But nobody listened to these questions anymore--they  were academic.    "What do you intend to do now?" the indefatigable ones kept  pressing Gilgenberg. "How will events develop, anyway?"    "I remain a deputy to the kray duma. I will be meeting with  my constituents. If necessary, right on the street. Let people  see what can be done to the law here...."    Cherepkov was carried out from the building at past 0100.    "OMON soldiers were carrying the mayor feet first," said  T.G.  Romanenko, a candidate for kray duma deputy who kept vigil in  the building until almost 0300. "There were so many people in  camouflage uniforms that you could not see Cherepkov  himself--only an occasional glimpse of sock-clad feet...."    This is how the incident in the mayoralty was carried out.  Promptly and successfully. In the morning, numerous documents  were read on the radio, explaining that since the mayor was  suspected of committing a grave criminal offense (bribes), he  had been temporarily--until the investigation was  completed--removed from duty. The "temporary" nature of the act  of deposing the mayor elected by the people was emphasized in  the official comments many times. Each step in the seizure of  the mayoralty was dressed in argumentation. Everything  apparently exudes legitimacy and only legitimacy.    Nevertheless, it was all too thin. "Temporarily" put on the  sidelines? Then why an equally rash destruction of the entire  administrative structure created under Cherepkov? Such a hasty  dismissal of personnel? Have they also been identified wholesale  as criminals, or at least suspects? Cherepkov had not been able  for months to get rid of obvious saboteurs--his deputies and  rayon heads--because of all sorts of procedural red tape. Here,  however, several minutes were enough--exactly as long as it  takes to read out the personnel "sentence."    And also, there is this disturbing bravura march, the  coronation speech on the occasion of the mew mayor assuming his  duties. It was as if a magic tablecloth had been spread before  the stunned city residents--transportation, dacha, merchandise,  social and charitable goodies.... Which horn of abundance did it  all come from? In what warehouses had it all been hidden from  the city residents, exhausted by adversity? What billions and  millions are behind it? If only this could all be true. Except  that somehow one feels sad at this promised feast....</p>

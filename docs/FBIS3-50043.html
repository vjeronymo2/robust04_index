			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Zhelyu Zhelev; place and </F> date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria:    Over the last two years, I have had to address you three  times on the subject of crime. The last address was in  parliament at the beginning of June 1993. At that time, I  insistently requested the National Assembly to give priority to  adopting the fundamental laws on the court, the police, and  state employees, as well as the necessary amendments to the  Penal and Penal Procedural Codes. All of this had to be done in  order to stop organized crime, which threatens us more and more  every day.    Unfortunately, certain deputies at the time viewed my  address  as a populist move, aimed to enhance my popularity, rather than  an attempt on my part to seek a constructive solution to the  problems.    Now -- seven months later and after a series of dramatic  events that showed the existence of organized crime in a  dangerous scope and the elements of the Mafia, or at least the  existence of preconditions of a Mafia emergence -- the same  people pretend to be surprised and try to pass the  responsibility off to the executive power, mostly to the police.    I am far from exonerating the police and the executive  power,  because they bear a large part of the responsibility. However,  I am puzzled by the fact that, while a danger exists for the  legal order in our country, responsible institutions, political  forces, and individual politicians continue to seek political  dividends in the tragedy that occurred. Instead of realizing  their own responsibility for the country's situation, they pass  the guilt on to each other -- the parliament to the police and  the government, the police to the court and the Prosecutor's  Office, the court and the Prosecutor's Office to the court and  the investigative bodies, the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to  the Union of the Democratic Forces [SDS], the SDS to the BSP,  and so forth. This game is extremely dangerous, perhaps even  lethal, for the state. I would like to remind you that crime  does not distinguish between party colors and political  convictions. It is directed against each one of us. Therefore,  the political forces and the state institutions must not  mutually seek each other's shortcomings but should unite their  efforts against organized crime and corruption, with each one  doing their share of the work.    The cabinet, being the executive power, must show whether it  really can govern and whether it has the courage and will to  implement its functions and guarantee order and calm in the  country, as well as preserve the citizens' lives, property,  honor, and dignity. The parliament, which for two years now has  violated the constitutional requirements of anything related to  the judicial system structure, must finally adopt with priority  the necessary amendments to the Penal and Penal Procedural  Codes, the bill on the judiciary's structure, and the bill on  the state employee. Without adopting the bill on the judicial  system and really and fully completing the structure of this  system with a supreme administrative court, a supreme court of  appeals, and local courts of appeals, Bulgaria will not have an  independent and efficient judiciary that could battle against  organized crime and the budding Mafia.    We expect the police, investigative authorities, the  Prosecutor's Office, and the courts to immediately adopt  energetic and bold steps aimed at imprisoning the criminals. I  insist that all cases of overt banditry be investigated rapidly  and without any pity.    The corrupt and inefficient employees of the Ministry of  Interior, especially the leadership, must go in order to  preserve the honor of the Bulgarian policemen who work under  exceptionally grave conditions. There are too many responsible  state officials and politicians who send nameless denunciations  and speak anonymously about corruption and crime in the realm of  the executive. Taking its cue from those denunciations, the  press constantly write about corruption in the high echelons of  the power. By doing so, certain newspapers are trying to suggest  that all those who work there are corrupt. It is high time to  speak clearly, precisely, and openly on this matter and point  out specific names, facts, and documents. It is high time for  the political forces to adopt their share of the responsibility,  rather than wash their hands with political declarations and  statements against crime. They must adopt the necessary laws in  the parliament, as well as identify any corrupt politicians in  their own ranks. This must be done, because there is nothing  more pathetic than political forces that claim they are  struggling against crime and yet they simultaneously tolerate  people in their ranks who own a large-size financial property of  an unclear origin.    It is not the Bulgarian citizens who should fear the  criminals who walk free, but rather the criminals should fear  the law and understand that wherever they hide, the judiciary  will find them and punish them.    As far as I am concerned, I will not leave a single state  institution or service in peace that could assist in the  struggle against crime until it begins to service appropriately.</p>

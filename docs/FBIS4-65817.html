			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nicola Mancino, Popular Party Senate floor </F> leader, by Gianluca Luzi on 19 May; place not given: "This Is  How Our Opposition Will Be Pending a Return Match"]    [Text] Rome -- Just 24 hours later, the chairman of the PPI  [Italian Popular Party] senators no longer wore the frown that  marked his expression after the vote of confidence in the  government. The rebels who disobeyed the party in order to  salvage [Prime Minister] Berlusconi played a nasty trick on him,  but Nicola Mancino has succeeded in keeping the PPI in  opposition, as promised.    [Luzi] Senator Mancino, what is meant by "neither blind nor  hostile opposition"?    [Mancino] Our aim is to work in the country's interest. This  means we will not constitute a confrontational opposition, we  will not seek polar confrontations. This is the last thing that  those, such as ourselves, who have the ambitious plan to break  up the artificial coalitions that came about during the election  campaign can permit themselves to do. Dialogue will bring about  a thaw and will bring to light the very many inconsistencies  already present within this majority.    [Luzi] Do you see many inconsistencies?    [Mancino] There is no agreement on the concept of the  country's unity and indivisibility. In foreign policy there is  still cause to be wary, both with regard to the not entirely  placated forms of nationalism (I am talking about the revision  of borders) and to the single European currency. As for the  economy, this emphatically announced neoliberalist stance needs  to be thoroughly clarified. Will the welfare system continue to  be afforded an important position, or will it be scaled down,  causing the most disadvantaged sectors to become completely  neglected?    [Luzi] Do you long for a return to welfarism? Do you not  think that there has been too much of that?    [Mancino] This is a criticism that the DC [Christian  Democratic Party] used to make of itself, because in the past 15  years the gains in the welfare system were undermined by an  exaggerated welfarism.    [Luzi] That was called cronyism.    [Mancino] Partly that. There were all kinds of things -- the  conservation of the ruling bloc, the limitation or exclusion of  imagination in production... If Berlusconi is aiming to create  a million new jobs within two years, he can do it, inasmuch as  already the forecasts for this year indicate an increase of at  least 400,000. But we must beware of undermining the recovery.  In order to achieve this target it is necessary not to try to  go too far. The issue of the South is a crucial one; but  specifically on the topic of southern Italy resistance and  conflicts could occur within the coalition.    [Luzi] Rather than criticisms, these sound like suggestions  to Berlusconi. Is the economy the most fertile field for  understanding with the government?    [Mancino] Unquestionably.    [Luzi] Does that mean that in connection with the Finance  Bill you will display generous attention to the government's  proposals?    [Mancino] To create new jobs is not the prerogative of the  majority forces alone; the responsibility of the opposition  forces will be measured on this too.    [Luzi] One of the inconsistencies that you mentioned in the  Senate was the prime minister's dual role, including that of  owner of a number of television channels. What does the PPI  think Berlusconi should do?    [Mancino] This is the most serious problem. When the power  of information becomes concentrated in the hands of a single  person -- either through ownership (Fininvest) or by virtue of  his status (the administration of RAI [State Radio and  Television]), there is a real, not merely potential, danger of a  limitation of the scope for freedom. Good intentions are not  enough; it is not enough to move away from the news production  centers. There must be a relinquishment. There is already an  incompatibility between the role of prime minister and ownership  of television channels. True, a businessman cannot be prevented  from engaging in politics, but when you choose to serve the  interest of the community, you must eliminate these  inconsistencies; and in this instance there is a formal and  substantive inconsistency.    [Luzi] If and when you approve some government measure or  another you will be voting the same way as the National Alliance  [AN]. Does this prospect embarrass you?    [Mancino] I do not think it embarrasses us. This raises a  more general issue. What [AN leader] Mr. Fini must come to  terms with is not my nostalgic feelings, but the nostalgia for  banners, flags, and blackjacks not unconnected with the  political tradition of his old MSI [Italian Social Movement].  The Rautis, the Buontempos, Miss Mussolini, the Maceratinis,  and the Tremaglias are not insignificant figures in Parliament.  In order to become a European-style moderate Right it is  necessary to shed these people. A cosmetic operation is not  enough.    [Luzi] You have said that within the opposition you will  "never become confused with left-wing cartels." Will there be  no battles waged jointly with the progressive forces?    [Mancino] There will definitely be battles to guarantee and  defend freedoms. Of course, this cannot authorize anyone to  talk in terms of regressive associationism. We want to create a  center capable of achieving groupings after it has undermined  the stability of alignments that we still consider unnatural.    [Luzi] In other words, you want to bring Forza Italia into  the center.    [Mancino] Yes. I think that the objective must be not only  to bring Forza Italia into the center: The objective is to win  back our traditional electorate. The recent CEI [Italian  Episcopal Conference] document stressed the need for the  presence of a Christian-inspired party. With such a party there  is a nonexclusive preferential relationship. It is up to the  secularist Christians active in politics to recompose the  fragmented area lying both to the Right and to the Left of the  PPI. When we have won back our electorate, the strategy of  coalitions will not be a chimera for us and we will present a  less fragile political proposal than that which we presented for  the general elections.    [Luzi] With which allies?    [Mancino] The frame of reference could be a group situated  to  our Right -- and Forza Italia is definitely situated to our  Right -- and a group situated to our Left, if the idea of a  democratic alliance embodying Liberal, Republican, and Socialist  tendencies materializes.    [Luzi] But that is the old five-party alliance...    [Mancino] It is not. It is something new born from the ruins  of the five-party alliance.    [Luzi] What about the Left?    [Mancino] The Left is the other aspect of the old system.  The collapse of the old majorities was accompanied also by the  collapse of the idea of a left-wing government, and this defeat  makes the crisis of the left-wing coalition much more serious  and profound than the sharp defeat suffered by the Popular  Party. The potential for recovery is more on our side than  theirs.    [Luzi] What does it feel like to be in opposition for the  first time?    [Mancino] Personally, it feels like a transition, therefore  like a change. I still wonder, will we succeed? Can we  recover? Do people understand the new effort that is being made?  So the experience borders on an existential and political  crisis. While on the one hand there is a feeling of depression,  on the other hand there is the impetus to carry on in order to  recover.    [Luzi] Opposition means remoteness from power...    [Mancino] It purifies...    [Luzi] Yes, it purifies, but it has already lost you the CCD  [Christian Democratic Center] and yesterday it lost you four  senators...    [Mancino] We have not lost them. I have heard from them,  listened to them. There is a desire to return, to remain full  members of the PPI. In any case, they have been suspended, not  expelled...    [Luzi] What would have happened if the government had  fallen?    [Mancino] It would have made our strategy more clearly  understood, and even Berlusconi would have realized that he is  not invincible. In other words, that politics is not the Milan  soccer club...</p>

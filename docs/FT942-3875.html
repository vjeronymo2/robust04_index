			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (11): EC design prize can show company culture at its best There was a time when the only real attraction for architecture enthusiasts visiting the Basle region was Le Corbusier's Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp. These days there is another: the extraordinary collection of contemporary architecture commissioned by Vitra, the Swiss office furniture company, at its production plant in Weil-am-Rhein across the German border, for which it has been awarded one of this year's EC Design Prizes. The Weil site - which includes factories by Nicholas Grimshaw and Alvaro Siza, the museum designed by Frank Gehry, Tadao Ando's conference centre and the expressionistic flurry of Zaha Hadid's fire station - attracts 40,000 visitors a year, many of whom make a special trip to see it. Vitra opened yet another landmark building last month when it moved into its new headquarters designed by Frank Gehry in a Basle suburb. There is a commercial sub-text to Vitra's architectural passion. The company, which was founded as a shopfitter in the 1930s, was the European manufacturer for Hermann Miller, the US furniture group, until 1984. It has since made its own way in the office furniture field by working with freelance designers such as Mario Bellini, Philippe Starck and Jasper Morrison. The publicity generated by its buildings, together with the fact that many of the people trooping around the Weil site are architects who could eventually become customers, has undoubtedly helped Vitra to establish itself as an independent entity. Rolf Fehlbaum, the chairman, who initiated the construction programme after the old factory was damaged by fire in 1981, is convinced that Vitra's employees have also benefited - not only from working in a visually stimulating environment, but from liaising with different architects. He sees the collaborative experience as a valuable complement to Vitra's 'trial and error' approach to working with its own designers. 'A project like this isn't a folly or fantasy, it's part of the company's culture,' he says. 'It's a financially feasible project with practical benefits that also send a clear message to our customers.' The company's financial figures corroborate his analysis. Since the break with Hermann Miller the company has quadrupled its turnover from SFr56m in 1984 to SFr210m last year. Its success in this year's European Union Design Prize is indicative of its status in the design sphere. Vitra is now moving in a new direction, developing new office systems to take account of the technological changes which are transforming working patterns. It has also called a halt to its architectural schemes. 'We don't need any more buildings,' says Rolf Fehlbaum. 'Not now, at least.'</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem plunges to Pounds 3m and sheds property side JOHN MOWLEM, the UK construction group, yesterday continued the trend of disappointing results from the sector and announced a sharp fall in profits mainly due to poor figures from its scaffolding subsidiary SGB. Mowlem also announced more than Pounds 20m of extraordinary and exceptional provisions to cover its withdrawal from commercial property development and the termination of two housing joint ventures, although it will continue its wholly owned housing business John Mowlem Homes. The company reported a pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 34m to Pounds 3m in the year to December 31. This follows a more than 50 per cent fall at the interim stage, when no provisions were made, from Pounds 18m to Pounds 7m. But Sir Philip Beck, chairman, hoped for improved performances this year from housing and tool hire. 'We're encouraged by the election and hope the housing market will now begin to grow and lead to a recovery for the whole construction industry,' he said. Mowlem is recommending cutting its total dividend to 10.5p (21p), which is uncovered, after a final dividend of 4.85p (15.35p). Analysts expected a heftier dividend cut and the shares gained 13p to 148p on the news. Turnover fell to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.52bn) due to lower sales from contracting and scaffolding. Operating profits fell to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 41.6m) after accounting for redundancy and restructuring costs of Pounds 5.2m. Hardest hit was scaffolding, where operating profits dropped to Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 37.7m) due to volume and margin pressure. Staff numbers have been reduced by 25 per cent, taking about Pounds 8m out of overheads, and further reductions are planned if volumes continue to fall. Contracting increased operating profits to Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 5.9m). There would have been no increase without Pounds 3m of bad debt charges in 1990. The division's order book has continued to decline, to Pounds 700m from about Pounds 1.1bn two years ago. Sir Philip remained optimistic for London City Airport, in which Mowlem holds a 90 per cent stake, despite uncertainty about the extension of the Jubilee Line following property developer Olympia &amp; York's debt refinancing talks. Housebuilding was affected by recession throughout the sector and average prices fell from Pounds 86,000 to Pounds 72,000. Nevertheless, the company maintained sales of 400 units and the division returned to a profit of Pounds 1.6m (loss Pounds 2.4m). Net interest payable fell sharply to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 8.2m). Interest receivable increased to Pounds 12.7m, helped by the proceeds of last year's Pounds 46m rights issue. Mowlem made exceptional provisions for losses of Pounds 7.2m, of which Pounds 3m related to the termination of the joint venture property developments. There was also a Pounds 2m deficit in the accounts of a French subsidiary, which the company will seek to recover, and Pounds 2.2m of previously concealed prior year losses. Mowlem refused to comment further, saying the matter is sub judice. The company is making an extraordinary provision, less taxation, of Pounds 13.3m to cover the withdrawal from commercial property. There was a loss per ordinary share of 2.2p (earnings 23.7p). Losses attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 15.4m profit) and, combined with the interest bill, a Pounds 26.6m transfer from reserves was needed. See Lex</p>

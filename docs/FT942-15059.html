			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Way clear for Forza Italia chief: Right-wing allies see their candidates elected as speakers The slow constitutional procedure for forming a new Italian government grinds into gear this week when President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro begins talks with the leaders of political parties. It is now a virtual certainty that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, will be called upon to head the next government, but he is unlikely to be given the mandate until after April 25. On April 25 Italy celebrates the nation's liberation from fascism and Nazi occupation. President Scalfaro is said to be anxious to avoid this being turned into a destabilising demonstration against the new right-wing government that is backed by the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance which is inspired by the ideals of Mussolini. The way was opened at the weekend for forming the next government by the election of the speakers of the two houses of parliament. The Freedom Alliance, composed of three main parties - Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist Northern League, and the National Alliance - and the small Christian Democrat Centre succeeded in having both their candidates elected. This is the first time in Italy's post-war parliamentary history that a future governing alliance has sought to impose its own candidates and not seek a broader consensus with the opposition. The move was intended as a deliberate break with the past where the opposition was co-opted into being part of the political system by agreeing to share some of the senior offices of state - such as the speaker of the chamber of deputies. The new speaker of the chamber of deputies is Ms Irene Pivetti, a militant catholic aged 31, who was first elected as a League deputy in 1992. She is the youngest speaker ever and was elected with 347 of the 617 votes cast in the 630-seat chamber. Ms Pivetti raised some eyebrows by her acceptance speech in which she openly dedicated herself to God and ignored both the traditional homage to the outgoing speaker, Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the highly respected former communist, and the normal respectful address of the house members as 'honourable'. In the Senate, the Freedom Alliance candidate Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, a Liberal senator who defected to Forza Italia, just managed to win on the fourth round against outgoing speaker Mr Giovanni Spadolini by 162 votes against 161. After the first round of voting on Friday, which Mr Scognamiglio lost, Mr Berlusconi warned fresh general elections might be necessary. This threat brought a sharp rebuke from President Scalfaro.</p>

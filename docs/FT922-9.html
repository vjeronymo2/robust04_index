			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Slow start for Globex with less active contracts GLOBEX, the 24-hours-a-day futures and options trading system launched last week, has got off to a slow start, but its longer-term prospects are still hard to gauge as key contracts have not yet been listed. On its first full day's trading on Friday. the system traded just 2,000 contracts. The bulk of this was in DM/dollar and yen/dollar contracts, which notched up 1,000 and 800 contracts respectively. Yesterday, volume slipped to 1,700 contracts. Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex, which is backed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, said: 'I am very pleased with the way the system has performed.' Mr Ginter said he was encouraged by the quality of the market, with narrow bid/offer spreads and a broad geographic range of business. So far Globex screens are on-line in Paris and London as well as the US. The CBOT has not yet been authorised by the UK Treasury, however, so its 10-year Treasury contract cannot be traded in London, where it would provide a useful hedging instrument for swap dealers. The contract is traded until 10.30pm local time in Chicago, so the prospects for any increase are slim ahead of UK authorisation, which is expected soon. The low level of trading is not unexpected. Less active contracts were chosen initially to test the system. Exchange-listed currency derivative products are not widely used in Europe, where there is a large over-the-counter market in such instruments. Some market participants predict a shift towards exchange-traded foreign exchange business, however, as concerns about counterparty credit risk mount. This could favour Globex. Interest in the system will not be fully tested until the most actively-traded products become available in the next few months. Mr Martin Booth, a director on Barclays de Zoete Wedd's futures desk, said: 'The real launch will be when the Eurodollar contract is listed.' Even the Eurodollar contract faces a tough battle, however. The contract is already traded on Simex, the Singapore exchange, and Liffe in London - although volume there is not high - as well as in Chicago and some traders argue that after-hours trading is not needed. The Eurodollar contract, with 30-year Treasury and Libor contracts, will be listed in the next 75 days, following the listing of other currency contracts and two and five-year note contracts in the next two weeks. The system could face problems if a critical mass is not created. The head of a futures brokerage in London said: 'It's difficult to motivate staff when there's no business going through.' At Dollars 800 a month for each terminal, the costs deter some market participants. In an effort to encourage business, Reuters has waived transaction fees of 50 cents per trade for the first four months, and for a further two months in the case of marketmakers. The exchanges have cut the Globex charges per contract for six months, and for 12 months for market-makers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 16 Jun (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister  Faris Buwayz revealed that the United States has conveyed to  Lebanon the U.S. "clarifications" about what is happening on the  Jordanian-Israeli track in which it stressed that Washington  does not regard this action as a deviation from Madrid's Middle  East peace conference mechanism but sees it as an aspect of it.  He said that these clarifications emphasized that no agreement  has been signed between the Jordanian and Israeli sides.    In a report he submitted to the Lebanese cabinet last night,  Buwayz said that U.S. Ambassador in Lebanon Mark Hambley brought  him these clarifications yesterday to have them conveyed to the  Lebanese Government.    The Lebanese foreign minister expressed his belief that the  Jordanians' objective from this action is to lift the U.S. siege  on the Gulf of al-'Aqabah and to obtain an economic and  financial share in the economic agreement between the PLO and  Israel which is required by the Gaza-Jericho agreement on  Palestinian self-rule.    President Ilyas al-Hirawi briefed the cabinet last night on  the outcome of the Lebanese-Syrian summit talks that he held  with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus the day before  yesterday.    Informed sources said that al-Hirawi unveiled a  Syrian-Lebanese agreement to draw up a joint action plan to face  the U.S. pressure that the two countries are expecting to be  exerted on them in the next few weeks following the recent  developments in the Jordanian-Israeli track.    The sources added that al-Hirawi conveyed to al-Asad  Lebanon's fears following reports that Syria and Israel might  reach an agreement, leaving Lebanon to face Israel's political,  security, and military pressures alone. They said that the  Syrian president stressed to al-Hirawi that his country would  not agree to peace and to withdrawal from the Golan before the  fate of Lebanon's south and western al-Biqa' are decided.    Al-Hirawi also told the cabinet that al-Asad stressed to him  Syria's readiness to approve the mechanism for the Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan within a period not to exceed six  months after security and peace are achieved.</p>

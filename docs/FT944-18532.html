			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Muted sighs of relief after FOMC meeting - New York The sighs of relief when the Federal Reserve decided against an immediate credit tightening last week were muted. The leading market indices managed to add a few points in the aftermath, but most analysts expect them to reverse course before too long. This week it may become more apparent why the enthusiasm of investors has been restrained, even though few had predicted an early move by the Fed, and not many would have welcomed one. Interest rates are approaching a level at which the appeal of equities would diminish, analysts say. With that in mind, the stock market is closely tracking the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond, which is sure to rise or fall in response to any change in monetary policy. Most investment strategists see the 8.00 per cent level as a red flag for equities. Late on Friday, the long bond was bid at about 7.83 per cent, compared with 7.79 per cent before the Federal Open Market Committee's policy-making session on Tuesday. When the FOMC meeting ended with no statement - save a terse announcement that the meeting had adjourned - Fed watchers were quick to put an unfavourable spin on the form chosen by the central bank to frame its traditional reticence. The statement was interpreted as a signal that the FOMC had authorised Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to increase rates as soon as he sees irrefutable evidence that the economy is growing at an unmanageable pace. He may not have to wait very long. This week brings the most keenly watched economic report of the month. On Friday, the Labor Department will release September employment data which is expected by analysts to show a gain of 250,000 in non-farm payrolls. An excessive rise may not cause Mr Greenspan to act immediately. He may want to consider next Friday's data on industrial production before making a decision. But a big jump in payrolls is likely to trigger an instant reaction in the stock market, as investors anticipate what would then seem to be inevitable. A month earlier, Wall Street was pleasantly surprised by a payroll increase of just 179,000, which helped lift share prices to their mid-September highs and perhaps persuaded the FOMC to stand pat last week. This time, however, a stronger than expected surge in August industrial production suggests that manufacturers may have taken on more workers in September than analysts have calculated. Against this unfavourable backdrop, the third-quarter reporting season has arrived. Wall Street is expecting strong results. If this week's first arrivals fail to impress, the negative sentiment could spill over into related stocks.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cookson and JM may merge Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, and Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, are considering a merger. The two companies, which have grown closer over the past 12 months, said yesterday that discussions were at a relatively early stage. But it is understood that if a deal is done, events will move quickly, possibly being completed by the end of the year. Any recommendations to shareholders would 'be based on the relative contributions of each company to the merged group,' the two companies said. Mr David Davies, chairman and chief executive of Johnson Matthey, has made no secret of his ambition to take the company into the FT-SE 100 Index. The two companies would have a combined market capitalisation of about Pounds 2.5bn, annual sales of Pounds 3.5bn and forecast profits of more than Pounds 200m. JM, which reports its interim results on November 24, is expected to make pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 90m for the financial year ending March. Cookson, which is expected to make profits of about Pounds 115m in the year to end-December before restructuring costs, has been turned round by Mr Richard Oster, its flamboyant US chief executive. He has taken the group out of its non-core businesses, selling 25 engineering subsidiaries earlier this year. Last December Cookson bought JM's jewellery materials operations for Pounds 37m, and in March the two linked their ceramics interests in a venture that made them number two in the world market. The latter deal was described by Mr Oster at the time as 'a sort of dream come true'. The logical step towards a full-blown merger is thought to have been instigated by Mr Robert Malpas, Cookson's chairman. He would be likely to remain on the board of the new company as a non-executive director. Mr Davies is expected to be chairman. He took on the additional role of chief executive at JM only in March after Mr Richard Wakeling resigned. Mr Oster would be chief executive. It is not the first time that Cookson has taken an interest in JM; it took a stake in the late 1980s, but had to sell. The deals between the two companies over the last year have led to a much more friendly atmosphere this time.</p>

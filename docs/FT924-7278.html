The December contract started quite firm at 2,695, despite the gloomy weekend media comment and good two-way business meant a slow rise in the morning session. However, weak gilts and short sterling opened up arbitraging opportunities as December traded at a par or below its fair value level for most of the session. December reached its high point of the day of 2,708 at lunchtime. In the afternoon, firmer sentiment that interest rates would remain at 8 per cent for the rest of the year depressed the mood, which together with a weak opening on Wall Street combined to send December down. A minor rally was staged in later trading, although dealers said that the sombre mood would overhang the market at tomorrow's opening. December closed at 2,684, a discount of some five points to its fair value level of around nine. Volume was 8,177 contracts. A quiet traded options market saw 21,676 contracts traded of which nearly 8,000 was in the FT-SE 100. British Steel was the top traded option with 1,316 contracts, the July 40 puts at 5p notching up 400 in one trade. Next came Barclays (1,076 contacts), Asda (1,010) and British Gas (764).</p>

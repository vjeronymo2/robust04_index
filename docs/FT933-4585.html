			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson loss rises to Pounds 11.4m BROWN &amp; JACKSON, owner of the Poundstretcher discount retail chain, fell deeper into the red in the first half of 1993. The pre-tax loss increased from Pounds 9.73m to Pounds 11.45m. However, Mr Ian Gray, chief executive, said yesterday that the group historically had made a loss in the first half as Poundstretcher is highly dependent on Christmas trading, with 50 per cent of turnover coming between September and December. Turnover rose by 4.7 per cent from Pounds 63.8m to Pounds 66.8m. The group said like-for-like sales in Poundstretcher were 5.5 per cent ahead. Toiletry sales rose 30 per cent and confectionery sales 20 per cent. B&amp;J, which operates 230 stores, is now one year into its three-year recovery plan. Three months ago it had a Pounds 21m rights issue, its second in just over a year, to reduce borrowings and finance a store opening programme. Interest payments fell in the half to Pounds 851,000 against Pounds 2.12m and the company had net cash of Pounds 2.1m at June 30. Losses per share fell from 5.4p to 2.5p. Mr Gray said yesterday that significant progress had been made with the group's recovery plan. He blamed the increased loss on margin reductions from the clearance of slow-moving stock early in the year, and more than Pounds 2m of capital expenditure, including the installation of an electronic point of sale system. Working capital had been cut, mainly through a 10 per cent reduction in stocks. This had been achieved without the benefits of Epos and at a time of rising sales. There is no interim dividend.</p>

If the employee is restored to duty at a date later than the original adverse action, credit for intervening periods of nonpay status or breaks in service is given in accordance with other provisions of this subsection. If the employee had been properly separated from the rolls of the agency before a finding was made that the adverse action was unwarranted or improper, the correction and additional service credit given the employee may not extend beyond the date of the proper separation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (iv) Intervening service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain types of service that ordinarily are not creditable are counted when they intervene between two periods of creditable service without a single break in service in excess of 30 calendar days, excepted as provided in subparagraph (H) of his paragraph.

Specialists are  thinking through its prospects. The head of the general  machine-building design bureau, (?Aleksey Prusanov), said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS that a feasibility study for the entire  complex will be ready by the end of 1994. The document will  envisage the use of initially two and subsequently five silos  for launching light booster rockets, and the creation of two  launchpads for heavy booster rockets. A missile division used  to be stationed on the site where the cosmodrome is being built.  The site will be several times smaller in size after it has been  converted for its new purpose. The reclaimed land will be  returned to the state.</p>

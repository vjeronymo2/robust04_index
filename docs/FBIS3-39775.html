Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Deputy Defense Minister  Nikolaos Kouris stressed that Greece focuses on finding a  peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papoulias said he  hopes the crisis in Bosnia will be overcome if, as he said, a  mortar does not hit Sarajevo's market again.    Discussing the withdrawal of AWACS from Aktion base,  Papoulias said NATO knew that Greece was not going to  participate in any military operation against Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Kouris said it is Greece's sovereign right to decide on the  AWACS and non-participation in the crisis. Referring to the  possibility of air raids against Sarajevo, Kouris said anything  is possible.    Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos appeared optimistic,  saying he hopes there will be no military moves after NATO's  ultimatum expires tonight. He added that every side gave  assurances that UN political dialogue will proceed in order to  resolve the Bosnian problem peacefully.</p>

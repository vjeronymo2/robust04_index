			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Drivers warned in insurance probe Police investigating an alleged insurance fraud yesterday arrested two men and seized documents and a computer in Lancaster. Detectives appealed for car owners who answered advertisements from Mono Services and received insurance cover notes in the name of London Associated Insurance to come forward. The advertisements have appeared in newspapers in Lancashire, Liverpool and the Manchester area, and in Exchange and Mart magazine. Detectives warned that anybody with the cover notes was uninsured and should not drive until they had arranged alternative cover.</p>

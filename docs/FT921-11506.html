			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: BMW expects sales to expand BMW, the German maker of luxury cars, expects to produce and sell even more cars in 1992 after a year in which turnover rose by 10 per cent to DM29.8bn (Dollars 18.6bn) and profits showed a further increase. Despite his optimism about this year's performance, however, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, the chief executive, expressed some misgivings about world economic trends. He also called for more moderate wage and fiscal trends in Germany as the post-unity boom slowed down. BMW, which has benefited from high demand for the latest generation of its compact 3-series model, lifted car output put by 6.5 per cent to 553,000 units; this was despite some disruption during the changeover to the new model. Motor-cycle production, accounting for only a small proportion of its total business, was 8 per cent higher at 32,000 units. Like other domestic and foreign producers, BMW experienced a big jump in its home market sales which increased by 21 per cent to 233,000 cars. German demand has been stimulated by unification as east Germans have bought western cars for the first time and many west Germans have sold their cars into a buoyant second-hand market. The company gave no profit figures, but said its results had improved again last year. In 1990, pre-tax profits were 6.5 per cent higher at DM1.7bn and net profits up by 25 per cent to DM696m, helped by a lower tax bill.</p>

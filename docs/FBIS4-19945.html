			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris April 21 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister  Antonin Baudys discussed means of drawing up military budgets  and army modernisation programmes with chairman of the French  Parliamentary Defence and Security Committee Jacques Boyon  today, Baudys told journalists.    Cooperation with France was very interesting for the Czech  Republic, Baudys said, because besides Sweden, France was the  only country that was increasing its military budget for the  purpose of modernising its conventional weapons.    The reason for the modernisation programme was not that  France had outdated military technology but that "it realises  that after the collapse of the bipolar world, that longed-for  time when all of us head towards peace has not yet come. There  are various pitfalls. They just want to be ready and have a good  army, which is France's tradition," he said.    Baudys today began a three-day official visit to France at  the invitation of his French counterpart Francois Leotard.    Baudys told reporters both countries were preparing for the  first joint Franco-Czech military exercises, to be held in June  this year. Beginning in the Czech Republic and continuing in  France, they will represent a very good foundation for future  cooperation and resume the interwar tradition of good  Franco-Czechoslovak relations in the military sphere which were  interrupted by the communist regime, he said.</p>

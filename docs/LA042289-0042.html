			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACT REACHED ON OLVERA ST. FUTURE STARTS TO UNRAVEL  </P> <P> No sooner had an agreement been reached to end the bickering over the future of  Olvera Street then a new dispute surfaced between two prominent Latino  politicians -- Rep. Edward R. Roybal and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard  Alatorre -- that threatens the truce.  </P> <P> At issue is whether Olvera Street's 77 merchants can link up with a developer  of their choosing and bid on the long-awaited city modernization project to  spruce up the popular but aging tourist spot just north of the Civic Center.  </P> <P> Initially, merchants said they were worried that the renovation would go to a  developer who would allow them little or no say in the project and who might  evict them. Most of them have been on the street since its founding in 1929.  </P> <P> The merchants said they were suspicious that the East Los Angeles Community  Union, which has strong ties to Alatorre, would be chosen for the project and  would turn it into an "overly commercialized Mexican Disneyland," according to  Vivien Bonzo, president of the Olvera Street Merchants Assn.  </P> <P> With Roybal (D-Los Angeles), Mayor Tom Bradley, Alatorre and others, a  compromise was struck last month. Under the pact, the merchants would be  offered a chance to become part owners of the project. They would also get  relocation costs while their shops and restaurants were being renovated, and a  study the merchants commissioned two years ago would become the blueprint for  the remodeling.  </P> <P> But the agreement, hammered out in the days before the April 11 municipal  primary election, started unraveling this week in a dispute over whether the  compromise precluded the merchants from also bidding for the project itself.  </P> <P> Roybal, patriarch of local Latino politicians, favors allowing the merchants to  bid on the project to preserve the street's historical and cultural integrity.  He cited a city attorney's opinion that said there was nothing that precluded  the merchants from being chosen as developer for the project.  </P> <P> But Alatorre, in whose district Olvera Street is located, contends that there  is no need to let the merchants bid on the project because the compromise would  allow them to have some control over it.  </P> <P> Eastside observers said the project could have started as early as next year,  but the fallout from the new dispute throws that timetable into doubt.  </P> <P> "This blows the deal and will delay the work that Olvera Street desperately  needs," one Latino insider said Friday.  </P> <P> Alatorre chose his words carefully when asked about the dispute.  </P> <P> "The bidding is not in the understanding that we negotiated," Alatorre said.  "This could be a whole different ballgame."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bidding Proviso  </P> <P> Roybal, reached at his Washington office, said although the bidding proviso was  not written into the agreement, it was clearly understood by everyone who was  party to the pact, including Alatorre, that the merchants would be allowed to  bid for the project.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry that Richard doesn't agree or like the idea," the veteran  congressman said, "but as far a I'm concerned, it's in the agreement."  </P> <P> The agreement was seen as a way to end the rancor that has dogged the Olvera  Street project since the discussions over improvements were initiated in 1987.  While attracting nearly 2 million visitors a year, the Mexican-theme tourist  marketplace has fallen on hard times because of deteriorating buildings, a lack  of parking and rising crime in the area.  </P> <P> Roybal, a longtime supporter of the merchants, called on Bradley to push a  compromise earlier this month. The merchants' concerns were so important to  Roybal that he insisted on Bradley's support before he would endorse the mayor  for reelection, Roybal said.  </P> <P> Mayoral endorsements by his daughter, Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard  (D-Los Angeles), and City Councilwoman Gloria Molina were also tied to the  mayor's support of the merchants, he said.  </P> <P> "I wanted to have a news conference of elected public officials to make an  endorsement of the mayor," Roybal said, "but this had to be resolved first."  </P> <P> Left unresolved was the merchants' demand that they be allowed to bid for the  project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advice Sought  </P> <P> Roybal said he telephoned the mayor early this month about it, and Bradley  asked the city attorney's office for advice on the question. A few days later  -- just before the election -- the city attorney issued an opinion that said no  conflict of interest would exist if the merchants who purchased equity in the  project were also chosen as developer.  </P> <P> The situation has Alatorre fuming.  </P> <P> "It was clear since the beginning that they weren't interested in bidding on  the development itself," Alatorre contended. "They were more interested in an  equity position. We put (in) the 50% equity clause to insure that they wouldn't  be thrown into the cold."  </P></p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Bosnian Serbs 'to sign truce' Bosnian Serb leaders last night said they would sign a four-month ceasefire agreement today while the Moslem-led Bosnian government called in a senior UN official for last-minute negotiations. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, and General Ratko Mladic, Serb military commander, at noon today will sign the cessation of hostilities, on one side, and General Sir Michael Rose, Commander of UN forces in Bosnia, on the other. However, in an ominous note for the ceasefire, about 30 shells yesterday hit the Bihac town centre, a UN 'safe area', slightly wounding a UN peacekeeper. After talks in Sarajevo, Gen Rose said: 'The ball is in their court, not in ours any more,' in regard to the Bosnian government, which urged him to put more muscle into the ceasefire agreement. Fearing the truce will freeze Serb military gains, the government is seeking the withdrawal of Serb forces round the northwestern enclave of Bihac and the demilitarisation of Sarajevo. Mr Yasushi Akashi, top UN envoy in former Yugoslavia, will travel to Sarajevo in an effort to persuade the Bosnian government to endorse the truce, which was due to come into force tomorrow. It is calling for the opening roads to the city - a more ambitious proposal than the deal negotiated earlier this month by Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president. Sarajevo yesterday ended its 1,000th day under siege. Bosnian Serb leaders, who control 70 per cent of the war-torn country, are unlikely to lift their siege of the city, half of which Serbs lay claim to.</p>

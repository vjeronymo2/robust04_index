			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Leading Article: A case of self-congratulation IN A recession, finance ministers join ordinary mortals in worrying about job security. This does much to explain the hyperbole poured on what appears to be rather a banal communique from the finance ministers and central bankers of the group of seven leading industrial countries. In fact, the document reconfirms the outlines of global macroeconomic policy, restates known policies of individual countries and demonstrates a marked lack of urgency over two immediate challenges: the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations within the Gatt and economic reform in the former Soviet Union. Yet several countries claim it is a 'major breakthrough'. Mr Pierre Beregovoy of France, for example, asserted that 'we have rediscovered the spirit of the Plaza and Louvre accords'. Meanwhile, Mr David Mulford of the US claimed that there is a 'clear commitment to world economic growth in this communique', so echoing his boss Mr Nicholas Brady who argued that the communique represented 'a big change'. Yet the fundamental G7 stance is the same. 'They believe strongly,' say the ministers and officials of themselves, 'that the appropriate framework is one of fiscal and monetary policies geared to sustainable growth with price stability over the medium term'. Earlier in the same paragraph one finds the habitual emphasis on 'co-operative efforts to improve the conditions for non-inflationary growth'. Wary approach True, there have been changes, as Mr Brady claims, but the most important are those in the global economy itself. 'The ministers and governors are convinced . . . that the forces that have been inhibiting economic activity in many countries are dissipating and that the conditions for improved global growth exist.' But the sluggishness was itself not foreseen, which should make one wary of G7 claims that it knows either whether conditions for growth are in place or how to establish them, should they not be. What the G7 has agreed, in effect, is that each country shall do what it thinks best (except for France, Italy and the UK, which must do what the Germans think best, and Japan, which feels obliged to pay attention to what the US thinks best). Half the communique is taken up with what read like official press releases from each country's finance ministry. Yet the G7 is probably right to claim that actions already taken and developments already under way will bring recovery. It is, in any case, impossible for the G7 to massage economic growth from year to year. It must, instead, focus on providing a general framework for the world economy and stand by to deal with crises. Failed opportunities Here is where it has failed. Where, for example, was the serious attempt needed to grapple with the obstacles created by the G7 countries to completion of the Uruguay Round? The G7 may regret its cowardice. It may also regret its failure to respond sufficiently to the crisis in Russia. Mr Norman Lamont of the UK was right to urge action on a stabilisation fund. Waiting for IMF membership is a flawed strategy, because it will take too long. Some believe that membership may be agreed by the spring, but that is very optimistic. It would, in any case, delay provision of needed resources until later. Weirdest of all is the view that the G7 cannot even afford a stabilisation fund for Russia. But Nato defence expenditures were around Dollars 500bn in 1991 and most of this huge sum was devoted to protecting the west from the Soviet Union. Now the west enjoys an opportunity to stabilise the former Soviet Union on the basis of democracy and a market economy. The west also faces threats of nuclear proliferation from it and even of the use of such weaponry within it. Yet the response to both the opportunity and the threat is that action might be too expensive. This is unpardonably nonchalant. Posterity may conclude that this meeting represented not the resurgence of global co-operation, but an egregious failure to rise to an historic occasion.</p>

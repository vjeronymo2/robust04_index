			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The tripartite meeting on the implementation of  the national pact has been in progress in Tamanrasset, Algeria,  since 16 April. The meeting, attended by Mali, the Unified  Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA], and Algeria -- the  mediating country -- is reviewing the progress made in the  implementation of the national pact since it was signed. From  Tamanrasset, our special correspondent Oumar Toure reports:    [Begin recording] [Toure] The Tamanrasset meeting closely  follows the second anniversary of the signing of the national  pact on 11 April 1992 by Mali and the rebel Tuareg movements to  consecrate the return of peace, security, and national  reconciliation in Mali. The meeting is aimed at taking stock of  the pact's implementation and at defining future priorities in  line with the spirit of the pact. Already the pact has led to  the creation of a peaceful atmosphere. What remains to be done  now is to tackle the developmental aspect of the pact because,  in reality, apart from its political nature, the pact is a real  action program for development and integration and a real answer  to the problem of exclusion, abandonment, and underdevelopment  of our country's northern regions which sparked off the  rebellion.    Opening the Tamanrasset session, the Algerian representative  restated his country's solidarity with the efforts to  consolidate the gains of the national pact. He hailed the  efforts that have so far been made since 11 April 1992.    In his address, Sada Samake, the territorial administration  and security minister who led the national delegation, said the  Tamanrasset meeting is aimed at taking an objective look at the  progress made in the implementation of the national pact.    [Samake] Today, the national pact represents an important  gain which we all need to preserve and consolidate. It is a  mark of the return of peace even though acts of banditry  continue to create an atmosphere of insecurity in our country's  northern regions. From the military and security standpoint,  decisive progress has been made with the integration of 640  fighters into the regular Army while special security units are  being set up despite delays in the effective takeoff of the  exercise. The present meeting will afford us another  opportunity to give new impetus to the implementation of the  national pact. It will enable us to take an objective look at  the progress made and to identify existing shortcomings so as to  work out ways and means of overcoming them.    [Toure] The MFUA representative, (Sidi Mohamed Ould Zaibi),  pointed out that the movements did not come to Tamanrasset to  renegotiate the national pact because it is clear enough as it  stands.    [(Zaibi)] [passage omitted] We do not see ourselves as  attending a renegotiation session of the national pact as it is  clear. There is nothing to renegotiate. We only have to  implement what has been agreed on by the two sides. The pact  forms the historical yardstick for judging all sides.    [Toure] All the movements are represented at the Tamanrasset  meeting including the ministerial departments involved in  handling the northern problem. Since 16 April, the  deliberations have been going on behind closed doors and no  information has filtered out. However, according to informed  sources, MFUA representatives have demonstrated a lot of  flexibility in their appreciation of the progress made so far in  the implementation of the national pact.

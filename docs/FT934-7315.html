			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Japan sticks on rice issue JAPAN'S revised schedule of tariff reductions submitted yesterday to Gatt includes no offer on the most sensitive categories - white spirits, leather, forest and agricultural products including rice - where the country is facing demands for improved foreign access. The move by Japan, which has publicly expressed a strong desire to help push the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion by the December 15 deadline, shows the difficulties negotiators still face. Meanwhile an official at the trade ministry said there was nothing more to offer at this point on leather and leather shoes, which have been a point of contention with the EC. For mining and manufactured products, however, Japan indicated it was willing to be more compromising with an offer of an average 60 per cent cut in tariffs on 6,600 products, which will bring average tariffs on these products to 1.5 per cent. On rice Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, indicated yesterday that there might be scope for Japan to accept minimum levels of imports. Although he reiterated the official line that the government opposed lifting the ban on rice imports and denied media reports that US and Japan had agreed on a compromise deal over rice, he said he could not tell what would happen after the negotiations. Japan is seeking to avoid being blamed for delaying the Uruguay Round. Officials are currently under negotiations with the US over a compromise agreement to partially open its rice market in exchange for rice to be exempt from tariffication. Japanese officials want a six-year moratorium on tariffication of rice imports, during which Japan would import 4 to 8 per cent of its domestic consumption, a slightly higher range than the 3 to 5 per cent minimum access level under Gatt's Dunkel text. The Japanese government aims to appease both the international community and the Japanese public with its proposal. However, whether it will be accepted by the US and other countries remains to be seen, since it fails to guarantee that Japan will open its rice market through tariffication after the six year grace period.</p>

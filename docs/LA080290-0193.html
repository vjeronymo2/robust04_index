			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> WRIGHT-BRALY RACE COSTLIEST IN COUNTY  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and GOP challenger Hunt Braly spent  more than $672,000 in their bitter June primary election battle, making it by  far the most expensive state legislative race in Ventura County, according to  final campaign reports.  </P> <P> Both candidates wound up in debt after the June 5 election, which Wright won by  a 3-2 margin, said final reports released this week.  </P> <P> Wright reported owing nearly $23,000. Braly owes more than $60,000.  </P> <P> Campaign reports said Wright, who faces only a token Democratic challenger this  fall in the 37th Assembly District, spent $425,000 during the 12 months before  the primary. Braly, chief aide to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), spent  $247,000.  </P> <P> The race was the toughest Wright, 61, has faced since her 1980 election to the  Assembly.  </P> <P> Braly, 35, attacked her repeatedly for trying to intervene with law enforcement  authorities on behalf of her daughter Victoria, who received 28 traffic tickets  over a seven-year period.  </P> <P> Braly said virtually all of his debt is money he personally lent his campaign.  </P> <P> He made the loan, he said, with "the full expectation that, if I didn't win,  I'd never see that money again." He said that, unlike many candidates, he plans  no fund-raisers to retire the debt. JACK CHEEVERS  </P></p>

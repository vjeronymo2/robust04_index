			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To further address SG tube burst probability, the following qualitative discussion of limited tube support plate (TSP) displacement is provided. As part of ComEd's technical support for the implementation of IPC at Braidwood Unit 1, numerous quantitative analyses were completed to assure the structural integrity of the SG tubing. These quantitative determinations were provided as part of WCAP&hyph;14046. These analyses focused on the quantifiable elements of the IPC to evaluate the impact of crack length on steam generator tube leakage and burst, and were completed consistent with the guidance provided in draft RG 1.121, ``Bases for Plugging Degraded SG Tubes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bases for these calculations are the analyses completed by the utility industry and reported to the NRC in the EPRI Draft Report TR&hyph;100407, ``PWR Steam Generator Tube Repair Limits_Technical Support Document for Outside Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking at Tube Support Plates'', Revision 1, August 1993. As explained in this document, the analyses have been completed to assure that the general design criteria and the requirements of RG 1.121 are met during plant operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preparation of these industry documents and the Braidwood Unit 1 specific WCAP&hyph;14046, all analyses for leakage and burst potential were completed using the extremely conservative assumption that all Outside Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking (ODSCC) indications occur on the tubing freespan. In fact, as indicated in both WCAP&hyph;14046 and EPRI Draft Report TR&hyph;100407, ODSCC degradation is confined to the region of the tube/TSP intersection. The burst capability of a section of tube containing ODSCC indications and located within the tube/TSP intersection substantially exceeds the burst capability of a freespan tube section without ODSCC indications. Therefore, tubing left in service by Braidwood's Unit 1 IPC amendment will not burst when confined by the tube support plates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In fact, it is highly unlikely that a section of tubing within the tube support plate will leak, even with through wall cracks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assure structural integrity of the tubing, even during a MSLB accident, ComEd undertook extensive analyses, presented as part of WCAP&hyph;14046, to show analytically that the TSP's do not move far enough during a MSLB to allow degraded tubes to uncover, and subsequently, result in increased leakage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Generic Model D&hyph;4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion Analysis is also being conducted and should be submitted to the NRC by the end of August, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This analysis is being performed using the following assumptions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The TSP crevices are clean, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The TSPs are free to move, depending on applied loads, along the length of the SG tube, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Movement of the TSPs along the length of the tube is not restricted by bending or distortion of the SG tube hole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of these base assumptions is extremely conservative in its own right: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. For assumption 1, visual inspections of the secondary side of the tube bundles of Braidwood Unit 1 SGs show some quality of deposits in the tube to TSP crevice, and along the length of the tube. Since these deposits are considered to be a possible factor in causing ODSCC, it is likely that any tube having ODSCC indications has deposits in the tube/TSP intersection. These deposits would tend to close the tube to TSP crevice, restricting by friction the ability of the TSP to move along the tubes as loads are applied to the TSP during a MSLB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. With regards to assumptions 2 and 3, the TSPs tend to flex and in some locations, are constrained by tie-rods and wedges attached to the tube bundle shroud. These constraints tend to cause the TSPs to ripple under the applied loads as indicated in WCAP&hyph;14046. This effect tends to distort the shape of the tube holes, which are fitted to a tight tolerance around the tubes. Therefore, any distortion of these tube holes caused by motion of the TSP will tend to cause the TSP to bind against the outside diameter of the tube, further constraining its movement away from the degraded area of the tubing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of these facts will lessen the ability of the TSP to move, thereby significantly reducing the possibility that a degraded section of tubing would become uncovered during a MSLB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, this proposed license amendment request does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated within the Braidwood Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

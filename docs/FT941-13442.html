			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Commission is split on steel tubes venture The European Commission is divided over whether to block a three-way European joint venture in the steel tubes sector on competition grounds. Commissioners are due to decide on the deal, which involves French, German and Italian companies, at their meeting today. It is probably the most difficult competition decision they have faced for more than a year and officials said yesterday it was impossible to predict which way a vote would go. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, has proposed outlawing the joint venture between Vallourec, a French steel tubing company, and subsidiaries of Mannesmann of Germany and Ilva of Italy. If a majority of the 17 commissioners supports Mr Van Miert's proposal, it will be only the second time the EU's 1990 merger regulation has been used to block a deal outright. The Commission has reached the four-month deadline for a decision on the case. Under merger rules, the deal will go ahead if no decision is taken. The Commission's merger task force opposes the deal because it believes it would create an anti-competitive 'duopoly' in the sector, with the joint venture and Sandvik, the Swedish engineering group, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the European Union market. But some commissioners believe the alliance should be encouraged as the best means of competing with potential rivals in Japan and eastern Europe. If Mr Van Miert's proposal is approved it will set a precedent in European competition law, by endorsing the principle that a duopoly can exist, even if there are no structural links between the companies involved. The two French, two Italian and two German commissioners are expected to reject Mr Van Miert's proposal, backed by the Luxembourg commissioner.</p>

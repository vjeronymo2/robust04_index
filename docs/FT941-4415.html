			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / BCCI litigation 'will net Abu Dhabi Dollars 900m' The government of Abu Dhabi believes it will collect Dollars 900m by suing regulators, auditors and participants in alleged frauds at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The figure was revealed as details were released yesterday of the Dollars 1.8bn settlement between the liquidators to BCCI and Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder. Abu Dhabi said yesterday: 'This achieves what we have always wanted to achieve: to get the money into the hands of creditors as soon as possible.' It added that the decision was 'mature and statesmanlike'. Abu Dhabi will pay Dollars 1.55bn to the liquidators as soon as the agreement is ratified by the courts in London, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. It will pay a further Dollars 150m in two years and another Dollars 100m one year later - more quickly if it recovers the money from litigation before then. As in the previous agreement negotiated in 1992, Abu Dhabi will waive any legal action against BCCI in an attempt to recover more than Dollars 2bn of the government's money that it claims was stolen by the bank. The liquidators have in exchange agreed to waive litigation they could have brought against Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi will still count as a creditor to the bank for a claim which it says is more than Dollars 1.2bn, and receive a proportion in line with the dividend paid to other creditors. Of the total Dollars 1.8bn to be paid, Dollars 450m represents a half share in the proceeds that Abu Dhabi says it will receive in recoveries from litigation against third parties. If Abu Dhabi is named as a co-defendant in any actions brought against a third party by the liquidators, it will first offset any payments against this Dollars 450m. Abu Dhabi is believed to be preparing its own legal actions against several parties including those being sued by the liquidators: the Bank of England, BCCI's auditors and Sheikh Khalid Bin Mahfouz and the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. Representatives of the liquidators and the government of Abu Dhabi signed the non-binding 'heads of agreement', or outline terms of the settlement, in Zurich on March 3. Lawyers have still to draft the detailed terms and agree to a legally binding contract. Abu Dhabi has also demanded that as a condition of payment at least Dollars 4.5bn of creditors by value agree to waive any rights to sue. The settlement followed long negotiations between the two sides after the Luxembourg appeals court rejected the previous agreement last October. In response to objections raised by the court, the agreement has been restructured so that Abu Dhabi will no longer receive a share of the proceeds of any litigation initiated by the liquidators dis-proportionate to its claims as a creditor. Under the previous agreement, it would have received a half share of the proceeds. However, it is still offering the liquidators half of any settlements it achieves, including a Dollars 9bn civil action against 13 former executives of BCCI on trial in Abu Dhabi. One lawyer said yesterday that the liquidators only required the agreement to be ratified by the courts, although in practice they would seek approval from the elected BCCI creditors' committee, which is due to respond at the end of next week. As in the previous agreement, the BCCI branches in the United Arab Emirates, which include Abu Dhabi, are excluded. They are insolvent and creditors have received no compensation since the bank was closed in July 1991. Some of the more difficult aspects of the negotiations were restructuring the agreement to take into account the objections of the Luxembourg court, and how Abu Dhabi would deal with claims against it from third parties.</p>

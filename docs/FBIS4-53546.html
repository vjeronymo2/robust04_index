			<p>BFN     [Text] Army Spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan yesterday  denied a fresh allegation that Thailand is providing a sanctuary  for secretive Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.    "There is no reason for Thailand to provide a refuge for Pol  Pot," he emphatically told THE NATION.    Phalangkun was responding to a FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW  news release yesterday which reported that Pol Pot is believed  to be residing in a well-guarded compound inside a durian  plantation in Chanthaburi province.    Khmer Rouge defectors told the REVIEW that the renegade  faction leader had found a safe haven in Thailand after spending  some time in a special residence in the Phnum Chhat area near  the Thai border in late 1993.    Branding the allegation "outdated information," Phalangkun  insisted that the Army wanted to confirm that Pol Pot was not  living in Thai territory.    The communists Khmer Rouge rejected participation in  UN-organized elections in Cambodia in May 1993. The guerrillas  continue to fight for an advisory role in the government.    An earlier report said that Khmer Rouge nominal chief Khieu  Samphan agreed last week to meet Cambodian government  representatives for peace talks in North Korea scheduled to  begin on May 27.</p>

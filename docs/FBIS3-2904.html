			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Disaster"] </F>   [Text] Warren Christopher's attempt to suggest that China  and the United States had managed to narrow their differences  over human rights in the final hours of his four-day visit to  Beijing is scarcely credible. Congressional supporters of  linking the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN)  trading status to an improvement in its human rights performance  status are unlikely to be convinced by the Secretary of State's  inane claim that Beijing now understands the U.S. view. The  Chinese leaders Mr Christopher met are even less likely to have  come away from their talks impressed by U.S. resolve.    The simple truth is that China, with its cynically timed  crackdown on dissidents, has called President Bill Clinton's  bluff. Short of a change of heart by the Chinese, the ball is  clearly in the U.S. court.    Mr Clinton can try to prove he is no paper tiger by revoking  China's MFN status. He would then have to accept that he has to  live with the economic and electoral fallout. Alternatively, he  could argue that U.S. economic interests are more important than  human rights in a distant country of which many Americans know  very little. That would mean renewing MFN, despite the evidence  that China has not met the conditions he set for renewal. Or he  could admit that linking trade and human rights was not the best  strategy for promoting change in China.    The consequences to America of cancelling MFN should not be  underestimated. It would lose an estimated US$9 billion in  export business, with resulting damage to employment and  economic recovery. It would also have to sit back and watch  while its less-finicky competitors scrambled to take its place  in the Chinese market as the two giant nations fought a mutually  destructive trade war.  <H5>  Greed for Markets </H5>   Beijing long ago mastered the art of playing off  export-hungry foreigners against one another. Once America's  traditional allies had thumbed their noses at Washington in  their greed for new markets, Beijing would have little fear that  their behaviour would be any different in future when it came to  membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for  instance, or support for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.    Beijing would have scored a political victory in proving the  U.S. could not rely on international support for inflicting such  arbitrary damage on a developing nation and potential  superpower. But these would be pyrrhic victories neither wants  nor can easily afford.    MFN, however, is not a privilege the U.S. grants only to  China. It is a right enjoyed almost automatically by most other  nations. Not even such dictatorships as Iraq or Libya have lost  that right, despite other sanctions imposed on them. It is an  accident of Cold War history that China, as one of the few  still-nominally socialist nations, must be subjected to the  annual farce of the MFN renewal debate while worse regimes  remain out of the firing line. The original aim of imposing  conditions on MFN for communist countries was to ensure they  allowed their citizens to emigrate freely. The conditions on  China go far beyond that requirement.  <H5>  Blunderbuss Tactics </H5>   The bitter truth, as the Hong Kong Government and as Hong  Kong and American business interests have been telling Mr  Clinton since the start of his election campaign two years ago,  is that MFN is the wrong weapon. Human rights in China are too  important a cause to put at risk by such blunderbuss tactics.  These will always be questioned in the U.S. because of their  potential to cause harm at home. And they will be questioned by  many human rights supporters who see trade and the development  of China's economy as essential to eventual political reform.    The MFN tactic also suffers from the weakness that it is a  purely American initiative. Because other countries want to  trade with China as well as press for human rights improvements,  MFN makes it impossible to build an international coalition  intent on trying to persuade China to improve human rights.    Since taking office, Mr Clinton and his State Department  advisers have begun to learn the lesson that the yearly MFN  fiasco is not a good way to deal with China. Indeed, Mr Clinton  has learned both economic and political lessons swiftly. But he  has not learned how to package them to make them appeal to his  Congressional supporters.    Now the President and his advisers have painted themselves  into an awkward corner, and are facing a Congress which does not  understand the lessons the White House has learned. Yet neither  Mr Clinton nor anyone else has worked out how the MFN weapon can  be used -- if Congress forces that upon him -- without  committing political suicide. MFN withdrawal will explode in  the face of the president who orders it. Some weapon.</p>

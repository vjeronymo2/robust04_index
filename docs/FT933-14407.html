			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Cox resigns as president of CSFB's US arm CS First Boston, the New York-based investment bank, said last night that Mr Archibald Cox, the president and chief executive of its US operations, had resigned. The firm said Mr Cox was leaving for personal reasons, and that his resignation had been accepted by the board 'with extreme reluctance'. The news stunned Wall Street, and industry insiders speculated that Mr Cox's departure was linked to a recent restructuring or to a long-running internal row at First Boston over employee bonuses, which led to a series of defections by high-level bankers and traders. Officials at CSFB and First Boston would not comment, but in a statement Mr Cox, 53, said: 'I am resigning to seek other personal interests. I feel strongly that during my tenure at First Boston I have made a meaningful contribution to the organisation.' First Boston said Mr Cox would stay on at the firm until September 1. No successor has been named, and Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of the CSFB group, will assume Mr Cox's responsibilities. Mr Cox's departure is the latest upheaval at CSFB, which has recently reported erratic profits and been dogged by internal rivalries. In March, Mr Jans-Jorg Rudloff, chairman of the group's European operations, was appointed to the board of CSFB's majority shareholder, the Zurich-based financial group CS Holdings, and replaced in London by Mr David Mulford, a former US Treasury official. At roughly the same time, Mr Robert Diamond, head of CS First Boston Pacific in Tokyo, was brought in to run the US bond sales and trading division after the division's previous head had resigned for personal reasons. Last month, CSFB said it was consolidating its three units into one group, and reorganising the business along product, rather than geographic, lines. The restructuring was seen by some analysts as an implicit acceptance by CSFB that its ambition to forge a fully-integrated global investment banking group had failed.</p>

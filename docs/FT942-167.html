			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Accountancy: Lawson lifts the veil on professional issues - Andrew Jack talks to the new president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales Two years of bombardment by the headquarters bureaucrats at Moorgate Place in London have clearly not yet had their full intended crushing effect on the new president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Chatting to the FT earlier this week while 'minded' by Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the institute, Roger Lawson allowed his official presidential veil to slip periodically - and without much forced tugging. It is not that Lawson has managed to entirely clear his agenda. Barely settled into his office since starting in his role earlier this month, our conversation was squeezed in between an interview with another journalist and a lunch with John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. Some of his presidential predecessors have certainly been known to succumb to the ministerial 'red box' trick beloved of civil servants: drowning their bosses beneath torrents of irrelevant paperwork. Within the institute, there is the additional risk from the gallons of drink at innumerable receptions and dinners, leaving little time to develop personal visions - let alone be allowed the chance to implement them. But Lawson is certainly willing to offer contentious views. 'It is entirely appropriate that there should be greater transparency (from accountancy firms) for buyers of services so they can be satisfied of the financial strength or otherwise of the people with whom they are doing business,' he says in a swipe at the firms' traditional refusal to disclose their accounts. 'Of course any action along these lines would be up to the member firms themselves to take,' Colquhoun hastily interjects. 'The institute would only be involved in prescribing activities if there was a clear public interest issue.' On other topics, a more familiar institute line quickly emerges. 'The legal claims against accountants are completely out of proportion,' Lawson says, echoing standing policy which calls for lobbying to repeal company law to allow auditors to cap their liability. In the same vein, he says there is no tension between the 'dual roles' of the institute: as both trade association for its members and regulator in the public interest. 'These roles have co-existed for one hundred years,' he says. 'I do hold the official line.' The defensive barriers also go up on the institute's disastrous investment in Accountancy Television, which fell into the hands of the receivers. 'It's an unhappy episode,' Lawson says. 'We were trying to create a medium for our own members and others. We believed it was the way education was going to go.' Soon, no doubt, there will be letters to newspapers and magazines (signed by him though often penned by officials) taking the establishment line against some attack or other on the reputation of the profession. Asked about whether he is concerned about 'lowballing' or predatory pricing as larger firms undercut their smaller rivals in tenders for work, for example, he replies that it is something already considered by the chartered accountants joint ethics committee. Even so, there is a Lawson twist. 'It is an issue about which we remain nervous,' he says. 'Any firm that puts in a price must demonstrate that it does not compromise on quality or it could be subject to reprimand.' Colquhoun adds that the committee would have preferred to take a stronger line, but was held back at the insistence of the Office of Fair Trading, which apparently claimed interference in pricing by the institute would have interfered with competition. Like all those before him, Lawson has a list of ideas for change during his year in office. The first is restructuring the professional bodies - reducing the existing six leading organisations to one, with regional and functional arms. 'It was appropriate 25 years ago and it is still appropriate,' he says. He argues there may be a need to make the case for reform more clearly, particularly to younger members. 'We've been unblushingly gentlemanly in our approach so far. It would be a shame if we didn't grasp the opportunity. I am sorry not to use more passionate, emotional words but this is a case based upon logic.' Lawson's second target is to improve the image of chartered accountancy. 'We've got to get the branding right, to make sure the public are aware of the rigorous training of the qualification and distinguish it from non-qualified people,' he says. This will involve publicity to students and employers, and persuading local practitioners that they can provide 'added value' to their clients. His third aim is to review the technical provision of the institute: to respond to changing issues, ensure that members remain competitive, and support the role of the Research Board that funds academic work. Finally, he talks about the need for internal changes to the institute to understand its members' needs. 'We need to move from a Whitehall mentality to being a more market-driven organisation,' he says as Colquhoun (an ex-Foreign Office civil servant) sits quietly. 'I'll be tinkering at the edges rather than carving the place up,' he adds reassuringly. 'Consensus management is vital.' None of these topics is perhaps as snappy as one of those of the president before last, Ian Plaistowe: that on disciplinary matters, the institute should be 'firm, fast and fair'. Such catchphrases can have the habit of returning to haunt their authors. The jury is still out on whether this aim has yet been achieved. Lawson concedes that a recent defeat in the courts of the profession's joint disciplinary scheme - which was attempting to investigate Price Waterhouse's audit of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International - could spell the end of self-regulation. On audit regulation too, he sees the need for 'a slightly lighter touch' from inspectors. One reason for his slightly unorthodox views is an unusual background. Until the second world war, the by-laws of the institute expressly forbade a chartered accountant outside public practice to take senior office. He is now the fourth member from business to inherit the top seat. During his year in office, he remains on the staff (indeed the second-longest serving person after a secretary) as a director of 3i, the venture capital company, which he says is 'fully supportive' of his activities. Equally important, Lawson is also the first president to have won his place in a contested election. In the past, any list of contenders for the throne was whittled down in smoke-filled rooms, before a single name was placed for ratification in front of the institute's council. 'I think the election has given me a greater degree of confidence than I otherwise would have had if I had arrived here because it was Buggins' turn,' he says. 'I will stand up and say what I believe.'</p>

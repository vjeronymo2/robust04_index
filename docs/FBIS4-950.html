			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quarter-page advertisement for the African Christian </F> Democratic Party, ACDP]    [Text]  <H5>  When the righteous are in authority the people </H5> rejoice.    Peace can only come as a result of repentance, forgiveness  and reconciliation.    The ACDP believes in government by the people, so that  individuals and communities can take charge of their own lives.  Local government should enjoy real power over all aspects of  public responsibility. Social services should be funded by the  State and the Region, but THEY MUST BE CONTROLLED BY THE  COMMUNITY. For the first time communities should be given the  authority to prioritise their own needs, without State  interference. This is real empowerment of the people.    The ACDP believes that via local referendums, you should be  able to vote regularly on a single issue, without having to wait  for five years for another election. YOU should decide whether  you want to build schools, clinics, houses or training centres.  YOU should decide on job creation priorities.    YOU should be able to decide your own future, without having  self appointed leaders thrust upon you. Too much power leads to  corruption. Vote for yourself. Vote ACDP. It's time for  Christians to stand up and be counted.    [The ad also has a photograph of candidate Kenneth Meshoe  next to a voter's checkmark and the enjoinder "It's Time to do  it God's way. Put your vote by the cross."]</p>

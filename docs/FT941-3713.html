Perversely enough, he asserted that at yesterday's launch of a Pounds 4m project - led by the British Council - to help the world learn English. The prince lamented the drop in standards of spoken English over the past few decades, saying 'it is not good enough to expect other people to conduct business in English . . .We're not good enough at teaching other people's languages.'

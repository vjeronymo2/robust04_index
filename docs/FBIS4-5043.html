			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japan will grant up to 500  million yen in assistance to Cambodia to help it increase food  production, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday [7 April].  Japanese Ambassador to Cambodia Yukio Imagawa and Cambodia's  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom  Sirivut exchanged documents on the agreement in Phnom Penh, the  ministry said.    The aid will be used to purchase fertilizers and  agricultural  machinery, it said. Food production in Cambodia is very slow  because its economy was destroyed by years of war and because of  lack of fertilizers and machinery, the ministry said.    The latest aid brings the total amount of Japanese  grant-in-aid to Cambodia in fiscal 1993 to about 8.4 billion  yen, it said.</p>

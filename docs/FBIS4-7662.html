			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 1 (CTK) -- Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus today said that Russia's payment of its debts to the Czech  Republic in the form of goods supplies is basically acceptable.  Talking to reporters after a special cabinet meeting, Klaus  stressed, however, that it depended on the character of the  goods. The Czech Republic is interested in particular in oil  supplies, he added.    Klaus was referring to his visit to Moscow, scheduled for  April 4-5, to which he had been invited by President Boris  Yeltsin. Klaus said he would try to settle economic issues  which could not be settled at lower levels.    He called very important an accord on the support and  protection of investments, to be signed during the visit. The  Czech Republic has similar accords with other countries but the  agreement with Russia will be "less liberal," said Klaus.    Another point the cabinet discussed was a proposal to  negotiate an agreement on trade cooperation between the Czech  Republic and Brazil. The accord is to be signed during Klaus's  visit to Latin America, scheduled for mid-April. The Czech  Republic is to have a similar accord with Morocco.</p>

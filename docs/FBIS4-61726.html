			<p>BFN     [Text] The fulfillment of the state plan for supplying  Ukraine with electric energy in 1994 is impossible due to a  number of reasons. This is the essence of a statement by  managers of Ukraine's nuclear energy complex, which was made  public yesterday. The statement notes that there are no funds  for purchasing nuclear fuel and spare parts. According to the  authors of the statement, an urgent decrease in tariffs on  electric energy and a state credit for the Ministry of Energy  for repaying the debt of nuclear power plants are necessary.</p>

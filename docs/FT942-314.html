			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome wanted US buying of Wellcome continued yesterday and pushed the shares up 23 at best. Dealers said Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, had been picking up American Depositary Receipts, but the shares came off their highs after US rival Salomon Brothers cut its forecasts for the sector. Salomon said worldwide health care cuts had led to price competition between drug firms and it expected slower sales growth and lower gross margins. It believes Wellcome's profits will grow by only 7 per cent over the next three years, compared with a previous estimate of 11 per cent. The shares ended 9 higher at 611p. Elsewhere, Glaxo, which Salomon sees growing by only one per cent over the same period, fell from a high of 549p to close 3 up at 543p. SmithKline Beecham 'A' was ahead 4 at 400p, after touching 403p. Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca rose 10 to 712p after Goldman Sachs recommended the stock but shaved forecasts. The US investment bank said the stock represented good value in the drugs sector as it offered low risk and would soon see the benefits of its research and development pipeline feeding through. However, the house trimmed its 1994 profits forecasts by Pounds 25m to Pounds 765m, reflecting the pressure on drug margins, weakness in agrochemicals and increased interest charges. Shares in drinks groups Allied-Lyons and Grand Metropolitan moved in separate directions as the sector analysts from NatWest Securities recommended a switch from one to the other. Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest said he had taken heart from an analysts' visit, which finished yesterday, to GrandMet's Pillsbury food operations in the US. He added that the company's shares had underperformed Allied by 20 per cent over the past quarter. Allied fell 6 to 549p while GrandMet added 13 1/2 at 393 1/2 p. Guinness was restrained by news of import controls in South America. The shares declined 7 to 436p. Conglomerate Hanson climbed 5 1/2 to 243 1/2 p after Japanese securities house Yamaichi reiterated its buy recommendation. Job shifts hit chemicals group BOC at the expense of Tiphook, the transport rental group. BOC fell 10 to 683p on news that Mr Ian Clubb, the company's finance director, had resigned. Tiphook was 8 per cent ahead at one stage and closed a net 2 better at 51p on news that Mr Clubb was joining as chairman designate. Engineering group GKN gave up a further 15 to 546p. One analyst attributed the decline to selling brought about by the recent erosion of the yield premium. Confidence that Wassall's Pounds 92.2m rights issue, which closes today, will be a success helped the stock add 3 at 276p.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Property: Your own windmill? - Cadogan's Place If you long to live somewhere different, a working windmill with its mill house is for sale in Stanton, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. The windmill, listed grade II* and a scheduled ancient monument, was built in 1751 but was moved to its present site around 1820, when the mill house was built. The price is Pounds 135,000 from Hamptons in Bury (0284-767338) or Kevin Henry in Saffron Walden (0799-513632). At Tregurtha Downs near Marazion, Cornwall, you can buy a tall engine house once used for powering a tin mine. It was built in 1883 and mining continued until 1900. In 1903, the engine was taken out and moved to the South Crofty mine, where it worked until 1955. The engine house, looking like a Norman castle combined with a chapel, was turned into a home in 1987. Offers over Pounds 175,000 are invited by Miller in Truro (0872-74211). Equally unusual are plans for an earth-sheltered home for sale at Ashmead House in Fulbrook, near Burford in Oxfordshire. By building the house into the soil, there is an enormous saving of energy, while the building is intended to merge with its surroundings to make a harmonious whole. The agent, John D. Wood in Oxford (0865-311522), also points out that it will provide greater protection than usual against burglary. There is a choice between two plans, priced at Pounds 275,000 or Pounds 250,000 and designed by David Woods. Both allow plenty of natural light, through the roofs or conventional windows looking out on open areas. Mr and Mrs Kipling loved Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire so much that they named their son after it. Now, two boathouses are for sale there. The Lady of the Lake, set in the lake itself and approached by a jetty, costs Pounds 175,000. The Shieling is on dry land and costs Pounds 65,000. The agent is Jackson-Stops in Chester (0244-328361). The House Builders Federation, representing the builders of new homes, has been complaining that prices of development land have shot up and will threaten the recovery in the housing market. With the cost of a plot forming about a fifth of the sale price of a house, they say they cannot find enough land 'where people want to live'. But plenty of derelict industrial land is available in our cities. It would help society to develop such spaces, especially now there is an increasing tilt at the Department of the Environment against out-of-town, car-dependent shopping centres. A wonderful, red-brick Tudor house is for sale in Northamptonshire. Fawsley Hall (as in Lord St John of Fawsley) was derelict in 1972 when the present owners bought it. Listed grade I, its highlight is a splendid Great Hall. The house is set in a park (which it does not own) that was probably planned by Capability Brown. In the middle of it, all on its own, is the parish church. Savills in Banbury (0295-263535) is asking Pounds 1.25m.</p>

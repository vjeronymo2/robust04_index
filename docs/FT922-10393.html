			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save The striking aspect of Kwik Save's interim results was the reminder that while it is opening a store a week, it has almost no debt. It uses internal cash flow to finance expansion and does not capitalise interest. Granted, Kwik Save's branded discount formula is a much cheaper proposition than Tesco's or Sainsbury's. Its avoidance of rights issues, sale and leaseback deals and borrowings is thought-provoking just the same. It is perhaps equally significant that Kwik Save had a tough first half. Despite a 44 per cent increase in sales, its pre-tax profits rose a mere 6 per cent, mainly because it defended its market share against rivals moving into discounting. That meant attacking Gateway and Asda as well as Aldi and Netto, whatever the consequences for margins. The strategy worked in that Kwik Save actually strengthened its position, and should make enough in the second half for its shares to be on a current year multiple of around 12. As it happens, during the same period Sainsbury and Tesco also increased market share. But they may have Kwik Save to thank for denying the likes of Gateway and Asda the chance to move down market out of their way.</p>

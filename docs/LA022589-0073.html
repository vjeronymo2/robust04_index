			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-AMERICAN RANCOR TO TINGE BUSH'S S. KOREA VISIT  </P> <P> In sharp contrast with President Bush's ceremonial visit to Japan, where he  attended the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, and his so-called "sentimental  journey" to China, tension will be in the air when Bush makes a brief,  five-hour stopover Monday in South Korea.  </P> <P> The country is simmering with anti-American rancor expressed with violence. A  bilateral relationship that was once considered basically sound is now strained  by trade disputes. And much confusion is arising from an awkward retooling of  joint security arrangements at a time when the Seoul government is making  ambivalent peace overtures to its bitter military foe, Communist North Korea.  </P> <P> Anti-Americanism promises to be the theme of the day. Students and dissidents  have already begun a series of protests against the Bush visit, and they have  vowed to demonstrate in force on Monday.  </P> <P> Bush is not likely to be threatened or disturbed, or even to see a protester.  But he might smell something unusual, as the government can be expected to  deploy thousands of riot police to quell any unrest with their usual clouds of  acrid pepper gas.  </P> <P> Kim Suk Kyu, assistant minister of foreign affairs, dismissed the growing  concern over U.S.-South Korean ties at a recent meeting with foreign reporters.  He said anti-Americanism is "a minority view and a passing phenomenon, despite  loud voices and anti-American activities."  </P> <P> But there are clear signs that the problem is getting worse, not better. The  American Cultural Center in the southwestern provincial city of Kwangju has  been attacked three times in the past month by radical students wielding rocks,  firebombs and, in one incident, sledgehammers.  </P> <P> After a particularly vicious attack at the end of January, U.S. officials let  it be known that they had had enough and were considering shutting down the  center.  </P> <P> "If we must close our center to protect human life, we do so, although with  great reluctance," Thomas Brooks, U.S. charge d'affaires, reportedly told  Kwangju Mayor Choi In Ki.  </P> <P> Kwangju, in fact, is the crucible of South Korean hatred for things American.  It was there that former President Chun Doo Hwan used regular South Korean army  troops, released from the operational control of an American commander, to put  down a 1980 civilian revolt with tragic results. The government says nearly 200  protesters were killed, but unofficial estimates of the death toll are much  higher.  </P> <P> Dissidents allege that U.S. authorities gave tacit approval to Chun's brutal  measures by releasing the troops, but the charges do not stop there. Washington  stands accused of meddling in South Korean affairs and propping up a succession  of dictators. Proponents of a revisionist view of history maintain that the  United States was solely responsible for dividing Korea at the end of World War  II and now wants to perpetuate that division to advance its own geopolitical  aims.  </P> <P> Disenchantment with the American benefactor is spreading among the mainstream  population too, as South Koreans awaken to new national pride. In the Seoul  Olympics last year, the crowds cheered for Soviet teams and booed the  Americans. The Korean YMCA sponsored a nationalistic campaign to boycott  American cigarettes after U.S. trade pressure pried open the market to imports  last year.  </P> <P> South Koreans are "annoyed by Washington's 'arrogance' and 'heavy-handedness'  in trade negotiations with Seoul," Byung Chul Koh, professor of political  science at the University of Illinois in Chicago, wrote in a recent monograph  on U.S.-South Korean relations. "Some are even beginning to question the value  of the American military presence, something that had been unthinkable until  very recently."  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Have Lunch With Roh  </P> <P> Bush will have little time to get into substantive discussions when he meets  President Roh Tae Woo over lunch. The two leaders are likely to discuss ongoing  revisions in the joint-command structure and the Status of Forces Agreement,  the treaty under which U.S. troops are stationed here, as well as recent  progress toward reconciliation with North Korea, officials said.  </P> <P> Prospects for withdrawal of some of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South  Korea, however, are not expected to be on the agenda. Nor is the controversy  over North Korean demands -- backed now by students and dissidents in the south  -- that the joint U.S.-South Korean "Team Spirit" military exercises be  canceled next month to nurture the north-south dialogue.  </P> <P> But Bush, making the first presidential visit here since Ronald Reagan came in  1983, may be forced to depart from the script when he goes to the National  Assembly to give a speech and meets the "three Kims," opposition leaders who  head rival parties.  </P> <P> Hanging heavy over the Bush visit will be the threat of U.S. retaliatory  sanctions under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. After negotiations on U.S. demands  that Seoul open its telecommunications market broke down in Washington earlier  this month, South Korea appears to be a candidate for designation as an unfair  trading partner. Disagreements over intellectual property rights and  liberalization of agricultural imports are also pending.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan to Cut Trade Surplus  </P> <P> Trade Minister Han Seung Soo announced a plan to cut tariffs and boost U.S.  imports by 29% to $16.5 billion this year, thus cutting the bilateral trade  surplus from $8.5 billion in 1988 to $6.5 billion in 1989. But officials say  they are perplexed over how to satisfy the Americans.  </P> <P> "We hope that after negotiations, Korea will be excluded from the list" of  unfair trading partners, Han said. "We hope to explain to the Congress and to  the Administration that what we have been doing in the past was the maximum we  could do, and that we'll do the maximum in the future."  </P> <P> Shin Doo Byong, director general of the Foreign Ministry's American Affairs  Bureau, said that although the "basic fabric" of the relationship is in good  shape, ties could be strained by continued trade friction.  </P> <P> "The United States should be very careful not to pick on Korea as a scapegoat,"  Shin said. "There'd be a backlash in every sense."  </P> <P> Already, the anti-American theme has become a standard plank in nearly all the  frequent ritual protests in Seoul. On Feb. 13, for example, about 12,000 angry  farmers stormed the National Assembly building in a riotous protest over an  irrigation tax and red pepper prices. They also denounced U.S. beef imports --  and mimicked dissident slogans criticizing the Bush visit and demanding the  withdrawal of U.S. troops.  </P> <P> "The red light is starting to blink for the United States," said Kim Keun Tae,  a dissident leader. He said that anti-American violence is likely to worsen "if  America continues to make foolish choices in its Korea policy."  </P> <P> Kim cited the recent appointment of Donald Gregg, a career Central Intelligence  Agency official and former national security adviser to Vice President Bush, as  U.S. ambassador to Seoul. Gregg was CIA station chief here from 1973 to 1979,  and he replaces another CIA man, James R. Lilley.  </P> <P> "He was here with the CIA during one of our darkest eras, when human rights  were grossly violated," Kim said. "This shows the U.S. considers Korea an  operational center, where they can manipulate politics."  </P></p>

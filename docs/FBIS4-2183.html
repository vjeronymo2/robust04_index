			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Tie (3769 6993): "A Review of the Combat Against </F> Corruption and Its Outlook"]    [Text] Aiming at the rampant and extensive corruption  emerging in the new era, China launched a new round of struggle  against corruption in 1993. For a while, "fighting against  corruption" appeared in the newspaper almost everyday and was  quoted quite frequently in Chinese political life. Foreign  media generally believed that China was unleashing another  attack at corruption.  <H5>  Results Scored by Anticorruption Drive '93 Marks the </H5> Completion of One Stage    Broadly speaking, anticorruption work in 1993 consisted of  three main tasks: Leading cadres maintaining self-discipline  and staying clean themselves; investigation of serious and  important cases; and correcting unhealthy practices in trades  and professions. It can safely be said that in all three tasks  the planned objectives have been achieved.    The requirement of staying clean and maintaining  self-discipline for leading party and government cadres at or  above the county and departmental levels stood out as more  important than the other two parts in 1993 anticorruption  work. The requirement was made directly of leading cadres  at the county and departmental levels. Media generally believed  that this was the key as well as the difficult point for the  three main tasks and would determine the outcome of the  struggle. It was also the area which the masses were most  concerned about.    Stories from authoritative organs show that leading groups  at or above the county and departmental levels across the  country all made self-inspection in terms of "11 prohibitions"  in 1993, and dealt with the problems thus uncovered according to  relevant provisions. Leading cadres throughout the country  handed in a great variety of gifts and largess: renminbi, Hong  Kong dollars, US dollars, credit cards, various high-grade  merchandise such as cameras, wristwatches, small video cameras,  miniature color televisions, and gold coins, necklaces, rings,  scissors, monkeys, and rams. In Shanghai, 318 bureau-rank  cadres returned largess, gifts, credit cards, and securities  worth about 272,900 yuan. News from Hunan revealed that by  early November 1993, 18,000 cadres at or above the county and  departmental levels in the province had by themselves uncovered  2,563,700 yuan of largess and securities, 3,380 Hong Kong  dollars, 14 gold necklaces, 39 gold rings, 26 miniature  televisions, 21 cameras, and so on.    Concentrating on investigating serious and important  cases was the second of the three parts of anticorruption work  in 1993. The central authorities demanded vigorously  pursuit of law- and discipline-breaking cases perpetuated by  leading party and government organs, leading cadres, and  judiciary, administrative and law-enforcement organs, especially  cases involving serious abuses of power. Notable results were  scored in this area. Localities and departments investigated  and handled a number of cases: Xu Zhonghe, former mayor of  Ruzhou City, Henan, accepted and solicited some 475,000 yuan in  property and embezzled 10,000 yuan in public funds. Hong  Yonglin, former chief of the Huizhou City Public Security  Bureau, Guangdong, accepted 914,000 Hong Kong dollars and  348,000 yuan in bribes, and failed to account for another 1.444  million Hong Kong dollars and 693,000 yuan. Chen Binggen,  former head of the Shenzhen City Housing and Property  Administration, accepted a bribe of 12,000 yuan and a house and  embezzled 110,000 yuan. Cases involving staff in  law-enforcement and supervisory organs are as follows: Li  Jianhui, an inspector of lieutenant rank with the Beijing  Municipality Border Defense Bureau, and Zhao Dong, a deputy  section head of major rank and a lieutenant-ranking inspector  Wang Lin at the same bureau, accepted a total of 1,601,800 yuan  in bribes. Parasites in the banking sector include: Xue Gen,  former accountant at the Dongfeng Office of the Haikou Branch of  the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and co-conspirator  Chen Yiquan together accepted 33.44 million yuan of corrupt  money. Feng Yang, former financial planning section head of the  Huzhou City Trust and Investment Company of the Industrial and  Commercial Bank of China, and his co-conspirator Xu Jianxin  together accepted 5.1 million yuan of corrupt money. Luo Yuhai,  a former staff member of the operation section of the Bank of  China head office, took some $400,000 in bribes and embezzled  some $776,000 public funds.... Other economic crimes include:  Wu Weidong, former transport section head of the material  supply company of the China Huabei Electric Power Allied  Corporation, took some 498,000 yuan in bribes. Guo Min, former  operations section head of the Beijing Branch of the China  National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation, took  some 960,000 yuan and embezzled some 880,000 yuan public funds.  The Supreme People's Court upheld in the first half of November  the death sentences for the five main offenders in million yuan  corruption cases, who are: Lu Lanzhen, Liu Guifen, Jiang Jiaxu,  Li Qiang, and Chen Haiqiang.    The investigation and bringing to justice of once-notorious  corrupt elements greatly enhanced the deterrent power of law and  discipline, prompting hundreds with serious economic offenses to  confess and surrender themselves to law- and  discipline-enforcement organs.    The third job in the 1993 anticorruption drive was to  curtail a few unhealthy practices which the masses had reacted  to most strongly. Following the second plenary session of  the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, administrative  fees charged by central state organs since 1991 were screened,  and some considered to be arbitrary levies were subsequently  revoked over time. In the second half of October, the Ministry  of Railway was the first to cancel 272 unreasonable charges and  stop 84 surcharges levied on behalf of local governments. In  the first half of November, the Ministry of Finance and State  Planning Commission jointly announced the abolition nationwide  of the first batch of fees, 75 in all, charged by the eight  departments of public security, labor, personnel, railway,  transport, post and telecommunications, banking, and civil  aviation. In the second half of the same month, the State  Education Commission abolished 21 arbitrary fees in secondary  and primary education, and localities screened and abolished  arbitrary local fees.    Regarding curbing publicly sponsored overseas trips (or  those  outside the borders), figures from 21 central departments, 11  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities show that up  to mid-November, 1993, 715 publicly sponsored travel groups of  about 7,555 people were canceled, saving the state enormous  amounts of foreign exchange. By the end of the year, the  unhealthy practice of sponsoring overseas (or  outside-the-border) travel with public money had basically been  halted.    Many professions and trade also singled out and dealt with  unhealthy practices the masses reacted to strongly, and scored  notable results. The railway sector dealt with the procurement  of personal gain by illegitimately offering freight cars and  train tickets; the post and telecommunications sector did the  same with abuses in telephone installations; the banking sector  dealt with the same problem with loans and discounts; the  publication sector tackled the problem of "selling ISBN [book]  numbers"; the news sector was against "news stories written for  a price"; the public health sector addressed the problem of  medical workers accepting "red packets"; agricultural  departments made efforts to reduce peasant burdens, and so on.  All these efforts addressed people's complaints and improved  relations between the people and the party and government.  <H5>  There Are Still Problems We Cannot Ignore </H5>   All the three anticorruption tasks in 1993 achieved their  targets. But there are still problems we cannot ignore, and the  anticorruption mission remains very arduous.    Regarding cadres staying clean and maintaining  self-discipline, some cadres are not taking this requirement  seriously enough, or are just going through the motions. One  situation that is often seen is: Revealing lesser offenses and  avoiding serious ones or those that have been seen and not those  that have not been seen, and addressing general problems instead  of particular aspects of them. Some cadres revealed that  they had received gifts such as fountain pens, briefcases,  neckties, and shirts; but not cash, gift coupons, credit cards,  and high-quality consumer goods. Some admitted to the things  and money they had received from attending ribbon-cutting and  various ceremonies, but not those secretly sent to their homes.  Some looked at only the general aspect of the problem, such as  grass-root cadres accepting party invitations and indigenous and  special gifts such as tea and fruit, but not benefits and  advantages received by individuals. In short, most of the  problems exposed did nothing to the reputation or interests of  the accused; only a few were followed with rectification,  refunds, or investigation.    Some localities and departments refused to meet the central  authorities' requirement of soliciting mass opinion prior to  regular democratic-style party activity meetings, and failed to  ask discipline inspection committees and organizational  departments of a higher level to attend such meetings and to  report to the masses the results of self-inspection. They only  conducted such meetings perfunctorily, blatantly just going  through the motion.    We should draw our attention to this situation: The  monitoring mechanisms of supervisory departments do not follow  closely enough the state of cadres staying clean and maintaining  self-discipline. As a norm for conduct and education, staying  clean and maintaining self-discipline is a measure that relies  only on self-awareness. As such, its effect is very limited,  and almost none for people with serious problems. That is why  it has been called a method "binding only on gentlemen, not on  scoundrels." So far self-inspection and self-correction have  not made any corrupt elements come forward with confessions of  their wrongdoings.    Extra-judicial pleas for mercy seriously obstruct  investigations into big and important cases, making the  investigations very difficult. This is a glaring problem  in current anticorruption struggle. The popular practice of  pleading for mercy points to many deep-seated problems. First,  there is not a direct command chain running from top to bottom  in the supervisory system. Judiciary and discipline inspection  organs are under and run by local authorities, much of their  work depends on the support and help of various departments.  When someone pleads for an accused, especially when he is a  leading cadre, the investigators are under pressure to weigh up  the matter, thus affecting the impartiality of their  investigation. Second, there is nothing in our law and  discipline to stop or curb extra-judicial pleading. The person  who pleads for an accused does not commit any crime or a  discipline-breaking act, but he may gain gratitude without too  much effort. Third, in some departments and units, some people  are actively building personal networks, forming factions and  sects, resulting in a situation of "officials protecting each  other."    As regards correcting unhealthy practices in trades and  professions, there are the following situations: Orders and  bans are openly defied in some localities; some people have  reined themselves in but are waiting for a chance to spring into  action again. The central authorities and departments have  issued circulars stipulating the items on which arbitrary  charges are to be stopped, only to see them ignored by local  authorities, who have continued to charge arbitrarily. Some  local authorities committed fraud and forgery in order to  legalize their arbitrary charges. A county falsely reported its  per-capita income to be twice as high as its actual amount to  make it look as if the money it levied in fund raising was no  more than five percent of its per-capita income, as set by the  State Council.    These problems cannot be ignored if the fight against  corruption is to be pursued on a long-term basis and to come up  with results.  <H5>  Further Improve Policies, Laws, and Regulations </H5>   One big problem in the current anticorruption effort is the  lack of explicit legal and policy provisions on new problems  thrown up by changes in the economic situation. Some policy  and legal provisions are too rigid and not amenable to  application.    Of the "11 prohibitions" concerning leading cadres staying  clean and maintaining self-discipline made in last year's fight  against corruption, people had complained most strongly against  "prohibiting stock trading." First, though leading cadres were  barred from buying stocks, there were no explicit bans on stock  purchases by their spouses and sons and daughters. Second,  there were no provisions stating whether there were refunds for  returned internal worker stocks. Third, the spirit of the  relevant regulations was that cadres at or above county and  departmental levels with government duties were barred from  buying or selling stocks. But there were no specific provisions  advising ways to deal with changes in the identity of  stockholders. A discipline inspection cadre in charge of stock  screening told this writer the following similar cases: A  person was transferred to a government unit, where he now works,  after he had purchased some stock as a leading cadre in an  enterprise; another was a serving cadre when buying stocks,  though now he is retired; a cadre -- a department head -- was  the head of a section when he bought in stocks; and a cadre had  bought stocks before being demoted from department head to  section head for some mistakes he made. It has been said that  the ranking was not a scientific guideline deciding who can and  cannot trade in stocks. Some section head-rank cadres wield  enormous powers, and there are strong complaints against failure  to inspect their corrupt behavior.    There is also the question of properly defining high  consumption. Are the many local authorities' policies of  rewarding bids that have successfully attracted capital and  projects in order to develop local economies to be counted as  paid intermediary activity? How do we handle the capital (from  government unit investments, bank loans, money raised by cadres,  and so on) sunk into party- or government-sponsored economic  entities? All these problems call for investigations and study,  corresponding measures, and explicit policies and legal  provisions.  <H5>  Anticorruption Efforts Must Solve Deep-Seated Problems </H5>   The fight against corruption is a long-term, arduous, and  complicated mission. For it to get real results, it is  necessary to create a supervision and management system at a  deep level.    Regarding supervision, our guiding thought has been that  most  of the people are good, and only a very few need to be punished.  The shortcoming of such thinking becomes obvious when used to  guide the effort to correct unhealthy practices. Most people  caught in unhealthy practices are involved in general, minor  corruption offenses. If we concentrate on only corrupt elements  and leave most of the people unguarded, we would be letting  these people committing minor corruption offenses escape our  supervision, in effect encouraging them to continue making  offenses. This is the reason many units, especially monopolies,  law-enforcement and supervisory departments, and positions with  financial or personnel powers, have without exception, many  anticorruption provisions, which, however, were enacted to fool  inspection from higher levels rather than supervise and bind the  leaders themselves to rules. These anticorruption rules are  written on paper and posted on walls, but are hardly  implemented. In particular, when unhealthy practices such as  arbitrary levies are linked with the awards, welfare, and work  conditions of a unit, these unhealthy practices will be hardened  into interest group behavior and become even more entrenched for  the unit to do anything on its own. Social supervision,  including media and public opinion, has only made vague  criticisms and provided general guidance, or has exposed some  typical incidents, none of which has had much practical  supervisory impact on widespread unhealthy practices.    As for management, the biggest loophole is that under the  new  situation, we do not have a full package of methods to ensure  rational employment of state-owned assets. In the eyes of many,  the least valuable assets are public funds. There have been  incidents of reckless spending of public funds, funneling state  funds to unit coffers, and lining one's own pocket with public  money. So widespread and frequent are these incidents that no  amount of prevention and crackdown seem to be able to stop them,  with the result that state-owned assets are actually providing  the material basis for some unhealthy practices.    Regarding the economic structure, changes in governmental  functions have been slow. Powers that should be delegated  remain concentrated, streamlining and personnel cutbacks have  not been carried out, and cumbersome procedures have not been  simplified. Economic administrative departments do not  coordinate among themselves in work and set up barriers against  each other and complicated procedures, lowering efficiency. For  their own local or departmental interests and to get things  done, people have to "burn incense to pay homage to buddhas,"  and suffer the consequences if they forget to worship a certain  budhha. People compete in holding banquets, giving gifts, and  building up networks. The general standards for gifts become  "giving the kind of gifts others do not have; new ones when  others do have the same; or gifts in amounts larger than those  given by my rivals." Gifts become increasingly expensive and  banquets more upmarket, and in this twisted competition certain  unhealthy practices gain ground and become generally acceptable  "normal" behavior.    In the area of the financial system, one noted problem is  the  difficulty of maintaining regular funding for state organ  expenditures, especially for organs related to social stability  such as the public security apparatus, which has not been  getting even remotely enough appropriations. Some public  security organs cannot pay travel allowance to their personnel  handling women's and children's abduction cases, and have to  rely on "arbitrary levies" to subsidize operating expenditure.  Such a situation, in which "another loophole appears shortly  after one has been plugged," has caused some units to rely on  arbitrary levies for both their regular and irregular  expenditures. When departments of higher levels cannot solve  problems, they can only turn a blind eye, in effect encouraging  the unhealthy practice of arbitrary levies. The current travel  allowance arrangement for government cadres are also very  unreasonable. When a government cadre pays a work visit to  organs at a lower level, cadres at that level without exception  have to pay for his accommodation and food allowances, which  forces them to engage in unhealthy practices.    There are also numerous problems in the cadre personnel  system. In some units, promotions and dismissals depend entirely  on certain individuals. When many who are ideologically  unhealthy want to advance their official careers, they become  eager to spin relationship networks, look for backers, pave  their way by giving gifts, and recklessly spend public funds  instead of making real efforts at their work, thus corrupting  officialdom and fanning unhealthy practices.    There are also numerous loopholes in law and policies. Some  tend to be too simple and exist merely as general principles,  and therefore fail to clearly define encouragement, permission,  and prohibition and areas between them. As such they cannot  effectively regulate government workers. The scope and severity  of punishments for some law- and discipline-breaking acts vary  considerably, are hard to operate under, and therefore mutilate  against the purposes of punishment. In particular, there are  almost no constraints on collectives intent on engaging in  unhealthy practices, with the result that many unhealthy  practices are made under the excuse of providing welfare for  workers and in the name of units and collectives to ensure that  they will not be banned.  <H5>  1994: The Fight Against Corruption Will Deepen </H5>   Looking back at the 1993 anticorruption struggle, we have  scored certain results in the three tasks proposed by the  central authorities. Localities and departments which did well  achieved outstanding results in some areas, where various  negative and corrupt phenomena have been stopped or curbed.  More importantly, through the year's anticorruption effort,  people are now more confident. In the second half of February  1994, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection convened  its third plenary session to sum up experiences of the early  phase of anticorruption drive and plan for anticorruption work  in 1994 according central instructions. The anticorruption work  this year will have the same format of concentrating on three  tasks, which will, however, have new content as the situation  has changed.    The work of enabling leading cadres of party and government  organs at or above the county and departmental level to stay  clean and maintain self-discipline will continue to implement  last year's "five regulations" and reiterate the following  regulations: 1) There is to be no buying or exchanging imported  luxury sedans; there is to be no abuse of powers to exchange or  borrow cars from enterprises and subordinate units or have them  contribute money for car purchases. Cars used by leading cadres  cannot be purchased with loans, money from raised funds, or  special-purpose appropriations. Leading organs and units at the  county (city) level owing workers pay are not allowed to buy  sedans. 2) Cadres are not allowed to use their powers to  depress prices of residential houses they intend to buy--that  will be a violation of the State Council's regulations for  housing reforms; or to provide better house buying terms for  themselves, their sons or daughters or relatives; or to renovate  their own houses with public money on a scale exceeding official  limits. 3) Leading cadres must be economical in conducting  domestic business travel, their lodging and meals must not cost  more than set by local reception standards. No one is allowed  to hold functions specially for leading cadres. 4) No one is  allowed to make use of his or his family members' weddings,  funerals, job transfers, birthdays, or house removals to spend  recklessly or too much for the occasion, nor to hold  celebrations for these occasions with public money or public  property, with or without a view to pocketing money from such  celebrations. 5) No one is allowed to use his powers to delay  or refuse to pay back public money, to buy or build houses for  themselves or their relatives or friends, or to engage  profitmaking activities with borrowed public money. Subject to  local situations, localities and departments can increase some  other regulations as they see fit.    Case investigators must remain firm in their insistence on  focusing on the law- and discipline-breaking cases involving  leading party and government organs, leading cadres, judiciary  departments, administrative and law-enforcing departments, and  economic administrative departments and their workers.  Investigators must concentrate their effort on big and serious  cases and focus on bribery, corruption, and power abuse by  leading cadres; jobbery, stealing confiscated goods, obstruction  of justice, and law and discipline breaking by law and  discipline enforcers; and law- and discipline-breaking cases by  legal entities.    In the effort to correct unhealthy practices in professions  and trades, it is necessary to continue to curb arbitrary levies  vigorously. The focus is on implementing provisions of the  central authorities' policy of "parallel lines between income  and expenditure" in connection with administrative fees and  income from fines and confiscations, and adopting effective  measures to detach economic entities launched by government  organs. This year, we also need to seriously screen and tackle  the problem of party and government organs and their workers  abusing their powers in using firms' cars, computers, and  telecommunications without payments, and the problem of whether  or not this equipment belongs to organs or individuals; screen  and inspect the practice of funneling firms' funds into the  pocket of units or spending these funds on workers' welfare  under various excuses. We must resolutely curb the bad practice  of asking sponsorships from enterprises under various excuses  and continue to pursue the task of reducing peasants' burdens.  We must conscientiously implement the "circular from the  Central Committee General Office, State Council General Office  on strictly forbidding overseas (or outside-the-border) travel,  in whatever forms, which is sponsored by public funds" jointly  issued by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection  supervision department and six other departments. Moreover, we  must make special efforts to tackle outstanding problems in this  regard. The review and approval of travel under the 1994  official overseas (outside-the-border) travel scheme will also  be tightened up.</p>

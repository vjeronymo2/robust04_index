			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals return Jackson to the black An exceptional credit put Jackson Group, the East Anglian construction and industrial services company, back into profit. In the first half of 1992 it made Pounds 386,000 pre-tax, after taking in Pounds 874,000 exceptionals, being Pounds 1.37m from revaluation reserve on the sale of an investment property less Pounds 500,000 against the value of dealing property stock. Before the exceptionals the loss was Pounds 488,000, compared with the corresponding Pounds 292,000. Earnings per share came through at 1.8p (losses 0.9p) but the interim dividend is omitted (1p). Turnover was Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 26.4m) and generated a trading profit of Pounds 221,000 (Pounds 658,000). Operations in all divisions have been reviewed and measures taken to cope with on-going recession. That involved extra costs but would effect 'substantial savings' in 1993.</p>

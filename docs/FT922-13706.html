			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Count in Scotland off to a flying start THE campaign in Scotland has already produced one clear winner: the helicopter companies that ferried politicians around its remote regions. Helicopters are no longer used only by Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Paddy Ashdown and others cultivating an action-man image. The final days of the campaign saw unlikely figures such as Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary, taking to the air in a last-minute dash around the marginals. Last night the choppers were standing by to bring in ballot boxes from all over the highlands and islands to achieve the earliest declarations ever in the north of Scotland. Mr Keith Nichols, election officer at the Highlands regional council, is organising the count for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, Ross, Cromarty and Skye, and Caithness and Sutherland. In 1987 results for these three northernmost mainland constituencies were not announced until 1.30pm on Friday afternoon. This time the last one should be out by 2.30am. Mr Nichols has chartered three twin-engined helicopters from Black Isle Helicopters, the Scottish subsidiary of Dollar Helicopters. Twin engines allow the helicopters to fly at night, and the 27 pick-up points have been equipped with temporary lights. Argyll and Bute, a Conservative/Liberal Democrat marginal composed of islands and sparsely populated farmland, is expected to be the last Scottish constituency to declare, at about 12.30pm on Friday. A single-engined helicopter has been chartered from PLM Helicopters to pick up 22 ballot boxes from the most far-flung villages. Single-engined aircraft cost less to charter, about Pounds 500 per flying hour, but cannot fly in the dark, so the run will begin after dawn on Friday.</p>

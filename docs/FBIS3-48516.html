			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Since 15 January, Rangoon radio and  television have carried a series of live and recorded reports on  "mass rallies" held throughout Burma by the Union Solidarity and  Development Association [USDA]. According to the radio, USDA  members, departmental officials and public service personnel,  workers, peasants, fire service reserves, members of the  Literature and Periodicals and Theater Associations, athletes,  local people, students, and members of local Red Cross brigades  have been among those participating in the rallies.    Rangoon Radio Burma in Burmese at 1330 GMT on 15 January  carries a 37-minute report on a rally held by the Union  Solidarity and Development Association of Rangoon Division on 15  January at Aung San Stadium. The rally was carried live on  Burmese television and radio.    According to the radio, the rally was attended by 110,000  people, including USDA members from four districts of Rangoon  Division and members of the public. Those present "unanimously"  endorsed the six motions that were put forward at the meeting:  "Fully support the 104 basic principles laid down by the  National Convention; Solemnly support the five objectives of the  USDA; Urge the armed organizations in the jungle to give up the  policy of armed struggle and cooperate in working for the  development and prosperity of the Union; For the indigenous  people to safeguard national sovereignty from internal and  external threats; For all indigenous people to undertake as a  national duty to develop the Union into a peaceful, modern, and  prosperous state; and To assist in strengthening the USDA."    U Ko Lay, secretary of the USDA and mayor of Rangoon,  delivered an opening address at the rally, explaining the  significance of the USDA's five objectives: nondisintegration of  the Union; nondisintegration of national unity; perpetuation of  sovereign powers; promotion of patriotism with the objective of  enhancing national pride; and national development and the  emergence of a peaceful, modern, and prosperous nation. He also  explained the need for the people to implement these objectives.  U Ko Lay noted the people's support and praise for the State  Law and Order Restoration Council's [SLORC] national development  endeavors and the work being done by the National Convention.  He enumerated the 39 basic principles laid down by the National  Convention, saying the people have a duty to defend these  principles.    U Ko Lay said the SLORC -- which is based on the united  Defense Services -- is working effectively for social, economic,  and political development and the emergence of a modern state.  He also urged the organizations in the jungle to return to the  "legal fold." Continuing, he explained Burma's foreign policy  and actions as well as the subversive activities of the  "neocolonialists and their local henchmen," urging the public to  safeguard the country's sovereignty.    In conclusion, he called on the public to support the 104  basic principles laid down by the National Convention and  support the USDA's five objectives. He called on the  jungle-based organizations to give up the armed struggle,  cooperate in working for the development of the union, and  safeguard the country from external and internal threats. He  called on all indigenous people to undertake the development of  the union and the emergence of a peaceful and modern state as a  national duty, and to strengthen the organization of USDA.

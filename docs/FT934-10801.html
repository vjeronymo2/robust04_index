			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (4): Quiet revolution is under way in farming - Now the country must co-ordinate its agricultural reforms TEN years ago, 57 per cent of Morocco's population lived and worked on the land. That percentage has declined to 50 per cent and is set to continue its downward trend. However, fewer than half of all the jobs in Morocco are on the land, as between one fifth and one quarter of all farmers are seriously under-employed. Overall, this sector contributes nearly 20 per cent of gross domestic product, yet the average income of those who till the land amounts to half that obtained in the towns. Imports of foodstuffs account for 12 per cent of Morocco's trade deficit which in 1990-92 averaged Dh3bn a year. Yet exports of farm produce average 17 per cent of total exports and are growing, though in erratic fashion because very contrasted climatic conditions (the country has suffered badly from drought since 1991) makes the sector's contribution to national wealth volatile. Many difficult problems confront the Moroccan countryside. It remains under-equipped in many ways. Few small farmers have electricity, let alone running water, and little has been done to improve communications with outlying areas. The land remains extremely fragmented, with the average farms no more than 4.8 hectares, the average age of farmers is over 50 and between two-thirds and three-quarters of the population remains illiterate. Yet despite these difficulties, a quiet revolution is under way. Much of the credit for these changes rest with Mr Othman Demnati, who left the government earlier this year after a decade during which his reputation was steadily enhanced, an unusual outcome for someone occupying a ministerial portfolio in Morocco for so long. A private landowner himself and a man of common sense and determination, Mr Demnati set about changing a policy which, in the 25 years after independence in 1957 had seen fit to make the farming sector pay for the development of industry. Luckily, such a policy was not pursued, as in many other Arab or African countries, with the kind of ideological drive displayed in neighbouring Algeria. Furthermore, the monarch had no intention of impoverishing the countryside, from which he still draws considerable support. Throughout his reign, King Hassan has insisted that investment in water was essential. It is thanks to this policy that 10 per cent of all usable land is irrigated. Production from such land today accounts for 45 per cent of the added value of farm production and 90 per cent of the value of exports. In 1984, after three years of very severe drought, King Hassan decreed that farming would be exempt from taxes until the year 2000. Though it discriminated between rich and poor farmers, the decree was more than justified because the old agricultural tax yielded less than it cost to levy. A 50 per cent devaluation of the dirham over 10 years has provided a strong boost. The results are remarkable. The diversity of Moroccan production has grown. Potatoes, courgettes, winter melons, strawberries, artichokes grown from seed, peas, chilli peppers, mange-tout and cut flowers have been added to the traditional list of tomatoes and citrus. Even more remarkably, half of all exports now go to markets outside the European Community, notably to Canada and Scandinavia. Within the EC, Moroccan exporters have targeted the UK and Germany, markets where they were hardly present a decade ago, successfully. They are now taking their produce directly into Portsmouth through Geest, a large UK shipping, distribution and packaging company and into Bremen in north Germany. They are selling to eastern Europe, in exchange for hard cash. Where exports have not been diversified, difficulties remain. Sixty-five per cent of all tomatoes are exported to France, where they risk being destroyed by irate French farmers. Spain and France are in direct competition with Morocco but the EC has proved, overall, a good market for those producers in Morocco who innovate and upgrade quality - in other words, are really professional. Around Agadir on the Atlantic coast of southern Morocco, the carefully cultivated plain which boasts 300 days of sunshine a year looks from the air like parts of California. The Soussi berbers are proof that some Moroccans are more than able to hold their own in the modern world. Joint ventures with foreign partners, many of whom are actively relocating production, helps to explain this success. Near Agadir, one Swiss investor has built 400 greenhouses at a cost of between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m since 1990. The Spanish seem to be everywhere, in Larache near Tangiers in the north and around Agadir. British and French investors are present. In the vast irrigated Haouz project around Marrakesh, which boasts a computer-controlled water distribution system worthy of the best in the west. The Italians, the French and the Dutch are, growing roses on 120 hectares of land in joint ventures with Moroccans. Seventy per cent of the production is exported to Holland, Canada and the US. Not only is production increasing and getting very diversified, but more added value is being put onto products in Morocco. French bulk importers of Moroccan potatoes are now happy to treat and repackage Moroccan potatoes in winter months because their profit margins are under pressure owing to the recession. This winter Morocco will start treating and packaging some of its own potatoes before exporting them. Chilli peppers produced around Larache are being turned into paprika before being exported. Other factors have contributed to this revolution. One is that by introducing Israeli seeds to Morocco a few years ago, the authorities have in effect broken what was a virtual Dutch monopoly. Israeli irrigation techniques, often trading under Spanish convenience names, are also openly pointed to in Marrakesh and around Agadir. In the Haouz project, farms of different sizes are integrated into the water distribution pattern, less well-off farmers working side by side with wealthier ones. Some can afford more sophisticated irrigation and fertilising methods than their neighbours, but the result appears to encourage change rather than envy. On all these fronts, King Hassan's domaines royaux are said to offer models of what modern farming should be, but are virtually closed to outsiders. Observers agree that the economic reforms which the rescheduling of the country's debt forced on Morocco after 1983 have been the key to the current changes. Indeed, the abolition of the state export monopoly of fruit and vegetables and its replacement by private groups such as Atlas Fruit Board, which handles exports from the king's domains, have made all the difference. Another debate is now opening up which centres on why Morocco should be self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs such as sugar. Two-thirds of the sugar that Morocco consumes comes from the central Doukkala, Tadla and Gharb regions. But small local farmers are increasingly protesting against the local water boards that impose a pattern of water distribution, which is only of use to those who grow sugar beet. So great is their obduracy that some farmers have taken to sinking small wells and storing the water, thus escaping the tyranny of the water boards. Sugar beet is very labour-intensive and thus its cultivation reduces unemployment. Against that rather political logic, a new logic is increasingly rearing its head, that is the logic of the market and a real appreciation of the costs of production. And water is a key here as Morocco must manage its water resources with greater care. Needs are huge, while resources are increasingly expensive to mobilise, but years of drought will force, every few years, some water resources to be used for cereals rather than fruit and vegetable crops. Mr Demnati is believed to have left his post because he could not get the government to agree to co-ordinate the different aspects of rural development - bringing electricity, schools, roads and running water to what remains a physically and tribally very fragmented countryside. He appears, most notably, to have run into difficulties with the powerful ministry of the interior. Here, as in other sectors, the challenge Morocco faces in the next few years is to co-ordinate reforms which to date have often been conducted sector by sector and avoid what a recent strategic study on 'Rural Development' from the Ministry of Agriculture describes as 'confrontation' between different ministries and economic interests. Such a change would hold the key to further rationalising and developing the farming wealth of Morocco.</p>

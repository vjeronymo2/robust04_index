			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADAR VIOLATION  </P> <P> In his column ("U.S. Illusions Shattered in Snows of Krasnoyarsk," Op-Ed Page,  Oct. 30), Frank Gaffney has stooped to outright falsification of the views of  those with whom he differs. He labels the Arms Control Assn. (ACA), its  chairman, Ambassador Gerard Smith, and three of its board members, Ambassador  Paul Warnke, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and former National  Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, as "discredited apologists" for the Soviet  Union and suggests that they have denied that the Krasnoyarsk radar is a  violation of the ABM treaty. This is a total misrepresentation of their  position.  </P> <P> In fact, in 1984, ACA Chairman Smith, in an article he co-authored with Bundy,  McNamara and Ambassador George Kennan in Foreign Affairs, called the  Krasnoyarsk radar "a violation of the express language of the treaty" even  before the Reagan Administration published this accusation in its February,  1985, compliance report. This has been the consistent and oft-repeated position  of Smith, Bundy, and McNamara, as well as that of Ambassador Warnke, myself and  other ACA board members. It was also the explicit conclusion of ACA's 1987  analysis of Soviet compliance activities and of our mid-1989 book, "Arms  Control and National Security."  </P> <P> Gaffney does not enhance the credibility of his arguments by such irresponsible  attacks on those who would protect the ABM treaty and support a new strategic  arms agreement.  </P> <P> SPURGEN M. KEENY JR.  </P> <P> President and Executive Director  </P> <P> Arms Control Assn.  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Ozone layer set to recover The earth's protective ozone layer will reach its lowest level around the turn of the century and is then expected to recover gradually to near-normal levels within about 50 years, according to the latest scientific assessment of ozone depletion released this week by the World Meteorological Organisation and the UN Environment Programme, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. The assessment confirms that international action to curb production of ozone-depleting chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has already begun to slow the build-up of these chemicals in the atmosphere. However, it warns that 'the ozone layer's most vulnerable period still lies ahead' and that the expected recovery is contingent on strict adherence by all nations to the Montreal Protocol which bans production of CFCs after 1995.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia must go ahead with building a balanced navy  which would include all types of warships, Deputy  Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Igor Kasatonov  told Interfax.    He said priority would be given to the building of  submarines, cruisers and anti-submarine warships with a  displacement tonnage of 10,000-12,000 tons and medium-class  vessels such as destroyers and patrol ships with a displacement  tonnage of 4,000-5,000 tons.    On the future of Russia's aircraft carrier fleet, Kasatonov  said that out of the three carriers it had, only one, Felix  Kuznetsov, was on combat duty in the Pacific. The second  carrier, Varyag, is 85 percent complete, but he said there was  no money to finish the project at the moment. More  disturbingly, the carrier is under construction at Nikolyayev  shipyards belonging to Ukraine, which is also cash-starved,  Kasatonov said. As for the third carrier, Ulyanovsk, it is yet  to be assembled, he said.    Nonetheless, the admiral believes the current trend of  building aircraft carriers will persist though Russia cannot  afford this at present. At the same time if other CIS states  are ready to help finance the program, Moscow will welcome this,  Kasatonov said.</p>

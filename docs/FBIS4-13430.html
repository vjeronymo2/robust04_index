			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 19, IRNA -- The English daily `KAYHAN  INTERNATIONAL' in its editorial Tuesday [19 April] said that the  U.S. confused military policies show that the U.S. senior  officials themselves are foggy about the rules governing  eventualities.    The paper referred to the downing of two American  helicopters  by two American F-15 jets last Thursday in which 26 American and  allied personnel were killed in what had been termed a `friendly  fire' disaster in northern Iraq.    It commented that had the helicopters been downed by Iraqi  aircraft the consequence would have been disastrous and Pentagon  would have mobilized allied support and "once again we would  have witnessed a display of American military machismo with  innocent Iraqi citizens being the target of relentless hellfire  of the allied war machine."    The article said, "It is only when Americans erroneously  kill  their compatriots or get killed by the enemy that it becomes an  eye-opener for U.S. policy makers to review their rules of  engagements in military operations abroad. The rules defining  when U.S. forces can attack enemies have now been tightened."    After a series of foreign policy and military faux pas, now  the world sees a Clinton deflated and the American people  demoralized over Washington's foreign policy. Human errors made  at the lower levels are a reflection of bigger blunders  committed by the top brass, concluded the editorial.</p>

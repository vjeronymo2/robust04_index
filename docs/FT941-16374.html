			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EU directive on utilities 'could increase prices' The European Union's Utilities Directive could lead to higher prices for electricity transmission and distribution equipment, dashing hopes that competitive purchasing could reduce costs and benefit consumers, a report* says today. The controversial procurement directive, which came into force last January, was a key weapon in the European Commission's battle to subject suppliers of goods and services such as utilities to long-term competitive pressures. The Commission has long believed that the tendency of public agencies to buy equipment and services from domestic suppliers meant costs were higher than if contracts had been allocated on the basis of full and fair international competition, which the directive is aimed at encouraging. However, a report by Mr Steve Thomas and Mr Francis McGowan of Sussex University says the reverse could be the case for transmission and distribution equipment. 'It may be that the time when procurement liberalisation measures could prove useful has already passed and the rigidities a mandatory requirement would impose could prove counter-productive,' it says. 'Given the dangerously concentrated nature of the equipment supply industry, a much greater threat to the economic welfare of consumers may be posed by non-competitive forces in the equipment supply industry than is posed by the policies of the electricity supply industry.' In the past, says the report, electric utilities in France, Italy, Germany and the UK could all choose from at least two domestic suppliers for most big items of equipment. Now, following a series of cross-border mergers and takeovers, the option of 'buying national' usually does not exist. With further mergers still likely, no prospect of new equipment suppliers being created and the 'worrying history of cartel behaviour' in the supply industry, the assumption that it will always behave competitively looks optimistic, says the report. The directive also makes it more difficult for utilities to enter into long-term agreements with suppliers to develop and purchase new designs of equipment, ironically a practice that is increasingly common in other industries, says the report. This could weaken the utilities' market power. *The European Market for Transmission and Distribution Equipment.

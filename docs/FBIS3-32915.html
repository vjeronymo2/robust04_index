			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special AFP correspondent Lidia Hunter] </F>   [Text] El Rosario, 15 Feb (AFP) -- Rebel leaders and  members of a mission of international observers and the Catholic  Church have stressed the success of a meeting held Tuesday to  begin the disarmament process of the 3-80 Northern Front,  Nicaragua's principal armed group.    The meeting between guerrilla leaders and representatives of  the peace mission, which consists of representatives of the  International Support and Verification Commission of the OAS  (CIAV-OAS) and the Catholic Church, took place in El Rosario, a  village in Nueva Segovia Department in the northern part of the  country, 2 km south of the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.    Both parties confirmed Army chief Humberto Ortega sent the  rebels a message that presumably established the terms for their  demobilization and subsequent integration into civilian life.  The content of the document was not revealed to the press,  however.    For its part, the 3-80 Northern Front gave the CIAV a  document with its demands which consists basically of guarantees  for physical security for the disarmament process.    The Peace Commission will give the document to the  government. A new meeting will then be called on an as yet  unspecified date, CIAV representative Sergio Caramanga has  explained.    Both the Army and rebels have maintained a unilateral truce  since last week to pave the way for the disarmament talks.    Caramagna said at the end of the meeting the objective of  "exchanging proposals" had been achieved.    Esteban Talavera, one of the rebel leaders, said the  participation in the talks of the 3-80 Northern Front's foremost  leader, his brother Jose Angel Talavera, alias Chacal, was  impeded by the strong presence of military troops in the region.    According to him, approximately 120 special Army troops were  deployed to the region in the past few hours. This prevented  Chacal from reaching the area. It is believed Chacal is in a  region bordering Honduran territory.    The 3-80 Northern Front leaders reiterated their readiness  to  disarm without the political conditions they had established  several months ago, including the resignation of Army chief  Humberto Ortega and Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo.    "We will insist on these demands in a civic struggle,  because  the political climate has improved in Nicaragua," Esteban  Talavera said. As a goodwill gesture, Talavera released a  soldier who was captured several days ago in fighting with the  Army.</p>

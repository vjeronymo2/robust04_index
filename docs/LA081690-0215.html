			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 IN INSIDER TRADING CASE FINED $37,445  </P> <P> An Anaheim stockbroker and a Torrance printing plant worker, who were convicted  in May on civil charges relating to an insider trading scheme using advance  information from Business Week magazine, were ordered Wednesday to repay  $28,655 in illegal profits and fined $37,445.  </P> <P> Brian J. Callahan, a high-profile broker with Prudential-Bache Securities in  Anaheim before he was fired for his role in the scandal, was ordered to repay  $1,149 in personal profits and $8,000 in commissions earned on sales to  clients.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles also issued a permanent  injunction barring Callahan from future securities law violations and ordered  him to pay a fine of $27,445, or an amount equal to three times his illegal  profits.  </P> <P> William N. Jackson, a former quality control inspector at the R.R. Donnelley  printing plant in Torrance, was ordered to give back $19,507 in illegal profits  and pay a $10,000 fine. He also has been fired from his job.  </P> <P> The case was one of five around the country involving stock transactions based  on advance knowledge the contents of Business Week's "Inside Wall Street"  column. Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Christopher Petito said  three of the other cases have been settled and one is still outstanding.  </P> <P> Patricia A. Friedel, an attorney for Callahan, said he would appeal both the  original verdict and the penalty.  </P> <P> Jackson's attorney, Jack Samet, said his client would not appeal. "Given the  determination of the jury that the conduct was unlawful, we accept as  reasonable the conclusions of the judge," Samet said.  </P> <P> Samet noted that Jackson was not formally barred from future violations of  securities laws and interpreted that as an indication that Jackson was "viewed  by the judge as less culpable."  </P> <P> The SEC had asked that Callahan also be forced to repay nearly $20,000 in  profits his clients earned between 1987 and 1989 from trades based on the  inside information. But Petito said the penalty of three times the illegal  personal profit is the largest allowed under the law and that he believes  Callahan is the first defendant ever to be subject to that sanction.  </P> <P> Jackson said during the trial that he did not believe he was doing anything  wrong by using information from "Inside Wall Street." He would call Callahan  after the magazine had been printed but before it hit the streets and order  stocks based on what was in the column.  </P> <P> Callahan maintained that he did not know where Jackson worked and that he had  no idea that the stock tips were coming from Business Week. Attorneys for the  defendants also argued that in any case, the information did not truly  constitute insider information.  </P> <P> The SEC countered that Donnelley kept its workers well informed of the law and  that Callahan was fully aware of the origins of Jackson's information.  </P></p>

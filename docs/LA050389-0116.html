			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER BLANKS OCEAN VIEW  </P> <P> A dominating performance by pitcher Brett Grebe helped Westminster remain in a  tie for first place in the Sunset League as the Lions defeated Ocean View, 3-0,  Tuesday at Westminster.  </P> <P> Westminster (16-6-1, 8-4), which began the day tied with Ocean View and  Fountain Valley, is now tied with Fountain Valley for first place. Westminster  plays Fountain Valley Saturday.  </P> <P> Grebe came into the game with the third highest number of strikeouts (77) among  county pitchers. He added six while giving up two hits and walking two.  </P> <P> He threw only 97 pitches, the fewest number of pitches he has thrown for seven  innings, Westminster Coach Ken Ostrowski said.  </P> <P> "He was just overpowering. He had the good stuff," Ostrowski said. "He was  strong. He felt good. He was on, and the rest, as they say, is history."  </P> <P> Westminster scored in the third inning. Jim Slagle singled, then stole second  before first baseman Ryan Klesko singled down the third-base line to score  Slagle and put the Lions up, 1-0.  </P> <P> Lion third baseman Joe Tiano led off the fifth with a double. Brent Heredia  laid down a sacrifice bunt, to Ocean View pitcher Brent Woken, but Woken's  throw went over the first baseman's head.  </P> <P> Tiano scored from first on the error to make it 2-0, with Heredia reaching  third.  </P> <P> Angel Lopez's ground ball up the middle scored Heredia for the final run of the  game.  </P> <P> In other Sunset League games:  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 3, Edison 2 -- Mark Dodd walked with the bases loaded in the  bottom of the seventh inning to give host Fountain Valley (15-7, 8-4), which  scored three runs in the inning, the come-from-behind victory. Edison pitcher  Rick Alvarez had walked the first three batters of the inning, before Don Smith  took over and gave up one run on a groundout and the tying run on a squeeze  bunt by John Orcher. Jeff Daniels then relieved and walked Dodd on five  pitches. Steve Montgomery went the distance for Fountain Valley, giving up two  unearned runs on five hits while striking out 12 and walking one. Edison drops  to 7-10-2 overall and 5-7 in the league.  </P> <P> Marina 4, Huntington Beach 2 -- Robin Lindsey had two hits and two RBIs for the  Vikings (11-12, 4-8) at Marina.  </P></p>

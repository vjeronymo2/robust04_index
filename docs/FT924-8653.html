			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Ford unions to ballot on action - Workers face compulsory redundancies for first time in 30 years UNIONS AT Ford in the UK are to ballot members on industrial action, as workers face compulsory redundancies for the first time in almost 30 years as well as a 40 per cent cut in pay for workers on short time. Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU electrical and engineering union, said yesterday: 'The company seems to be turning the industrial relations clock back 20 years. We have no option but to ballot members on action.' Ford said its Halewood, Merseyside, car assembly plant would move to single shift working for November in a further bid attempt to cut car production in line with weak sales. The threat of industrial action followed Ford's withdrawal of an offer to maintain its long-standing policy of voluntary redundancies only, in exchange for a six-month pay freeze from November 24 and a cut in lay-off pay from 100 per cent of the basic wage to 60 per cent from Jan-uary 1 1993. The lay-off pay of a skilled day worker earning Pounds 281.93 a week would go down to Pounds 169.15. Mr John Hougham, Ford personnel director, indicated that some undertakings made before the downturn could no longer be sustained. 'We are prisoners of the economic climate. We believe the market is going to stay totally flat throughout the year and see little sign of an upturn before 1994.' The company still hopes to avoid compulsory redundancies but is looking for about 270 more volunteers before December 11. More than 3,000 workers have already volunteered to leave this year. The Dagenham assembly plant is likely to achieve all job losses voluntarily, but some workers at Halewood are likely to face enforced redundancies, although all Ford workers can apply for an enhanced severance package. Ford's move contrasts with the deal negotiated by Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, last month for a two-year 3.6 per cent pay deal and a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies. Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union, said Ford workers would be balloted on strike action and action short of a strike. But he said: 'We certainly won't walk our members into a major problem.' Unions are angry because they believe UK plants are unfairly bearing the brunt of job cuts in Ford's European operations, in spite of significant recent productivity gains in the UK.

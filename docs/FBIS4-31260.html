			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tirana special correspondent Marina Vikhou] </F>   [Excerpt] In an interview with Greek correspondents,  Servet Pellumbi, first vice chairman of the Socialist Party of  Albania, said that "the U.S. policy in the case of Albania is  not unified. The State Department follows a different policy  from that of the CIA and the Pentagon."    Explaining his position, Pellumbi said that "the U.S. State  Department initially favored the fall of the communist system as  well as the technical support and democratization of Albania.  At the same time, there are U.S. military interests in the  Balkans and Europe that are separate and are expressed by the  Pentagon."    Pellumbi also pointed out that "Albania is being  strengthened  by the United States more militarily than economically.  However, this causes concern to the other Balkan states. The  Socialist Party has supported from the very beginning that since  we participate in the `Partnership for Peace' we should tell the  people the whole truth."    According to the Socialist Party vice chairman, "no  permission can be given to U.S. spy planes to use Albania as a  base for their flights over the former Yugoslavia unless the  Albanian people are informed in advance, unless some referendum  is held to tell them the pros and cons of such a decision."    However, Pellumbi expressed his optimism that "recently the  State Department's stand has been more positive, their  statements are more objective. They give us to understand that  they will defend the forces that are based on the people. The  U.S. Embassy in Tirana has until now been unreservedly  supporting the policy of [Albanian President Sali] Berisha.  However, I think that with the arrival of the new ambassador in  Tirana in September, the situations will improve."    Pellumbi's position on the relations between the Berisha  regime and Europe was interesting. He noted that "the biggest  problem facing the Albanian Government is its relations with  Europe.    "Europe calls the Tirana government the `Berisha regime.'  With the escalation of tension he applies to Greek-Albanian  relations, Berisha wants to tell Europe `look, here are our  country's stability and security in danger and you are dealing  with human rights and democracy.'"

"In order to discuss additional measures that could be  taken,  in the spirit of respect for the international and bilateral  obligations that both countries have undertaken to prevent  border incidents, the Yugoslav side has recently proposed to the  relevant Albanian bodies that an extraordinary session of the  main joint Yugoslav-Albanian commission for border incidents be  held in Belgrade."    The statement goes on to say: "The normalization of  relations  on the Yugoslav-Albanian border would improve relations between  the two countries, which the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  adhering to the principles of good-neighborliness, has as its  lasting goal."</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Blurred relations in integrated houses Sir, The recent debacle at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is terrifying in its implications. Have corporations become so ashamed of their accounting policies that they need to gag a reference work by Terry Smith? Does this mean shareholders' needs have been subordinated to the large corporations by the integrated houses? Further, has the objectivity of analysis been compromised by the need of the integrated houses to keep the FT-SE 100 companies sweet? I understand that no specific recommendations are made in Terry Smith's book. It merely outlines methods used by companies. Why, then, should any company be distressed by an analyst pointing out policies sanctioned by its board? Is it time for the institutions to review again the blurring of relationships within the integrated houses? Perhaps the two-way function of broker and marketmaker is a manageable relationship, but that including corporate finance is not. P G Moon, Hartnup House, Smarden, Kent TN27 8QB</p>

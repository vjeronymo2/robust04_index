Diplomats say it is difficult to obtain a clear  picture of what is happening, but troops from the Makoanyane  Barracks on the outskirts of the capital are believed to have  launched an attack on the defense force headquarters in Maseru.  South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha is being kept well  informed on the situation.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Generously-priced new issues raise little enthusiasm THE uncertain tone continued in the international bond market yesterday, with even generously-priced new issues finding little enthusiasm among investors. Tohoku Electric Power, the fifth largest of the Japanese power utilities, launched a Dollars 250m five-year issue via Yamaichi International. The 7 3/4 per cent bonds were reoffered to investors at a fixed price of 99.90, for a yield 66 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. Participants said that the pricing was fair, with bonds of a similar maturity issued by other Japanese power companies offering a yield spread of around 60 basis points. However, demand for the paper was restrained against the background of a weak US Treasury market. In addition, few investors are familiar with a borrower making its first Eurodollar bond issue since 1984. The bonds traded down to 99.85 bid, where the yield spread over US government paper was 69 basis points. Osaka Gas, another Japanese utility, launched a DM300m five-year deal, lead managed by Westdeutsche Landesbank, into an equally lacklustre German bond market. The paper carries a coupon of 8 1/2 per cent and was priced to yield 8.79 per cent, or 49 basis points more than German government bonds. Again, the pricing was seen as generous by participants, offering a higher yield than bonds issued by European corporations. For example, five-year bonds issued by Fiat offer a yield of around 8.62 per cent. But the deal struggled to find buyers in a market dominated by negative sentiment. The bund futures contract on the Liffe fell to 87.20 during the day, having opened at 87.37. From an issue price of 101.375, the Osaka Gas bonds traded down to 99.10 bid, just inside full fees. Nacional Financiera, the Mexican state-backed financing agency, launched a Dollars 100m seven-year issue, lead managed by Bear Sterns International. The 9 3/8 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.25, where the yield is 205 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. Participants reported reasonable demand for the paper, despite a yield spread seen as tight for a Latin American borrower.</p>

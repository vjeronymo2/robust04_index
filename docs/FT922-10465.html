			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Volvo optimistic on Renault alliance VOLVO, the Swedish car and truck group, said it would save SKr4bn (Dollars 670m) a year - equivalent to 5 per cent of group sales - by the end of the decade as a result of its alliance with Renault, the French vehicle group. Mr Christer Zetterberg, chief executive, said the alliance with Renault would provide savings of SKr400m this year for Volvo. Separately, Mr Zetterberg said that in spite of the weak start to the year, 1992 would be 'clearly better than the preceding year,' although no precise forecasts were given by the group. Speaking at a press conference before Volvo's annual general meeting yesterday, Mr Zetterberg said that when the group entered into its alliance with Renault in 1989, 'we estimated that the savings - integration gains - would amount to SKr800m annually within two to five years, increasing thereafter to SKr2bn a year. Today, our calculations indicate a savings potential of SKr4bn annually toward the end of the 1990s'. Mr Zetterberg said Volvo's alliance with Renault was 'developing very well . . . in fact, significantly better than we dared hope in the beginning'. About 75 per cent of the savings related to product development and the supply of components, he added. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman, stressed the strategic motivations behind the group's alliance with Renault. He said that the link provided economies of scale, highly complementary product programmes, and a presence in the European Community. It also provided gains through industrial co-operation in product development, procurement and manufacturing, he added. However, on a less optimistic note, Volvo said 1992 had seen a rather weak start. In the truck sector, Volvo experienced a decrease in market share in Europe, and its truck division suffered from 'substantial costs' related partly to the development of new products. Volvo said that car sales had declined in 17 of its most important markets in March, although the group managed to increase its market share in Sweden. Mr Zetterberg, who is responsible for introducing a cost-cutting programme which included slashing 11,000 jobs, said the full effect of the rationalisation would not be felt until 1993. He is leaving the group this autumn following a surprise management shake-up last month. Mr Soren Gyll replaces Mr Zetterberg as chief executive officer.</p>

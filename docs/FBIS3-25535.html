At a meeting held in Kaparabyong and chaired by  President Museveni, the Karamojong, through their  representative, Mr. Philip Ichumal, who is also the Resistance  Council [RC] Three chairman for Namalu, expressed their  gratitude to the pacification committee which is sensitizing  them on how to live peacefully and harmoniously with their  neighbors. Mr. Ichumal assured the president that the  Karamojong will ensure that all guns are handed over to the  vigilante force in Moroto within two weeks. He said that they  will also go and tell their fellow Karamojong, in other areas  never to come with guns to the neighboring districts. Mr.  Ichumal also appealed to the government to facilitate the  pacification committee with transport so that it can coordinate  interaction easily between the Karamojong and their Teso  neighbors at all levels of the community so that there is  permanent peace in the region. He said that constant contact is  necessary to help iron out hostilities. He also expressed  confidence that education is necessary to help Karamojong to  change their behavior. He asked the government and the Teso  people to forgive the Karamojong for the wrongs committed to the  neighboring communities.    President Museveni, in his remarks, stressed the need to  have  the program supported by Karamojong as well as all other people  in their neighboring districts to help the government alleviate  the suffering of the people in the region. The president also  urged Ugandans to support the formation of the vigilance group  in Karamoja because they are already doing a good job in the  phasing out of illegal guns in Karamoja. He therefore urged all  Karamojong with illegal guns to join the vigilance force, which  is like LDUs [local defense units] in other areas, adding that  government will consider some incentives for the vigilantes.  Mr. Museveni also said that he is ready to visit Karamojong  Kraal leaders who, he said, need to be educated on how to keep  cows cost-effectively and get earnings from their herds.    President Museveni addressed a public rally at Kaparabyong  County headquarters, where he commended the people of Teso for  rejecting insurgency. He said that this will help government to  tackle the problem of illegal guns still in Karamojong hands.  He said that the government will ensure that the Karamojong  become law-abiding citizens.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told Parliament  yesterday some MPs were suspected of involvement in drug deals  and he vowed to get rid of them. He said he had a list of  suspected drug dealing politicians, including MPs and provincial  and local politicians, but declined to reveal who or how many  there were.    Mr Chuan said the list was not updated and those who had  been  in previous governments for the past several years would know as  much as he did. But the list of suspected drug dealing  politicians was not provided by Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri, according to the Premier.    The Premier pledged to take action against all drug dealers  no matter if they were MPs or other politicians.    "Don't ask who they are or how many. That's useless. We  don't have any evidence to pin them down. We only have  suspicions."    Mr Chuan said he did not have any evidence which could lead  to the arrests of any MPs and disclosure of their names would  not be of any help.    "It's the duty of my Government to suppress all vice and I  believe no party wants to have bad MPs."    But the Premier did not confirm or deny news reports that  Sqn  Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong had claimed in a Cabinet meeting  on Tuesday that 17 MPs were allegedly drug dealers.    Sqn Ldr Prasong dismissed the reports during his testimony  before the House Committee for Parliamentary Affairs as well as  during the full House meeting yesterday. The minister said he  was doing the right thing for the prestige of Parliament and the  country.    "It's a shame on us all. If you wore a bucket to hide your  face, I would wear a bucket to hide my face, too," he said  referring to drug claims against MPs. Mr Chuan said Cabinet  meetings were supposed to be secret but admitted it was his  Government's fault some information was leaked to the press.    Chat Phatthana MP Sophon Phetsawang and a few other MPs  insisted the Premier tell the House whether or not Sqn Ldr  Prasong had made such a claim during the weekly Cabinet meeting.    The Premier said the foreign minister had shown documents  provided by United States authorities through the US Embassy in  Bangkok on allegations that Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong  and Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon Chongsuthamani had been involved  in drug deals.    The US authorities seized Mr Thanong's home and car in  California, lodged criminal charges against the Chat Thai MP for  his alleged marijuana smuggling and revoked in March a visa for  Mr Mongkhon, also suspected of having dealt in drugs. The  foreign minister reported this to the Cabinet, Mr Chuan said.    Mr Thanong was suspected to be a marijuana smuggler between  1977 and 1987, the period during which he was not a Chat Thai  MP, but the information pertaining to the claims was only  recently exposed to the press, according to Mr Chuan. He did  not think there was any conspiracy outside Parliament which  might want to sabotage the House; only some MPs who might want  to discredit other MPs or tarnish the entire House.    "I don't think there is any conspiracy. It's only among us.  Don't blame anybody else."    His comment followed several MPs' claim that drug dealing  charges against the 17 MPs might have been made as part of a  conspiracy outside Parliament aimed at destroying the entire  House.    Mr Chuan dismissed criticism that drugs claims surrounding  the Opposition MPs were designed to pre-empt a no-confidence  motion the Opposition had planned to launch against his  Government.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Arts: Kiri te Kanawa/Maxim Vengerov - Barbican Hall The Barbican is busying itself with a celebration of its 10th anniversary, and has launched a glossy series of recitals and concerts to mark the occasion. The festivities began on Monday with an appearance by Kiri te Kanawa - a mixed bag of a recital that stretched from Purcell to Walton via many points in between. It was not, in truth, the kind of a festive event the occasion and the audience of adoring fans expected. The singer's determination to leave the platform for extended intervals between the smallest groups of songs broke what little continuity there was in the first half, which hardly gained any sense of focus until the final groups of songs, by Mozart and Liszt, were gratefully reached. The opening had been dutiful rather than involved; in Purcell's 'The Blessed Virgin's Expostulation' and arias by Gluck (from Paride ed Elene), Scarlatti and Piccinni, te Kanawa found little sense of line or focus, and adjusted only slowly to the size of the hall (never the best for a song recital). But Mozart's 'An Chloe', 'Un moto di gioia' and especially 'Abendemfindung' brought much more security, as she smoothed out her phrasing and began to introduce nuance and colour; the Liszt selection then, highlighted by 'Freudvoll und Leidvoll', was poised and positively succulent. Duparc shared the second half with Walton. While it is hard to breathe much more life into the three spin-offs from Facade with which Kiri te Kanawa ended, her Duparc selection of brought the finest moments of the evening. There is more sensuousness and ambiguity to be woven into 'L'Invitation au voyage', but 'Extase' and 'Phidyle' had the kind of rapt coherence and easeful phrasing one hoped all of the evening would have offered more generously. In the Duparc too Roger Vignoles came finally into his own; after his labours in the ill-fitting accompaniments to the baroque and classical arias, he was able to get to grips with these meaty, rewarding piano parts in a genuinely perceptive way.                             *      *      * On Tuesday, when the young Siberian-born violinist Maxim Vengerov appeared with the English Chamber Orchestra, there were a few unsold seats at the furthest edges of the Barbican Hall. That seems worth recording, since it may never happen again. Followers of the Carl Flesch Competition have known about Vengerov since he won it - at 16 - in 1990, and those of us who heard his Wigmore hall debut last May came away astounded and deeply impressed. He seems a phenomenon of nature, though there is nothing wild about his native wood-notes. On the contrary, his readings are classically faithful, without a hint of performer's self-indulgence (except when that is part of the text, as in his sensational 'Carmen' Fantasy at the Wigmore). He just happens to play the violin like someone congenitally meant for it. Discussing 'technique' and 'control' would seem out of place: no doubt Vengerov has learnt things since he first took the instrument up, but it must have been like learning to walk and talk. His violin speaks as directly and effortlessly in 'difficult' passages as in plain melodies; his big, forthright tone carries all the expressive precision of a human voice. His Mendelssohn Concerto, ably supported by the ECO under Yan Pascal Tortelier, was a model of brilliant simplicity. Everything in his part sounded, and always to a lucid purpose - the weightless virtuoso flights, the heartfelt double-stopping, the sweetly radiant line of the Andante. No touch of Schmalz there, though a few passionate curves reminded us that Vengerov is Russian; he traced the idyll with rapt, selfless attention. His tempo for the finale was a clear notch above what most violinists will risk, and yet the music danced easily. Better still, he gave full, intrepid value to Mendelssohn's 'Presto' for the first-movement coda: it made perfect structural sense and a dazzling sound.</p>

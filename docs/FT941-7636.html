			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Pentagon counsel for Reno deputy The Clinton administration yesterday picked Ms Jamie Gorelick, general counsel at the Pentagon, to be its new deputy attorney general. Attorney General Janet Reno, who asked Mr Philip Heymann, her last deputy, to leave because of different management styles, said Ms Gorelick was 'an accomplished lawyer and a proven leader'. The nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, and the 43-year-old lawyer could face some hostility from conservative Republicans who have complained about the way she handled them while at the defence department. Ms Gorelick has already passed the confirmation hurdle once when she was appointed to her Pentagon position. But, like Mr Strobe Talbott, who was confirmed by the Senate this week as deputy secretary of state after some rancorous debate, she could face greater difficulty in winning votes for this more public post. Nevertheless, her nomination is expected to be approved without too much difficulty. She has considerable experience of the nomination process, since she supervised not only the administration's defence nominees but also Ms Reno's own confirmation hearings last year.</p>

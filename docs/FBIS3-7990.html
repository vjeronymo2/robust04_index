			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, parliamentary group leader of </F> the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Attila Zsoldos; place and  date not given: "Kuncze on Success Propaganda"]    [Text] While he has been using very clever rhetoric since  he was elected prime minister, Peter Boross has not implemented  any real changes, Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] told NEPSZABADSAG.  Kuncze named the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] as his  party's strongest opponent at the elections. In his view, it  has not yet been decided which tendency will become dominant in  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] after the elections.    [Zsoldos] After the MDF's national meeting and the MSZP's  congress, what are your views on the SZDSZ's possibilities for  making a coalition after the elections?    [Kuncze] We continue to maintain that this depends on the  possibility to reconcile the programs, and this question can  only be answered after the election results are known.    [Zsoldos] In the past, you said that an increasing number of  tendencies exist in the MDF and you do not know which one will  become the dominant one. Do you still hold the same view?    [Kuncze] It has not been possible to clarify our views on  the MDF because we still do not know their program. On the  basis of the ideas raised at the MDF's national meeting, it  seems that, on the level of rhetoric, they are beginning to echo  the proposals that the SZDSZ has long been representing in its  amendment proposals.    [Zsoldos] Does this mean that, even after the election of  Peter Boross as prime minister, it is still impossible precisely  to determine the MDF's political line?    [Kuncze] I still see the coexistence of many tendencies in  the MDF and it is impossible to know what weight they will have  in the new parliament after May.    [Zsoldos] Which party does the SZDSZ see as its main  election opponent?    [Kuncze] The MSZP, on the basis of the public opinion polls.    [Zsoldos] With the approach of the elections, what are the  most dangerous phenomena in your view?    [Kuncze] As the official campaign period has not yet begun,  I cannot give a clear answer to this. On one hand, I am afraid  of the quite conceivable possibility that the forces that refer  to the past 40 years will have too much presence in the MSZP's  campaign. On the other hand, it can already be seen that the  MDF has launched a success propaganda that does not reflect the  real conditions. This is dangerous for the public opinion  because it is misleading, and it is also dangerous for the MDF  because it defines its program and its tasks for after the  elections starting from an unrealistic situation.    [Zsoldos] The MDF's popularity increased after the election  of Boross as prime minister. To what do you attribute this?    [Kuncze] According to the latest opinion polls, the  temporary increase of the MDF's popularity has stopped. Boross,  who has indeed been using a very clever rhetoric since his  eleciton has not actually implemented any real changes in  governing. The press is still loud with corruption cases in  privatization. The fact that the government has replaced some  of its members does not alter the fact that the institutional  system that facilitates corruption is unchanged. Boross has  also refused to make changes in the leadership of the television  and radio although these can fundamentally influence the purity  of the elections. Boross has been trying very hard to appear in  an attractive manner for the public and draw the MDF with  himself, nevertheless, the mistakes of the past four years will  be a burden on the next governmental cycle. People draw the  conclusions on the past four years on the basis of the contents  of their wallets rather than on the basis of success propaganda.</p>

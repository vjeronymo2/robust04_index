			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WATERFRONT HOTEL MOVES CLOSER TO CONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> A proposed 41-story luxury hotel between Seaport Village and the San Diego  Marriott's twin towers moved closer to construction Tuesday. The San Diego  Unified Port District unanimously backed the project but asked for several  minor architectural changes.  </P> <P> The board, which last July approved the conceptual plan for the sprawling  waterfront project, met Tuesday to review design changes prompted by the  expansion of the site to 5.91 from 4.75 acres when the city realigned Harbor  Drive.  </P> <P> Aside from a pair of complaints from environmental groups, and minor aesthetic  recommendations from the Port District, the process went smoothly for Doug  Manchester, president of Torrey Enterprises and chief developer of the project.  Manchester owns the adjacent San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina.  </P> <P> Manchester argued that, in order to attract the major gatherings of trade  associations it wants and needs for the new Convention Center to thrive, San  Diego "demands" the hotel space that would be provided by the Hyatt Regency San  Diego.  </P> <P> One of his architects -- several flew in for the meeting, one from Dallas, the  others from San Francisco -- said the new Hyatt hotel would be an  "architectural showplace" for San Diego.  </P> <P> "I know of several large groups and associations that wanted desperately to  come here for their conventions but deferred to other cities," Manchester said.  "The reason is, at the present time, we just don't have the space."  </P> <P> Christopher B. Neils, Manchester's attorney, said Convention Center management  has indicated it needs at least 2,000 hotel rooms adjacent to the waterfront  site. Neils said the Marriott now provides 1,400, and the additional rooms  provided by the Hyatt Regency (about 900), would push San Diego over the  minimum.  </P> <P> "I think this project is worth about $60 million to $70 million a year for the  economy of San Diego, not to mention what it will bring in occupancy taxes and  new jobs," Manchester said.  </P> <P> Even so, Manchester's presentation, also involving landscapers and attorneys,  failed to win the commissioners' complete and immediate backing. Commissioner  Lynn Schenk abstained from voting on the matter, saying only she hoped the  project was "public friendly" and served the interests of San Diegans as a  whole.  </P> <P> The 6-0 vote merely endorsed a motion, asking Torrey and its band of architects  to redesign the 7,000 square feet of retail space, confining it to one building  instead of the three separate structures now in the plan.  </P> <P> Several commissioners expressed concerns that "undesirables" -- meaning  transients or homeless persons -- might congregate in the corridors between the  buildings. They also asked that the retail area be moved back, farther from the  waterfront. And, finally, they expressed interest in having a trellis cover the  top of a six-story parking garage to make that structure more aesthetically  appealing.  </P> <P> Neils, the attorney, said he hoped construction could begin "within two  months." Although the hotel is now an 8-year-old undertaking, with Hyatt's  involvement having reached the six-year mark, Neils said he hoped construction  would be completed in 28 months.  </P> <P> One person objecting to the project was Judy Collins, a spokeswoman for  Citizens' Coordinate for Century III. Collins argued that the environmental  impact report for the project, approved in 1984, is no longer relevant because  it fails to consider other new construction in the area.  </P> <P> "The EIR considered only this project," Collins said. "We want it to consider  the Convention Center, the Marriott and the expansion of Seaport Village."  </P> <P> Jay Powell, a spokesman for the Environmental Health Coalition, raised  questions about the project, saying it fails to address the modern downtown  concern of "de-watering" -- the ability of new buildings to withstand  hydrostatic pressure (to resist the intrusion of contaminated underground  water).  </P> <P> Powell left the meeting dissatisfied.  </P> <P> "I would much rather have heard an explicit statement from the developers  saying, 'We're convinced we can handle hydrostatic pressure,' rather than  several guys looking around and asking, 'Uh, I think it's OK, don't you?'

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific president announces sudden resignation Mr James Hankinson has resigned suddenly as president of Canadian Pacific, the rail transport, shipping, energy, hotel and property group. He will be succeeded by Mr David O'Brien, head of the group's energy arm, PanCanadian Petroleum, next February. Mr William Stinso, chairman and chief executive, said Mr Hankinson, who has been with CP for 21 years, left to 'pursue other interests'. He would not provide further details. Mr O'Brien, a former executive vice-president of Petro-Canada, a big integrated oil company, came to Montreal in 1989 to head Noverco, a big Quebec energy group. However, when Noverco's expansion programme failed to take off, he moved to Canadian Pacific in 1990 to become president of PanCanadian. His appointment emphasises the importance of energy for the CP group's future recovery. CP owns 87 per cent of its energy arm and PanCanadian has been one of the main contributors to CP's consolidated results over the past three years. Mr Hankinson is best known for the creation of one of the world's biggest newsprint groups, Canadian Pacific Forest Products in the early 1980s. CP spun this off early last year and it has become Avenor, a widely held company. Unitel, a joint venture of Rogers Communications of Toronto, AT&amp;T of the US and Canadian Pacific is losing several key executives. Mr Richard Stursberg, executive vice-president, will become president and chief executive of the Canadian Cable Television Association on January 3. He led Unitel in the battle to open up Canadian long distance telecommunications to competition in 1992 and will now lead the cable industry at a critical point when cable TV, telephone and computer technologies are converging.</p>

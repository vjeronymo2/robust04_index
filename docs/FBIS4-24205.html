			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chris Louw] </F>   [Text] African National Congress secretary general Cyril  Ramaphosa this week made his first move to assert his influence  on government from outside the cabinet, when he announced major  structural changes in the organisation.    During a heated ANC caucus meeting on Tuesday [21 June]  morning, Ramaphosa's position was strengthened when he was  elected chairman of a committee to investigate the relationship  between the cabinet and parliament. Caucus members accused  President Nelson Mandela's government of taking decisions  unilaterally and insisted that MPs have greater access to the  parliamentary processes.    Ramaphosa recently refused a cabinet position. Senior  members of the National Party [NP] expressed their concern at  the time, arguing that he was planning to frustrate the  government of national unity by influencing decisions through  the ANC caucus.    According to reports, Ramaphosa was smarting because Thabo  Mbeki was made deputy president instead of him. Apparently  offered the portfolio of foreign affairs, by Mandela, he refused  on grounds that he wanted to focus his energy on strengthening  the ANC organizationally. He was later elected chairman of the  Constitutional Assembly.    The latest developments were watched with concern this week  by NP members. They fear that all cabinet decisions may in  future be subjected to ANC caucus approval, rendering them  powerless.    This, they maintain, will be "contrary to the spirit of  national unity and nation-building".    It was agreed between the ANC and the NP during negotiations  last year that the new government would function on the basis of  "power-sharing". If the balance of power is to shift to the ANC  caucus, the NP will be powerless.    The ANC caucus showed its muscle on Tuesday when it decided  that a cabinet committee looking into the issue of a new capital  for the country be disbanded. The four-man committee was  appointed by Mandela and is led by Constitutional Development  Minister Roelf Meyer.    The caucus insisted that a more representative committee be  appointed, arguing that most members of the present committee  were biased towards the Transvaal.    Objections were also raised to the "untransparent" way the  cabinet was functioning. MPs wanted the cabinet to seek the  advice of caucus on policy issues and before any decisions were  taken. Caucus chairman Mendi Msimanng released an angry  statement after the meeting, demanding that a new committee  investigate the location of the capital.    ANC MP Raymond Suttner was reported as saying the people  should be drawn into the decision-making process. "We don't  want a parliament which is little more than a passive receiver  of cabinet decisions."    Ramaphosa called a media conference for Thursday afternoon  to  announce restructuring measures taken to improve the ANC  organizationally. Details were not known at the time of going  to press.</p>

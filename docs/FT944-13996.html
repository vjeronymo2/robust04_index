			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Scott Paper sells energy complex Scott Paper yesterday announced the sale of its Alabama energy facility for Dollars 350m to the Southern Company, a holding company for utilities based in the southern states, and provided the first specific details of its plan to sell off non-core assets and focus on the paper tissue business. The announcement comes less than two weeks after Scott Paper agreed to sell its SD Warren glossy paper unit for Dollars 1.6bn to an investment group headed by Sappi, the South African paper company. The Warren transaction, and the sale of the energy complex in Mobile, Alabama, are the first steps in a divestment programme launched by Scott Paper's new chairman, Mr Al Dunlap. The plan should raise about Dollars 3bn. Scott Paper said among the assets considered for sale are the group's US and UK food service business, its global pulp operations, another energy complex (in Pennsylvania), about 1.5m acres of timberland, and real estate, including the corporate headquarters in Philadelphia. The money from the divestments will be used to reduce Scott Paper's debt, which will stand at Dollars 1bn after the Warren deal is concluded but which should be reduced to zero once the restructuring is finished. Mr Dunlap, the business turnround specialist and former right-hand man to Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, came out of retirement in April to run Scott Paper. He said of yesterday's deal: 'This marks the completion of another key phase of my plans for Scott. The Mobile energy complex is one of a number of assets where we can free up capital to invest in our core business.' The ultimate aim, said Mr Dunlap, was to reposition Scott Paper as a pure consumer products company. The asset sales at Scott Paper are part of a wider restructuring instituted earlier this year by Mr Dunlap. In August, four months after joining the group, he announced that 10,500 jobs, or almost one-third of Scott Paper's workforce, would be eliminated by the end of the year. Scott Paper's restructuring has been generally well-received on Wall Street, where the group's share price has risen more than 60 per cent since Mr Dunlap took over as chairman. Yesterday, the stock rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

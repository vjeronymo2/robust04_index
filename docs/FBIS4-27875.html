			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Kyo-chun, from the "Central Tower" column] </F>   [Text] Some of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]  lawmakers criticized on 6 June that the government's  countermeasure to the North Korean nuclear issue is slovenly  under the present tense situation in the phase of sanctions  against North Korea.    A lawmaker of the Foreign Affairs and Reunification  Committee  of the National Assembly said: "While the president said that  the people do not have to worry, the prime minister asked the  people to strengthen their alert posture. Their contradictory  remarks were made on the same day." He then added: "Under this  situation, it is natural for the political circles to have been  divided into hard- liners and moderates."    He also said: "We are in an emergency state requiring all  the people to wear gas masks. The government, however, assumes  an inadequate attitude."    Another lawmaker who asked not to be identified said: "The  people's lack of security sense is a result of the government's  muddled position. It seems that officials concerned do not  fully understand President Kim Yong-sam's policy on dealing with  the North Korean nuclear issue."    The lawmaker continued: "Demonstrations by the Korean  Federation of University Student Councils and the workers'  struggle to establish the second Federation of Korean Trade  Unions will likely be intensified when the issue of sanctions  against North Korea passes a critical moment." He then  stressed, "Measures to minimize the internal confusion to be  caused by this must be prepared."</p>

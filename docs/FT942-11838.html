			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Treasury backs ID card The Treasury has thrown its weight behind the government efficiency unit's recommendation that identity cards should be issued for benefit claimants to combat fraud in the Pounds 80bn social security budget. The unit, headed by Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, wants the government to launch a trial scheme in a small town. The recommendation follows the presentation of a report by social security officials arguing that cards could eliminate fraud running to hundreds of million pounds. Whitehall officials believe the Treasury's intervention may tip the balance of power in favour of launching the pilot scheme, although the Department of Social Security is fiercely resisting it. The Home Office has also voiced 'concern' that the potential savings may not outweigh political risks associated with the introduction of the cards. Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday told the Commons that he had 'considerable sympathy' with those in favour of identity cards. 'There are practical difficulties, but we are examining them to see if they can be overcome,' he said. Mr Nicholas Budgen, a member of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said many backbenchers strongly favoured introducing an identity card system. Both the DSS and Home Office are concerned that there is no overseas model which has a proven track record of combating fraud. But Mr Budgen said other countries were not necessarily suffering from the same degree of fraud problems as the UK. An identity card system would probably involve benefit claimants being issued with cards which store encoded data on the shape of their hands. The cards would be 'read' by electronic scans each time a benefit was collected. Although the error rate on such scans is small, DSS and Home Office ministers fear that a huge row would be caused if anyone was wrongly denied benefit.</p>

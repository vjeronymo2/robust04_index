			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "Clinton's Crucial Test"] </F>   [Text] Bill Clinton has never been good at foreign policy;  his statesmanship is limited to saying "yes," "no," or "perhaps"  -- and this in quicker succession than would be advisable in the  interests of credibility. Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia -- these three  case studies of "postmodern" foreign policy following the Cold  War reveal a pattern showing neither priorities nor interests.  "Anything goes," seems to be the motto of this President who  takes less pleasure in foreign policy than any of his  predecessors since the isolationist twenties.    But now Clinton has reached the border of postmodern foreign  policy, and this border goes right across the Korean Peninsula.  On the other side of this border is North Korea, the last  Stalinist fossil, which makes even Castro's Cuba appear a model  of an open society. Kim Il-song, the 82-year-old permanent  dictator, has confronted Clinton with an impudent nuclear  challenge that could develop into a "definite crisis" of his  presidency -- like the Cuban missile crisis in the second year  of Kennedy's presidency.    For two years now, Kim Il-song has staged a nuclear gamble  according to the motto: "Where is the bomb?" Inspectors of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are hoaxed or locked  out, while Pyongyang threatens to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, which would abruptly mark the end of  any inspection. In the center of the most recent escalation are  8,000 fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor core. In other words,  if the inspectors cannot access the rods, they cannot say how  much plutonium has been "bred" and how much bomb-grade material  can be extracted and secretly put aside following the  cooling-off phase (approximately a month). By rough estimates,  the rods are good for five or six atom bombs.    Filling the cup to the brim, Pyongyang simply reacted to the  United States' threats of sanctions by stating: "Sanctions will  promptly mean war, and war will be merciless." Clinton cannot  leave this poker game now to deal with the health reform at home  or the financial trouble in which his wife, Hillary, is involved  in connection with the "Whitewatergate" affair. What is at  stake is not just the United States' credibility, but also a  pillar of the postwar order -- the nonproliferation regime,  which has ensured for more than 30 years that the number of  official nuclear powers does not exceed five, and the number of  unofficial ones does not exceed two. Some would-be bomb  builders (such as Sweden or South Africa) gave up, while others  (Iraq) were forced to do so.    The crux of the matter is this: If North Korea goes to the  end of the road upon which it embarked in 1989 and which it has  continued since then, this would mark the end of containment.  The signal would be that the United States as a superpower and  the "international community" (meaning China, Russia, Britain,  and France) are not even able to enforce an interest that unites  them all -- nuclear nonproliferation. Those waiting for such a  signal are no lambs -- Libya, Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Pakistan. In  addition, a North Korean bomb would entail a South Korean and a  Japanese bomb.    Clinton is not to be envied. His presumptive allies are no  allies. China suddenly talks about "blood friendship" with  North Korea and even strictly rejects any sanctions. Russia  wants a conference of the big powers, which would, however, be  intended to serve its own status rather than as punishment for  Pyongyang. Japan is afraid, and South Korea hesitates, even  though they are both threatened most by Kim Il-song's bomb. By  the way, sanctions do not make sense with a country that has  adopted autarchy as its policy principle. There are only one  and a half levers. The half-lever is the sum of $1 billion that  Koreans in Japan transfer to their home country. The whole  lever consists of the oil products (75 percent of its total  demand) that North Korea buys from China. No gasoline, no war  -- however, Beijing will not use this lever.    Would "bribery" help, meaning economic aid or diplomatic  recognition? Hardly, because, first, relevant offers have long  been on the table, and, second, the construed picture of a  hostile outside world is the breeding ground on which the  stone-age dictatorship lives. Those who are serious about the  containment of atom bombs must face a sad reality, which  requires military countermoves.    A minimum is the demonstrative enforcement of the United  States' presence in South Korea and the Japanese Sea. If Kim  Il-song threatens war, he must know that a war would fall back  on him and would destroy him. This would at least be helpful  for an assessment of the reality, of which even dictators are  capable. Under this umbrella, Clinton could prove that he is  able to concentrate on what is essential in foreign policy.  Combined with persistence, U.S. resolve could even work  diplomatic miracles and could forge an alliance among Beijing,  Moscow, Seoul, and Tokyo, which would show Kim Il-song that he  is isolated. One thing is, however, impossible -- to wring  one's hands and look on as, at the threshold to the third  millennium, Korea opens the door to a world in which any  second-class dictator would play with the bomb.</p>

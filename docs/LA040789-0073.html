			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'MUSICAL CHAIRS' GROUP USES THE HOME AS CONCERT HALL  </P> <P> Ruth Armentrout was filled with a new sense of conviction as she soaked up the  sunshine one recent Sunday afternoon in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> "We're not the cultural wasteland people have been saying," she pronounced.  </P> <P> Armentrout and about 40 others had just gathered in a designer home tucked in  the hills south of Ventura Boulevard to hear the Shostakovich Trio in E Minor,  opus 57.  </P> <P> After the performance, the audience lounged by an impressive spread of wine and  hors d'oeuvres to critique another in a series of "home concert events" staged  by an organization called Musical Chairs, named for the changing locale of its  monthly performances.  </P> <P> Armentrout learned of the concerts through a music appreciation class she takes  from Greg Hettmansberger at his Woodland Hills home. Hettmansberger is an  associate of Musical Chairs and concert reviewer for the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to try the intimacy of listening and having the performers right  there," Armentrout said. "Now, I'll come back for more. I think it's really a  good thing. We're finally getting more performances and interest and music in  the Valley."  </P> <P> Musical Chairs is the brainchild of Beverly Gladstone, who began organizing the  chamber music concerts under the auspices of the Valley Arts Council three  years ago.  </P> <P> Hettmansberger was teaching "classes in the classics" at the time, and  recommended that his students attend the home concerts to hear live  performances of the music they studied.  </P> <P> "What he was doing and what I was doing fit like a hand to a glove," Gladstone  said.  </P> <P> Last year, Gladstone decided to leave the Valley Arts Council and joined forces  with Hettmansberger. In January, the two presented their first independent  concert, keeping the name Musical Chairs, which Gladstone's husband had coined  years before.  </P> <P> The concerts are intended to give musicians a forum in which to play and  listeners a place to hear chamber music performed by professionals.  </P> <P> "When Mozart and Bach wrote chamber music, it was not with the idea that it  would be performed in concert halls," said violinist Alan Grunfeld, who  performs with the Long Beach Symphony and was featured at the March home  concert. "Their music was performed in rooms in palaces or mansions where the  elite would gather. In that sense, Musical Chairs is carrying on an age-old  tradition."  </P> <P> He added, "And it is nice to play for a smaller audience in an intimate  setting."  </P> <P> Admission to the concerts is $10 for listeners. Musicians attend free.  Performers split 50% of the proceeds; the rest covers the cost of printing and  mailing Musical Chairs newsletters.  </P> <P> The concert usually lasts about 45 minutes and is preceded by introductory  remarks and commentary by Hettmansberger. He discusses composers and the  circumstances in which they lived, the history of the music about to be played  and the circumstances under which it was written. The performance is followed  by refreshments, potluck style.  </P> <P> Then members of the audience -- many of whom are amateurs -- are encouraged to  bring along their instruments, break into small groups to improvise with each  other, and in some cases, with the professional performers.  </P> <P> "A lot of musicians are not associated with any formal musical group," said  Cheryl Leah, a musician who attended last month's concert. "They love to play,  but they're not in an orchestra. This gives them a chance."  </P> <P> Yvonne Hseuh, who has been playing violin for 16 of her 22 years, said the  concerts, which she regularly attends, are just plain fun -- "sort of a  relaxed, Sunday musical thing to do."  </P> <P> "It's not like going to an evening concert and going home afterward, and that's  it," Hseuh said. "Here you get to meet people."  </P> <P> In fact, two of the musicians who performed at the March event, Grunfeld and  pianist Ronna Binn, met at a previous home concert.  </P> <P> In addition to socializing with fellow musicians, Hseuh said, home concerts  lead to other work, since listeners are occasionally interested in hiring  musicians to play at private events.  </P> <P> "Musicians need more opportunity to be involved with the public, for people to  listen to them and meet them," said flutist Anna Lawrence. "This is a nice way  to do it."  </P> <P> Organizers pride themselves on being elegant but not elite.  </P> <P> "It's just as easy to bring a nice wedge of cheese and crackers as Ding Dongs,"  Gladstone said. "We want people to walk away saying they've had a full  experience."  </P> <P> Most members of the audience conform to the savory standards, although a  sampling of Mounds bars made their way beside the pastries and other finger  foods at one recent event.  </P> <P> Every concert is taped, then later broadcast on Cal State Northridge's campus  radio station, KCSN 88.5 FM, from 6 to 7 p.m. the first Sunday of each month.  </P> <P> Most concerts are held at San Fernando Valley homes, and the next performance  is scheduled for 2 p.m. April 23 in Encino. The concert will feature music from  around the world, including "Spanish Suite" by DeFalla, "Csardas" by V. Monti,  works by Chopin and Bartok and a contemporary piece by the Yugoslav composer  Boris Panandopulo.  </P> <P> Reservations can be made by calling Gladstone at (818) 784-8105.  </P></p>

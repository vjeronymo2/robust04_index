			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (5): Regional gap in cost of renting gets narrower - The recovery of the property market in different parts of the country The UK property market has begun its recovery, after the deepest downturn since the war. But the legacy of the property recession will have a lasting impact on companies which are considering a relocation. The fall in property costs over the past three years has relieved some companies of pressure to uproot from their existing locations. Moreover, the incentive for a company to move long distances has diminished, as the gap between the cost of renting property in different parts of the country has narrowed. The property recession hit London far more severely than most regional centres, helping to even out some of the formerly sharp variations in property costs and supply around the country. For example, in the City of London, which was part- icularly badly affected by the downturn, top quality property can be rented for less than half the Pounds 70 per sq ft it fetched at the peak of the market in 1988. In Manchester, by contrast, top rents have scarcely fallen during the recession from a peak of Pounds 21 per sq ft. Another consequence of the property downturn which has reduced the flow of relocations is that many companies are unable to move premises because of the difficulty of disposing of existing leases. Many tenants are locked into leases which require them to pay far more than the market rate, creating difficulties in assigning leases to another tenant. Nonetheless, companies which have the freedom to move have the opportunity of securing property at rents close to the bottom of the market. Office rents have fallen by about 40 per cent from their peak and industrial rents are down by about 20 per cent, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. In most parts of the country, asking rents are static or falling. But gradually, as tenant demand increases, the incentives on offer from landlords, such as rent-free periods and cash contributions for fitting out costs, are declining. Most tenants are still able to negotiate relatively flexible leases, although as supply and demand returns to balance, landlords will be anxious to return to 25-year leases, with upwards-only rent reviews at five-year intervals, which are traditional in the UK market. Signs are emerging that pockets of the London market may recover more rapidly than other parts of the country. The vacancy rate for Central London office property - of which 23.5m sq ft is available - has fallen from a peak of 18 per cent in mid-1992 to 12 per cent, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers. Brokers at Paribas Capital Markets predict that rents for the best modern office properties in London could rise by more than 30 per cent this year, although poorly-located and older buildings will continue to decline in value. Outside the south-east, the main office markets have been relatively stable, as a result of fewer developments during the 1980s and a lower impact of recession on office employment levels. But with a smaller pool of potential demand, the prov- incial cities may experience less upwards pressure on rents than in London. The availability of property, as well as its cost, is a crucial factor in determining a reloc- ation decision. After several years when development activity has been at a low ebb, there is a shortage of modern offices in several cities. According to Chesterton, the property advisers, 'regional centres offer little to potential relocators in terms of readily available office space. Major requirements exceed supply in many regional centres.' Birmingham, for instance, has some of the lowest levels of available space of any large UK office centres. At the end of 1993, there was about 789,000 sq ft of empty space - available at a cost of up to Pounds 20 per sq ft - out of a total market of 16m sq ft. Developers are gradually getting back into the market. In a recent report, Chesterton estimated that just 2.7m sq ft of speculative development was under way in London and 3.2m sq ft in regional centres. Although more developments are now starting, activity is likely to remain at a low ebb while tenant demand is uncertain and there is a shortage of bank finance for speculative schemes. In the industrial sector, signs of increased tenant demand are slowly beginning to appear. In January, the availability of empty premises began to fall for the first time since 1989. According to King Sturge, chartered surveyors, a total of 182m sq ft of industrial property is available to let. Demand is concentrated on new buildings, which account for just 9 per cent of the total available space. Tenant demand has been strongest for large distribution warehouses adjacent to motorways. The availability of industrial space is at its greatest in the south-east, Wales and East Anglia. But in the West Midlands and the south-west, vacancy rates are tighter and agents believe there could be some rent increases as soon as the first quarter of next year. Another factor affecting relocation decisions is the impact of the revaluation of the Uniform Business Rate in 1995, which is based on rental values in April 1993. The revaluation is likely to shift the rates burden from the south to the north. In London and the south-east, where rents fell sharply between 1988 and 1993, reductions in rateable value could be between 40 and 50 per cent, according to James Capel, the broker. In regional centres outside London, where rents peaked later and subsequently underwent more modest falls, the rates burden is set to increase. Herring Baker Harris, a firm of surveyors, has estimated that the proportion of the business rates bill shouldered by industrial occupiers will rise from 18 per cent to 22 per cent, while that borne by retailers will remain broadly stable and that from offices may decline from 29 per cent to 27 per cent. The shift in the rates burden, together with differential falls in rental costs, has tended to even out property costs across the country. As a result, companies needing to relocate their premises are tending to move shorter distances. Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors, believes that about two-thirds of companies moving out of London over the next three years will stay in the south-east region. The cost of property remains a key factor influencing a company's decision to relocate. Jones Lang Wootton reports that between 1983 and 1992, the chance to make property cost savings was the main reason for moving in 55 per cent of cases. In 1993, however, four out of the eight large companies moving out of London London cited 'operational and organisation issues' as the main factor influencing their decision. As companies emerge from recession, the drive to improve their efficiency is encouraging them to consolidate and restructure their operations. The prospect of substantial property savings has become a less important factor in generating long distance property moves than it was in the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the opportunity to obtain property at prices close to the bottom of the market could secure an important advantage for companies that are willing and able to move.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the concerns expressed about the relationship of the amount of a fine to the size of an institution or of a third-party servicer's business, the Secretary points out that the size of an institution or business has a bearing on whether the institution or servicer has overextended its capability of properly administering the Title IV, HEA programs and the extent to which harm has been done to the programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the commenter who thought that the phrase special arrangement should be deleted from this section, the Secretary does not agree with that commenter. Special arrangements are based on individual circumstance and therefore should be taken into consideration. However, as noted elsewhere in the comments and discussion section, the Secretary clarifies special arrangements to refer to those special arrangements entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraph (a)(5) is revised to specify that as one of the criteria in determining the extent to which violations are caused by a repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error, the total number of violations is considered to be a single violation, provided the third-party servicer has not previously been cited for this type of error and had failed to make the appropriate corrections to the system where the violation originated. In determining the amount of a fine, the Secretary also takes into consideration, as applicable, the financial loss to the Title IV, HEA programs that was attributable to the repeated mechanical systemic unintentional error.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.94&blank;Termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended that the regulations be amended to terminate the eligibility to perform some but not all of the services provided by the third-party servicer, claiming that some functions provided by the servicer may continue to meet the applicable requirements of the program. This change would recognize that a third-party servicer may provide multiple and unrelated functions under the Title IV, HEA programs. Many commenters expressed concern about the provision in &sect;668.94(c) requiring the servicer to return to each institution that contracts with the servicer all records pertaining to the servicer's administration of that program on behalf of that institution. One commenter suggested that since the institution may contract with another servicing entity, the records should be passed to the new servicer as specified by the institution. Many commenters pointed out that the records maintained by the third-party servicer appear on microfiche, imaging disc, microfilm, or in paper form and the servicer will be able to provide copies of such records but not the original records. One commenter suggested an expansion to require the servicer to return servicer notes, related documents, records or copies of such notes, related documents and records that pertain to the servicer's administration of the program on behalf of the institution. The commenter further suggested that the servicer certify copies as exact copies whenever required by law. The commenter also suggested that a sentence be added to protect the proprietary rights of the servicer to data base media, servicing procedures, computer programs, software packages, servicer forms, and other proprietary information, procedures and materials. Another commenter noted that copies of records for a single institution's loans may be commingled with records pertaining to other institutions and suggested that servicers should be permitted to provide records upon request rather than all at once.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenters that it may be appropriate to terminate the eligibility of a third-party servicer to perform some but not all of the activities under certain circumstances. In other situations, however, a violation may be so egregious that complete termination from being able to administer any aspect of the institution's participation is appropriate. The Secretary believes that the regulations provide the needed flexibility to determine the correct action to be taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Records relating to a third-party servicer's administration of any aspect of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs are the institution's property. A third-party servicer may make copies of the original records that it provides to an institution if the contract between the servicer and institution is terminated. See the discussion in &sect;668.25 on records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not agree that the regulations need to be expanded to cover servicer notes, related documents, records, or copies of such notes; that is a matter between the institution and the servicer. The Secretary does not believe that it is necessary to add regulatory language to protect the proprietary rights of the servicer since adequate protection already exists through copyright laws to serve this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.95&blank;Reimbursements, Refunds, and Offsets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters recommended that the reference to third-party servicer in &sect;668.95(c) be removed because the servicer generally makes no claims for benefits on its own behalf therefore funds would not be available to be offset. Another commenter noted that if the Secretary is transmitting funds directly to a third-party servicer on behalf of institutions, the funds are for multiple institutions and to offset an unaffected institution's funds would not be reasonable or fair. One commenter requested that the provision in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that would have the servicer or institution repay any discounts, premiums, or excess interest paid under 34 CFR part 682 be eliminated stating that the payment of premiums and discounts are contract issues between two lenders in the FFEL programs and should not be assessed to other parties or repaid to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with those commenters who recommended removing reference to a third-party servicer from the provision governing the ability of the Secretary to offset any benefits or claims due to an institution or third-party servicer against any payment that an institution or third-party servicer may owe to the Secretary. A situation may arise where a third-party servicer makes a claim against the Department of Education for funds owed to the servicer and the Secretary wants to offset that claim because the servicer has not repaid a liability owed the Department of Education for a violation of the Title IV, HEA program requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also does not accept the comment that paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section should be removed. This provision is particularly relevant to an institution's participation in the FFEL programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart H_Appeal procedures for Audit Determinations and Program Review Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.114&blank;Notification of Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that with respect to a third-party servicer's request for review, the hearing official only notify the institutions to whom the findings were originally disclosed since a third-party servicer may have added new clients during the period between the publication of the findings and the announcement of the hearing and the new clients would not be aware of the findings and could be confused by the notice of the hearing. Another commenter felt only institutions that contract with the servicer of the affected functions should be notified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that subsequent notices from the hearing official should be sent only to the actual parties to the proceeding. In the cases of institutions receiving similar services to those at issue in the proceeding, they need not be notified. As discussed above, the need for notice to other affected institutions is satisfied with notice of the final determination. Therefore, there is no need to impose the burden on the hearing official of providing notice to every institution with which a third-party servicer contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 668.114(b) is revised to require notice only to the actual parties to the proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.116&blank;Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters recommended that an institution or third-party servicer also have the burden of proving that the findings are not substantial in nature. The commenters felt that some findings or alleged violations may be irrefutable, but their effect may be strictly limited, posing immaterial impact on the integrity of the servicer's or lender's portfolio. One commenter felt that a third-party servicer should only have the burden of proving that the ``expenditures questioned or disallowed were proper'' to the extent that the servicer contracts with the institution for cash management of Title IV, HEA program funds and that the Secretary should not question servicing fee income since it is not considered Title, IV HEA program funds. A few commenters suggested deleting references to the time frames within which an institution must have provided documentation previously stating that any legitimate documentation regarding the subject at issue should be admissible and the time frames within which it was previously submitted are irrelevant to their authenticity or material relationship to the case. Several commenters felt that the transcribed records of the proceeding should only be made available to the hearing participants and not to any institution that contracts with the servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With respect to the suggestion that an institution or third-party servicer need only prove that findings are ``not substantial,'' the Secretary disagrees that the standard for accountability for Federal funds should be relaxed. An institution, or its third-party servicer, is a fiduciary and duty bound to use the highest standard of care and diligence at all times in the administration of the Title IV HEA programs. The suggested language would weaken this standard. If, as suggested by the commenters, a violation truly has an immaterial impact, then there will no significant liabilities assessed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

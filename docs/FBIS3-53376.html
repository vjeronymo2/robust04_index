These statements, they said,  contained a number of unacceptable prevarications.    They added that the first prevarication was the description  of the dispute between the UAE and Iran as "a misunderstanding,"  a description which belittles the UAE's just demands and its  historical and legal rights to its three islands of Tunb  al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu-Musa. The second  prevarication, they said, was describing the UAE as intransigent  despite the fact that it was the UAE which sought dialogue  through repeated initiatives, beginning with the first round of  negotiations between the two countries in September 1992,  followed by the meeting between Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al  Nuhayyan, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, and Iranian  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati on the sidelines of the  Islamic foreign ministers conference in Karachi in March last  year, and ending with the Iranian foreign minister's visit to  Abu-Dhabi in May of the same year, as a result of which the UAE  softened the intensity of its media's concentration on the  islands issue although it was aware of the harm this could cause.    The sources said that the UAE has declared and continues to  declare that it insists on a peaceful solution of the problem of  the islands, that it seeks a resumption of the dialogue with  Iran on that problem, and that it is Iran which is refusing to  resume the dialogue, on the pretext that drawing up a framework  for dialogue would mean making preconditions.    The sources pointed out that a dialogue without a clear  framework is unacceptable because it would undermine the  foundations on which the UAE efforts to regain its rights to the  three islands are based.    The sources also said that the UAE does not want Iran "to  directly acknowledge the UAE's historical and legal rights to  the islands but to accept the principle of peaceful dialogue and  to let international legitimacy and international law be the  judge in settling the dispute, with the UAE expressing in  advance its willingness to accept the verdict of international  legitimacy whatever it may be."    They added that even with Iran's continued rejection of  recourse to international law, the UAE continues to announce on  every occasion that it insists on the principle of peaceful  settlement, a matter received with increasing understanding by  numerous states and political forces.    The third prevarication, the UAE sources said, was the  Iranian spokesman's claim that the UAE is making preconditions  for the resumption of dialogue when in actual fact it is Iran  which is making such preconditions by refusing to discuss the  islands of Tunb al-Kubra and Tunb al-Sughra and confining  discussions to the question of administrative arrangements for  the island of Abu-Musa.    The sources further said that those who followed the first  round of negotiations, which failed to achieve any results, know  that the Iranian delegation adamently refused to go beyond  discussion of Abu-Musa island and refused even to listen to the  UAE's views on the subject.    The UAE sources added that the fact that the Iranian  spokesman chose to level accusations against the UAE after the  final statement of the meeting of the Damascus Declaration  foreign ministers seemed to be an attempt to prevent the UAE  from raising the issue of the islands in regional and  international circles, which is out of the question considering  the Gulf and Arab response and the gains made at international  level.</p>

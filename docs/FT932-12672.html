			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Mitsui expands in pharmaceuticals TOYAMA Chemical, a mid-ranking Japanese pharmaceuticals company, and Mitsui Pharmaceuticals yesterday announced they are to merge, expanding the Mitsui group's influence in the Japanese drugs market, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. The deal involves one Y500 share in the private Mitsui Pharmaceuticals being swapped for 10 Toyama Chemical shares of Y50 par value. The merged company, to be formed on October 1, will be capitalised at Y18bn (Dollars 162.6m). While the new company is supposed to be owned equally by Toyama Chemical and Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, the merger is essentially a takeover by Mitsui group companies. Before October 1, Mitsui Pharmaceuticals will issue 3m new shares to facilitate the swap. The two companies have already made their first profit forecast, suggesting sales in the year to end-March 1994 will be Y60.5bn, rising to Y75bn in the following year, while pre-tax profit will rise from Y4.5bn to Y5.5bn over the same period.</p>

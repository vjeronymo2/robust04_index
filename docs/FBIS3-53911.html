Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian  delegation, said that the document will be relayed to the two  leaderships for perusal. According to 'Asfur, over the weekend  the PLO leadership will decide whether to change the directives  given to the delegation and whether the negotiations will resume  next week on the basis of this document.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 20 January  carries a live report from Taba by Netan'el Semrik, adding that  "the points of disagreement remain -- as previously -- the  issues of symbols and procedures for checking those entering and  departing the autonomy. The document itself is four-pages long  and includes several dozens clauses and subclauses dealing with  the various issues."]    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the Civilian  Affairs  Committee postponed the scheduled discussion regarding the  establishment of television and radio stations because the  Palestinian expert did not arrive in Taba.</p>

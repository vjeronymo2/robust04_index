			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IFP spokesman Dr. Ziba Jiyane in Umlazi by </F> announcer Lester Venter in the Johannesburg studio -- live]    [Text] [Venter] Dr. Jiyane.    [Jiyane] Hello.    [Venter] Thanks for joining us there Dr. Jiyane. Dr. Jiyane,  the most serious of the allegations to my mind, that is being  put by Mr. Naidoo there is that there are 10 voting stations,  that he calls pirate stations, and we presume by that he means  not under control of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission],  but he says they are under the control of the KwaZulu Government  and the KwaZulu Police. What do you say to that?    [Jiyane] I would have said most ridiculous allegation. You  see, first of all, when would we get ballot papers to use there.  But in any case it would be illegal. There is a state of  emergency here. They would immediately close those down. This  is red herring again by Jay Naidoo, who finds every opportunity  now to desperately besmirch the name the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party], which is surprising them beyond their expectations with  the popularity and the turnout of its voters. This is a lie. He  has been attacking the Zulu police when in fact there is a state  of emergency here, they brought all the soldiers to do  everything. The fact is, they are panicking. The IFP is about  to deliver a resounding victory.    [Venter] Mr. Jiyane, Mr. Naidoo goes on to say the ANC wants  the results from those stations, their existence of which you  deny, to be discounted. Now let's just assume a hypothetical  case: say a chief in some remote area of KwaZulu has launched  out entirely on his own and he's put up a voting station that  shouldn't be there, if that should be the case in cooperation  with the IEC and a proper investigation has found that has  happened, would you then agree with the ANC that those, whatever  votes that were cast there, should not be counted?    [Jiyane] It is obvious there is nothing like that that can  happen. First you must know that the IFP was not involved in  the IEC formation and the delivery of the ballots. We know for  a fact that now there is an alert by police because they found  in PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] votes at a regional  level that were marked ANC. Those are the ballots that are  missing. We have 22 million missing ballots, and those were the  reason to believe that there are some of them in the hands of  the ANC. Now, in KwaMashu a car, an Isuzu car drove away with  10 boxes from an area that is predominantly IFP. Those were  stolen by ANC people.    [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, I'd like to clear up [words indistinct]  you have 2 minutes to do that. But just before, what is your  source for saying that 22 million ballots are missing, because  Judge Kriegler denied that last night?    [Jiyane] Well, he said that they are hoping to find them in  some 10,000 little stations. The fact is, at Cape Town, a  million of them were found and a person, his life was  threatened, when he wanted to reveal this. In Empangeni, here  in Natal, boxes were found in Royal Hotel in Empangeni, and our  leader there, IFP leader Mr. Gwala [as heard], was asked to come  and see the boxes, and nobody has collected those now because  they have been revealed. Now it was not IFP and we can know who  brought them there. Also children, throughout the night  yesterday in KwaMashu, were hired to make Xs on ANC name on the  ballot papers. Those are the missing ballot papers which the  ANC is using, which it also uses its own cars to steal away  ballot boxes.    [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, in the one minute left to us, let me  put another accusation that is made just so that we for the  purposes of our viewers can strike some sort of a balance. Mr.  Naidoo talks about the display of weapons, party political  propaganda which presumably is inside the perimeter of the  voting stations, amounting I imagine here saying to  intimidation. Is that happening, isn't it? Well, that is all  red herring to try and shift the focus from where the problem  is. There is nothing of the sort. The fact is our people, from  the old people, they were threatened by youngsters with guns,  not just knobkerries, throughout this vote, and the police have  intervened. In fact, they have arrested some of the ANC people  who have been doing this. This is all red herring. They are  panicking because IFP is about to deliver a resounding victory.    [Venter] Dr. Jiyane, thank you very much for joining us and  taking the trouble to come to our remote unit in Umlazi.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed PSM: "Huge Arms Catch in the </F> Netherlands--Yves Otte Involved"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Amsterdam, 23 Dec (ANP/BELGA) -- During an  investigation into a gang of criminals, Dutch police forces  discovered a huge arms arsenal in the adjoining garage of a  house in Zwanenburg (Netherlands). The catch includes 45 kg of  Semtex explosives.    Six Dutchmen and two Belgians were arrested. From a  statement issued by the Dutch press agency ANP, it can be  concluded that the gangster Yves Otte was involved in the case.  Otte was shot by the state police in Hoogstraten [Belgium] on  10 December.    According to the police, which presented its investigation  in  Amsterdam on Thursday, the weapons, most of them from former  Yugoslavia, were hidden in a lubrication pit converted into a  hideout.    In addition to the plastic explosives, the catch also  included 81 detonators, 36 hand grenades, 25 handguns, 10  so-called Brisant missiles (antitank guns), and a few thousand  cartridges of 45 different calibers. Several kilograms of  cocaine, amphetamines, and XTC were also found.    The Dutch police arrested six suspects, all of them Dutch  citizens. The Belgian state police arrested two suspects, who  were wanted for a number of armed robberies.    One of the arrests resulted in a shootout, during which the  suspect was shot in the belly by a bullet from the state police.  The man turned out to be heavily armed. In addition, he had  escaped from the jail of Louvain [Belgium] last April, where he  still had to serve a sentence of several years, according to ANP.    This description corresponds to the events which occurred in  Hoogstraten on 10 December, at an exit of the E19 Antwerp-Breda  highway, where the state police shot Otte after having itself  been shot at. Otte had also thrown a hand grenade.    Otte got caught when the state police checked a car which  turned out to be stolen in Dunkirk. Two of the three passengers  offered no resistance, but Otte ran away.    The arms catch resulted from an investigation into an attack  on the regional police training school in Amsterdam on 29  September and into a shootout at Ede [Netherlands], where police  officers were shot at from a van.    During the attack on the police school, a so-called  fragmentation shell was thrown at the front door; the 3,000  steel bullets in the shell riddled the door. Two policemen  remained unhurt, thanks to the steel doorstep which cushioned  the force of the explosion.    The shootout at Ede took place after policemen had attempted  to halt two stolen vans. The passengers of the vans kicked or  shot out the vehicle's rear window and opened fire at the  pursuing police cars. The gangsters managed to escape. Later  on, a bag with hand grenades and a cap were found by the  abandoned van.    According to the police, most of the suspects, many of whom  have a criminal record, made partial confessions. According to  their statements, the attack on the police school was a  rehearsal for a robbery, which should have yielded millions of  guilders. What specific target the men had in mind is still  unknown.    Last Saturday, the police were informed of an imminent arms  transport. They followed the suspect van from northern  Amsterdam to Zwanenburg (Netherlands), where the arsenal and a  quantity of drugs were seized. Three individuals, including a  61-year-old man, were arrested on the spot. The police does not  rule out the possibility of more arrests.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Canada is cracking down on foreign ships fishing  outside the 200 mile limit on the east coast.    The minister of fisheries, Brian Tobin, presented  legislation  in the House of Commons today to protect the Grand Banks. If  passed by parliament the law would allow fisheries officers to  board foreign ships, search them, and bring them back to a  Canadian port to face charges. Fines could reach a million  dollars.

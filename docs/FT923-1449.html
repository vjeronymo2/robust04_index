			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Britain in arms talks with Kuwait BRITAIN is to start detailed negotiations on an arms supply package for Kuwait. The move follows a visit there by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary. Discussions have included possible sales of tanks and armoured vehicles, and there has been speculation that a package might also include aircraft such as Hawk jet fighters, as well as naval vessels. Vickers' new Challenger 2 battle tank recently underwent trials in Kuwait in a competition to supply about 200 tanks. This deal would be worth up to Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.77bn). Kuwait is known to be keen to diversify its sources of arms to avoid relying solely on the US. Yesterday's agreement is aimed at moving talks forward after a wide-ranging memorandum of understanding on UK-Kuwaiti defence co-operation. The understanding was signed in February. A British consortium linking the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard with the construction companies Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey has already been selected to rebuild and upgrade Kuwait's main naval base, a project expected to be worth up to Pounds 200m. Mr Rifkind, who has also been discussing pending arms sales to Saudi Arabia, said yesterday that Iraq still posed a threat to stability in the Gulf region and also expressed concern about Iran's arms build-up.</p>

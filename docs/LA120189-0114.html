			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPOSED GARBAGE PACT WOULD SET QUOTA FOR  CITY  </P> <P> A proposed agreement between the city and county of Los Angeles on development  of a regional garbage dump in Elsmere Canyon would result in the city paying  fines if it failed to deliver large volumes of trash.  </P> <P> Environmentalists said the provision could discourage recycling and make it  more difficult for the city to comply with a state law requiring the volume of  trash sent to landfills to be sharply reduced.  </P> <P> The proposed pact, already endorsed by county supervisors, would penalize the  city if less than 6,000 tons per day of trash generated within city limits is  hauled to the planned dump near the junction of the Antelope Valley and Golden  State freeways east of the city of Santa Clarita. The city would pay a penalty  of $1 for each ton less than that amount, although the fine could be raised by  as much as 6% per year.  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Car part groups seek know-how from Japanese Managing directors, team leaders and production workers from a dozen UK motor component suppliers are to spend time in Japanese factories as part of an initiative by the Department of Trade and Industry - backed by Nissan, Toyota and Honda - to boost the competitiveness of the UK industry. The aim of the two-year 'Learning from Japan' initiative, which is being backed by Rover Group, Unipart Industries and the Inchcape group, is to upgrade the quality of nearly 10,000 smaller component-makers in the UK. Known as second- or third-tier suppliers, their products are built into the more complex components systems supplied directly to the carmakers' production lines by the few hundred first-tier component-makers such as GKN and Lucas. Together, components-makers form one of the biggest elements in the UK's manufacturing economy, with turnover estimated at Pounds 14.7bn a year, nearly 150,000 employees and Pounds 3bn in direct exports. Improving the smaller companies' competitiveness is seen throughout the industry as a vital step if the current revival of the UK-based - if no longer UK-owned - motor industry is to be sustained. A warning that it is already being put at risk by hundreds of small suppliers failing to improve quality and productivity standards was given recently by Prof Dan Jones, the motor industry academic who has been involved in benchmarking studies between the Japanese and UK components industries. Prof Jones and other leading industry figures such as Mr George Simpson, chairman of Rover Group who is shortly to take over as chief executive of Lucas Industries, say that many of the biggest first-tier component-makers have already learned from the standard-setting Japanese industry. According to Mr Simpson, unless the big companies pass on these lessons many of the smaller companies could disappear. A benchmarking exercise comparing Japanese and UK suppliers undertaken by Andersen Consulting, Cardiff Business School and Cambridge University 18 months ago found a two-to-one gap in productivity and a 100-to-one gap in quality performance between Japanese and British suppliers, with only Unipart matching Japanese suppliers on quality. Andersen is also a partner in the DTI initiative. It has helped the participating companies identify weak performance areas and after the Japanese visits will help them develop improvement programmes. The 12 companies taking part in the initiative range from small pressings-makers such as Hockley-based Frederick Woolley to plastics-moulders such as the Stadium group.</p>

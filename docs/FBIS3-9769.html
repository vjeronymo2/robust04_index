It should also be sent to the European  Parliament and the parliaments of all the countries in order to  find the indispensable international support for a correct  solution of the Kosova question. I think that a parliamentary  commission must be created to prepare the statement which then  will be discussed and adopted by the parliament.    Secondly, I think it is necessary to juridically denounce  the  bloody communist Enverist dictatorship not only for the  monstrous crimes it committed to the Albanian people but for the  real threat that danger that its offsprings are posting to  democracy. The problems which need indispensably be solved are:    1. Enverian dictatorship should be juridically denounced.    2. Antinational criminal figures such as Enver Hoxha and the  main former communist leaders should be brought to court for  their crimes to the Albanian people.    3. The titles "Hero of the People" and attributions stemming  from it entitled so far to persons that are responsible for  grave crimes towards the Albanian people, should be lifted. It  is a pity that this title has not yet been removed from the  hangsman Enver Hoxha. At the same time it is a paradox that  Shefqet Peci, a criminal notorious for the massacres and  sentences without trial in Gjirokaster, Libohove, Mirdite,  Kukes, and Kosova [as received]. Peci should be sent to trial  and not be a "Hero of the People."    4. Although our parliament has renounced the prescription  for the crimes, no judicial process have yet been held for the  crimes committed during the 50 year communist regime by  criminals such as Ramiz Alia, Aranit Cela, Manush Myftiu, and  former interior ministers, who besides the crimes, they have  also ordered the elimination of the documents in the archives of  the Republic of Albania.    Ramiz Alia is not only co-responsible with Enver Hoxha, but  he also is to be blamed for the violence over the pioneers of  democracy, for murders in the border which he himself has  ordered during his rule over Albania. Ramiz Alia ordered that  fire be opened against the refugees, he ordered arrests and  imprisonments, maltreatments and the sending to psychiatric  hospitals of those who took part in the demonstrations and who  toppled the busts of the dictators. Ramiz Alia ordered for the  April 2 massacre and many others.    The democratic states in the world have punished and  continue  to punish the Nazi criminals and the past and present terrors.    We do not urge political trials but trials against illegal  and inhuman state crime, genocide and massive terror exercised  by the hangmen who not only do not apologise but yet continue  their efforts to deny the present democracy.    There has not been and will not yet be any Nurenberg in the  postcommunist Albania although there is enough evidence for the  crimes and criminals on national scale.    The Albanian people terrorized by the communist  dictatorship,  the formerly politically persecuted and their families have not  manifested any sign of revenge, but they demand justice. They  are convinced that the parliament and the Albanian democratic  state will solve this question.    The abuse must not be everlasting because the entire  persecuted Albanian people need relief from the extraordinary  hatred accumulated by the 50 year violations, they need peace  and spiritual harmony, stability and love for one another,  national spirit and consciousness, on order that they be able to  work and live in democracy.</p>

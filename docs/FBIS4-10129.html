			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy issued a "message to  the people," which was not read out, to journalists at the  international airport yesterday. In the message, Wasmosy says  his government has studied and approved nearly 100 industrial  projects, and created an Industrial Development Fund for  granting immediate financial assistance to those projects. The  message states: "Before the year end we will have a considerable  number of new job opportunities for our young people,  professionals, and technicians who anxiously expect to overcome  the unemployment that afflicts thousands of our fellow  countrymen." The eight-page message is signed by the president.  Wasmosy did not talk to the media.    In another paragraph Wasmosy says: "The allegation that the  executive branch wants to maintain a harmful influence on the  judicial branch is absolutely false. Very soon we will have a  new judicial branch, reorganized according to constitutional  mandates. No one is more interested than the executive branch in  a sovereign, independent, and trustworthy justice system. We  want a judicial branch capable of assuring not only to our own  citizens, but also foreigners who might want to work and invest  in our country."    The message says: "The fight against corruption has enabled  the government to increase its fiscal collections week after  week. These collections are at record levels compared to the  same periods in previous years. The government will be able to  fulfill its obligations in time."    Wasmosy's message adds that the political difficulties faced  by the government to administer situations and conflicts of  various kinds has sometimes made relations between government  and Congress more or less critical. He comments: "Events will  show that our commitment with opposition leaders who consider  democratic governability an essential factor for the  consolidation of this historic process will not be destroyed  with the ease forecasted by those who miss the autocratic  system."    In the message, Wasmosy recognizes "the valuable cooperation  of various opposition leaders who intellectually contributed to  our diplomatic efforts, because in my government the national  interest is more important than any egoist sectarian interests,  which are a permanent source of mediocrity."    Wasmosy says he faced the numerous labor conflicts "with  calm," stressing that negotiation is the appropriate instrument  "to transform confrontation into agreement." Wasmosy adds that  he has "the necessary calmness and equanimity" to listen to  representatives of groups who have not had the opportunity to  make themselves heard before. He adds: "We are not impressed by  force, but we are very sensitive to the force of reason used by  the different groups in their arguments." Wasmosy concludes by  committing himself to seek "the well-being of all in freedom,  democracy, and peace."</p>

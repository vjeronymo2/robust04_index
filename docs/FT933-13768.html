			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Clarke prepared to extend scope of VAT MR KENNETH CLARKE yesterday admitted that the government might extend further the scope of value added tax if the recent acceleration in the pace of economic recovery did not make a significant dent in the government's borrowing requirement. In a bid to shore up crumbling support for the Conservative candidate in the Christchurch by-election he ruled out unequivocally the introduction of new National Health Service charges for the elderly. The chancellor did not attempt to counter the backlash in the once-safe Tory constituency against the introduction of VAT on domestic heating, hinting instead that he would be ready to widen further the VAT net to raise additional revenue in his November Budget. He told a press conference in Christchurch that he had supported from the outset the imposition of VAT on fuel, adding that he had always regarded the UK's relatively narrow indirect tax base as 'anomalous'. Endorsing the progressive shift in the tax burden from direct to indirect which has been engineered by previous Conservative chancellors, he left the clear impression that, if necessary, he would consider ending the zero-rating of other goods and services. But he insisted repeatedly he would make his judgment on any tax changes much closer to the date of the November Budget, holding out the possibility that faster-than-expected economic growth might allow him to avoid any significant increases. In a confident if relatively brief appearance on the by-election stage, Mr Clarke set as his aim the once-and-for-all rebuttal of claims from opposition parties that the government is considering charging the elderly for prescriptions and introducing 'hotel charges' for stays in hospital. Around a third of the voters in the constituency are elderly and the combination of VAT on fuel and fears about the future of the welfare state have dealt a crushing blow to Conservative hopes of retaining the seat in the July 29 poll. Mr Clarke also gave a broad hint that other groups currently exempt from prescription charges - notably children  - would retain that privilege. But, facing a Pounds 50bn annual borrowing requirement, he refused to give other pledges on spending or taxation to prevent what party workers fear is a haemorrhaging of support for Mr Robert Hayward, the Conservative candidate. Instead the chancellor accused Mrs Diane Maddock, the Liberal Democrat challenger in Christchurch, of promising billions in additional expenditure that would be impossible to finance. He confirmed that the cabinet was pressing ahead with plans to restrict the scope of invalidity benefit and was looking for other savings across the welfare budget.</p>

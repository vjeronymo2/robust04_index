			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: No change to threshold - Capital Taxes / The Budget and You ONE OF John Major's most inspiring visions faded in the Budget. At the Conservative conference in 1991, he told delegates that he wanted to see wealth 'cascading down the generations'. Lobby journalists were given to understand that this would mean reform, or even abolition, of inheritance tax. As it transpired, last year's budget merely increased the threshold for the value if an estate before IHT becomes payable by slightly more than the rate of inflation - from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000. That is where the threshold will stay this year. Inflation is low, while prices of the assets which form the bulk of most estates - houses - have fallen over the last year, so heirs have little to complain about. But it is not the sweeping reform for which some had hoped. There will similarly be no indexation for the CGT threshold. You are only allowed to realise gains of Pounds 5,800, over and above inflation, before CGT becomes payable. That remains generous, in spite of the equity market recovery in the last quarter of 1992, and fewer than 100,000 investors are liable to pay the tax in 1992-93.</p>

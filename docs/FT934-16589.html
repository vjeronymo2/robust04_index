			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Change of economic course in wind - Russia looks to IMF and World Bank for speedy help THE RUSSIAN government expects accelerated assistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank before the end of the year, with the Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 993m) second tranche of the IMF's systemic transformation facility likely to be paid next month. Meetings last week in Washington between Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, and the leadership of the Fund and the Bank encouraged both institutions to hope for a decisive change of course in an economic policy which had gone badly off course in the past three months. Inflation reached around 27 per cent in August and about 20 per cent the following month, according to figures released yesterday by the government's Economic Reform Centre. Mr Fyodorov told both institutions he expected that results of a tighter financial and budgetary policy would be obvious by the end of this month. The governments of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries want to support President Boris Yeltsin in the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for December. They are also keen that the elections take place no later than December so that the period in which he can indulge in a pre-election spending spree to bolster his popularity is kept to a minimum. Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the Economic Reform Centre, said the administration was preparing a raft of measures under the heading of a 'Plan for Economic Work in 1994'. These would centre on liberalisation of trade and energy prices, speeding up privatisation and protecting private property, with 'post-privatisation' reforms designed to make enterprises now in the private sector more efficient, and to streamline the relationship between the federal and regional budgets. The absence of the parliament, he said, gave the government a certain freedom of action, But 'on the other hand, elections to the new parliament mean that the government cannot plan properly in this period'. Emphasising the seriousness of the present economic situation, Professor Richard Layard, an adviser to the government, said yesterday that the rise of central bank credits in the third quarter was likely to be around 40 per cent, against a target of 20 per cent. He said that an extra cause of alarm was that the velocity of money transactions - the rate at which money changes hands - had risen sharply. Between October last year and this August, money had increased 4.45 times while prices had increased 7.78 times. 'This means that people are spending their money much faster than before. This was always the great worry - that in an inflationary situation people don't want to hold on to their money. It's dangerous because even if you manage to stick to the credit targets, you don't necessarily check inflation.' He said that measures to restrict credits and bring down the budget deficit 'would be very hard - but inflation is also very hard on people'. Reformers in the government are now pressing hard for the resignation of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman. Mr Andrei Illarionov, economic adviser to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, said yesterday that since the bank had been brought under government control on September 21 following the banning of parliament, it had refused to carry out an order to remit its profits to the government. Mr Illarionov, in a detailed critique of the bank, said yesterday that its 'senseless' decision in July to declare invalid all pre-1993 cash roubles had increased inflation in August by up to 15 per cent, and in September by around 7 per cent as cash flooded back into Russia from former Soviet republics still using the rouble. The bank's announcement on Monday that transactions in foreign currency were to be declared invalid from January 1 was not backed by the government, and was impossible to implement. Mr Vassiliev said the economy was now extensively dollarised: between a third and a half of cash money circulating or on deposit was now in dollars. 'The central bank's action is stupid, and they must change it,' he said. Mr Vladimir Vinogradov, head of the Moscow Bankers' Association, called the decision 'premature and another mistake by the central bank'. There was, he said, no point in banning foreign currency until trust was restored in the rouble. The scanty good news is that privatisation continues at a rapid rate. According to figures from the Centre for Economic Performance, some 20 per cent of workers now work for companies in the private sector. Prof Layard said that between 3 and 4 per cent of Russian industry was being privatised each month. 'This is the fastest rate of privatisation in human history. 'In one month the Russian government is privatising more than Mrs Thatcher (former British prime minister) did in 10 years.'</p>

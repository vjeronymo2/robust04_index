			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pechiney to take FFr1bn charge PECHINEY, the French state-owned aluminium and packaging group, is to make a FFr1.1bn (Dollars 205m) to FFr1.3bn restructuring charge against profits this year to cover job losses, but said yesterday it did not expect more charges in 1993. The group, Europe's largest aluminium producer, yesterday said the 1,250 French job losses it announced recent-ly would cost between FFr400m and FFr600m this year. This comes on top of a FFr700m charge made in the first six months of the year to cover restructuring at Howmet, its North American turbine components producer, hit by the decline in demand from the aircraft industry. Sales fell by 9.1 per cent in the first nine months of this year to FFr49.8bn. Pechiney recorded a 63 per cent rise in net profits in the first half of the year, helped by exceptional gains which made up for a sharp fall in operating profits.</p>

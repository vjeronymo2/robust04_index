			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / MPs to probe failed hospital: Founder denies that Scottish healthcare project was flawed Government funding for Health Care International, the private hospital which went into receivership on Wednesday only four months after opening, is to be investigated by the Commons' public accounts committee. This follows a request to the committee last month from Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, for an urgent inquiry into why Pounds 30m of public money had been committed to what he described as a 'shaky' project. Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the committee, said it would meet soon to decide how to carry out the investigation. The public funds offered to HCI included Pounds 22m in regional selective assistance, part of which had not been disbursed. Scottish Enterprise, the development body, had lent HCI Pounds 4m and invested Pounds 1.4m. The joint receivers, Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, were called in on Wednesday after the French bank Credit Lyonnais refused to accept a refinancing package for the hospital, which hit cash flow problems because of a shortage of overseas patients. Yesterday Dr Raphael Levey, one of the US founders of HCI, denied that the concept of HCI was flawed. Its cash flow needs had initially exceeded 'patient flows' but in recent days it had been achieving a rate of admissions that would have assured its viability. 'If we had had a bit more time and a bit more cash this catastrophe would not have happened,' he said. The bank which had refused to continue supporting the project was the one that was 'least close to the project'. Some hopes for the hospital's future are being pinned on the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority which owns 5 per cent of HCI's ordinary shares, and had been prepared to put more equity into it before the company went into receivership. HCI believes Abu Dhabi could also assure a substantial flow of patients to the hospital. Yesterday Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, rejected criticism that Labour's stance over HCI was based on dogma. He said: 'The dogma lay with Conservative ministers who were determined to plough so much money into a highly questionable and risky project.'</p>

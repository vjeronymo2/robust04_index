Testing of the first reactor, originally scheduled for the end of the 1980s,  has now been postponed until the end of 1992 at the earliest. The reason for  the delay was not specified. Cuban officials say their nuclear program is aimed  at reducing the Communist island nation's dependence on oil.  </P></p>

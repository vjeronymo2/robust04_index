			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> J. A. SAN ROMAN; COMMANDER IN FAILED BAY OF PIGS INVASION  </P> <P> Jose Alfredo San Roman, a commander of the Cuban exile invasion force that was  defeated at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, has been found dead with a note near his  side, police said.  </P> <P> Although the exact cause of death has not been determined, it appears to be a  suicide, police spokesman George Reyes said.  </P> <P> San Roman, 58, was found dead in his home Sunday morning. An autopsy is  pending.  </P> <P> "Apparently he had been depressed lately," Reyes said.  </P> <P> In 1961, San Roman -- a captain in the army of Fulgencio Batista, the former  Cuban dictator overthrown by Fidel Castro -- was one of the commanders of the  1,500 U.S.-trained and -equipped Cuban exiles on what turned out to be a  disastrous attempt to invade Cuba and oust Castro.  </P> <P> The attempt by Brigade 2506 to land at the Bay of Pigs was trounced by Castro's  forces and U.S. participation in the affair proved a humiliating defeat for the  Administration of President John F. Kennedy.  </P> <P> A member of the Veterans of the Brigade 2506, formed in Miami by survivors of  the ill-fated invasion, said San Roman had long been depressed by the failure  and Castro's continued grip on Cuba.  </P> <P> "He has been depressed for a long time over the problem in Cuba," said Jose  Perdomo, who fought under San Roman at the Bay of Pigs.  </P></p>

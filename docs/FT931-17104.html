			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Jury out on Kenyan experiment: Elections have left the country precariously balanced President Daniel arap Moi may come to look back on December 29 as the day he won an election but lost the authority to govern Kenya. Yesterday the ruling party's manipulation of the country's first multi-party election for 26 years achieved what once seemed impossible. The country's three main opposition leaders announced the formation of a united front and vowed not to let Mr Moi assume power again. Against the incongruous backdrop of new-year tinsel and bunting at a Nairobi hotel, they pledged to set aside past differences of personality and tribe to oust Mr Moi from the absolute power he has wielded for 14 years. It is more easily said than done, and last night the opposition refused to reveal its hand. But it is clear that Kenya will never be the same again and now faces its most critical moment in history since independence from Britain in 1964. The future is uncertain - the country is precariously balanced between further change and upheaval. At best Kenya will settle into a period of fragile stability as the three party leaders attempt to wrest power from an authoritarian president, or at least persuade him to share power in what would be a government of national unity. At worst, the nation will be thrown into civil strife. Much will depend on whether Mr Moi, a reluctant democrat, can learn to live in an era which requires a degree of tolerance, compromise and transparency that he has lacked in 14 years of near unbridled power. Equally important will be the opposition's capacity to contain the passions of its supporters. Whatever the outcome, Tuesday's polls have set Kenya irreversibly on the path of change. Much is at stake, for Africa and the west. A successful transition from autocracy to democracy would revive hopes for the recovery of a rare African example of stability and growth. For the west it would mark the successful culmination of the policy of linkage between aid and good government: the imposition of a freeze on donor funds in November 1991 spurred Mr Moi to drop the ban on opposition parties a month later. Failure would not only prove devastating for Kenya's 26m people. It would reverberate through a region scarred by tribalism, war and economic mismanagement, and act as a body blow to hopes for resuscitation of the continent as a whole, leaving western government reassessing the merits of pushing authoritarian states down the road of pluralism. For Mr Moi the election has been a painful, even humiliating, experience. Hours after he cast his vote in a mountain retreat deep in the Rift Valley, the 68-year-old president lashed out at his tormentors  - western governments which twisted his arm, forcing him to introduce multi-party politics by 'starving Kenya'. Few African leaders have proved as resistant to the continent's new wind of change as Mr Moi. For nearly a quarter century the country had been an African role model and a leading recipient of western aid. Real growth in gross domestic product narrowly outpaced an annual population increase of 3.5-4 per cent. But from the mid-1980s Kenya's reputation became ever more tarnished by human rights abuses, economic mismanagement and corruption that ate away at reform attempts. A year ago, the country became a test case: could international donors, by linking aid to good government, nudge an unwilling autocrat down the road towards democracy and economic transparency? And could democracy take root in a tribally based African nation after more than a quarter century of rotten one-party statism? For the moment, the jury is still out on the Kenya experiment. Provisional results from 167 of the 188 constituencies showed last night that, technically, Mr Moi and the ruling party Kanu are back in power, but the veteran leader has been badly mauled. He has won the presidency against stiff competition from Mr Kenneth Matiba, but with only 36 per cent of the presidential poll against Mr Matiba's 27 per cent. In the parliamentary election Kanu was last night headed for a narrow majority, but only if the 12 MPs which can be nominated by the president are included in the total. Several of Mr Moi's most important heavyweight supporters, such as Mr Ndolo Ayah, the foreign minister, and Mr Elijah Mwangale, the agriculture minister, were defeated in an election that claimed 14 cabinet ministers. However, the opposition yesterday said that it did not accept the results of an election which, it claims, was 'blatantly rigged' and marked by widespread intimidation, massive fraud and introduction of illegal ballot boxes. Any electoral abuses, however, did not protect Mr Moi from the humiliating exposure of the depth of his unpopularity among the Kikuyus and Luos, Kenya's two largest tribes. Kanu failed to secure a single seat of 25 constituencies in the Kikuyu homeland of Central Province and won only one seat in the Luo-dominated Nyanza Province. In the presidential poll Mr Moi won a mere 2.5 per cent of the vote in Central Province. Should he try to govern in defiance of the opposition parties, he will be unable to include members of Kenya's most powerful and politically active tribes in his cabinet. Many political observers believe this will make it almost impossible for him to rule. At a hasty meeting the three main opposition parties - Ford-Asili led by Mr Matiba, Ford-Kenya led by Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and the Democratic party led by Mr Mwai Kibaki - said they were forming a united opposition front to 'avert the imminent crisis in the country'. They demanded fresh elections and said they were determined to prevent Mr Moi from assuming office. Behind these demands lies the considerable threat of violence which the opposition could initiate to bring the country to its knees. As politicians, in government and in opposition, grope to come to terms with the new post-electoral reality, the role of western governments remains critical. Having initiated the process of change by freezing aid worth USDollars 350m-Dollars 400m a year, they now have to keep pace with developments. Like the Commonwealth and other observer groups, they have been reluctant to condemn the poll as 'unfree and unfair', and inclined to argue in favour of a 'second best' solution - in which Kenya is seen as having taken a 'first step on the road to democracy' and Mr Moi remains in power, but faces the checks and balances provided by a powerful parliamentary opposition. The US, Britain and other donors have to walk a delicate path between legitimising Mr Moi and recognising the power of the opposition. The performance of the opposition to date has not been distinguished, however, and its capacity to act as an effective coalition has yet to be proved. The patient queues of voters were eloquent testimony to the belief of Kenyans in the ballot box, but the result showed that democracy in Kenya remains dominated by tribalism. Thirty years after independence, ethnic loyalties and rivalries, not ideology, determine voter allegiances. In the weeks ahead, Mr Moi will surely continue to exploit these differences and seek to buy off opposition by persuasion, intimidation or patronage. In the meantime the opposition lacks the machinery to organise extra-parliamentary action such as a general strike. The trade union movement is weak and poorly led and it is unlikely that it could co-ordinate a strike or other protest. However, the ability of the opposition to call out tens of thousands of demonstrators on to the streets of Kenya is formidable, even if it cannot control the outcome. Meanwhile, the political machinations under way are certain to distract attention from the most severe economic crisis Kenya has faced since independence, exacerbated by massive extra-budgetary funding of Kanu's election campaign. Symptoms of the crisis include a rate of inflation now exceeding 40 per cent a year, money supply growth well above a target of 10 per cent, a soaring budget deficit and a continuing foreign exchange squeeze. The population of 26m is set to double by 2010 and hunger for land is increasing in a country two-thirds arid or semi-arid and with no known mineral resources. The country's largest foreign exchange earner, tourism, has already been badly hit by fears of instability and violence. Unless a political accommodation is reached, the economic decline will become irreversible and, as the economy falters and unemployment rises, the prospects for strife grow ominously greater.</p>

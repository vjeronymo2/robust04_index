			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Gardening: Hunting to save the landscape - Country View WE ARE accustomed to hearing dire news from the countryside. Farming is highly unprofitable, EC plans to cut subsidies will make business worse. The principal land-uses are in an unhealthy state and some hill farms with arable ground are selling for the same price as unenclosed moorland. Forestry has proved an unattractive alternative. Few farmers are prepared to risk such a long-term investment. Eco-forestry is being encouraged by the Farm Woodland Scheme, but offers little prospect for profit. Set-Aside, conceived as a way of reducing surpluses and satisfying environmentalists, has proved unpopular. It is applied on about 155,000 hectares, or 3 per cent of the farmable area. Farmers are given money to cease farming; where corn had grown nature was to take its course. Nature being what it is this meant that, instead of rolling acres of wild flowers the virile and invasive weeds, nourished by fertiliser residues, crowded out everything else. Green fields were made green by fertilisers or animal manure; without them much summer grass was yellow or brown. The commonest plant became the thistle. Farmers turned on each other when it became clear that the prime candidates for the sinecure of Set-Aside were either the most incompetent farmers, ageing farmers happy to be paid to drop out, or those on the worst land who at last had a chance to match the incomes of their better-endowed neighbours. The solution to the problem of what to do with the countryside is ready-made: turn it into hunting, shooting and fishing preserves. Which, of course, is what it originally was. The earliest property rights were hunting rights. Long before agriculture was more than sporadic pastoral activity in forest clearings, hunting reserves were thoroughly organised, the primary rule being protection of habitat. The conservation credentials of field sports as a land-use are excellent. A report has been published which says country sports are gaining popularity. The independent report, Countryside Sports: Their Economic and Conservation Significance, was commissioned by The Standing Conference on Countryside Sports and was published recently. It says the UK has become a nation of shooters, hunters, stalkers and anglers. Because of the indeterminate number of sportsmen who practise more than one field sport the report does not offer a total figure for all Britain's sportsmen, but there are 3.9m anglers, 850,000 shooters, and 240,000 hunters to hounds. This rustic activity generates more than Pounds 1.4bn annually in direct spending, and employs 125,000 people. Since 1970 the number of anglers has risen by 1m. In the last eight years the number of stalkers has trebled and the number of clay pigeon shooters has doubled. The game yielded by these activities is worth Pounds 38m a year. The hunting tackle trade is worth Pounds 43m in exports alone. Taxes on sporting revenues and on the earnings of gunsmiths, ghillies, gamekeepers and farriers; sales of gun and fishing licences and permits and business and sporting rates levied by local authorities, contribute Pounds 459m to the public purse. This industry is entirely in the private sector at a time when other country activities, agriculture and forestry, furiously subsidised by the state, are losing their meaning. However, country concerns are less well represented in the House of Commons than at any time. Country sports are the preserve not of the elite but of the poorer half of the community. Dividing participants into four socio-economic groups, the Standing Conference report finds that 56 per cent of shooters and 68 per cent of anglers belong to the lowest two groupings. A paltry 15 per cent of the most affluent participate in shooting or fishing at all. Even those arguing against the Hunting Bill in the last Parliament used the principle of freedom of choice as their basis, rather than a detailed defence of the part played by hunting in rural life. It is time they wised up. Country feelings run deep, and they throb in the breasts of many city-dwellers, too.</p>

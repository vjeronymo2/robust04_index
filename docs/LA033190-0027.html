			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FEW BUILDING PLANS SUBMITTED AS MORATORIUM EXPIRES IN BURBANK  </P> <P> A yearlong construction moratorium in Burbank, imposed to give the city time to  develop new building restrictions, came to an end this week, but few developers  have submitted plans for new projects because the City Council is still  haggling over new rules.  </P> <P> City Planner Rick Pruetz said that although a moratorium on issuance of new  permits for construction of apartment buildings expired Wednesday, the city has  received fewer than half a dozen proposals for new projects.  </P> <P> Before the moratorium, the city received about 150 building plans per year.  </P> <P> Pruetz said some developers are reluctant to propose new projects because the  city building guidelines are still being revised.  </P> <P> After voters approved a ballot initiative calling for growth controls last  year, the City Council imposed the construction moratorium so it could write  new building guidelines.  </P> <P> Council members are considering imposing a developers fee to help pay for the  city services required by the additional residents brought to the city by new  housing. Many developers would rather wait until the fee proposal is complete  before submitting building plans, Pruetz said.  </P></p>

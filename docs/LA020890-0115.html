			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LA CANADA GIVES TENTATIVE OK TO LAND DEAL  </P> <P> The La Canada Flintridge City Council has tentatively approved a development  agreement with the Flintridge Estates Partnership that may enable the city to  purchase 36.5 acres of undeveloped land for use as public open space.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 0 to approve the agreement and certify a final draft of  an environmental impact report, prepared for the developer by an Orange County  firm, at a public hearing Monday.  </P> <P> Councilman Ed Phelps, whose former business partner is the developer's  representative, abstained because of a potential conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The purchase price for the property is $1.75 million, of which the city would  pay $750,000. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency, would pay  $1 million.  </P> <P> The parcel is part of a 47-acre site known locally as the Sugar Loaf  Subdivision.  </P> <P> The agreement would allow the present owners to develop a nine-lot subdivision  on the remaining portion. The subdivision proposal next goes before the  Planning Commission for further hearings.  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Smoking 'costing NHS Pounds 610m' THE NATIONAL Health Service spends more than Pounds 610m a year treating smoking-related health problems in England and Wales, the Health Education Authority said yesterday. It said in a report that about Pounds 1m a week was spent on prescriptions from GPs for smoking-related illnesses, while GPs received 8m visits each year by patients who were ill because they smoke. It said children in households with a smoker visited their doctors more often and needed more prescriptions.</p>

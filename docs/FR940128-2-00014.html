			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, petitioners claim that the calculation methodologies used to prepare KT's September and October responses were virtually identical. According to petitioners, for both the September and October responses, KT calculated its material costs by multiplying the average per-kilogram material cost by the nominal weight of the pipe. Petitioners assert that the nominal weights used for these calculations were identical because KT stated that the nominal weight of the pipe was determined according to ASTM A&hyph;312 specifications. Thus, petitioners contend that differences in the materials costs could only arise if KT used different average per kilogram materials costs for its September and October responses. Petitioners maintain that these per kilogram materials costs are different for no apparent reason and are therefore suspect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners contend that KT is incorrect in its assertion that the difference in the material costs reported in the two cost responses is immaterial to whether home market sales were made at prices below KT's cost of production. According to petitioners, KT's analysis mistakenly assumes that the understatement of its costs can be corrected by merely using the costs in KT's unverified October response. Consequently, petitioners argue that the Department should reject both of KT's cost responses and use BIA to establish KT's final dumping margin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with KT. The Department verified that KT accurately reported its actual material expenses incurred during the POI. Although the Department noted at verification that KT did not break out material costs between specific dimensions of pipe within a particular grade for the verified submission, the record indicates that the company incurred the same per kilogram cost for differing gauges of coil within a particular grade of steel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We find that a comparison of the methodologies used in September and October responses is irrelevant because we only verified the methodology used in the September response. Prior to verification, we determined that the costs contained in the October submission were not adequately product-specific to meet the Department's requirements; therefore, we informed KT that we would not verify the COM portion of that response. Rather, the Department verified the material costs used in the September submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the methodologies used to compile the data in the two submissions were different, the costs reported in the submissions also differed. Therefore, the fact that the September data differed from the October data does not provide sufficient grounds to reject these costs. Because we verified the reasonableness of the September costs, we have accepted them for purposes of the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners argue that the Department should reject the cost of production data contained in KT's original cost submission because the Department was unable to verify the reported fabrication costs. Specifically: (1) The fabrication costs reported by KT in its September 13, 1993, submission were allocated to cost centers based on budgeted usage rates which could not be reconciled to KT's actual POI experience; (2) KT's methodology of allocating fabrication costs between industrial and ornamental pipe yields a result which is inconsistent with its reported production process steps; and (3) total manufacturing costs for industrial pipe were allocated to each subject product based on the weight of production rather than machine time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners note that, to the extent the Department resorted to weight-based allocations in a previous case involving WSSP (see, Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Welded Stainless Steel Pipe from Taiwan (58 FR 53705, November 12, 1992) (WSSP from Taiwan)), that case represents an aberration from the Department's usual practice and is clearly distinguishable from the facts in the present case. Petitioners maintain that in WSSP from Taiwan the Department accepted the Taiwanese respondent's allocation because it concluded that the allocation ``did not materially affect the cost calculation because labor and overhead represented a small part of total cost of production.'' In this case, however, petitioners contend that KT's submitted data demonstrate that fabrication costs can hardly be considered immaterial in relation to the submitted total cost of production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, petitioners contend that KT's reliance on WSSP from Taiwan as a basis for claiming that weight-based allocations are acceptable is misplaced. Alternatively, petitioners assert that the Department accepts allocation methodologies based on weight only when a respondent affirmatively shows that such allocations make sense in light of the specific fabrication process for the product under investigation and when allocations based on machine time cannot be performed. According to petitioners, neither criterion has been satisfied by KT, and thus the Department should reject KT's weight-based allocations in favor of BIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: Toyota plans to buy minority stake in French distributor TOYOTA, the leading Japanese car maker, is planning to buy a minority stake of about 35 per cent in Toyota France, its privately-owned French importer and distributor. The moves follows the acquisition last year by Nissan, the second largest Japanese car maker, of an additional 72.1 per cent stake in Richard Nissan, its French importer/distributor, raising its holding to 81.6 per cent. The leading Japanese car makers are strengthening control of their distributors in Europe in preparation for the creation of the single European market from the end of 1992. Tighter control will also help them cope with the growing supply of cars from their European assembly plants during the 1990s. Toyota's first European car plant, located at Burnaston near Derby in the UK, begins production in late 1992, as does Honda's car plant at Swindon. Nissan's plant at Sunderland in north-east England, which began production in 1986, is expected to raise car output to 175,000 this year and to 270,000 in 1993. Toyota France is currently 98.5 per cent owned by Walter Frey Holding of Switzerland, the holding company for the Emil Frey motor distributor and motor retailing group. Mr Walter Frey, chairman of the family-owned company, said that Toyota had received permission in December from the French authorities to take a substantial minority stake in Toyota France. The timing of the acquisition and the price were still to be negotiated. The Emil Frey group would remain the Toyota importer/distributor in Switzerland. Toyota already owns Toyota Deutschland and Toyota Italia, its German and Italian importer/distributors. It has also acquired a 5 per cent stake in Toyota GB, its UK distributor, which it will raise in stages to 51 per cent by 1998. Nissan took control of its importer/distributor operations in the UK with effect from the beginning of 1992. Toyota last year sold 16,631 cars in France, filling its 0.78 per cent quota of the market. France maintains a 3 per cent market share quota on direct vehicle imports from Japan and has limited the Japanese presence to five car makers, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda, Honda and Mitsubishi Motors. Toyota yesterday strongly denied reports in France that it had made a deal with the French authorities to accept special restrictions on its sales after the end of 1992 in return for French government approval of its plan to take a stake in Toyota France. Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, is reviewing the credit of Nissan Motor in Japan and several units of the automobile maker for possible downgrading, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. The review of the Single-A-One rating of Nissan's senior credit affects Dollars 16bn of debt. Moody's cited Nissan's 'disappointing business performance, especially in its intensely competitive home market' and concern about the impact on cashflow of plans for heavy investment in plant and equipment.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- PERFORMANCE INDEX NRI TOKYO BOND INDEX  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Average December 1983 = 100               yield     Last      12 wks   26 wks                       23/01/92     (%)      week         ago      ago Overall                171.12     5.39     169.88     164.58   157.09 Government Bonds       170.32     5.20     168.70     162.67   154.75 Municipal Bonds        172.43     5.85     171.73     166.92   158.87 Govt.- guaranteed Bonds 174.61     5.86     174.09     169.36   161.60 Bank Debentures        166.85     5.12     165.64     160.90   154.21 Corporate Bonds        172.28     6.37     171.63     167.20   160.01 Yen-denom.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 89. Where we adopt sized-based eligibility rules and provide that such eligibility determinations shall include the applicant and all its ``affiliates,'' the following rules shall govern determinations regarding affiliation. Apart from determining affiliation between the applicant itself and outside entities, the need to determine affiliation arises where an investor has an attributable interest in a designated entity. <FOOTCITE>131</FOOTCITE>  In this context it is necessary for the Commission to examine whether such investor has a relationship with other persons or outside entities that rise to the level of an affiliation with the applicant, and if so, whether the affiliate's assets, revenues, net worth, number of access lines, or other applicable financial thresholds, when aggregated with the applicant's, exceed the Commission's size eligibility thresholds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 131 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the context of broadband PCS, we stated that, generally, investors owning more than 25 percent of the applicant's passive equity would be considered to have ``attributable'' interests.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at &para;158. With regard to IVDS, we used the SBA standard to determine attributable interests,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 90.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Principles of Affiliation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An affiliation under the SBA rules would arise, first, from ``control'' of an entity or the ``power to control it.'' Thus, under the SBA rules, entities are affiliates of each other when either directly or indirectly (i) one concern controls or has the power to control the other, or (ii) a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both. <FOOTCITE>132</FOOTCITE>  In determining control, the SBA's rules provide generally that every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the power to control it. The rules, in addition, provide specific examples of where control resides under various scenarios, such as through stock ownership or occupancy of director, officer or management positions. The rules also articulate general principles of control, and note, for example, that control may be affirmative or negative and that it is immaterial whether control is exercised so long as the power to control exists. <FOOTCITE>133</FOOTCITE>  Second, an affiliation, under SBA rules, may also arise out of an ``identity of interest'' between or among parties. <FOOTCITE>134</FOOTCITE>  We adopted these same general provisions as our affiliation rules for broadband PCS and will also incorporate them into our general affiliation rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 132 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 CFR &sect;121.401(a)(2) (i), (ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 133 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;121.401(c)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 134 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;121.401(a)(2)(iii), (d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 91. In adopting these affiliation rules, we emphasize that these rules will not be applied in a manner that defeats the objectives of our service specific attribution rules. For example, in the context of broadband PCS, our attribution rules expressly permit applicants to disregard the gross revenues, total assets and net worth of certain passive investors, provided that an eligible control group has  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de jure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> control of the applicant. <FOOTCITE>135</FOOTCITE>  Our attribution rules are designed to preserve control of the applicant by eligible entities, yet allow investment in the applicant by entities that do not meet the size restrictions in our rules. Therefore, so long as the requirements of our attribution rules are met, the affiliation rules will not be used to defeat the underlying policy objectives of allowing such passive investors. More specifically, if a control group has  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de jure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> control of the applicant, we shall not construe the affiliation rules in a manner that causes the interests of passive investors to be attributed to the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 135 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at &para;205. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 92. Applying these SBA affiliation rules, an affiliation would arise, for example, where an entity with an attributable interest in an applicant is under the control of another entity. An affiliation would also arise where an entity with an attributable interest in an applicant controls, or has the power to control, another entity. For example, if an attributable investor in an applicant is also a shareholder in a large Corporation X, when should Corporation X be deemed an affiliate of the applicant as a result of the shareholder's ownership interest in both entities? Under the SBA rules and the rules we adopt here, Corporation X would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant if the shareholder controlled or had the power to control Corporation X, in which case, Corporation X's gross revenues must be included in determining the applicant's gross revenues. <FOOTCITE>136</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 136 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Fifth Report and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at &para;206. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 93. For purposes of determining control, ownership interests will be calculated on a fully-diluted basis. Thus, for example, stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) will generally be considered to have a present effect on the power to control or own an interest in either an outside entity or the PCS applicant or licensee. We will treat such options, debentures, and agreements generally as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised. <FOOTCITE>137</FOOTCITE>  However, an affiliate cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over or relationship with another concern before it actually does so. <FOOTCITE>138</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 137 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 CFR 121.401(f). SBA's rules provide the following examples to guide the application of this provision: Example 1. If company ``A'' holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company ``B,'' the situation is treated as though company ``A'' had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling interest in company ``B.'' The [annual revenues] of both concerns must be taken into account in determining size. Example 2. If company ``A'' has entered into an agreement to merge with company ``B'' in the future, the situation is treated as though the merger has taken place. [A and B are affiliates of each other]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 138 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> SBA's rules provide this example: If large company ``A'' holds 70 percent (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company ``B'' and gives a third party an option to purchase 66 of the 70 shares owned by A, company ``B'' will be deemed to be an affiliate of company ``A'' until the third party actually exercises its option to purchase such shares. In order to prevent large company ``A'' from circumventing the intent of the regulation which [gives] present effect to stock options, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 94.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Voting and Other Trusts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a similar vein, we also borrow from the SBA's rules and our own rules in other services to find affiliation under certain voting trusts in order to prevent a circumvention of eligibility rules. The SBA's rules provide that a voting trust, or similar agreement, cannot be used to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control an outside concern, if the primary purpose of the trust is to meet size eligibility rules. <FOOTCITE>139</FOOTCITE>  Similarly, under the Commission's broadcast multiple ownership rules, stock interests held in trust may be attributed to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, has the sole power to sell such stock, has the right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. <FOOTCITE>140</FOOTCITE>  Also, under the broadcast rules, if a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary of a trust, the stock interests held in trust will be considered assets of the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate. <FOOTCITE>141</FOOTCITE>  Because we believe the broadcast rules provide more definitive guidance in this particular area, we shall use them as a model for the general affiliation rules adopted here. Thus, for example, if an investor with an attributable interest in an applicant holds a beneficial interest in stock of another firm that amounts to a controlling interest in that other firm, depending on the identity of the trustee, the other firm may be considered an affiliate and its assets and gross revenues may be attributed to the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 139 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 CFR 121.401(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 140 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR 73.3555 note 2(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 141 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

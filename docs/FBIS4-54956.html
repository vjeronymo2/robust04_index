			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Altin Malaj report: "Tense Situation in Kukes"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Why Is There Tension? </H5>   The first days of May were very tense in Kukes. A possible  hunger strike had been announced some days previously as a  consequence of the intolerable misery that is a result of the  neglect of the demands of the inhabitants of 45 villages along  the banks of the Drin. People's feelings brought them out on  the streets. Gatherings increased on 1, 2, and 3 May. Warning  strikes also began, while the government in Tirana remained  silent at demands that were beyond the competence of local  authorities. The strikers then decided to embark on that most  appalling human act, a hunger strike. Perhaps this is the only  way to make our governments come out to the people. This is  indeed what happened. It took a group of 50 strikers occupying  the meeting hall of the former Kukes District Executive  Committee on the morning of 4 May for four ministers of the  Democratic government to urgently descend on Kukes by  helicopter. These included Public Order Minister Agron Musaraj.  Ministers Manushi, Halili, and Xhaja flew with him.  <H5>  Why Did the Strike Begin? </H5>   When the great dam of the Fierze hydroelectric station was  built years ago, it did not occur to anybody that this project  could later become the cause of major social problems that would  lead people to consciously make sacrifices of themselves. The  then regime made an extraordinary commotion about creating new  socialist villages, about which even songs were composed. These  are now turning into scenes of tragedy. About 30,000  inhabitants of the inundated villages were rehoused in 13  specially constructed so-called "socialist villages." At that  time, these people who were uprooted from their land were  content merely with a house each, which the state built for  them. They made no great claims over their expropriation,  because other cooperativist peasants were in virtually the same  position. However, the start of the democratic movement, the  collapse of the cooperatives, and the restoration of property  left these inhabitants of inundated villages stranded like fish  out of water. They could not return to their old land, because  this was under the waters of the "lake of light." Moreover, the  inhabitants of the villages where they had settled began to  evict them, because of their own land ownership. This was when  they started to raise their demands, which boiled down to a  matter of life and death. They democratically created their  association of those expropriated by flooding, which was  recognized by law. In 1991, they also formulated their demands,  which they submitted to the government. Here they are:    -- about 2,000 hectares in compensation for the inundated  land.    -- rent for their land on the basis of the approximate value  of the produce of the inundated land.    -- recognition of co-ownership in any possible privatization  of the hydroelectric station.    -- compensation for the difference in house values then and  now.    -- the accommodation of emigrant families in areas with  adequate land.    But what concretely has been done with these demands between  1991 and now? Nothing, except that they have been recognized as  fair, both then and now. In September 1993, representatives of  the association meet with Arbnori and Selami, and as a result a  government commission was created under Hasan Halili, now  agriculture minister. This commission has apparently never met.  The protests of the people of Kukes continued with a petition  addressed to the president of the Republic, but all these  efforts fell on the government's deaf ears. Under such  circumstances, the association decided to use the final method  of a hunger strike.  <H5>  Dialogue Followed by the Use of Force </H5>   The government was faced with an accomplished fact: In the  hall of the building in Kukes, the initial number of strikers  had trebled. They threatened not to leave the hall alive unless  their demands were met. Around the building, hundreds of other  people expressed solidarity with those inside. The tension  continually increased. The ministers came from Tirana. They  started talks with the strike committee, the committee of the  association, and the district council. All the district's  political groups called the strikers' demands fair, as did the  ministers, who attempted to extinguish the conflict with  discussions and promises. They offered hope for the migration  of some families, which had been approved by the relevant  communes. However, the strikers insisted on all their demands  and requested an urgent meeting with Prime Minister Meksi. Thus  the dialogue became embittered, and the members of the  government, who had not forgotten to bring with them some  vehicles with special forces, decided to use coercion, and  declared the strike to be illegal. Clashes began between  citizens and the special police forces. Forces of the Kukes  police were not used. There was no way in which they could  strike at their parents, brothers, and sisters. There were  inevitably gunshots and blows with truncheons and stones. A  truly painful situation. The result? Exact information is not  available, but official reports speak of 26 wounded, including  14 policemen and 12 demonstrators.    The tension in Kukes, which has lasted five days, is  continuing. The prime minister has still not gone there. The  national highway by the bridge of the Drin i Zi linking Kukes  with the rest of Albania was blockaded for one day, another  harsh warning from the strikers' supporters. The number of  people surrounding the building where the strikers are holed up  sometimes rises, sometimes falls. It is said that Jah Trota,  chairman of the strike committee from the village of Kenete, has  spoken to Mr. Meksi on the telephone, but they wait for him in  Kukes. Perhaps this would defuse the tension of recent days.</p>

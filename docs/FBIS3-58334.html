German </F> Constitutional Protection Office Investigates Russian Soldiers"]    [Text] The Saxony Land Office for the Protection of the  Constitution [LfV] is investigating whether members of the  Russian troops stationed in Germany or their relatives have any  contacts with the party of Russian right-wing extremist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy. The reason for the investigations: Saxony's  government wants to prevent Russian followers of Zhirinovskiy  from getting together with German neo-Nazis.    LfV President Mathilde Koller told BILD AM SONNTAG: "We are  investigating whether CIS soldiers stationed in Germany have any  contacts with Saxon neo-Nazis or whether they are producing  propaganda among German right-wing extremists for Zhirinovskiy's  ideas."    According to official information, 24 percent of the members  of the Western Group of the former Red Army in Germany voted for  Zhirinovskiy at the parliamentary elections. At the moment,  there are still 31,440 soldiers and 37,730 civilians in eastern  Germany.</p>

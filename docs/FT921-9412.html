			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Appointments: Senior move from Senior In the wake of management changes set in train by the imminent departure of Sir Roland Smith as chairman of Senior Engineering, David Cotterill, a director and divisional chief executive, is leaving to head Renold, the Manchester-based chain-maker. Cotterill, 48, has been in charge of the construction services and mining equipment divisions, the former generally regarded as one of Senior's best operations. But as a consequence of Don McFarlane's move to fill Smith's spot in May, another divisional chief, John Bell, head of engineering products, rises to group managing director. Renold, whose order book has been severely dented by the recession, says that the departure of Trevor Grice, who came in as chief executive in 1987, is unconnected with recent losses. It had been clear that Grice, 51, who lives on the other side of the Pennines and adds a 140-mile drive to a long day in the office, did not intend to do the job for more than five years. Before going to Senior, Cotterill had been managing director of Fenner International; this gave him specific experience in power transmission, Renold's speciality. ***** Walter Bourne has been appointed chief operating officer of BOWTHORPE Holdings, the electronic components group. He is 56, has been with the group since 1964 and became a director in 1981. Although an accountant by training, Bourne is described by John Westhead, who was recently appointed chief executive, as 'an extremely good marketeer'. ***** Stephen Chipping has been appointed commercial director of MASAS Cargo International, part of the OCEAN group. ***** Chris Rowlands has been appointed group finance director of HTV; he moves from Asda. ***** Pam Lewis has been appointed marketing director of Evans Medical, part of MEDEVA; she moves from Bristol Myers Squibb.</p>

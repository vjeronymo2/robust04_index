This has been  stated by the members of the first two Japanese delegations to  visit Cuba as part of the Union Tourism program. They showed  great respect and admiration for the attitude of the Cuban  people in resisting and overcoming the U.S. blockade. The  visitors belong to the provincial and municipal unions of the  governments of (Tokaona), (Logano), (Tuyana), and Hiroshima and  the public workers organization of Tokyo's administration. The  Japanese delegations were received by Norma Ortega, secretary  general of Cuba's Public Administration Union. The Japanese  delegations made cash donations for the Cuban people. Both  Japanese organizations showed interest in the current situation  of Cuba, and stressed the advantage that it is to live under the  social justice existing in Cuba.</p>

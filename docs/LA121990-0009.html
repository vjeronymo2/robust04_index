			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPARATIONS FOR BLACK AMERICANS  </P> <P> Three cheers for Robert Brock. He is correct in his assertion that America is  indebted to the descendants of former slaves.  </P> <P> Slaves provided much of labor that formed the foundation upon which this  country was built. The rewards of the labor provided by slaves wound up in the  pockets of the slave owners. Descendants of slave owners have therefore amassed  fortunes from the blood and sweat of African slaves.  </P> <P> How can anyone deny that America has profited from the work of slave labor? The  question is not "Does America owe descendants of former slaves anything?" The  question is "When will America give African-Americans the share of America's  wealth their ancestors have earned?"  </P> <P> Keep up the good work, Mr. Brock. The truth is on your side.  </P> <P> STACY KING  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

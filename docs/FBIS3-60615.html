Some cameras, which have been monitoring North Korea's  nuclear facilities and material, are no longer running, he said.    It is becoming more difficult for the IAEA to confirm that  North Korea is not diverting declared material from peaceful  purposes, Blix told the board.    It has become impossible for the IAEA to have meaningful  assurance that North Korea is using its nuclear material and  facilities for peaceful purposes, he said.    If North Korea does not cooperate with the IAEA, he warned,  the inspection continuity of the nuclear safeguards might  deteriorate to a state from where it cannot be restored.    The IAEA must visit and inspect nuclear material and  facilities in North Korea to determine if North Korea has  diverted declared material from peaceful purposes.    North Korea has not allowed the IAEA to do normal inspection  activities at its nuclear facilities since February and the  situation is worsening as time goes by, he said.    He said that the IAEA is ready for dialogue and consultation  with Pyongyang and to send an inspection mission anytime North  Korea is ready to accept it to carry out its work for  full-fledged implementation of nuclear safeguards, including  access to additional information and visits to additional places.</p>

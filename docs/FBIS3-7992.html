			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Public Order Ministry spokesman reports that  various political left-extermist forces continuously call for  and incite illegal gatherings through their newspapers,  particularly the Socialist Party with ZERI I POPULLIT. Such  calls have increased greatly recently, on the eve of the trial  of Fatos Nano, Ramiz Alia, and other blocmen.    The Public Order Ministry reports that it will act with the  force of law against anyone who seeks to exert pressure on  Albanian justice, which has an independent and inviolable power.  At the same time, it undertakes to guarantee order, calm, and  stability for the organs of justice, so that they can develop  their legal activity as normally as possible.    The Public Order Ministry warns all violators, whoever they  are, that they will be responsible before the law.</p>

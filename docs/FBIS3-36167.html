			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kotlyarov: "Kuzbass on Verge of Strike"] </F>   [Text] An all-Kuzbass conference of labor collective  representatives has been held in Kemerovo. It was attended by  delegates from enterprises in various industrial sectors, the  budget-funded sphere, and rural residents; leaders of a number  of firms, joint-stock companies, and sectoral trade unions; as  well as V. Goncharov, deputy chairman of the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia. Despite being officially  invited, the oblast administration, which, incidentally,  unilaterally terminated its involvement in the tripartite oblast  commission for the resolution of labor conflicts shortly  beforehand, ignored this representative assembly.    But the question under discussion at the conference is  highly  topical: "The socioeconomic situation in the Kuzbass and  tactics in the prevailing conditions." The situation in the  region is extraordinary and is steadily deteriorating. One by  one enterprises are coming to a standstill. The total credit  indebtedness has topped 2 trillion rubles [R]. And production  is continuing to decline. Thus production dropped 21 percent  last year in sectors working for the consumer market. Workers'  wages depreciated 20 percent a month. Miners alone have  currently failed to receive R29 billion in wages and the figure  is around R24 billion for budget-funded personnel....    The further stratification of society is proceeding at an  accelerated pace. Some 18-24 months ago the income of the poor  was one-third or one-fourth that of the rich, now it is lower by  a factor of 26! And what about underlying unemployment? There  are now 78,000 people on enforced extended leave or working a  reduced working day.    The conference participants adopted a set of demands to put  to the government and the president. The main ones being that a  program for socioeconomic transformations and a solution to the  economic crisis be published within one month and that a  mechanism be established to provide compensation for the damage  done to the health of the oblast's population by environmental  pollution.    In view of the prevailing situation and the opinion of labor  collectives, it was decided to declare a general strike in the  oblast and elect a coordinating council of labor collective  representatives.</p>

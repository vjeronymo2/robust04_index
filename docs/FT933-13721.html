			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Institutions bid for 1.4bn BT shares INSTITUTIONAL shareholders had bid for more than 1.4bn British Telecommunications shares after the international offer closed yesterday. The final figures will not be released until tomorrow. However, several leading UK institutional investors said they had declined to bid for shares because the price was too high. 'It's just not worth it at this level,' said one life insurance company investment manager. 'The deal will go well; we just aren't interested at these levels.' Another insurance company fund manager said that while he had placed bids for up to 1m shares, he realised that the prices he offered for them were too low relative to where BT shares were trading late Friday. 'We won't get any shares and we don't care to at these prices,' he said. The institutions point to the so-called 'time value of money' implied in the price of the partly paid shares. While this has been estimated at 14p per share, the premium has risen to roughly 12p, narrowing the discount to the market offered on the government's stake in BT. Retail investors have applied for just over 1bn BT shares in the UK public offer, according to final figures released yesterday. This is slightly more than expected but well down on the 1.7bn applications in the last sale of government BT shares in 1991. The total number of shares being sold is 1.2bn compared to 1.7bn last time. The number of individuals applying for shares was 1.66m. Share Shops took 978,000 applications compared to the 685,000 which went through the Share Information Office. More than half of all the applications came from existing BT shareholders compared to 15 per cent in the last sale in 1991. The government's advisers said this showed that the sale had succeed in deepening as well as widening share ownership. Retail investors have on average applied for 634 shares at total cost of Pounds 951.</p>

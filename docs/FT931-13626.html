			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: KOP losses set to double to FM3.5bn KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, said yesterday it was set to make a FM3.5bn (Dollars 643.8m) pre-tax loss in 1992, more than double the FM1.64bn deficit recorded a year earlier. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive, said it was unlikely that the bank would return to profit before 1995. 'We expect credit losses in 1993 to be as high as last year, when they were nearly FM4bn, and for there to be some improvement in 1994, but it all depends on the development of the Finnish economy.' He added that it was 'almost certain' that the bank would need a capital injection this year, either through a rights issue or through support from the government, or possibly a combination of both. The bank estimates its current capital adequacy ratio at 8.5 per cent. Last year, KOP received a FM1.7bn preference capital injection from the Finnish government, but so far it has not sought funds from the state guarantee fund. The huge 1992 loss is symptomatic of the crisis in Finnish banking, which has been plagued by recession and bad debts. The government has recently promised a further FM30bn in support for the banking system, taking the total available to FM50bn. In the first eight months of 1992, KOP recorded a FM2.53bn loss as credit losses soared to FM2.4bn. It warned at that stage that write-offs for the full year would total FM3.6bn and its overall loss would exceed FM3bn. Mr Voutilainen said the bank's figures had improved slightly in the final four months of the year, compared with the first eight months, because of better margins and a good performance from the Treasury division. But he was still gloomy about the immediate outlook because of the credit losses being suffered by small and medium-sized businesses and a Finnish unemployment rate which now exceeds 18 per cent. A plan to cut 1,500 jobs through 1992 and 1993 should produce annual savings of FM500m, said Mr Voutilainen. The bank planned to sell off some FM3-FM4bn in real estate - about half of its portfolio - to further strengthen its capital base. Mr Voutilainen said KOP, which is merging with STS-Bank, Finland's sixth-largest bank, had made preliminary contact with the state about a possible merger with the Savings Bank of Finland and Skopbank. Unitas, KOP's main rival, abandoned talks to buy Skopbank from the government guarantee fund last October.</p>

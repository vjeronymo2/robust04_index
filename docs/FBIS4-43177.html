			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lena Hennel: "EU Opposition Growing in Yes </F> Stronghold" -- introductory paragraphs in italics as published]    [Excerpts] No to EU [European Union] is holding its  convention in the midst of the stronghold of the yes side. The  clearest support for Swedish membership is found in Scania.    On that point the opinion polls have been unequivocal  so far. It is therefore not a coincidence that the EU opponents  have chosen to flex their muscles precisely in Lund; yesterday  they presented their message during a demonstration, and their  top figure and Scanian Per Gahrton gave a speech. During the  ongoing No to EU weekend, SVENSKA DAGBLADET went to Landskrona  to feel which way the EU wind is blowing.    Landskrona -- In June the ferries will resume crossing  Oresund between Landskrona and Copenhagen, and for the first  time in several years Landskrona residents will be able to take  a return trip to Denmark in about an hour.    The municipality has stepped in as a guarantor for the  traffic, since it is hoped that Danes will be enticed to come  and live on the Swedish side of the sound. Already 50 Danish  families have found a home in the little Scanian town where  rents and taxes are lower than in Denmark.    The nonsocialist municipal government, which took over in  the  last election from the Social Democrats who had governed the  municipal district for 70 years with simple majorities, is  working with determination to tie Landskrona more tightly to  Europe.    "EU is a future opportunity for Landskrona, and membership  could help us solve some of our problems," explains municipal  councillor Inga Jansson, Liberal Party.  <H5>  Has Had a Difficult Time </H5>   The once so prosperous industrial city of Landskrona has had  a difficult time in recent years. The high unemployment began  with the shipyard crisis in the 1980's. Oresundsvarvet was shut  down and 3,000 employees were laid off.    It was a hard blow for a municipal region of 30,000 to lose  that many jobs in one blow. Other industrial enterprises  followed suit and unemployment rose.    But after a long period of pessimism, life is beginning to  brighten for the municipality.    The shipyard is operating once again on a small scale; a new  industrial area is growing up along the E6 highway; Landskrona  BOIS [football club] has managed to climb into the all-Swedish  league after many years; and the Strandpaviljongen dance  restaurant, which burned down last year, has been rebuilt.    The interesting Skanska Teatern recently went bankrupt, to  be  sure, but it is hoped that the activity can be reconstructed.  And -- as was mentioned -- the ferries are beginning to operate  again.  <H5>  Vision of Orestad </H5>   But another push forward is needed; unemployment is still  high and the belief in the future is badly dented. The municipal  politicians and the employers' association are hoping that an EU  membership will supply the longed-for miracle.    Down by the beach, with the back toward Landskrona castle,  built by Christian III in 1549 at the time Landskrona was still  Danish, and with the eyes aimed at Oresund, this area near  Denmark is tangible. The houses of Copenhagen are visible and  the old vision about an Orestad, which was to link Copenhagen,  Malmo, and the municipal regions around them, does not feel  strange.    But now Landskrona's politicians are aiming more toward  becoming a vital part of the Scania-Sealand region. The EU has a  positive attitude toward regional cooperation, and in Scania  many are convinced that Scania-Sealand will be able to compete  with other European regions. [passage omitted]    But his criticism is more serious than that. He fears the EU  will mean that the rest of the world is closed off from Europe.  "We should trade with the whole world."    He does not believe that the Scanians are more favorable  toward the EU because of their vicinity to Denmark:    "Mind you, it has been 10 years since I have been to  Denmark.  Sure, I have taken trips, gone back and forth with the boat  across the sound and had a beer and a little food. But I have  not gone ashore in 10 years."    On a ladder leaning against one of the beautiful stone  houses  on Queen Street stands Lars Persson cleaning windows. He is one  of those favoring membership in the EU opinion polls.    "Even if there is a lot of nonsense with the EU, we have to  belong. Sweden cannot close itself off," in his opinion.    Retirees Tora Persson and Greta Svensson are walking down by  the harbor, on their way to take the boat to Ven for a day trip  and a picnic. That is something the two friends have done each  spring for the last 20 years. The short boat trip is "just right  for us landlubbers."    They say that they have actually taken a little EU course,  but they do not think they learned much from it. Nevertheless,  the outcome was that EU membership is inevitable.    "We must probably participate. A country as small as Sweden  cannot manage otherwise," says Tora Persson.    Greta Svensson has not detected any brightening for  Landskrona. It is only the municipal politicians who want it to  look that way, she believes.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / NHS union scorns pressure to curb claim The Royal College of Nursing yesterday became the first health service union to indicate that it would use the pay rise of 4.7 per cent awarded to MPs as a basis for its own next claim. The college, traditionally one of the most moderate of public-sector unions, said it would reject any government attempt in the coming pay review to revive last year's pressure for 'an exceptionally modest increase'. Mr Christopher Cordwell, a senior member of the college's industrial relations team, said on BBC radio: 'Nurses have clearly delivered more productivity by measures the government have themselves set down over the last few years, and we expect that to be noted by the review body. 'The Royal College of Nursing has no problem with MPs being properly rewarded, but against such a background, what we don't expect is the government to repeat the pressure it exerted on the review body last year.' Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said it was unfair for MPs to be awarded pay rises well above the rate of inflation while workers in the public sector were expected to show restraint. He said on BBC radio: 'If they are going to make these silly rules let them keep them themselves.' Doctors will step up opposition to proposals for performance-related pay in the National Health Service at a special conference in London tomorrow, Alan Pike writes. The British Medical Association has called representatives from every hospital in the country to the meeting. They are due to discuss an issue that is bringing the medical profession into renewed confrontation with the government. Ministers have said a shift from the NHS's centralised pay structure to locally determined performance pay must start this year. Mr Alan Langlands, NHS chief executive, has written to local managers of hospitals and other services telling them to prepare plans for the change by October, and have local machinery in place by February. The BMA regards the timetable as 'impractically short' and the principle of performance pay as 'totally inappropriate to the work of the medical profession'. A BMA briefing paper, circulated to its local negotiating committees in advance of the conference, says that performance-related pay for hospital doctors would lead to increased emphasis on financial objectives, resulting in a greater focus on the number of patients treated rather than the quality of care.</p>

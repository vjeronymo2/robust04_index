			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sun editor defends behaviour of the press THE EDITOR of Britain's biggest-selling daily tabloid, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie of The Sun, emerged defiant yesterday from a two-hour encounter with the national heritage committee investigating privacy and media intrusion. Mr MacKenzie told the committee chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for Manchester Gorton, that the press was better behaved now than at any time he could remember, adding: 'There has never been a time when the press is liked by the sort of people who sit on a committee like this.' The editor, who admitted to misdemeanours in the past, said: 'We only publish the truth now and you can't do better than that.' Mr MacKenzie told MPs: 'We are not going to change our news judgments just because parliament does not like what it reads in The Sun.' He defended the paper's recent coverage of the royal family, saying many of the stories involved public figures and had been widely published abroad. And he warned MPs that American-style privacy laws, which apply to private citizens, would not necessarily apply to the royal family. Every member of his staff had to observe the code of conduct operated by the Press Complaints Commission, he said, and he was now writing to all Sun freelances to make it clear they were subject to the code as well. Mr MacKenzie was followed by Mr Colin Webb, editor-in-chief of the Press Association news agency and a former deputy editor of The Times, who in an unflamboyant way said that the present system of self-regulation was working well. There was a greater awareness now than he had ever known in his 35 years as a journalist 'of the need to set and maintain standards and codes of conduct'. Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP who is backing legislation to require mandatory corrections for inaccurate news reporting, said yesterday he was prepared to accept amendments that would promote press freedom. His bill, which is opposed by the government, will be debated by MPs next Friday. Mr Soley said there was a vacuum in controls over the press. He proposes a statutory Independent Press Authority. But he said the IPA could also have a role in strengthening press freedom - by reviewing secrecy legislation, for instance. With the government proposing legislation on privacy which could restrict the media, clear rights to press freedom were more important, he said.</p>

Screening or Threshold Factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of concern by many commenters that CV surveys may be undertaken in damage cases where expected damages may be too small to justify the costs of the CV survey, the Department is seeking comment on the concept of a screening factor that trustee officials should apply in deciding whether to conduct a CV survey of nonuse values in a particular case. Factors currently limiting the use of CV include the high costs of surveys to meet NOAA's proposed standards, trustee budget and staff limitations, and trustee desire for speedy judgment to enable expeditious restoration activities. To employ an additional screening factor, expected damages might be estimated using a small sample with protocols designed to minimize survey costs and, therefore, not necessarily subject to the standards contained in NOAA's proposed rule. Alternatively, expected damages might be estimated by scaling damages estimated in other CV studies. Other methods may be possible. Several possible thresholds have been suggested. These possibilities include setting the threshold for a particular case at the greater of twice the expected cost of a full CV survey or the product of multiplying $5 per household by the number of households expected to hold nonuse values for the resource of concern. The Department is specifically seeking comment on: Whether such a screening factor would be appropriate; what form a factor might take; whether the factor should apply to total damages or only to lost nonuse values; and whether inclusion of a screening factor is consistent with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision upholding the inclusion of all reliably calculated values in a damage assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Technical Information Document <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department intends to work with NOAA and other interested agencies to develop a guidance document on use of CV. This document will provide additional technical information on possible means of satisfying any standards contained in the damage assessment regulations as well as other issues involved in conducting CV studies. Once a draft of the document has been prepared, the Department will publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing its availability and soliciting comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department requests comments on additional tests for determining the reliability of CV estimates for possible inclusion in the technical information document. In order to evaluate any additional tests, the Department requests that commenters provide a complete list of the behavioral assumptions underlying their theoretical framework of rational choice. The Department assumes that commenters will begin with what economists consider to be the generally accepted axioms of neoclassical consumer choice theory or revealed preference theory. The Department requests that commenters clearly state all further assumptions underlying the test and describe the sensitivity of the test's results to the assumptions presented. Second, if commenters are proposing tests that rely on marginal or infra-marginal changes in the scope of the injuries, the commenters should describe how the variation of scope dimensions involved in the test would be quantified. Third, and perhaps most important, the Department asks that commenters explain how any proposed test can be accomplished feasibly within the survey instrument design and development and survey administration standards specified in NOAA's proposed rule. Tests causing CV surveys to violate these standards are themselves unreliable tests. Fourth, the commenter should give examples of how these tests would be structured in the context of a hazardous substance release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, commenters have expressed concern about the valuation of past nonuse losses. The Department believes that when little time has elapsed since the occurrence of a nonuse loss, trustee officials might conclude that CV respondents' WTP is not likely to have changed significantly. On the other hand, in cases where a great deal of time has elapsed since the occurrence of the nonuse loss, determination of WTP becomes more problematic. Therefore, the Department is soliciting comment on methods for estimating nonuse values lost over a significant amount of time for possible inclusion in the technical information document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Response to Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received numerous comments on the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. The Department appreciates the time and effort expended by the commenters. This notice discusses only those comments concerning the assessment of lost nonuse values or the use of CV. All other comments submitted on the July 22, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice are addressed in the notice of final rulemaking to revise the Department's type B rule, which was published on March 25, 1994. 59 FR 14261.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

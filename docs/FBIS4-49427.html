			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- After being briefed on  the preparations of the fourth Chinese art festival, Li Tieying,  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and state  councillor, pointed out recently that the art festival must be  brilliant but economical, and that it must have special  characteristics. He said the spirit of reform should be  displayed in finding a way to make the festival a success, to  promote culture and art, and to expedite economic development  and social progress in all fields.    Chairing a meeting held on 21 March to study and coordinate  preparations for the fourth Chinese art festival, Li Tieying was  briefed by the Ministry of Culture and the Gansu Provincial  People's Government on the preparations for the festival. Li  Tieying said: Each and every art festival must have its special  characteristics, otherwise it will be dull. While we have  national sports meets, we also should have art festivals. Both  are important, and the two are similar in terms of sizes and the  ways they are held. While proceeding with economic  modernization, we must also expedite cultural and art  development. We must attach importance to achieving a unity  between artistic effects and economic results, making sure that  the festival will help local economic development. While there  should be performances staged by professional artists, there  should also be cultural and art activities of the masses, as  well as popular shows, so that the involvement of the masses  will inspire them and boost their morale. While emphasizing  Chinese culture, the festival should also pay attention to  promoting international exchange so that the festival will  become an arena for promoting friendship and contacts between  China and the rest of the world, and so that the festival will  reflect its objectives of promoting prosperity, solidarity, and  progress.    Li Tieying stressed: We should sum up our previous  experiences in holding festivals and sports meets, such as the  good experiences which Guangxi and Yunnan have respectively  gained in holding the sports meet of minority people and the  third Chinese art festival. We can also follow the experiences  of foreign countries. Anything we do today needs money, but we  cannot count on the state to take care of everything. Thrift is  one principle we must follow in carrying any public projects.  We cannot afford not to economize when holding nationwide  projects. We cannot go on to launch these projects if they have  become increasingly expensive. We must encourage people to work  as volunteers. Only when more people are involved will there be  greater social results. Li Tieying hoped the art festival will  be held more successfully on the basis of summing up previous  experiences.    Li Tieying urged relevant departments of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council to work with greater  coordination, support all festival projects, and help solve  problems so that the art festival not only will be a success  itself, but will also expedite reforms and development in Gansu  and northwest China.    The fourth Chinese art festival, which is scheduled to take  place in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu, from 18 to 28 August 1994,  will be sponsored by the Ministry of Culture with support from  the Gansu Provincial People's Government and the Foundation for  Chinese Art Festival. The theme of the forthcoming art festival  is: Solidarity, Reform, Prosperity; Bringing Together the Best  of Art, and Fostering the National Culture. The general  guideline for the art festival and its specific projects have  been basically determined, and all preparations have started.    Chen Changben, vice minister of culture; Sun Ying, deputy  secretary of the Gansu Provinciall Party Committee; and Chen  Yiling, vice governor of Gansu, briefed Li Tieying on the  preparations for the fourth Chinese art festival. Comrades in  charge of relevant departments under central and state organs  were present at the meeting.    The meeting also studed the problems encountered during the  preparations and came up with some solutions.</p>

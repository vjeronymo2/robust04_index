			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares unhurt by rights issue fears THE UK stock market moved confidently yesterday into a week which will be featured by important data on the UK economy as well as by trading statements from a number of Britain's leading companies. While trading levels remained unexciting, the blue chip stocks made further progress and support for the second line issues took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index near to its peak again. The stock market's satisfaction with its progress towards the middle of its current trading range was undimmed by the general expectation that today may bring a rights issue from British Airways in the Pounds 500m-plus range, perhaps accompanied by fund-raising in the brewery sector. Nor did the market seem unduly dismayed by suggestions in the weekend press that the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, published today, will argue strongly against any cut in base rates by its political masters. The focus of attention this week is likely to be the disclosure on Thursday of the latest statistics on UK unemployment, earnings and wage costs. After drifting down in early trading to test the Footsie 2,840 area, the market then steadied and, helped by a squeeze in stock index futures, climbed steadily throughout the rest of the session. But the big players were mostly on the sidelines. The UK market was driven for much of the day by demand for blue chip pharmaceutical stocks as the prolonged cloud thrown over the sector by worries about the Clinton administration's plans for US medical care was lifted somewhat by recommendations by a leading New York investment bank. Trading in both sides of the new ICI group continued as fund managers position themselves ahead of the formal demerger on the first day of June. Among the domestically orientated of the London market, retail and store shares found buyers as sector analysts began to look for good news on the progress of the UK economic recovery when Marks and Spencer, the leading high street retailer, reports progress today. Although checked by a slow opening on Wall Street, where the Dow Average was about two points off in London trading hours, the UK market closed very near the best level of the day. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,858.1 for a gain on the day of 11.1 points. The index has been at 2,867 in the past week in a trading range believed to extend to around 2,980. Seaq volume dipped to 533.7m shares from the 620m recorded on Friday, when retail business remained just above the Pounds 1bn mark now seen as the market's daily norm. At these volume levels, London's stockbrokers are finding comfortable profits, while marketmakers also have room for manouevre. Non-Footsie business, boosted by heavy activity in a new issue stock, constituted around 66 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total, against daily averages of around 62 per cent. From today, the Financial Times will be progressively changing the way it calculates price/earnings ratios in the London Share Service pages to make use of the earnings formula devised by a sub-committee of the Institute for Investment Management &amp; Research (IIMR).

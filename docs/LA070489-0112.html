The couple and their two teen-age children  escaped unharmed.  </P> <P> Arson investigators and the Phongpharniches said they did not believe there was  a link between the arson and the couple's religious activities.  </P> <P> Pachri (Pat) Phongpharnich, who came with her husband to Southern California  from Thailand 22 years ago, described herself as a Buddhist priest who uses the  religious title "Rev. Man Hsi." She said she holds weekly meditation meetings  at the house and at other homes in the San Fernando Valley.  </P></p>

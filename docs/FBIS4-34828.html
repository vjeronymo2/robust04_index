			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government does not take responsibility for the  financial crisis the nation is experiencing, because, according  to Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, OCI [Central Information Office]  director, the Executive Branch does not have a major say in  decisions made by the Banking Superintendency and the Central  Bank of Venezuela.    In his statements, which were motivated by the proposed  censure vote against Finance Minister Julio Sosa, Alvarez  Bajares said that the responsibility falls on the Congress,  because the government's legal actions, which are very well  defined, exclude it from making such decisions. Regardless of  whether the parliament approves the appointment, it is the  president who appoints candidates to head these organizations.    In the opinion of the OCI director, government officials are  not implementing decisions of the Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and  Banking Protection Fund], Banking Superintendency, and Central  Bank of Venezuela. As a result, contradictions appear in each of  these institutions. He admitted that the situation is difficult  to manage. Even though the decision to subsidize the banks was  made at a cabinet meeting and subsequently sent to the Congress  for its approval, Alvarez Bajares insisted that the problem  belongs to the political parties that approved the subsidies and  now criticize the situation.    [Begin Alvarez Bajares recording] Except for the [words  indistinct] management problem it has inherited and its attempts  to mitigate the resulting social effects, the government has  little responsibility for management as far as a decisions made  on specific issues are concerned. The government does not manage  monetary policy, it does not manage the amount of subsidies  granted to banks, and it does not manage or control bank  operations.    The OCI minister reiterated that the government does not  necessarily agree with policies adopted until now; it is just  the contrary. The government objects to the high interest rates,  among other things, but this policy is not the responsibility of  the Finance Ministry, he noted.</p>

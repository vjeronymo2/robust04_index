			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Verk: "Interests Will Decide Everything: </F> Parliament in Cross-Section"]    [Text] Only the indolent, perhaps, have not made  forecasts concerning today's event--the commencement of a  professional parliament. The future of an "appendage" of the  executive and pocket body or, on the contrary, a "nest" of the  opposition, which for precisely this reason will shortly be  "ravaged," has been predicted for the new corps of deputies. A  grain of sense could, if so desired, be found in each of the  adduced viewpoints. Nonetheless, we will venture to make one  further forecast: The new parliament will be by no means a  monolithic fifth column of the ruling state bureaucracy. It may  with substantial reason be called an arena of the confrontation  of group interests. And the country's future will, perhaps,  depend on whoever gains the upper hand.    The past 70-plus years were marked by the consistent  realization of the interests of a group of high-ranking party  bureaucrats within a strict ideological framework. A vigilant  eye was kept on the permanency of this framework by the powerful  and well-oiled administrative-command machine--the CPSU. With  the disintegration of the Soviet Empire new "interest groups"  began to appear--primarily the national bureaucracy. Although  today it is the interests of this group which are being realized  the most fully, it aspires to enshrine this process and make it  irreversible. It is this that explains to a considerable extent  the attempts, first, to shape a single national ideology of  "market reforms in the name of the prosperity of Kazakhstan" (we  recall if only the birth of the SNEK [Union of People's Unity of  Kazakhstan] in February 1993) and, second, to legitimize its  power (the self-dissolution of the former parliament--a "result  of the totalitarian past"--and the elections of a new one).  Analyzing the events of the end of the last and the start of the  present year, it may be affirmed that the sponsors of the  process of the "renewal" of the legislature have not at this  stage achieved their goals.    In this context the new parliament should be regarded as a  kind of patchwork canvas, each "patch" of which is endeavoring  to pull over to its side the whole "blanket." After all that has  been said, it remains to analyze each fragment of this canvas  individually.    It is impossible in a single newspaper article, of course,  to  take account of all the factors influencing the correlation of  forces in the corps of deputies (national, religious, clan, and  so forth). The observations offered here are merely an attempt  to distinguish the main political and economic interests which  will, possibly, determine the strategic course of the new  parliament.  <H5>  Corps of Directors of State-Owned Enterprises </H5>   It has an objective interest in economic upturn, economic  and  political integration in the CIS, in securing guarantees of  preservation of its social status in the event of a cancellation  of the contract with the state, and in a share of the profit in  the enterprises it manages and also in the stability and  efficiency of legislative instruments. It is not interested in  the proposed plan of privatization, and the majority are  opponents of the new economic structures. For a number of  reasons it frequently acts as a brake on the structural  reorganization of the economy. In its endeavors it frequently  relies on the work force of the enterprises.    The upper part of the corps could be temporarily neutralized  by the transfer of part of the block of shares in the  privatization process. But there will be no long-term  neutralization inasmuch as the economic recession rules out  tangible dividends on the stock and is reducing considerably the  value of the block itself. The transition to a contract system  of the hire of enterprise managers, the venture remuneration of  their labor, and a guarantee of the acquisition of part of the  block of shares of the enterprise upon fulfillment of the terms  of the contract would make it possible to realize the interests  of the said group sufficiently fully. The anticipated strength  of the parliamentary lobby is approximately 25 persons.    It is the corps of directors (more precisely, the group  lobbying for its interests and consisting of deputies who have  entered parliament from large industrial structures and also  from the scientific and technological milieu) which could in  principle be an ally of the "irreconcilable" parliamentary  opposition composed chiefly of deputies of the former parliament  and novices elected from the opposition parties and movements.  Both have an interest in the realization of an "intelligent"  anticrisis program and, most important, in a reorientation of  the present privatization strategy. But their ultimate goals are  fundamentally different. The "irreconcilables" are preoccupied  with an improvement in the political and socioeconomic  atmosphere in the country and, ultimately, with an upturn in  society's living standard. The corps of directors has an  interest primarily in the political and economic defeat of the  "holding company barons," who have seized the initiative in the  control of the economy.    Nonetheless, it is the efforts of the directors' lobby in  parliament that could create a legislative base limiting to a  considerable extent the appetites of the national-state  bureaucracy and placing the executive within the strict  framework of the law.  <H5>  Administration Chiefs </H5>   A process of federalization of the state is actively under  way in Kazakhstan, in an unlawful form, it is true. There are  more than sufficient prerequisites for this process. The  inevitable flow of command authority from the ministries to the  administration chiefs has led to a redistribution of real power  between the higher (central) and local bureaucracies in favor of  the latter. It is its interests, which are today being realized  unlawfully, that will be partially legalized by the new  parliament in a brutal struggle with the representatives of the  central bureaucracy.    "Political relaxation" of the strict dependence on the  president, decentralization of the state budget, a diminution in  the role of the cabinet of ministers and other central  structures in the management of state property, and a reduction  in the powers of the local representative authorities, control  powers primarily, are in the interests of this group.  Realization of these aspirations would enable the chiefs to  acquire political hegemony with all the ensuing consequences in  the sense of privatization of property. This group has a sizable  lobby in the Supreme Council, on the official slate included.  The chiefs are not interested in the establishment of a regime  based on the rule of law but would support with pleasure the  demands for strict supervision of the activity of the cabinet.  They are objective supporters of the concept of a strong  regional policy. As of today this is one of the most influential  groupings, whose financial possibilities and degree of freedom  are very substantial and growing constantly. The anticipated  size of the parliamentary lobby is approximately 40 persons.  Considering what has been said above, it may be assumed that the  deputies from the ranks of the former chiefs and the figures  close to them will play in the new parliament the part of Trojan  Horse. People who in terms of their former status were duty  bound to be loyal to the president will embark with particular  zeal on attacking the government (which under our conditions  means an indirect blow at the head of state). At the same time,  on the other hand, the deputy-chiefs will be the principal  obstacle to the "irreconcilables" in the latter's aspiration to  consolidate the corps of deputies on all-Kazakhstan interests.  It is by the efforts of the chiefs' lobby that parliament could  begin a gradual drift down the stream of regionalism (which,  incidentally, is feared in earnest at the upper levels of power).  <H5>  State Bureaucracy </H5>   Not only part of top government officialdom but also the  majority of bank "generals" and the top leadership of the  holding companies, concerns, and so forth may be attributed to  this group. They are represented in parliament by part of the  official slate and also the party factions of SNEK and the  People's Congress. The continued centralization of the executive  up to and including its "absolutization" is in the interests of  this group. They will aspire to the maximum limitation of  parliament's control functions, remembering the lessons of the  Control Chamber of the former Supreme Council. It is most  probable that this group will enjoy the tacit support of the top  executive structures, including the top persons of the state.  Nor is it ruled out that it is they that will try to obtain (and  will obtain) a majority in the key parliamentary committees  (primarily those in charge of the economy and finances), having  supplanted the representatives of other groups. In this case  hopes of intelligent opposition to the government's present  economic policy are not destined to be realized. The anticipated  strength of the parliamentary lobby is from 30 to 50 persons.  <H5>  Middle Class </H5>   The group with substantial capital, but lacking a sure  outlet  to power, is the one the worst represented in parliament. For  this reason the middle class has in practice been sidelined from  the redivision of property and, consequently, will lose more  than it gains as a result of official policy. It is represented  in parliament by deputies from the unions, the middle and petty  commercial structures, and certain social and political  formations. The establishment of a truly democratic, law-based  regime, a strengthening of market institutions, and the  assurance of tax and other privileges for the producer and,  ultimately, a rise in the living standard of as large a part of  society as possible are in their interests. Proceeding from  this, we may forecast a direction of their parliamentary  activity aimed at limitation of the omnipotence of the  "executants," fair privatization, and a broadening of the  political and social opportunities of all members of society.  Aside from all else, it is the middle class that is capable,  given support on the part of other social groups, of really  effecting a structural reorganization of the economy consonant  with the aims of the "irreconcilables" and the corps of  directors. Consequently, the lobbyists of this group could count  on the support in parliament of all the above-mentioned groups,  other than the state bureaucracy and the administration chiefs.  In addition, the middle class has in the new corps of deputies  potentially outstanding leaders. If this leadership acquires  real outlines, the forecasts concerning the  constructive-opposition character of the new parliament would  seem reasonably justified. We have thus logically approached a  problem of extreme importance for this corps of deputies--the  candidacy of the speaker.  <H5>  Speaker </H5>   In the context of present-day political realities there is  no  doubt that the person who occupies this seat will find himself  in a difficult situation. If he fully supports the official  course (primarily in the sphere of privatization), conflicts  with the interests of the majority of parliamentary groups and,  thus, the emergence of a parliamentary crisis "from within" are  inevitable. Many observers are inclined to use this to explain  the rumors that have arisen as of late concerning the refusal of  the "big house" to take a chance on Kuanish Sultanov, whose  candidacy was even recently seen as being a sure thing,  virtually. The former vice premier himself, it would seem, is  sincerely convinced of the soundness of the "reform" policy that  is being pursued. Speaking on the eve of the elections in a  northern oblast, he spoke about the reasons for the crisis as  being objective and independent of the government and the  president, from which it followed that struggle against the  crisis was a secondary preoccupation. "The main thing today is  privatization," Mr. Sultanov declared. And although this logic  coincides in principle with the precepts of the top persons of  the state, they have to understand that the aspiration of the  leader of the SNEK to be "holier than the pope" would hardly  meet with understanding on the part of the present deputies. In  addition, account needs to be taken of the manifestly negative  image of the SNEK, which was merely reinforced in the period of  the election campaign.    Olzhas Suleymenov could be named in this category also, but  he could be hampered by problems of a linguistic nature: the  speaker must, according to the constitution, know the official  language. In addition, the speaker must have a grasp of the  economic situation, which the leader of the Kazakhstan People's  Congress clearly lacks. But if Mr. Suleymenov decides, for all  that, to let his name go forward, he could "draw off" onto  himself the votes of some of the deputies, exerting a  considerable influence on the final result.    Some people are inclined to speak seriously about the  candidacy of Abish Kekilbayev, former state counselor, who  acquired certain political capital on the Aral problem. But this  figure, many informed people believe, enjoys far more support in  his native west than here, in the south. And the positions of  the southerners in this parliament are quite strong.    Particular meaning has come to be invested as of late in the  "foothills" of the political Olympus in the mentions of Umirbek  Dzholdasbekov--former dean of the Kazakhstan State University  and president of the Engineering Academy. To his credit are,  first, successful activity, in the view of some people, as dean  and, second, a correct (from today's standpoints) line of  behavior in December 1986. At the same time, on the other hand,  his role in the successful "self-dissolution" of the former  Supreme Council is well known (to be persuaded of this it is  sufficient to take a look at the stenographic accounts of the  final sittings of the 11th Session). Mr. Dzholdasbekov was not  only a member of the so-called 11-man "action committee" but was  also an active inspiration behind and conductor of all its  undertakings--together with Zamanbek Kurkadilov and his  ilk--former corps of deputy colleagues. And at the sitting on 10  December he even delivered the report on the draft law on  delegation of the powers of the Supreme Council to the  president. It is notable that prior to this the academician had  spoken at the sessions quite infrequently, and on matters of  procedure, more often than not. Old-timers recall just two  exceptions: the impassioned monologues of "Uncle Dzho" during  discussion of the coat of arms (1992) and the government awards  (1993). In the first instance, what is more, the member of  parliament favored the central component of the attribute of  statehood with a comparison with an intimate part of a lady's  attire....    According to the latest information, Mr. Dzholdasbekov  recently assembled the Alma-Ata [Almaty] deputies and persuaded  them to support the draft law "Legislative Assembly of the  Republic of Kazakhstan" containing a provision concerning a  bicameral parliament. Although not long before this, at a  meeting of the working group preparing the agenda, it was  declared that this bill would not be put to the session. It is  perfectly probable, however, that it will, for all that, surface  at a plenary sitting in the very near future. In any event, a  high-ranking government official communicated to your author the  perfectly realistic prospect of such a development of events. In  his opinion, there is behind this the endeavor of backstage  "scriptwriters" of the parliamentary performance to "decapitate"  the corps of deputies according to the principle: two heads,  hence, none. And to thereby exclude the possibility of the  arrival on the captain's bridge of a powerful politician of an  opposition persuasion. Gaziz Aldamzharov, cochairman of the  Socialist Party, for example, who is known for his  uncompromising position in the office of chairman of the Control  Chamber of the former Supreme Council. Despite all the apparent  ease of this maneuver, it turns on the need for an amendment to  be made to the constitution, and the consent of two-thirds of  the corps of deputies is necessary for its revision. Obtaining  the latter would seem highly problematical inasmuch as the  majority of deputies would easily read behind the prospect of  their division into two chambers the artless scenario of a  counterpoise of the parts of the corps of deputies to one  another, which would signify a blocking of the legislative work  of parliament and its virtual loss of control functions.  Observers do not rule out the possibility of the speaker's chair  being taken by a person around whom a majority of the opposition  groupings examined above would consolidate. In this case very  interesting events await us. It is even possible that the  president would be forced to "surrender" to the deputies the  present cabinet. And then, instead of a parliamentary crisis, we  would be witnesses to a government crisis, whose consequences  would be truly unpredictable.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Bosnia Serbs threaten convoys The Bosnian Serbs have stepped up the pressure on the United Nations, saying they would block UN convoys moving through their territory unless they handed over fuel. Peacekeeping commanders said they would refuse to accept such demands. Meanwhile, fighting intensified near Sarajevo in violation of the UN-mandated heavy weapons exclusion zone, which the Vatican announced that Pope John Paul planned to visit on September 8. The chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the UN believed it could guarantee the Pope's security. Despite tensions around the city, UN officials are still trying to broker negotiations to reopen the commercial routes into Sarajevo which the Serbs have closed. The move by rebel Serbs to block convoys comes two weeks after their long-time patron, Serbian-led Yugoslavia, imposed a blockade over their rejection of the latest peace plan.</p>

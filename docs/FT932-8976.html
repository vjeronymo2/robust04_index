			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Distilled essence of Irish - The country's slimmed-down whiskey industry WHEN Alfred Barnard visited Ireland to research his book The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom, published in 1887, he was able to survey 28 licensed distilleries: six in Dublin, three in Cork and ten in Ulster. His job would be considerably easier today - there are just three: Midleton in County Cork, Bushmills in Antrim, both owned by the Irish Distillers Group (a subsidiary of Pernod-Ricard), and Lockes in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath. Lockes is a brave independent venture centred on a mothballed distillery. They only started distilling again a few years ago and I have yet to see any whiskey released under its label. It has been a sad decline and fall for the country which invented whiskey and which remained the favourite until well into our own century. The virtual eclipse of licensed Irish distilling in our own time was intimately linked to the Irish revolution and the turmoil which accompanied the early history of the independent state. By the 1960s the handful of remaining distilleries had become so embattled that it was decided to roll the whole business into one and create the Irish Distillers Group. The next move was to close the stills in Dublin, Tullamore, Cork and Coleraine and transfer their functions to a modern distillery in Midleton. All malt whiskey was to be made at Bushmills on the Antrim coast, Ireland's oldest distillery. Bushmills made its successful blends such as Black Bush by adding Midleton grain whiskey to its own malt spirit. Later they released their highly successful ten-year-old malt. As for the old brands which had previously provided Irishmen with solace at home and abroad, they were now all made at Midleton by deftly juggling a gigantic battery of pot and column stills, which allowed them to imitate the styles which had previously been the responsibility of different sites, recipes and wells. The Irish Distillers found this easier than one might imagine because the country's distilleries had been for the most part urban institutions producing styles of pot-still whiskey. In this they varied considerably from the great Scottish distilleries, where the character of the whisky depended on a number of almost accidental factors, such as trace elements in the water and the shape of the stills. Nor had traditional 'Dublin Pot Still' ever been a malt whiskey. Malt formed part of a cocktail of grains which included rye and oats. This was blended before the mash was made and distilled for whiskey. The grains were dried in sealed chambers so that Irish whiskey was never impregnated with that kippery peat smell so distinctive in Scotch. Irish whiskey was never blended either. Even before 1966 the styles were created in the stills, not by the Scotch method of putting together the produce of different distilleries and then smoothing over the rough edges with a bigger measure of bland grain spirit. The smoothness (some might call it blandness) of Irish whiskey came from distilling the spirit not twice, as in all but lowland Scotland, but three times. This is how whiskey is made today at Midleton, but there is more column-still whiskey made these days than there was in Barnard's time. Barnard had travelled from distillery to distillery noting the continued use of pot stills in most of Ireland's distilleries, in spite of the fact that Aeneas Coffey, the inventer of the super-efficient continuous still, had been an Irish excise man. Today Midleton makes six 'building-block' whiskies: two pure pot still spirits, one of which is 100 per cent malt; two pot and column still blends, one with a majority of pot, the other mostly column still and two grain whiskies. It is these whiskies which are poured in their various permutations into old Bourbon, sherry and rum casks to become Jameson's Paddy's, Power's, Tullamore Dew and a host of less well known names restricted to the home trade. Midleton does not quite have the charm of a Scottish distillery perched above a fast running stream in the mountains of the Highlands or set in the jagged coastline of a Hebridean island; nor does Irish whiskey have the nuances of flavour associated with a great malt, but it is a good drink for all that, and a worthy alternative to blended Scotch. Personally I have always opted for Paddy among the brands on the advice of a medieval historian who told me that he always knew when he had had enough from the map of Ireland on the label: when the level got down to his native Leinster he put down his glass and went to bed. Information: for anyone travelling in Ireland both the Irish Whiskey Corner in Dublin (tel: 07 72 55 66) and the old distillery at Midleton near Cork 021 61 35 94) operate tours and tastings.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Proposals welcomed as 'step in right direction' REACTION FROM members of pension schemes to the Goode committee's recommendations yesterday was generally positive but many felt that the committee had not gone far enough in its proposals to protect scheme members' rights. Mr Bill Rayner, a senior actuary at consultants William M Mercer, said: 'What is proposed is not a revolution but a clarification and extension of present practice via a Pensions Act.' He said the recommendations should force all pension-scheme trustees to adopt best practice - 'which is already followed voluntarily by many but regrettably not by all'. Mr Alan MacDougall, managing director of Pirk, independent investment advisers to pension-fund trustees, welcomed the proposal to enshrine members' representation in law and the requirement on trustees to provide more information to scheme members 'in plain English'. However he said: 'The major disappointment is that there is no clear legal protection for member trustees. Goode is proposing majority voting, so the members will always be in a minority on the board.' The committee has recommended that members should be entitled to appoint at least one third of the trustee board for earnings-related schemes, with the exception of small schemes. Mr MacDougall also said that the central question of who owns pension schemes had been fudged. The Trades Union Congress also said the recommendations fell short on the question of member trustees' representation. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the majority of trustees should be elected from the scheme membership. He also said surplus money should be used to improve members' benefits instead of employers being able to continue receiving refunds of contributions from scheme surpluses. Nevertheless, Mr Monks said the recommendations were a 'welcome step in the right direction' and would help to protect workers' and pensioners' benefits. Mr David Harris, director of Chantrey Financial Services, independent financial advisers, was disappointed that there was no requirement on companies to appoint different auditors to its pension scheme. 'At the moment auditors to the pension scheme are usually also the company's auditors but that can lead to a potential conflict of interest.' He doubted the viability of the compensation board, which will extract a post-facto levy on occupational schemes should another Maxwell-type situation occur. 'I am not sure that this is the way to fund a compensation scheme,' he said. The pensions ombudsman, who arbitrates in disputes, and the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, which deals with public queries and complaints, both welcomed the report.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEESECAKE: RICH INDULGENCES;  </P> <P> THEY'RE DECADENT AND GUILT- LADEN. BUT IN SPITE OF THE HIGH-FAT, HIGH-CALORIE  CONTENT, MOST OF US FIND IT HARD TO RESIST A GOOD CHEESE- CAKE. THESE RICH AND  WONDERFUL DO-AHEAD SWEETS MAKE GREAT HOLIDAY DESSERTS.  </P> <P> Cheesecakes are a built-in guilt trip. Loaded with fat and all the other  no-no's a modern diet decrees be eliminated, cheesecakes are nonetheless almost  the irresistible dessert. Truthfully, it should be illegal for anything to  taste as good as a well-designed cheesecake.  </P> <P> Don't try to fool yourself into thinking that just a thin slice won't be too  fattening. It's a fact of life: A REAL cheesecake, one filled with all those  wonderful rich ingredients that make up its smooth and creamy texture and  flavor, is loaded with calories.  </P> <P> Take that Italian masterpiece, the Neopolitan pastiera, a cheesecake/tart  usually served around Easter. It is a mixture of softened wheat berries,  ricotta, fruits, eggs and flavorings. The ingredients are mostly healthful,  with just a few that could add up to a bit of trouble for someone watching  their cholesterol and fat intake. After all, ricotta cheese certainly isn't  anywhere near as fattening as the cream cheese usually used in cheesecakes. And  just think of all that highly desirable fiber provided by the wheat berries.  </P> <P> So a good pastiera should be the perfect answer for the person looking for a  low-calorie cheesecake, right?  </P> <P> Wrong! It may be lower in calories and fat than many of the ultrarich  cheesecakes that abound in top-drawer restaurants or are made from secret  family recipes that have withstood the test of time, but it is still a totally  decadent indulgence.  </P> <P> And that's just how one should view a cheesecake -- as a rich indulgence. One  that is either worth the guilt trip it causes, or isn't. The decision is yours.  But if you're going to sample one of these creamy desserts, enjoy it. Put your  conscience in your pocket, savor every bite and make up for your lapse of  fortitude the next day.  </P> <P> With the holidays soon to be upon us, a cheesecake can be a good choice for a  festive dessert. They have that one looked-for attribute that every frantic  cook needs; they can, indeed must, be made ahead. And by and large, most  cheesecakes go together quickly and easily.  </P> <P> One exception to this rule is a very special pastiera from La Mela, a small  storefront-type restaurant on Mulberry Street in the Little Italy section of  New York City. Nancy Zaslavsky, a Los Angeles-based graphics designer, talked  about La Mela at a dinner party one night and urged me to pay it a visit the  next time I was in New York. So I did, and quickly discovered that the moment  you finally get a table in the place you can forget about ordering what you  want. Mimmo or Pepi, both ebullient hosts, immediately take you in hand and  bring you what they think you need. It sounds dicey, I know, but the meals I've  had there and those served to equally startled diners at tables near us each  time were wonderful examples of good, simple Neopolitan food.  </P> <P> The pastiera was memorable and Pepi gladly shared the recipe. Unfortunately one  of the ingredients turned out to be a major problem. Pepi's recipe called for  "grain wheat," which we finally discovered is really whole wheat berries. But  ordinary wheat berries really don't produce a satisfactory end result. Finally,  we got the answer to our problem from two excellent sources. Albert Vera of  Sorrento, a well-known Italian deli on Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, told  us he carries what we needed under the name "peeled wheat grain." Sorrento has  the product most of the time.  </P> <P> Still another source, Carlo Middione, in his book "The Food of Southern Italy"  (William Morrow, $25), explains that the whole-wheat berries used in this  Italian dessert should be the berries of soft spring wheat. Otherwise the  berries will harden a day or so after the pastiera is made. He suggests that  you can get good results when soft spring wheat berries aren't available by  substituting cracked wheat or even barley. We haven't tried his substitutions,  but they should work.  </P> <P> If a more traditional cheesecake appeals to you, some of California's top chefs  and good home cooks have shared their recipes with us also. Joachim Splichal,  who with his wife, Christine, recently opened Patina on Melrose Avenue, gave us  an elegant recipe for a cheesecake made with hazelnuts and brown sugar and  topped with a crispy filo and almond crust. This is one of those desserts  that's almost too pretty to cut into.  </P> <P> Jim Dodge, author of the award-winning cookbook "The American Baker" (Simon  &amp; Schuster: $24.95), gave us a recipe for a wonderful cheesecake made with  ricotta and encased in a tender, flaky crust.  </P> <P> Still other professional chefs who have shared cheesecake recipes with us are  Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger of City Restaurant. These two well-known  young chefs and authors of the cookbook "City Cuisine" (William Morrow, $19.95)  gave us a recipe right in line with the season as it combines pumpkin with  cream cheese and flavors the mixture with pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and  ginger juice. The result is ideal for a Thanksgiving dessert.  </P> <P> One recipe that came our way, Grandma Elsie's Cheesecake, was shared by fellow  Times staffer Amy Klein, who told us that she has to bake it for her father's  birthday every year. "He can eat one-fourth of the cake in a sitting," she  said, "and we all wait for his arteries to clog while he does it."  </P> <P> And for those who hanker for cheesecake but really can't manage the calories or  fats found in the real thing, we've included a recipe for Cherry Cheesecake, a  light cheesecake-style dessert that boasts considerably fewer calories and fats  than most cheesecakes.  </P> <P> LA MELA'S PASTIERA  </P> <P> 1/2 pound peeled wheat grain  </P> <P> 2 quarts milk  </P> <P> 1 pound ricotta cheese  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups sugar  </P> <P> 5 egg yolks  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> 1 cup golden raisins, plumped in boiling water and drained  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped citron  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped candied orange peel, optional  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon orange flower water  </P> <P> Soak wheat in large mixing bowl in cold water to cover by at least 1 inch for  24 hours. Drain well, cover again with cold water and soak another 24 hours.  </P> <P> Drain grain well, add milk, bring to boil and cook over medium high heat,  partially covered, about 1 1/2 hours or until grain is very tender. Drain well,  discarding any remaining milk and place grain in large mixing bowl.  </P> <P> Add ricotta and sugar and blend until smooth. Beat eggs yolks until frothy and  add to mixture, blending well. Stir in vanilla, raisins, citron, orange peel  and orange flower water.  </P> <P> Spoon mixture into greased 9-inch square baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees 50  minutes to 1 hour or until wood pick inserted in center comes out clean. If  cake seems to be browning too much, cover top loosely with sheet of foil.

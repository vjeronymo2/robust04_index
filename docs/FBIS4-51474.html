			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Has Clinton's Delinking Policy Shown?"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Clinton announced yesterday his  decision on renewing the most favored nation trading status for  China for another year and abandoning his policy of linking  trade issues with human rights. This delinking policy is the  beginning of a change in U.S. policy toward China and will be  helpful in strengthening and expanding bilateral cooperation in  economic relations and trade and the vigorous economic  development in Asia-Pacific region, and promoting understanding  and ties between peoples of the two countries.    The Chinese Government was the first to set out separation  of  human-rights issues from the MFN trading status. At first, the  U.S. Government did not accept it, while believing that the  linking policy was the most powerful weapon to add pressure on  China, assuning that China, to acquire MFN status, would  inevitably make concessions to the tough pressure from U.S.  intervention in China's internal affairs. Tremendous changes in  the world situation have taken place over the past five years as  well as in China's economic strength. Among the world  industrial powers, the United States is the only one that  continues to intervene in China's internal affairs by means of  human rights, whereas other countries have expressed their  position on the need to separate human rights and economy;  consequently, the United States has found itself isolated from  its allies. At the same time, owners of some 100 largest U.S.  firms share the belief that China is a huge market, and they  wrote to Clinton demanding a change of the linkage policy.    Still greater changes have taken place in Asia; many  government leaders of Asian countries and regions are unable to  accept the U.S. policy of linking human-rights issues to MFN  trading status. They support extending the MFN trading status  to China without conditions, while criticizing the United States  for jeopardizing free trade. Asian countries believe that  should the United States succeed in intervening in China with  human-rights issues, it would do the same in the rest of Asia.  Failure to extend MFN trading status to China would inevitably  harm the Chinese economy, but Asian countries and regions would  suffer from still greater losses, because the Asian economy is  closely linked to the Chinese economy. When the United States  has dealt with China with human rights as a means, they demanded  Clinton abandon such linking. It is rarely seen that Asian  countries and regions take the Chinese side with a clear-cut  stand. A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust  cause finds little support. Clinton had to review his practice  of forcing China to yield by means of an executive order with  additional conditions. Because Clinton is facing not only  China, but also many allies, he must avoid self-isolation among  Asian countries, the surfacing of anti-U.S. sentiments in the  region, and entering a cul-de-sac.    China is a sovereign country; of course, China will never  obey the executive order of a foreign president.    If Clinton had issued another presidential executive order  with additional conditions, how would the U.S. President get out  of the predicament next year, how would he end the show? That  is a very realistic political issue.    A statesman must inevitably foresee the future, and he must  know others and know himself. Clinton has come to see that  Bush's tactics remain feasible, it is not advisable for the  President to stand up front where there is no leeway to turn  around; that being the case, separation of human-rights issues  from the MFN is the best choice, while discarding the issuance  of another executive order is also a wise measure for protecting  himself from something unfavorable.    Among his cabinet, officials in charge of defense and  national security, as well as the treasury, commerce, and  agriculture are for unconditionally extending MFN trading status  to China, and the Secretary of State has been doing his best to  seek a way to mutual concessions.    How should we account for the surfacing of a delinking  policy  in the U.S. Congress? First, China's national strength is not  to be underestimated. Just like Clinton put it yesterday:  "China is the world's fastest-growing economy; the protection  of U.S. commercial interests is the decisive factor in making  this decision." In addition, "China possesses nuclear weapons,  veto power in the United Nations, and is an important power in  both Asian and world security"; furthermore the two sides share  many common interests, including non-nuclear proliferation on  the Korean Peninsula and environmental improvement.    The second reason is China's success in pursuing a peaceful  foreign policy of independence and taking the initiative in its  own hands. Five years ago, nobody expected that peaceful  diplomacy could have scored such tremendous effects. Today,  those who want to isolate China find that the isolated is not  China. Clinton said: The extension of the MFN trading status  "will avoid the isolation of China while making it possible for  us to establish ties and communicate with China." The why China  has won friends lies in the fact that it treats others on an  equal footing, safeguards peace, and refrains from pursuing  hegemonism. However, by no means will China allow foreign  intimidation and accept foreign orders.    The third cause lies in changes in the world situation in  the post-Cold War period, and it is not advisable to maintain  the means of the Cold-War days. Faced with a pluralistic world,  the United States has failed to find solution to many domestic  issues, nor has it been able to settle issues in Somali and  Haiti. The United States must coexist and cooperate in  consultation with China in friendliness to cut back troubles;  only then, will it be possible to realize arrangements for  maintaining U.S. interests. There are all the advantages but no  disadvantages for the United States to cooperate with China.    The fourth cause lies in the fact that if the United States  wants development with a focus on the next century, there is a  need to maintain economic relations with China, who is likely to  become a power in economic relations and trade in the 21st  Century. The United States will lose the Chinese market,  whereas Western Europe and Japan will enter it; as one subsides  here, another will rise, how can the United States maintain its  advantages in the next century? People in the United States  require their government to take the lead in adopting a  pragmatic policy for the U.S. economy.    After all, Clinton does have a long-range view, and has  changed his hegemonist policy toward China; that is an action  worth welcoming. In the second half of this year, a  comparatively pleasing trend is likely to surface in Sino-U.S.  relations.</p>

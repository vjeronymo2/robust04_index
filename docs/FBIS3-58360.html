			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia has affirmed that it supports a Cyprus  solution based on the UN resolutions and criticized Turkey for  repeatedly ignoring UN resolutions calling for the immediate  withdrawal of the occupation troops. The Russian position was  outlined today by Ambassador in Nicosia Boris Zenkov in his  address at a meeting of the Larnaca district Rotary Club.    Russia will never support the establishment of two states in  Cyprus, Mr. Zenkov stressed, and added that Cyprus is too small  to be partitioned. He expressed the hope that there will be  some positive developments this year for a balanced basis for  negotiations in accordance with the Butrus-Ghali ideas and the  confidence-building measures, which, as he put it, should be  considered as a warm-up for a settlement.    Mr. Zenkov further noted that realism should be demonstrated  about a Cyprus solution in the near future, adding that he does  not believe the confidence-building measures will be implemented  easily. He said: Many years will be necessary because of the  long separation of the two communities. Mr. Zenkov also noted  that he had recently informed President Glavkos Kliridhis and  Mr. Rauf Denktas that if a solution is found to the Cyprus  problem, Russia will propose that they be awarded the Nobel  Peace Prize.</p>

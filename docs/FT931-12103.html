			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Property: Radon - the natural gas that can kill in the home  -Five counties have particular problems but there are plenty of ways to head off the potential dangers. Gerald Cadogan explains how TESTS for a natural radioactive gas called radon are being made at 24 houses in my Northamptonshire village and 700 in the surrounding district. Radon increases the chances of lung cancer, but it was almost unknown to most people until quite recently. Is it really a danger? Will it affect the value of your house? What can you do about it? For most of the country, the risk is negligible. You are in slightly more danger if you live in certain areas of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Northamptonshire and Derbyshire. Yet, even in these 'hot' spots, the level of radon can vary greatly between one house and its neighbour. And in 'safe' parts of the country, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) is surprised constantly to find isolated cases of a high radon count. Radon is emitted by the trace levels of uranium that occur in soil and rocks (and bricks and concrete made from them). Fresh air disperses it, but it can accumulate inside a building or down a mine (research into its dangers began with the case histories of uranium miners and scientists in the early days of nuclear physics). When breathed in, it deposits alpha particles in the lungs. Dr Robert Stoddart, senior lecturer in pathology at Manchester university, calls these 'seriously radioactive - an unpleasant form of radiation.' It is, however, only one of many carcinogens. As Stoddart points out: 'We all live in a soup of them, to which we are variably susceptible.' Many things can trigger a cancer - even bracken - and it is hard to point the finger only at radon. The factors that matter are the local geology; how your house is built; and your own body, which might - or might not - proof you against any amount of radon radiation. If you live in or near an affected area, it is sensible to check the level in your house. Ask the NRPB to send you plastic monitors, or your district council to arrange this for you. There is no charge. But remember that radon does harm only through exposure over many years. A holiday in Cornwall is not going to give you cancer. Radon enters houses through cracks in floors and walls. The uranium-bearing granite country of Devon and Cornwall has been known for some time as a hot spot, as is similar terrain in New Hampshire and Sweden. But not all granite is dangerous. Cumbria is safe; and even in Cornwall, where about a fifth of the houses are above what the NRPB calls the 'action level' - when something must be done to reduce the concentration - granite walls and fireplaces do not emit much radon. Now, though, the list of affected areas has expanded to Somerset, Derbyshire and Northamptonshire, with their limestone and sandstone. But Somerset seems rather better off than the other two counties where more than 10 per cent of houses are above the action level in west Derbyshire, and around Northampton and Kettering, In neighbouring north Oxfordshire, NRPB tests have confirmed a local council's soil gas survey which suggested a potential radon problem in some houses. The board estimates that around 100,000 houses in the UK are above the action level, although the problem decreases markedly as you go east. And, luckily, the great conurbations are not in radon zones, although London has its own geological problem of shrinking clay And subsidence. In Wales, there is a slight concentration in Powys; and, in Scotland, at the north-east tip and on Deeside. Perhaps the Queen will put in monitors at Balmoral. The NRPB is making a detailed survey using postcodes to isolate houses in groups of 15 or fewer. It sends two monitors, to be placed in the main living room and main bedroom for three months. On their return, the board analyses the readings, enters them into its data base and informs you. The whole process takes about five months. District councils also are eager to know your readings so they can prepare their own detailed local radon maps (they promise to keep the results as confidential as if they were about HIV). Double glazing and insulation have increased radon levels because they stop the gas dispersing. And it accumulates more in winter, when windows are shut. Open fires, and open windows in upstairs bedrooms (but not downstairs), increase the amount as they pull air upwards through the house. Draughty old houses are an effective antidote; so are those with suspended floors with air circulating beneath. Cellars may increase the amount, as they have a greater area (walls and floors) exposed to the soil. If your floor is solid, you can instal a sump underneath, with pipes and a fan to extract the radon-carrying air and send it up to disperse at roof level. If the floor is suspended, you can seal it (although, if it is wooden, this might increase the chance of dry rot). Improving the ventilation by more air bricks is another option. Or use a fan to blow fresh air into the house (although this is effective only up to two or three times the action level). Try opening more windows downstairs and do not use any extractor fans in kitchens, bathrooms and lavatories. You can also seal unused chimneys and give up open fires (including gas fires that look as if they are burning coal). At the end of all this, repeat the monitor tests to check how successful you have been. Make sure your builder knows about radon. Ask your local authority about (means-tested) house renovation grants, or discretionary repair grants in Scotland; the environmental health officer should be helpful. If you are building in an affected area, the special building regulations for Devon and Cornwall are extended to the other three hot counties from February 1. In the most-affected part of Northamptonshire, this will mean putting a membrane in the floor, joining it to the wall and arranging space for a sump and fan. After a year of living in the new house, it can be tested to see if they are needed. If you are buying in a radon zone, ask the seller for the results of any tests. But do not let radon deter you from the five hot counties. They are marvellous places in which to live. And, as you know the risks, they should not affect the price. The reaper is waiting to scythe us all, anywhere and any time. The Householder's Guide to Radon, from the Department of the Environment, is helpful. Enquiries to Room A518, Romney House, 43 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3PY. The Building Research Establishment, Garston, Watford WD2 7JR, publishes Radon: Guidance on Protective Measures for New Dwellings, at Pounds 8. It includes lists of parishes and maps (obtainable from the BRE Bookshop - 0923-664 444), The BRE also has a Radon hot-line (0923-664 707). The Radon Survey of the NRPB is at Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0RQ.</p>

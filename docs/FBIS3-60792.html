			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 24 Dec (DPA) -- The 17 December ambush  executed by Colombian guerrillas against an Ecuadoran military  patrol--which left 11 soldiers killed, 12 wounded, and two  missing--was aimed at DEA agents. [see previous Terrorism Report  for incident reports]    "We were mistaken for DEA agents," said one of the two  Ecuadoran soldiers who were captured after the ambush by the  "32d column of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  (FARC)" and were released hours later, "when they realized it  was a mistake."    The kidnappers, approximately 30 guerrillas between the ages  of 14 and 20, reportedly said they were mistaken because "this  area is where the DEA mostly operates," in reference to the  Amazon jungle stretch of the Ecuadoran-Colombian border.    At the Putumayo River, seven Ecuadoran military launches  were  ambushed by approximately 200 FARC guerrillas who fled into the  dense jungle where they are being pursued on both sides of the  border.    Press reports on the alleged capture of at least three  Colombian guerrillas has not yet been confirmed by the Ecuadoran  Army, although Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo said on 22  December that "we are following the tracks" of members of the  FARC's "32d Column."    The account of soldier Segundo Chamba reportedly confirmed  reports that FARC guerrillas and drug-trafficking rings linked  to the two largest Colombian cartels are operating jointly in  southern Colombia.    The guerrillas who captured the two Ecuadoran soldiers did  not explain the reasons why they tried to aim their attack  against the DEA, whose agents are reportedly solely involved in  fighting drug trafficking and are not participating in  antisubversive operations.    The day after the attack, Ecuador intensified security along  its border to prevent new guerrilla incursions while the Army  elite forces started to pursue the attackers.</p>

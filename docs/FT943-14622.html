			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Hasbro gives up on Spear Correction (published 14th July 1994) appended to this article. Hasbro yesterday threw in its hand in the battle for JW Spear, the maker of Scrabble, and said it would accept the Pounds 11.50 a share bid from US toy rival Mattel. It described the Pounds 62m offer as 'very generous and above a level which we could justify in business terms'. The decision ends a fierce scrap over Spear, which started when Hasbro launched a 900p a share bid for the company at the end of May. It had held a 26.7 per cent stake since 1990 and had received undertakings from the trustees of some Spear family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake unless a higher offer was received within three working days. After a frantic search for a white knight, Hambro, Spear's merchant bank, persuaded Mattel to launch a rival bid at Pounds 10 a share five minutes before the deadline. Hasbro came back with an Pounds 11 a share offer last Friday, which was topped by Mattel on Monday night. Mr Norman Walker, president of Hasbro International, said: 'Our offer at Pounds 11 per share was a very full one which we are not prepared to increase. We are very pleased at the outcome for all shareholders and will of course realise a substantial gain on our own investment which we made in 1990.' Hasbro bought its original stake at under Pounds 3 a share. The outcome leaves the rights to Scrabble divided between Mattel and Hasbro, which are fierce rivals in the doll market. Hasbro, maker of Sindy, retains the rights to Scrabble in North America, leaving Barbie's creator, Mattel, with the rest of the world. Mattel's victory is particularly sweet for Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. It was appointed by Mattel just six hours before the initial offer had to be launched and completed the task with a few minutes to spare. CORRECTION JW Spear's merchant bank, which handled its successful sale to Mattel, was Barings not Hambros as stated yesterday.</p>

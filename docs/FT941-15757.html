			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: FNFC cuts losses despite commercial lending setback First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 22.8m in the year to end-October 1993, less than half the previous year's deficit of Pounds 57m. The shares responded with a 1p increase to 71p. The group continued to have problems with its commercial lending division, where losses increased from Pounds 19m to Pounds 23.3m. Last November, FNFC took the precaution of issuing a warning that it expected its commercial lending losses to be 'somewhat higher' for 1993 than for 1992. Property losses declined from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 9.6m, but the group's core consumer credit business returned to profit, making Pounds 19.7m after a loss of Pounds 4.6m in 1992. Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman, said that the group's strategy was to build and improve the consumer credit business with its associated insurance products, while managing down its property activities and the commercial lending portfolio. Provision for bad and doubtful debts in commercial lending amounted to about Pounds 20m, following a Pounds 14.2m provision in the previous year. The group said it was taking a 'sterner view' than in 1992. FNFC said it did not expect an annual provision of this scale to be required 'in the foreseeable future', though it admitted that it was difficult to be certain what some of its smaller commercial properties would realise. The group sees the key to profitability in commercial lending as property valuation. Despite the end to the falls in property prices, Mr Mays-Smith said unemployment and fear of unemployment had had a continuing adverse effect on confidence. The board is recommending a final dividend of 1p, following an interim of 0.5p, and an enhanced scrip dividend alternative worth 1.5p. In July, the group agreed a refinancing deal for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed to 107 international banks. The agreement saved it from collapse, but the fees for arranging it are estimated to amount to about Pounds 13m. This is being spread over the life of the bank facilities.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Spenders fail to lift Japanese economy: Steven Butler reports that consumers are becoming more choosy as incomes stagnate THE Japanese consumer's love affair with fast cars, designer suits, and big-screen televisions was supposed to save the Japanese economy from recession. That at least is what government officials were confidently predicting just a few months ago. Like so many other theories about the Japanese economy, however, this one has gently cracked open in recent months under a wealth of accumulating evidence that the Japanese are becoming more and more choosy about when and where they open their wallets. Department store sales are terrible - off 3.7 per cent year-on-year in June  -while car sales fell by 6.2 per cent in the first seven months of the year. The theory that Japanese consumers would keep spending money, in spite of a plunge in stock market prices and land values and a steep drop in corporate profits, seemed to have a sound basis. A structural shortage of labour caused by Japan's low birth rate, it was argued, would keep employment at high levels. With employment and income secure, and debt levels modest, consumers would see little need to trim extravagant spending habits formed during the era of easy money of the 1980s. Strong consumer spending would therefore provide a firm bottom for the economy. In the event, however, Japanese consumers have been cautious with their money because companies are finding ways to limit how much they pay employees, and because jobs, it turns out, may not be so secure after all. According to the Labour Ministry, real wages in the manufacturing sector have declined for much of this year, with May registering a year-on-year decline of 1.1 per cent. Overtime hours were off by 22.8 per cent in May as companies reined back production to clear excess inventories while saving on wage costs. Unemployment has stayed at apparently low levels of just 2.1 per cent. But the unemployment figures do not register the thousands of women who work part time, have been laid off and simply returned to the home. While the statistics show that net jobs continue to be created in the economy, there were 10,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in the second quarter than a year earlier. The pressure so far has been mainly on small companies. The Teikoku Data Bank, a private research company, yesterday said that bankruptcies in July had hit the highest level in five and a half years, with 1,213 companies unable to pay their debts. The level of debts, at Y784bn (Pounds 3.2bn) was also the highest for the year. Teikoku said more than half of the bankruptcies were caused by slow sales. The demise of so many companies, many of which are in mainstream manufacturing industries, inevitably affects consumer spending. A number of large companies, such as Sanyo Electric and Nomura Securities, have announced programmes for gradual reduction in staff and there is mounting anecdotal evidence of early retirement programmes. So far, however, big companies have managed to avoid the layoffs that five years ago drove the unemployment rate up to 3 per cent. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, argues it is only a question of time before salaried employees are affected. Amid fears of an impending labour shortage, companies hired more salaried staff in 1991 than at any time in the last 20 years, boosting full-time employment by 3.1 per cent. With demand sluggish, he argues: 'There is no way companies are going to be able to carry this level of employment.' The element of uncertainty is making consumers cautious. Mr Barker estimates real consumption will grow by 2 per cent, or possibly as little as 1 per cent this year, compared with 2.8 per cent last year and 4.1 per cent in 1990. Salomon Brothers takes a more optimistic view that real consumption is likely to grow by 2.7 per cent this fiscal year. Consumer spending accounts for 57 per cent of national income and private capital investment for 19 per cent. With spending sluggish and investment stagnant, it is plain that only a big boost in government spending can get the economy going again.</p>

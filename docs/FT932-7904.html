			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / British Coal seeks leave to start mine closures BRITISH COAL yesterday asked two High Court judges for a declaration that it can lawfully shut the first 10 mines in its pit closure programme. Lawyers for British Coal argued that correct review procedures had been adopted since the original High Court judgment last December, which ruled the closure proposals unlawful since no proper consultation had been carried out. Mr Nicholas Underhill QC, for British Coal, said the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and Nacods, the pit deputies' union, had already agreed to the closure of Cotgrave and Silverhill pits in Nottinghamshire. British Coal now wanted to shut the remaining eight pits scheduled for early closure, but this had been opposed by the National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods. The pits are Grimethorpe, Houghton Main and Markham Main in the Yorkshire region, Trentham, Parkside, Betws and Taff Merthyr in Midlands and Wales and Vane Tempest in the north-east. Mr Underhill said the unions were wrong in arguing that British Coal had failed to comply with the court's order that consultation procedures should be followed which were substantially the same as the modified colliery review procedure and included some form of independent scrutiny. British Coal had consulted properly, he said. He asked the judges to rule that if closure of the pits went ahead there would be no breach of the order. 'Even if such closure would, as a matter of wording, constitute a breach of the order, British Coal has now complied with its substantive obligations and the order should be discharged,' he said. Mr John Hendy QC, for the NUM, said he could not see on what basis there was jurisdiction for yesterday's application to be made. The hearing would, however, test whether proper consultations had taken place.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Observer: Outsiders While the more fuddy-duddy clearing bankers might frown on Beynon's brass-necked ambition, it is a fact of life that, were it not for outsiders like him, there would be even fewer success stories in British banking. Take Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, the UK's fastest growing general insurance company. He is a computer boffin who spent 11 years in Alexander Howden's back office before joining the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1984. It's no wonder that RBS rewards him so handsomely. He has created a hugely successful business out of nothing. David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink, the soon-to-be floated telephone share-dealing service, is trying to do the same. It wasn't until he broke free from BT in the mid-1980s that his entrepreneurial flair was noticed. In a stockbroking industry where losses are more normal than profits, Jones has created a fast-growing business with operating margins of 40 per cent. Its long-term viability still needs testing in a bear market, but his success to date is impressive.</p>

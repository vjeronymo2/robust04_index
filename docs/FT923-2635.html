			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Loan aid to Brazil coffee growers UP TO Dollars 200m in public loans has been rescheduled as the core of a package of measures announced by the Brazilian government in an effort to alleviate pressure on coffee producers, who are suffering from record low international prices, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo. The package awaits technical approval by the National Monetary Council, expected by the end of the month. Under the plan, producers whose public sector loans came due by April will have their debts rescheduled over five years, with a two-year grace period. Loans due after April will be awarded six-month extensions if prices fall below 85 per cent of a referential price of between Dollars 65 and Dollars 73 per bag (60 kilos). Federal officials rejected a minimum price guarantee scheme defended by, among others, officials in Sao Paulo, a leading coffee growing state.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The second festival of radio and television programs  produced by Voice and Vision centers has opened in the town of  Ziba-Kenar in Rasht Province in the presence of Mr. 'Ali  Larijani, the head of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic  Republic of Iran.    In the festival, which will last three days, 39 selected  news  programs, 31 television programs, 27 music and song programs, 20  radio programs, and 65 other productions relating to graphics,  photography, and posters will be assessed.    At the festival's opening ceremony, Mr. Larijani delivered a  speech in which he said: Holding this kind of festival leads to  the improvement of the cultural standards of our Voice and  Vision colleagues in two respects--the assessment and appraisal  of the year's cultural work and the exchange of experiences.    The head of the Voice and Vision referred to the means by  which the enemies of Islam carry out their cultural onslaught  and to the expansion of satellite broadcasting. He added:  Today, the expansion and increased activity of satellite  broadcasting has become a serious problem for Europeans, because  it will bring about the destruction of their cultural  identities. He went on to say: We are not opposed to the  positive dimensions of satellite broadcasting; we must also  strive toward improving the quantity and quality of our programs  while adhering to our Islamic criteria.</p>

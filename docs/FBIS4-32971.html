			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential  candidate Ernesto Zedillo has invited the other candidates to  hold a debate.    [Begin Zedillo recording] On 24 April, I invited two of the  presidential candidates to a public debate. This debate, held  on 12 May, confirmed my party's commitment to democracy. I  invited them to debate for two reasons. First, I wished to  demonstrate with facts that I believe firmly in the discussion  of ideas among several persons. I am convinced the leadership  that Mexico requires must be based on the best ideas and  programs. Second, I am convinced that my party's proposal is  the best, offers the greatest possibilities of turning the  progress of the national economy into tangible benefits for the  family economy, preserves the attainments that we, the Mexican  people, have reached with so great sacrifices, and proposes the  great social and juridical reform that Mexico demands.    On 12 May, I expressed my interest in holding a debate with  all nine presidential candidates. Today, I wish to formalize  this invitation, which also corresponds to the interests of the  other parties. I propose that we hold this debate as soon as  practicable. The country is entitled to it. The country wishes  to continue these democratic practices. For this reason, I  expect a prompt reply to this invitation. I am extending this  invitation under the same principles and in the same democratic  spirit that guided the first debate. This is to say, that the  nine parties should discuss a format that will guarantee  impartiality, clarity, and equity. Each of the candidates  should be given an equal amount of time. The debate should be  broadcast live by radio and television and a single signal  should be used, which can be picked up and transmitted by all  the stations that so desire.    This debate will meet a demand from every single one of you:  to have better information at the time our votes are cast on 21  August. On that day, all of us should participate in an exercise  in responsibility and knowledge. We all desire a process that  will conclude in peace and harmony, an exemplary electoral  process in the history of our country. I know that we can do  it, provided we are united. Thanks. [end recording]    [Later, this "24 Hours" newscast carries a report that on 7  June the nine presidential candidates will speak during a dinner  traditionally held by newspaper editors to commemorate Freedom  of the Press Day. In a recorded statement, Ricardo Perete,  president of the Association of Daily Newspapers of Mexico  [ADIMEX], says: "It occurred to us to invite the nine candidates  to this important meeting commemorating Freedom of the Press Day  so they can express their views. This will not be a debate.  Each of them will be given five minutes. They will choose  their own topics. They will not be interrupted at all. Yes,  there will be a moderator, who will advise the candidates when  their time is up." Perete adds that the order for the speakers  will be determined by a drawing to be held in the ADIMEX head  office.]</p>

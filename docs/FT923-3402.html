			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives markets provided a good lead yesterday for an equity market already encouraged by the strength of the US dollar, writes Terry Byland. In the stock index sector, the September contract, which expires in a just over a week, traded briskly as dealers continued to roll-over positions into the December contract which will take over as the market leader. Locals, or independent traders, were short of the September contract and their efforts to close positions forced the price higher. September showed a premium of around 10 points to cash at the close; with no fair value premium now standing on the September, last night's quotation represented an acceptable cost-of-carry premium on December. Turnover in traded options increased from 26,448 contracts on Thursday to 35,499 yesterday, with calls registering 19,044. The FT-SE 100 Index option saw a sharp rise in business, recording a total of 16,524 contracts against 10,914. HSBC topped the list of individual stock contracts with 2,210, followed by Glaxo (2,084) as the drug group continued to respond to the trading results.</p>

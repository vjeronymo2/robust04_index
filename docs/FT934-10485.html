			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand brokers DM1bn barter deal with Russia THE Treuhand privatisation agency, and a consortium led by Deutsche Bank and Westdeutsche Landesbank, have arranged a barter and financing package worth DM1bn (Pounds 400m) for the export of east German manufactured goods to the Tyumen region of the Russian Federation. However, the agency and the banking consortium have still to confirm that part of the financing agreement will be guaranteed by Hermes, the German export credit agency which last August suspended credits to the Russian Federation. Under the accord's terms, Tyumen will buy DM200m of goods from eastern German enterprises, while at the same time, it will export oil and other gas products to Germany. The latter will be sold at world market prices. The remaining DM800m of orders from Tyumen, which is anxious to obtain equipment for drilling and transport, will be financed through the consortium. Yesterday, a Treuhand spokesman said there were signs that Hermes would support the deal, which is seen as crucial for reviving links between eastern German manufacturing and the former Soviet Union. The agreement follows a recent visit to Berlin by a trade delegation from Tyumen led by Mr Leonid Roketzky, who held talks with Mr Hans-Georg Pohl, a senior member of the Treuhand's department for trade with eastern countries. The contract, which follows earlier barter deals arranged by the Treuhand with the former Soviet Union, is a welcome boost for east Germany's heavy manufacturing sector which before German unification depended on exports to the countries of eastern Europe and Russia.</p>

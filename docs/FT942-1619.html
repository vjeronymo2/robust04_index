			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at ERF ERF (Holdings), the truck maker, returned to profitability in the second half of last year for the first time since the UK truck market collapsed into recession in 1990. However, it was not sufficient to offset the first-half loss and for the full year to April 2 there were pre-tax losses of Pounds 26,000, compared with Pounds 4.12m. Mr Peter Foden, chairman, said ERF had begun recruiting more workers to allow a 40 per cent rise in output rates over the next three months. The increase is mainly to cater for rising demand in the UK, where the truck market is firmly into recovery after its steepest decline since the second world war. Output is to rise from 10 to 11 trucks a day to 15, with the workforce increasing by nearly 100 to 840. Prospects for continental markets were likely to remain bleak until next year, said Mr Foden. However, ERF expects to receive a boost from the changed political situation in South Africa, where it has an assembly plant. ERF is predicting a rise in demand there of 50 per cent over the next 12 to 18 months. The Cheshire-based company, the UK's last remaining publicly quoted truck maker, made a profit of Pounds 453,000, after interest payments, in the second half. For the full year, losses per share were cut to 4.98p (46.25p) while the proposed final dividend is held at 2p. Gearing was reduced to 44.7 per cent at the year end after peaking at nearly 60 per cent half-way. The latter figure was inflated, however, by the Pounds 2.5m cost of launching new trucks designed for continental Europe and the setting up of a network to sell them. These costs were treated as an exceptional item last time. But the venture could hardly have been worse timed, with continental truck markets declining sharply last year. ERF sold only about 50 trucks on the Continent but in the next few years hopes to capture 1 to 2 per cent of the region's heavy truck market, representing up to 1,000 trucks a year. Turnover rose by 34 per cent to Pounds 149.5m (Pounds 111.7m) with unit sales 20 per cent up at 2,339 (1,942). There was exceptionally high pressure on profit margins as continental truck makers discounted heavily, said Mr Foden.</p>

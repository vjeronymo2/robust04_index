			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 5 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Illegal  transactions and seeking profits at the expense of faith are big  taboos in the business world. The "pirated CD phenomenon" that  has recently become rampant on the mainland is a case of such  business. On this matter, the vice minister of China's Ministry  of Radio, Film, and Television recently stated that China  supports the crackdown on pirating records and audio tapes.  People hope that the mainland authorities will vigorously and  speedily clean up the pirated CD's and not let bad elements ruin  China's national reputation.    The pirating of CD's on the mainland has indeed aroused much  concern. According to an unofficial estimate, there are 25  manufacturers of original CD's in various parts of the mainland.  They have 30 production lines, with an annual production  capacity of 60 million CD's. Some people think this is an  overestimation and that the actual production capacity is under  30 million.    Even by the minimum estimate, the mainland's CD output  exceeds demand. According to statistics, the mainland public  actually owns less than 7 million CD players. Given that three  CD's are purchased for each CD player per year, the annual sales  volume on the mainland market is about 21 million. In addition,  the prices of the mainland's original CD's are on the high side,  often going up to 200 or 300 yuan each. A large proportion of  CD owners can only afford one or two CD's a year. Estimated  this way, about 10 million CD's are sold annually, which is  one-third of the annual production capacity. But pirated CD's,  costing only 20 or 30 yuan each, can be sold in the tens of  millions.    As a result of the excess supply of original CD's, either  the  manufacturer goes bankrupt, or is tempted into illegal pirating.  It is said that some audio industry businessmen from Hong Kong  and Taiwan have spotted the mainland's enormous potential for  manufacturing CD's. They rope in people in charge of CD  factories on the mainland, give bribes to local cadres, and ask  factories to produce pirated audio tapes and CD's semi-overtly.  The reason that some mainland factories knowingly violate the  law is because they cannot resist the temptation of staggering  profits: Each CD brings 10 yuan in processing fees, and if they  produce 3 million a year, they can make 20 to 30 million yuan.  This is a huge profit after the costs, outlays, equipment  depreciation, and management expenses are deducted. Most of the  pirated disks made by such Hong Kong or Taiwan businessmen in  conjunction with mainland factories are for the domestic market.  Some of them are smuggled to Hong Kong and Taiwan for sale or  for reselling to other places. For example, Hangzhou's Huadie  Guang Dian [5478 4308 0342 7193] Company imported Taiwanese  equipment for producing audio tapes last year with a 110,000  pound sterling investment from a Taiwan firm. It produced 1  million pirated foreign music tapes in a year, most of which  were smuggled abroad. Because a foreign firm lodged a complaint  against this company not long ago, the city authorities of  Hangzhou took action and ordered the company to suspend  production and rectify itself. The Taiwan businessmen involved  were also detained for interrogation.    In fact, most pirated audio tapes and disks are for the  mainland market. While original CD's or even audio tapes are  too expensive and slow-moving on the market, pirated ones sell  very well among those in the lower class. With 20 to 50 yuan,  one can buy the CD's of Hong Kong and Taiwan singers and famous  foreign singers. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the record shelves  are packed with audio tapes and CD's of stars from Hong Kong,  Taiwan, and other countries, most of which are pirated copies.  Each tape sells for 20 yuan and a CD only costs 30 to 50 yuan.    Because the International Federation of Producers of  Phonograms and Videograms (Hong Kong) lodged a complaint, the  mainland recently stepped up the crackdown on factories that  produce pirated audio tapes and CD's. Shenzhen authorities have  conducted five cleanups so far, confiscated large quantities of  pirated products, and punished two pirating companies. The  mainland has also cooperated with the Hong Kong side in tracking  down smugglers of pirated goods. Any Hong Kong citizen  discovered by customs to be carrying pirated cassette tapes or  CD's into the territory is subject to a penalty.</p>

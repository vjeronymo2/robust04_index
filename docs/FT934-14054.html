			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Too popular for own good: Nato needs to form a policy on enlargement Nato is in a fix about eastern Europe. Its efforts to build links with its former foes, in a region which for 40 years was tacitly recognised as the Soviet Union's domain, have succeeded only too well. Public enthusiasm for Nato is more apparent in countries such as the Czech Republic or Poland than in the allied nations themselves. Half a dozen countries are queueing at Nato's door. Several former Soviet republics could also become candidates. It is a situation that Nato does not know how to resolve. Allies know that their summit meeting planned for January 10 cannot duck the issue. They will want to send a clear signal that the door to membership is open, but at the same time try to win eastern European countries over to the idea that there may be an acceptable alternative, short of membership. What Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, has already indicated they are unlikely to do is set a timetable or identify candidates. Defence ministers of the 16 allies will discuss relations with eastern Europe in an informal meeting starting tomorrow in the German seaside resort of Travemunde. But neither the US nor any of its main allies has yet formed a policy on enlargement. 'There's going to be an enlargement at some point. Nobody believes we're going to stay at 16 members for ever,' said a senior Nato diplomat. But in the corridors of allied headquarters in Brussels there is little enthusiasm for new admissions. One European official warned: 'We are creating expectations which we do not have the means to fulfil.' Former Warsaw pact members have been encouraged by Nato's efforts to promote co-operation since the pact collapsed in 1991. Nato saw an active role in eastern Europe as the way to justify its own continued existence and keep political support in the US. But Nato is in no hurry to extend its security guarantees to new borders. Membership of Nato, under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, commits members to assist each other against attack. In practical terms this means a US guarantee to its European allies, backed by US conventional and nuclear forces. 'It's honestly up to the Americans,' said a European diplomat at Nato. But the US Congress would probably be most reluctant to extend the protective umbrella. The second obstacle, and Nato's main pretext for hesitation, is Russia. If, by integrating Moscow's one-time allies, Nato makes Russia feel isolated and insecure, it could damage rather than improve global stability. This dilemma has worsened since this month's bloody confrontation between President Boris Yeltsin and rival factions in Moscow. Eastern Europe is looking more anxiously towards the west for security. But Nato is even more concerned not to create problems for Mr Yeltsin. Oddly, it was Mr Yeltsin who put enlargement on the Nato summit agenda. In Warsaw in August, under persuasion from Poland's President Lech Walesa, he stated that Russia would not see Nato enlargement as being against its interests. This shook Nato, which then had to start thinking seriously about it. The next month, Mr Yeltsin corrected his position, proposing that Nato and Russia should jointly guarantee eastern Europe's security. He also argued that Nato had implicitly agreed not to expand eastwards at the time the status of united Germany was settled in 1990. Both suggestions are firmly rejected by Nato. However, there is no consensus in Nato about how far it should envisage expanding. There are three groups of actual or potential candidates. Top of the list, but not necessarily all together, come the 'Visegrad four' - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Romania and Bulgaria are also keen, but are considered less ready. Former Soviet republics may look to Nato, although this is currently too sensitive an issue with Russia. There are also different schools of thought about Russia itself. In December 1991 Mr Yeltsin declared a 'long-term political aim' of membership. But Russia has not pressed its candidacy, and some allies see it as 'too large, too Asian and too backward' ever to join. Among the main European allies, Germany has been the most supportive towards central European applicants, particularly its outspoken defence minister, Mr Volker Ruhe. But he has recently taken a more cautious line. The UK and France are both wary. The US is also uncomfortable with the emphasis given to the membership question. Nato will try to match any gesture it makes towards enlargement with a parallel upgrading of defence relations with Russia and Ukraine. The summit can also be expected to try to inject more substance into the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, set up as a talking shop for Nato and the former Warsaw pact countries including Soviet successor states in Europe and Asia. Special arrangements are under discussion in Nato for the countries that feel entitled to membership and that have done most to reform their military along Nato lines. The Washington Treaty, while allowing for other European countries to be invited to join, makes no provision for associate membership. But there could be affiliation agreements. This would, in effect, extend to the countries concerned the consultation procedures foreseen in Article 4 of the treaty in the event of a security threat, but not the commitment to mutual armed assistance contained in Article 5. 'We're in no position not to accept affiliation,' said a Polish official. But he warned it would be seen in Poland as just a first step towards entry. 'It might work in January, but already by March or May it would be insufficient.' Some members are pushing for Nato admission to be linked to countries' accession to the European Community. As EC members, they would have the option of belonging to the Western European Union, with its own mutual security guarantee. This would avoid having to set specific criteria for Nato membership. But officials in candidate countries believe it may mean waiting too long. Mr John Chipman, director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, said these countries had given too much importance to Nato, failing to see that their long-term security lay in economic integration in the EC. 'Is it absolutely certain that Nato will be useful to them in the future?' he asked. European allies are also worried that Nato, in its concern about eastern Europe, is being distracted from its own 'family problems' - crucially, the balance in the alliance between the US and western Europe. This has been highlighted by President Bill Clinton's latest remarks about the UK and French record over Bosnia. The European allies want the summit to produce a reaffirmation of US commitment. 'Nato's problem is this relationship: what do they want to do together?' said one diplomat. 'If Nato has a problem of raison d'etre, it's not in enlargement that it will find another raison d'etre.'</p>

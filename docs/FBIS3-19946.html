The men had fled to Iran during  the operations in Igdir and Agri, the ANATOLIA News Agency  reported. Mentese said in a written statement that great  achievements had been made in the struggle against terrorism and  that the PKK [outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan] had been  severely damaged by recent military operations.    Mentese said that in last week's operations 78 terrorists  had  been killed and 82 captured and added:    "Thanks to the decisive policies, both at home and abroad,  followed by the government since coming to power, great progress  has been made in the fight against terrorism."    In the provinces of Erzurum, Kars and Ardahan, 53 terrorists  were killed and 66 captured, in Agri two were killed and 19  captured, in Tunceli 12 killed, in Mus three killed, in  Kahramanmaras eight killed, in Igdir 16 captured and in Icel 36  terrorists were captured, making a total of 160. Five terrorist  hideouts were discovered and 103 people were arrested for giving  aid to terrorists.    Mentese said "By returning the terrorists, the Iranians have  once more demonstrated their willingness to cooperate in the  struggle against the PKK."    Three rocket launchers, 20 rockets, 28 rifles, five pistols,  22 grenades, documents, food, clothing and medical equipment  were seized during the operations.    Interior Minister Mentese said that with the support of the  legislature, the judiciary, the executive, the media and the  public, the issue of terrorism would be erased from the agenda  and that the peace and trust deserved by the people would be  established for good.    It was said that security precautions were tightened due to  the upcoming elections and the Newroz celebrations. In a  statement from the Emergency Rule Region Governor's office the  deaths of 18 terrorists in clashes with security forces in the  provinces of Hakkari, Sirnak and Tunceli were reported.    One of the dead was reported to be a high ranking member of  an outlawed leftist organization who had escaped from Nevsehir  prison some time ago.    Two children named Saddulah Gokyavas and Nihat Aydin were  killed in an explosion in a village in Bingol. It was said that  the explosion might have been due to a mine or bomb left by  soldiers. The mayor of Bingol, Selahattin Kaya confirmed the  news. The soldiers had apparently dug a trench while they were  in the area and had afterwards left. The explosion took place  while the children were playing.    The bodies of the children were taken to Bingol but it was  reported that there was trouble at the scene of the autopsy.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE IN THE NEWS  </P> <P> Seven South Bay residents and a Long Beach man have been honored for their  suggestions on ways to improve traffic, mobility and transportation in Los  Angeles. They are among 90 people whose ideas were selected by a panel of nine  judges in a contest sponsored by the RTD, the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> Suggestions ranged from providing tax incentives for ride-sharing (Robert  Chirpin, Hermosa Beach) and posting of laminated route maps and timetables at  bus stops (Cheryl E. Dent, Rancho Palos Verdes) to urging the Coroner's  Department to shorten investigative time on freeway fatalities. Willis C.  Hendrick of Long Beach noted: "This is a necessary job, but whatever can be  done to minimize freeway closures would be a big help." The other South Bay  residents honored are Sandy Quine of Manhattan Beach, Pauline Shea of El  Segundo, Ernie H. Valdovinos of Redondo Beach and Dora Beale and Olga Polk of  El Segundo, who jointly suggested that the RTD offer "a systemwide map printed  on quality paper so it can be carried and frequently handled without falling  apart."  </P></p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Applied Distribution to float in March Applied Distribution, a Maidenhead-based contract distribution group providing third-party warehousing and distribution services mainly to retailers and food manufacturers, plans a stock market flotation in March. The group intends to make its market debut through a placing organised by Baring Brothers, which is likely to value the group at about Pounds 40m. NatWest Wood Mackenzie will be brokers to the issue. Applied was formed five years ago as part of a Pounds 16.5m management buy-out of Geest's distribution division led by Mr Michael Rowley, who became chief executive of the new company. Since then, the group has benefited from the growing outsourcing trend among UK retailers and manufacturers to contract out their warehousing and transport needs to specialist service suppliers. The UK contract distribution market is estimated to have been worth about Pounds 5bn in 1992 and to represent about 30 per cent of the total UK distribution market. Applied operates nationally from five main depots and specialises in distributing food and other fast-moving consumer goods, fresh produce, cut flowers and pot plants under temperature controlled conditions. Its main customers include J Sainsbury, Nestle, Esso, Somerfield/Gateway and CWS. Despite the recession, the group reported increased operating profits of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.2m) in 1992 on turnover of Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 18.4m). Applied has also invested about Pounds 4.5m in depot facilities and its vehicle fleet since the MBO. Results for 1993 are expected to show continued growth and will be contained in the forthcoming prospectus. The group plans to uses part of the placing proceeds to repay bank and other borrowings, with the balance being used for working capital and investment purposes.</p>

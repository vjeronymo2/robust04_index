			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / French sing a song of Francophilia: Musical defence of the nation is causing some discord France is having a fit of the Francofollies and that's official. A Paris-based organisation called Franco-folies will this week be promoting French songs in all of New York's French restaurants, in Amsterdam, Madrid, Copenhagen, Mainz and Berlin, and inside France mounting no fewer than 1,500 concerts, radio shows and school lectures in performance and praise of 'the French song'. All this is the brainchild of Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister who last week criticised Eurotunnel for dubbing its new subterranean rail transporter 'Le Shuttle' instead of 'La Navette'. The government, said Mr Toubon, 'refuses to consider the English language as an inevitability'. But, in the view of France's eight national FM radio networks, a more serious form of Francofolly is about to be imposed on them in the form of a law that within two years will force them all to raise the French content of the music they broadcast to a minimum of 40 per cent - half of that quota must come from 'new French talent'. The bill, approved by parliament in December, has just been declared in keeping with the French constitution, and is expected to be passed into law this week. But Mr Javier Pons, secretary general of the SRN radio stations association, said: 'We remain opposed to this infringement of the freedom of expression, and we are taking legal advice to see if it is contrary to European law'. The current drive to protect French culture is thus for the first time creating internal controversy, compared to just the international row with the US caused by France's domestically popular and successful defence of its television quotas in the Gatt negotiations. The reason is simple. The eight FM networks have all carved out separate niches for themselves, partly by varying the amount of French songs they play. This diversity has, up to now, been recognised by the CSA broadcasting authority which has in fact negotiated a range of French content quotas that go from 50 per cent for Radio Nostalgie, with its bent for accordion-playing and crooning, down to 15 per cent for the Fun and Skyrock stations. 'Some 80 new French records come out every month,' explains Mr Andrew Manderstam, head of the RFM popular radio network. 'If we all have to go for the same new records - because of the new talent requirement - we will end up pumping out the same music.' Listeners will lose out in having less choice, and if they switch off, so will the recording industry that has strongly backed the new law, he points out. Mr Pons himself is angry, not because his M40 station which specialises in new French songs cannot meet the law's requirement, but because if all other radio stations do so too, 'we would have no point in existing'. There is clearly a market for chauvinists. Skyrock itself has just set up Chante France, a Paris radio station with the jingle: 'After Vercingetorix, Jeanne d'Arc and Charles de Gaulle, you now have Chante France, with 100 per cent French songs'. But even Chante France is anxious about keeping its raison d'etre as a distinctively Gallic beacon in an increasingly un-French world.</p>

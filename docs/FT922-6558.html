			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Third world hopes follow strong growth  -Antonia Sharpe on emerging markets, marked outperformers for the past eight years After the phenomenal growth in emerging stock markets since the mid-1980s, particularly in Latin America, it is understandable that some fund managers might feel they have missed the boat. Argentina, which grew by 392.5 per cent in dollar terms last year, has put on a further 25 per cent so far this year, while Hong Kong, widely regarded as a proxy for China's untold economic potential, has risen by 33 per cent in local terms since the beginning of January, reaching record levels in the process. However, Citibank analysts believe the party is far from over. In their view, emerging markets still offer investment opportunities in the 1990s and are an increasingly important component in reducing risk in global equity portfolios. Mr Arnab Banerji, director of the emerging markets group at Citibank Global Asset Management, says the best returns are to be found in developing countries where the application of technology, government commitment to education and the elimination of price distortion together produce steady economic growth. Mr Banerji told a group of fund managers in Amsterdam last week: 'In the third world, notwithstanding the poverty, the growth rate is faster than in developed countries . . . as they attempt to catch up.' He added that since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, many developing countries have accepted that price distortion - in the form of state subsidies, excessive government regulation, or barriers to trade - hinders economic growth and that central planning does not realise the economy's full potential. Furthermore, the effect of technological advancement on economic growth seen in the 'Tiger' nations of south-east Asia is now being duplicated in Latin America, and at a faster pace. In most of these countries, this development has been facilitated by the existence of an educated workforce. Examples of where the three factors of transfer of know-how, literacy, and a reduction in price distortion are evident include India, Brazil, Argentina and Pakistan. However, Mr Banerji warns that equity returns from these countries are likely to be more volatile than those from Chile, Mexico or Malaysia, where the stock markets are more established. Dutch institutions have been at the forefront of investing in emerging markets. But Mr Marinus Keyzer, chief economist for Pensioenfonds PGGM, the second largest pension fund in Europe, recalls that his enthusiasm was not shared by all in the mid-1980s. At the time, sceptics said it would be kinder to hand out the money directly to the poor since they were unlikely to see any of it back. Since 1984 to April this year, however, total returns from emerging markets have far exceeded those from stock markets in developed countries. For example, total returns on the Latin America index of the International Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank, have reached 840.4 per cent in dollar terms, while the Asia index has produced total returns of 347.2 per cent. This compares with 320.3 per cent for the MSCI World index and 317.3 per cent for the MSCI United States index. The only continent not to have joined in this development is sub-Saharan Africa, where a series of natural and man-made disasters have led to a severe contraction in economic growth while the population has continued to grow. Fears of over-population or failure to grow enough food are not justified elsewhere, because an increase in wealth, education and urbanisation has led to a rapid decline in fertility rates and per capita food production has grown.</p>

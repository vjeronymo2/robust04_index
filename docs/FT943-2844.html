			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds see early falls pared Gold stocks were lifted off the day's lows by last-minute buying ahead of futures expiry, ending with mild losses on the back of a lower bullion price. Industrials declined on a lack of fresh factors rather than any mark-down, dealers said. Shares drifted down from the start as investors took to the sidelines to ride out the consolidation in the gold price. Dealers said the market could see more aggressive selling of gold and mining-related shares if gold dropped below the Dollars 388 an ounce support level, but the undertone was still bullish on expectations that the metal would eventually push ahead to Dollars 400. The gold bullion price was still strong in rand terms and much of the expected rise had been discounted in recent share price gains. The overall index lost 32 at 5,840, the industrial index shed 21 to 6,523 and the golds index was 25 off at 2,428. De Beers slipped 90 cents to R109.25 and Anglos fell R4 to R244. In golds, Oryx went against the trend to gain 25 cents at R5.50, while Freegold receded R1.25 to R75.25.</p>

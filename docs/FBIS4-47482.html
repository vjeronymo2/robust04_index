Maymistov, Moscow Institute of Engineering </F> Physics; UDC 535.2]    [Abstract] Propagation of ultrashort light pulses through a  dispersive nonlinear medium is analyzed, for simplicity  considering only scalar electromagnetic waves. The analysis is  based on the theory of coherent interaction in several  approximations: 1. resonance, 2. unidirectional wave  propagation, 3. slowly varying complex pulse envelope. Resonance  may be assumed when the bandwidth of the pulses is much smaller  than the resonance frequency. In this approximation the wave  equation is supplemented with Bloch equations, the resulting  Maxwell-Bloch system having steady-state solutions but no  soliton solution. Unidirectionality may be assumed when the  concentration of resonant atoms is sufficiently low for  interaction of counterpropagating waves to be negligible. In  this approximation that system of equations transforms into one  whose soliton solutions describe gp-pulses and breezers with  2-pulse envelopes. When the unidirectionality condition is  not satisfied, then the nonlinear wave equation E[.sub],zz[/]  - c[.sup]2[/]E[.sub],tt[/] = ... must be resorted to. This  equation, obtainable from the same solutions to the Bloch  equation and very similar to the Boussinesq equation, is  completely integrable and has known multisoliton solutions.  Approximation of a slowly varying complex envelope leads to the  system of MacCall-Hahn equations, whose soliton solutions  describe 2-pulses. In the approximation of a slowly varying  envelopes of optical pulses and of medium polarization formal  solution of the Bloch equation yields the nonlinear Schroedinger  equation of nonlinear fiber optics.

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Malaysia sells 32% stake in carrier The Malaysian government is selling a 32 per cent stake in Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the national carrier, in a deal worth MDollars 1.79bn (USDollars 700m). The shares, part of a 42 per cent MAS stake held by Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, are being acquired by Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS), a company dealing in support services for the oil and gas industry. It is understood that the sale is being arranged through a share swap, based on two MAS shares for one MHS share. The share prices of both MAS and MHS have risen recently on rumours of a deal. MAS shares last traded on Friday at MDollars 7.35, while MHS stock traded at MDollars 15.70. 'The sale represents another step by the government to privatise further the national airline,' the finance ministry said. 'With this sale, the majority of Malaysia Airlines shares will be in the hands of the private sector, including non-residents.' Analysts say the government has taken advantage of a buoyant Kuala Lumpur stock market to rid itself of shares in what has become a financially troubled company. MHS will become the biggest shareholder in MAS, which was partially privatised in 1985. MHS is controlled by Mr Tajuddin Ramli, who is one of Malaysia's leading business personalities. Mr Ramli's main company is Technology Resources Industries, which is mainly involved in the telecommunications sector.</p>

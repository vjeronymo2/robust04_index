			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STANFORD SOCKS IT TO CSUN IN 3-GAME VOLLEYBALL SWEEP  </P> <P> Many of the Cal State Northridge men's volleyball players scribbled "BS" on  their socks before their Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match against  Stanford on Friday night.  </P> <P> The reason, according to team captain Tom Ribarich, was to show support for  teammate Bob Samuelson, who was suspended from the team earlier this week.  </P> <P> The initials obviously didn't stand for Beat Stanford. The Cardinal, ranked  fifth in the nation, crushed CSUN, 15-7, 15-2, 15-6, in 90 minutes in a WIVA  match at CSUN. Although the loss of Samuelson -- CSUN's top hitter -- obviously  hurt the Matadors, odds are his presence in the match wouldn't have affected  the outcome.  </P> <P> "I don't think that we played as well as we're capable of playing but I think  Stanford played excellent," CSUN Coach John Price said. "They dug everything we  hit (and) once they started playing well, the snowball kept rolling."  </P> <P> Samuelson was suspended Tuesday for disciplinary reasons, Price said. Price  will meet with Samuelson -- a 6-foot-5 senior -- Monday to discuss Samuelson's  status.  </P> <P> "Any time I set Bob it's an automatic kill," Ribarich said. "But you can't say,  'Oh, no! We don't have Bob.' "  </P> <P> Senior middle blocker and 1988 Olympian Scott Fortune led the Cardinal attack  with 21 kills in 28 attempts.  </P> <P> Fortune wasn't the only player getting rich against the Matadors' porous  defense. Dan Hanan added 17 kills in 19 attempts as the Cardinal (6-1, 3-1 in  conference play) finished with a .423 hitting percentage.  </P> <P> Sophomore middle blocker Raphael Tulino led CSUN (2-4, 0-4) with 10 kills and  Andrew Greskovics added nine.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text]The rates for digital dedicated circuits in Japan and  the United States were classified into long distance and local  and compared. The result is Japan's prices are overwhelmingly  costlier. Although the rates in Japan were less than one-half  when compared at the initiation of service, several differences  exist with the U.S. These rate differences cannot frustrate the  realization of a multimedia society in which high-speed,  high-capacity circuits will be in common use.    Charges for NTT's high-speed digital transmission services  were cut on February 1 of this year. The rates were decreased to  less than half the rate level at the initiation of service.  Nevertheless, the gap with the U.S. is huge. Therefore, we will  compare the two countries to evaluate the current situation.  Elements other than rates such as the communication quality were  not considered to be targets of this comparison.  <H5>  A Large Gap Exists between Japan and the U.S. Despite the </H5> Rate Cut    Starting with the conclusion, we can say that although the  rate calculation methods differ in the two countries, Japan's  rates are several times higher.    Figure 1 compares the rates of NTT's 1.5 Mbits/second  high-speed digital dedicated circuit to those of the Terrestrial  1.5M (T1) service of AT&amp;T, a long distance telephone company  in  the U.S.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-72A>      Figure 1. Comparison of 1.5 Mbits/second Services in Japan </FIG>        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1 AT&amp;T's Rates for Dedicated Digital Circuits                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Speed                    |Basic Rate               |Measured Rate (per mile) |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.5 Mbits/second         |$2,600                   |$3.65                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |64 kbits/second          |$281                     |$0.33                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |This rate is based on AT&amp;T's interoffice distance.                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In addition, an access charge from the central office                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |to the user's residence is required. 64 kbits/second                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |went into service on 20 November 1993. 1.5 Mbits/second                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |went into service on 18 September 1993.                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      It was noted beforehand that comparing the two services of  NTT and AT&amp;T on the same graph is not strictly correct. In  contrast to NTT's offering end-to-end service, AT&amp;T's service  target is only the relay portion. Therefore, the methods for  calculating rates differ.[.sup]1[/]    Only the relay portion offered by AT&amp;T is shown in  Figure 1.  The circuit access charge that varies with the users' conditions  is not considered. In fact, the access charge is about several  hundred dollars. Nonetheless, when this point is considered,  Japan's dedicated circuit rate is very high. (An example is  explained later.)    The results are almost identical at other speeds. For  example, a comparison at 64 kbits/second is shown in Figure 2.  The disparity is about the same as in the 1.5 Mbits/second case.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-73B>      Figure 2. Comparison at 64 kbits/second. The comparison </FIG>   <H5>  Comparison of 1.5M between Tokyo-Osaka and NY-LA: The </H5> Distance Is One-Tenth But the Rate Is Doubled    As a concrete example of rate calculations including the  access charge, we will present an example using the 1.5  Mbits/second circuit between New York and Los Angeles which are  separated by about 2,500 miles (about 4,000 km) (Figure 3). In  this example, the monthly fee is about $12,500 (about 1.32  million yen). The distances of the access circuits were each 2  miles in both New York and Los Angeles. The access charges used  are determined by each local telephone company, NYNEX and  Pacific Bell. Since rate is determined by each local telephone  company, rates differ for the same distance.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-74A>      Figure 3. Calculation Method for Long Distance Dedicated </FIG>      It is a bit forced to select the Tokyo-Osaka route (408 km)  as the Japanese example corresponding to the New York-Los  Angeles route in business activities, but the circuit usage rate  at the same speed is 2.7 million yen. Compared to the New  York-Los Angeles route, the distance is one tenth, but the rate  is almost double.  <H5>  A Shorter Distance But 4 to 5 Times More Expensive </H5>   In Japan the charge calculation method does not change for  short distances from several kilometers to several tens of  kilometers. Only rates corresponding to distance divisions are  determined. While in the U.S., if confined to within the service  area of the local telephone company, the rate structure of the  local telephone company is used[.sup]2[/]. For example, the  rates for the New York Metro LATA (Local Access and Transport  Area: region provided service by the same telephone company) of  NYNEX in the U.S. adds basic rates and measured rates between  the user and the central office and between central offices  (Table 2).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2 Monthly Rates of NYNEX's Superpath (1.5 Mbits/second)                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Basic Rate               |Measured Rate (per mile) |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Interoffice Rate         |$115                     |$30/mile                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Access Charge (one end)  |$210                     |$5/0.25 mile             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rates were effective 1 October 1993 in the New York Metro LATA.              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Based on a survey by the United Communications Group in the U.S.             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      In this case the access condition is not fixed, thus, a  comparison on the same graph is difficult. Figure 4 was graphed  when the distance of the access circuit is 0 and only the  interoffice distance is changed. A large gap is evident.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-75A>      Figure 4. Comparison at Local Distances (1.5 </FIG>      For a comparison of realistic conditions, we will calculate  an example between Marunouchi and Shinjuku in Tokyo (Figure 5).  The distance between NTT's Marunouchi office and Shinjuku office  is 6.5 km. The users at both ends are 400m from the Marunouchi  office and the Shinjuku office.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-76A>      Figure 5. Example Calculation of Dedicated Circuit Rates </FIG>     In NTT's rate calculation method, a rate of &yen;33,700 is  applied up to a distance division of 15 km. In contrast, the  rate of NYNEX in the U.S. is adapted to each case. The rate  ($695 = &yen;73,000) is the combination of the rate between the  two offices ($265, corresponding to part A in Figure 5) and the  rate based on the distance from the office to the user's  residence ($215 on one end, part B in Figure 5). Japanese rates  are 4 to 5 times higher.  <H5>  Considering the Causes </H5>   The gap between rates in Japan and the U.S. is confirmed by  NTT. The Dedicated Services Division stated ``We are aware of  the problem. People within the company have pointed out the need  for further reductions.'' Firstly, what is the cause of this gap?    One reason is NTT's internal rate structure. Historically,  NTT has had high earnings services and low earnings services.  Dedicated services have high rates relative to costs. When we  look at the profit rate in which ordinary profit and loss were  classified by the business income for different work (telephone,  telegraph, dedicated services) at NTT in 1992, the profit rate  for suburban calls (subscriber telephone) is 59.8% and  that for  dedicated services is 14.6%; both are in double digits.  Considering the rate system with respect to costs, the rates of  both services should be further reduced. However, while services  with high earnings decrease in price, there is the fear that low  profit services, like the current rate for intracity calls of  &yen;10 for 3 minutes, will experience price increases. If the  rates for users of dedicated circuits fall rapidly, placing the  burden on users who make many station-to-station calls would be  pursued. Also, there is the high probability that NCC (new  first-time communications commercial customers), who increase  earnings in dedicated circuits, will receive a heavy blow.    Another reason may be the difference in costs to provide  communication services in Japan and in the U.S. According to the  NTT Special Services Promotion Department, ``There are elements  that cannot be explained only by the difference in the  relationship between costs and rates in each service. Ideas  about networks also differ in Japan and the U.S.'' Specifically,  there are the amount of backup circuits and the refined  monitoring system. In addition, because the depth at which  cables are buried is set in Japan, the road construction costs  are 10 times higher than in the U.S.    One telecommunication analyst gave one reason for high rates  as ``the manufacturer's protection policy followed in the past  by NTT.'' During the training period of the manufacturer, the  equipment used by NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) was  purchased at high prices from domestic manufacturers. This had  the effect of a high level of R&amp;D strength at the  manufacturer.  However, when NTT was privatized, procuring domestically or  overseas without distinction became possible. If manufacturer  protection is carried out, the danger of pushing up  telecommunication costs is exhibited.    In realizing a multimedia society focused on transmitting  images, a premise is the ability to inexpensively use  high-speed, large capacity circuits. But high rates will become  a major obstacle. Of course, to secure lower prices, a review of  the old framework will be involved. In reforming the framework  in rate theory, a wider range of view must be assembled.  Footnotes    1. Dedicated Circuit Calculation Methods in Japan and the  U.S.    NTT uses a rate table corresponding to the 24 distance  divisions. In principle, the rate is determined based on the  distance to the MA (message area, unit of individual charging  area) the user belongs to. However, at short distances within an  MA, the distance between the receiving offices is applied. While  in the U.S., the relay circuits provided by long distance  telephone companies like AT&amp;T and the access circuits  provided  by the local telephone companies must be combined.    The rate of each circuit consists of the basic monthly rate  and the special rate corresponding to distance.    2. Rate Structure of Local Telephone Companies    Local telephone companies in the United States have  different  rates for end-to-end services such as the access circuits of  long distance telephone companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed the peoples  of Kazakhstan with a New Year's message. He said: Despite the  difficulties of the present period we managed to preserve our  republic' main asset -- public and political stability, civil  and interethnic accord. This is the cornerstone on the basis of  which we succeeded in avoiding economic and political upheavals  and we can confidently face the future. Maintaining such an  atmosphere is most valuable and we can be proud of this. It  could facilitate the process of reforms in our society.    I am grateful to you, my compatriots and like-minded people,  for your support. By the powers, that have been given to me by  the Constitution and you, I guarantee observation of the  principle of equality and liberties of all people, irrespective  of nationality, religion, and social status. Kazakhstanis  should not worry about their future and the future of their  children. All of us have a common motherland, the Republic of  Kazakhstan, and we should think about its prosperity. The  current year should become one of the more important stages on  this path. I wish optimism, wisdom, and strength to each  Kazakhstani and each family so as to undergo all the trials with  credit. Happy New Year, my dear compatriots.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro says his country is  ready to establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. In a  message presented to President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria,  Castro also offered Cuba's assistance to the new South African  Government. He said he would support this new stage in South  Africa's development with the same sentiment of solidarity and  fraternity with which Cuba has supported the struggle of South  Africans against racial segregation.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities slide on interest rate fears THE OPTIMISM kindled in the UK stock market by the reductions in German interest rates was quashed yesterday by sterling's fall to within a hair's breadth of its permitted ERM low, which brought renewed fears that UK base rates might have to be pushed up sharply to protect the pound. A slide in share prices gathered pace towards the close and the FT-SE Index ended 52 points down as the market resounded with suggestions that UK rates could be forced higher by two percentage points without waiting for the Maastricht referendum in France this weekend. City analysts at the leading securities firms were summoned to meetings after trading hours last night. Nerves came in for further testing following reports that Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had cancelled plans to return to the Continental holiday interrupted by the Bundesbank's actions last weekend; and also after unconfirmed rumours of crisis meetings at either the Bank of England or at Downing Street. The day's loss of 52.1 on the Footsie wiped out Monday's gain and left the index at 2,370 last night. The big institutions, having taken the opportunity to sell into a firm market on Monday, appeared to be less active yesterday. Seaq volume, which increased towards the end of the session when sterling was challenging its ERM low and the Bank of England was believed to be supporting the UK currency, totalled 507.3m shares. Monday's Seaq turnover of 537.9m shares reflected retail business worth Pounds 971.7m, still on the low side. With City analysts and the investment press taking a negative view of the likely effects of the Bundesbank's rates cut, the UK stock market made a gloomy start to the day. 'The writing was on the wall as soon as we saw the Footsie open six points off after Wall Street had climbed 70 points overnight,' commented one leading dealer. The Footsie 2,400 mark melted away and occasional pauses to test support levels invariably crumbled in the face of the market's negative sentiment. Widespread falls in government bonds and persistent pressure on stock index futures left equities to close virtually at their lowest levels of the day. Nomura's Nicholas Knight, the spokesman for the bears, described the Bundesbank's actions as no more than an anaesthetic for the financial markets. 'The anaesthetic will wear off,' he warned clients yesterday morning. The fear that UK interest rates would be forced higher outweighed other considerations, including Wall Street's overnight strength and even the suggestion of a sterling devaluation, which also circulated in the financial markets. Building and construction shares, the chief casualties from high base rates, lost more than the cautious gains achieved on Monday. The international stocks brushed aside Wall Street's Monday upsurge, which was reversed early in the new session when the Dow slipped 29 points. BAT Industries, Glaxo and Wellcome were cut back as investors in the London market dived for cover.</p>

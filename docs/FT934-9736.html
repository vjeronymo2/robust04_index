			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Finnish investment house to market fund in the UK STRONG foreign interest in Finland's resurgent stock market has prompted Arctos, one of Finland's five leading investment houses, to market its most recent investment fund to institutions in the UK. Finland's stock market has almost doubled in value this year on signs that its economy is recovering from virtual collapse two years ago. The abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership of shares at the start of this year has also contributed to the big improvement in daily turnover. Mr Topi Piela, executive officer of Arctos Asset Management, said yesterday the open-ended fund offered foreign investors an exposure to high-technology and export-oriented stocks, the two growth areas in the Finnish economy. In addition, the fund is the only Finnish investment fund to use derivatives, mainly index and stock options and futures, to protect itself against falls in equity prices and to produce an additional yield. The fund's hedge against downside risk should attract foreign investors who have been put off Finland's stock market by its high volatility, of around 30 per cent. This compares with between 15 to 20 per cent in other countries. The Guernsey-registered fund has attracted FM40m from domestic investors since its launch at the end of May. However, Mr Piela expects the size of the fund to reach FM2bn by 1998.</p>

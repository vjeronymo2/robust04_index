			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS' TRAMBLE MIGHT RETURN SOONER THAN EXPECTED  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton safety Terry Tramble, who was expected to miss six to eight  games after sustaining a broken forearm Sept. 8 against Auburn, might be back  sooner than originally anticipated.  </P> <P> Tramble, an all-Big West, first-team defensive back in 1989, saw a specialist  Wednesday and was told surgery on his left ulna would not be necessary.  </P> <P> He resumed practice Wednesday but will concentrate on conditioning and  participate only in non-contact drills.  </P> <P> Tramble, who will wear a protective device on his arm, said he hopes to be  ready for the Fresno State game Sept. 29. But Titan defensive coordinator Kirk  Harmon said Tramble will be evaluated on a week-to-week basis beginning next  week.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure when he'll be ready," Harmon said. "We're going to work on  keeping his legs fresh and see how his arm feels."  </P> <P> The addition of Tramble would be a boost to the Fullerton secondary, which has  allowed 842 yards and eight touchdowns passing in three games.  </P> <P> "Obviously, getting Terry back will help because he's a senior member of the  defense, a team leader and an all-conference performer," Harmon said. "We're  excited about that prospect." MIKE DiGIOVANNA  </P></p>

The monetary base (volume of money in the hands of the  public plus the compulsory reserves the banks keep in the BC)  increased 43 percent in February compared with January's average  daily balance. This is 2 percent more than the average inflation  rate measured by the IPC-Fipe [Consumer Price Index-Economic  Research Institute Foundation], the IGP-M [General Market Price  Index], and the INPC [National Consumer Price Index]. As a  result of high interest rates, the internal debt also increased  4.6 percent more than inflation in February, reaching 31  trillion cruzeiros.    Based on the average daily balances, the monetary base only  increased more than the average inflation rate in the months of  December in the last two years. In the other months the BC  managed to control the monetary base through the issuance of  government titles. The main factor in the monetary base's  expansion was the exchange of dollars -- coming from abroad --  for cruzeiros. The net inflow during February was 1.1 trillion  cruzeiros. Part of this pressure was compensated for by the  issuance of public titles. The BC withdrew 552 billion cruzeiros  from circulation in this operation.    In the case of the internal debt, its proportion of the GDP  jumped from 8.3 percent in January to 8.6 percent in February,  which is the same rate as November 1992, when the volume of the  internal debt in government titles placed on the market began to  drop.  <H5>  Reserves </H5>   Hard currency reserves, including cash and short-term  credits, reached $29.1 billion by the end of January, which  represents a considerable increase of $3.3 billion compared with  December. Under the concept of international liquidity, which  includes mid- and long-term credits, the increase was $3.2  billion, amounting to a total $35.4 billion.    In the commercial exchange market, in which imports,  exports,  and the arrival and remittance of foreign investments are  registered, the February surplus was $2.4 billion, 27 percent  less than in January.</p>

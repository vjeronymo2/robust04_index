West German government  officials said that about 500 East Germans had come by chartered trains and  buses from Vienna to the main transit camp in Giessen north of Frankfurt and to  another camp near Nuremberg. They were among 661 East Germans who the officials  said had shown up at the West German Embassy in Vienna after fleeing from  Hungary to Austria through an open gate at a picnic site.  </P></p>

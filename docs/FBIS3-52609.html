			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department,  made the following statement to our correspondent upon his  arrival in Amman this morning:    [Begin recording] [Qaddumi] First comes coordination. We are  one people and one country. In fact, coordination and  cooperation are a must. We should explore the future and how  the situation will be in the Middle East. The Jordanians and  the Palestinians are one people and have common interests. The  aim is to organize these common interests in the future, to draw  up rules for them, and to reinforce the brotherly ties between  us. The previous experiences we have faced as one unit cannot  be seen as just a relationship between one country and another,  but as one among the members of one family. This is our concept  of the work for which we have come and for the future we want to  work out together, God willing.    [Reporter] There is a crisis in Jordanian-Palestinian  relations. What are the dimensions of this crisis?    [Qaddumi] There is no crisis. This is, regrettably, the  creation of Arab or non-Arab media. There is, in fact, a  persisting desire to carry out joint action because we are  moving toward a serious stage. This esplains his majesty's  statement that stressed desire to base relations on sound  foundations. This, in fact, is our opinion and our trend.  Therefore, what is being portrayed as a crisis is not a crisis  at all. There is not crisis among the members of one family.  [end recording]</p>

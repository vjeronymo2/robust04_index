			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Homelessness will rise, housing authority warns HOMELESSNESS will increase and council waiting lists lengthen unless the government doubles the number of new homes provided each year for rent, according to a study published yesterday by the Housing Corporation, which funds and supervises registered housing associations. The study, by two researchers from the London School of Economics, says that 100,000 additional homes for rent will be needed each year for the next 10 years. Government plans - under review as part of this year's public-expenditure round - are for an average of 51,000 housing association homes for each of the next three years. The study is the latest in a series of authoritative reports to suggest that government housing plans are inadequate. The Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, estimated in May that an extra 74,000 homes a year would be needed over the next decade. An earlier study by the Institute of Housing put the figure at 130,000 homes a year, while the Association of District Councils said that the figure should be between 75,000 and 115,000 a year. The Housing Corporation suggests that 80,000 of the 100,000 additional units would have to be new homes. The balance could come from reducing vacancies, buying in homes built for sale and other sources. In the present depressed climate of private investment in housing, the study concludes that to maintain the present level of government provision would almost certainly increase waiting lists, homelessness and the number of concealed households. That would be exacerbated by the drive to transfer rented housing to owner-occupation. A Review of Housing Needs Assessment. The Housing Corporation, 149 Tottenham Court Road, London W1P 0BN. Pounds 3. THE NUMBER of new private homes started by builders fell sharply during the summer, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment, Andrew Taylor writes. They show that private house starts during the first eight months fell by 7 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. If that trend continued for the rest of this year, the total number of housing starts by private builders would be the lowest for more than adecade. According to the department, private housing starts fell by more than a tenth in the June to August period, compared with the corresponding three months last year. The fall was offset by a 38 per cent increase in public-sector starts, including those made by housing associations, which have taken over councils' role of providing social housing. Overall public and private starts fell by 3.6 per cent compared with the June to August period. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The latest house building figures are terrible. House building in 1992 will almost certainly be the worst of any year since the war.' The total number of homes started by builders in August was 12,600 - almost 6 per cent fewer than during the corresponding month last year.</p>

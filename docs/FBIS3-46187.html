			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Weiping (2621 4850 1627) and </F> XINHUA reporter Jiang Peng (5592 7720)]    [Text] Chongqing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- While inspecting  Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province, Li Tieying, CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau member and State Councillor,  and concurrently minister in charge of the State Economic  Restructuring Commission, said: Under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and in the course of implementing the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, Sichuan should proceed from its own realities to  emancipate the mind, blaze a new trail for its inland areas to  accelerate reform and open to the outside world, and strive to  promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  Pilot cities should take the lead in exploring and in  establishing a new socialist market economic system.    From 6 to 11 January, Li Tieying inspected Chengdu and  Chongqing, heard reports by the relevant departments in Sichuan  Province as well as in the two cities, and held discussions with  managers and factory directors of medium-sized and large  enterprises in Chengdu and Chongqing, and together with  responsible persons from various cities, prefectures, and  autonomous prefectures in the province who attended the meeting,  during which they jointly looked into issues related to reform  and development. While in Chongqing, Li Tieying also visited  the Qingling Automobile Company, Ltd., the construction industry  company (group), the Nanping farm market, and the Chongqing  means of production exchange.    Li Tieying pointed out: There is no ready-made model for  building a socialist market economy. Sichuan has made an early  start in reform; both Chongqing and Chengdu are pilot cities for  a complete set of reforms. You have attained great achievements  in the process of reform and created much experience which  should be continuously summed u. Constant efforts should be  made to study how to implement comprehensive reforms, and how to  tackle new situations and new problems that have cropped up in  the course of moving forward as a whole, and efforts should be  made to create many more new experiences. Urban economic  restructuring must be comprehensive with emphasis on key areas;  we should not deal with only a certain aspect in isolation  without taking other aspects into account. Currently, we should  focus our comprehensive reforms on transforming the operating  mechanism of state-run enterprises, establishing a modern  enterprise system, and carrying out macroeconomic regulation and  control nationwide. He stressed: In the course of reform, the  government serves both as a director and a protagonist. We have  to count on the government to play a leading role in instituting  a modern enterprise system while it is itself also engaged in  transforming its own functions. At the same time, we should  change the situation in which enterprises have for a long time  had to bear the heavy burden of "running society" under the  planned system. Social functions should be divorced from  business operations, and a social security system should be  gradually established and perfected. Only when these problems  are solved can enterprises show their vitality in market  competition.    Touching on cultivating and developing a market system, Li  Tieying said: We must promote the development of markets for  factors of production, financial markets, and technology  markets, and also pay attention to developing intermediate  agencies such as accounting, auditing, and law offices. We  should handle the relevant affairs through these intermediate  organizations in accordance with the law.    While hearing reports in Chengdu and Chongqing, Li Tieying  stressed the need to quicken the pace of opening to the outside  world. He said: Sichuan must further step up its construction  of transportation, telecommunications, and energy facilities.  At the same time, it should strive to establish a new economic  structure and a sound operational mechanism, and constantly  improve its investment in elements of the intangible  environment. Greater efforts should be made to attract more  business and funds, as well as to absorb funds, technology, and  qualified personnel from other parts of the country and the  world.    While hearing reports on the supply and marketing of grains  and edible oil products, Li Tieying said: It is necessary to  correctly and properly handle the relationships between  producers, operators of businesses, and consumers, but most  important of all, we must mobilize producers' enthusiasm to  achieve an agricultural bumper harvest and ensure growth in the  output of grain and edible oil products. We must study how to  speed up the reform of the grain structure and establish a  reserve system and risk funds. We must proceed from the  interests of the masses of the people and pay due attention to  stabilizing prices of grains and edible oil products, as well as  to maintaining market stability.</p>

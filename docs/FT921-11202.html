			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / German steel strike looms after 'yes' vote GERMANY braced itself yes-terday for a long and disruptive steel strike after a five-day union ballot resulted in an 87 per cent majority in favour of industrial action over pay. Despite weak public support, according to opinion polls, and solid resistance from employers, the IG Metall union is expected to announce the industry's first official stoppage since 1978 after a meeting of the union leadership in Frankfurt on Tuesday. There seemed little chance yesterday of early compromise or mediation. Announcing the ballot result, union officials said they would not talk again to the employers without a fresh offer. Mr Peter Schmithals, the employers' negotiator, said yesterday morning he had no plans to make one. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, IG Metall president, said he hoped the vote had destroyed what he described as the employers' last illusions that they could get a 'cheap' result. Negotiations started last October with a 10.5 per cent demand and broke down on January 22 with employers offering about 5.5 per cent and unions holding out for about 6.5 per cent. The decisive vote, in which 96 per cent of the 95,000 eligible union members took part, could set the scene for a similar result from a current strike ballot among banking workers. It reinforced the hard line adopted by IG Metall, which starts negotiations on behalf of its 3m-plus engineering industry members in March, and by 3.6m public service union workers, whose wage demands will be put formally to employers on February 7. Steel strikes could legally start immediately after next week's Frankfurt meeting. However, Mr Harald Schartau, of the union's steel section, said it would take 'some days' to organise action. The effects of stoppages are likely to be quick and wide-reaching. Motor manufacturers, who keep little steel in stock, would be among the first to be hit. Mercedes-Benz managers say they would feel the effects in three or four days, and most car companies have laid plans for short-time working. Knock-on economic effects will spread quickly to the engineering sector, where many of the country's 10,000-plus companies will be affected. In the longer term, if em-ployers are forced to give too much ground and pay inflationary increases, there is international concern that the Bundesbank will not feel able to reduce interest rates from their current record levels. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, said in Stockholm yesterday that inflation, currently 4 per cent, was far above his 2 per cent target. After last year's high wage rises (averaging 6.7 per cent), the underlying rate of inflation had gone up distinctly, he said. Union claims posted so far this year on behalf of about 10m German workers call for average increases of 10 per cent.

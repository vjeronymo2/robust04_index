			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLOR IT TOYOTASAURUS WRECK: CAR ART HEADED FOR JUNK HEAP  </P> <P> Another dinosaur bites the dust.  </P> <P> "Toyotasaurus Tyrannicus," the Toyota station wagon/art installation towed from  the Laguna Canyon site of "The Tell" 600-foot-long photomural, will go to the  junk heap, said artist Mark Chamberlain.  </P> <P> "It's just returning to earth," said Chamberlain, who co-organized "The Tell"  project and half-buried his former car nearby as part of its anti-development  message.  </P> <P> "Toyotasaurus" was exhumed and towed by the City of Laguna Beach earlier this  month and impounded at Larry Hunt Auto Body Center where it has been  accumulating impound fees for about three weeks. Tuesday morning, Chamberlain  received notification that a lien of $275 (an amount growing at $12 a day) had  been placed on the car.  </P> <P> Chamberlain, who acknowledges that he was never given permission to bury a car  at the mural site, claims that he was never told that the auto was going to be  towed and charges that "a form of censorship" therefore occurred. City  officials assert that the artist was definitely told that the vehicle was going  to be removed because it had been installed without permission.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the artist says the 1977 vehicle is ready to go to scrap and is  worth neither his own money nor time to salvage. The auto body center has been  told to dispose of the car and intends to do so on Nov. 4, he says.  </P> <P> City officials say the city will pay all impound charges incurred.  </P> <P> "It was on city property, and we were the ones that hauled it out," explained  Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Martha Collison. "We didn't want to make it an  issue. It wasn't the purpose to stick him (with the bill)."  </P> <P> Chamberlain added that the whereabouts of Irving, a manikin that sat at the  car's steering wheel and last seen before the auto was towed, are still  unknown.  </P></p>

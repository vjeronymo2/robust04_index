			<p>Bill   <F P=102>   94WD0433B Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 25 May 94 pp 1,3 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0433B </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok BANGKOK POST </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] The Counter Corruption Commission is drafting a bill  to deal with the laundering of "dirty money" acquired from  narcotics trafficking or other illegal activities, CCC  secretary-general Prasit Damrongchai said yesterday.    Mr Prasit said the bill would be completed in two weeks and  forwarded to the Cabinet for consideration.    He said the bill would empower the Bank of Thailand to  examine the movements of money belonging to individuals  suspected of involvement in the businesses or who are  "unusually" rich.    The directors-general of the Police and Customs departments  and the secretaries-general of the CCC and Office of Narcotics  Control Board will be empowered to examine suspected "dirty  money," he said.    All other officials will be barred form checking into the  source of "dirty moeny" to protect the rights and freedoms of  individuals.    Mr Prasit said it was impossible to fix the amount of money  determined as unusually large and suspected of being acquired  illegally other than to base it on the occupation of the  individuals under suspicion.    For instance, a civil servant earning 30,000 baht a month  yet  with 500,000 baht in the bank would cause suspicion as to how  the money was acquired. Like-wise, a businessman who operates a  business worth about 1,000 million baht and has a revolving fund  which doubles the amount of the operating fund would also  warrant an examination to determine the source of the money.    He said the anti-money laundering law would greatly benefit  the CCC's operations. If there is a complaint of corruption by  an official or of an official said to be unusually rich, the CCC  could ask for information about the official's financial  standing and the source of his money. Gift cheques could be  frozen if the official cannot explain how they were obtained.    The law, he said, will also apply to MPs.    "If MPs suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking  cannot prove how they amassed their wealth, their assets can be  subject to forfeiture," he said.    Mr Prasit said it was necessary to explain the benefits of  the law to parliamentarians to avoid opposition in Parliament.    He said the law would not infringe on the rights and  freedoms  of individuals.    "The United States, which has a constitution which provides  the greatest protection for the rights and freedoms of  individuals, also has an anti-money laundering law."    People who violate the law should not receive protection and  law-abiding citizens should not be afraid of the law, he said.    The CCC chief said he had sought the opinions of about 20  bankers on the law and was told they all support it. But they  doubt it will ever be passed into law.    The bankers also expressed concern that the law would be an  additional burden on banks and financial institutions and might  affect the financial system as well as the economy.    Mr Prasit insisted the anti-money laundering law would help  protect honest businessmen against the use of dirty money in  lawful businesses.    "If someone dumps 500 million baht of drug money into a  business, honest competitors will be seriously affected," he  said.    The Office of the Narcotics Control Board, Bank of Thailand,  Finance Ministry and Chulalongkorn University's Law Faculty are  drafting similar bills. Their bills will be combined and  incorporated as one, said Mr Prasit.    ONCB secretary-general Chawalit Yotmani said Deputy Prime  Minister Amnuay Virawan, who oversees ONCB affairs, had  appointed a panel comprising officials from the Finance and  Justice ministries, Bank of Thailand, Stock Exchange of  Thailand, Chulalongkorn University, Police Department, ONCB and  Supreme Attorney-General to draw up the anti-money laundering  law.    Pol Gen Chawalit said Thailand already had a law allowing  authorities to confiscate the assets of people convicted of  financing drug businesses.    The law was introduced in 1992 and 11 offenders have since  had their assets seized, he said.    Pol Gen Chawalit said the ONCB would pursue the  investigation  into allegations by the United States that former Chat Thai MP  Thanong Siripree-chapong was involved in smuggling marijuana to  the US.</p>

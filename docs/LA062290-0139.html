			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACE TO THE SWIFT; HEARTS TO EAGLE  </P> <P> Eagle Performance Racing of Santa Barbara went to Le Mans last week with an  obsolete race car, an untried engine, two rookie drivers on a bread and cheese  budget -- and France loved every audacious moment of this lone Yankee Doodle  effort.  </P> <P> But worship wasn't enough.  </P> <P> Eagle's 2-year-old Chevrolet Corvette prototype did not finish in the francs.  </P> <P> In fact, after being nibbled to death by mechanical problems, it did not even  start the prestigious 24-hour race.  </P> <P> "It was a lot of little things that added up to a lot," said team driver Dennis  Kazmerowski. "The first problem was a vapor lock in one radiator that caused  overheating."  </P> <P> Overheating burned pistons and scored cylinders. Race inspectors declared the  car a centimeter too short here, a millimeter too long there. The exhaust pipe  measured too low. The rear spoiler rose too high.  </P> <P> "Even our American driving suits didn't meet safety requirements for European  racing," said Kazmerowski. "We got everything fixed and then found the  alternator was not pumping out enough juice (electricity).  </P> <P> "Out in practice, after about 10 laps, the car just quit, dead, and we couldn't  get it started again in time for the race."  </P> <P> Yet buoyed by fun and friendly headlines (one French newspaper described the  American car with its huge, 900-horsepower engine as: Le Monstre Retour), the  support of fans (two California tourists located the team and presented them  with a story about them that had appeared in the Los Angeles Times) and  informal invitations from race officials to compete again, Eagle Performance  plans to return to Le Mans next year.  </P> <P> Failure, says Kazmerowski, always is integral to maximum effort. That's racing.  Also c'est la vie. PAUL DEAN  </P></p>

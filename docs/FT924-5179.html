			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (18): A haven for gourmets - Food and wine shopping / cheese, fish, bread, meat, wine, chocolate, coffee, tea - you name it - there are specialist shops for almost everything very, very seriously indeed. Parisian street markets are crammed with customers peering judiciously to make sure that the peaches, or parsnips, they have chosen are of the very best quality. Every Parisian has a favourite fromager, cheese specialist, or poissonnier, fishmonger. The snooty Gault Millau guide to the creme de la creme of Paris devotes as many pages to food shops, as to clothes or hotels. So, if you are prepared to plough through the traffic to farflung 20th arrondissement to pick up your raisan bread fresh from the oven at Bernard Ganachaud and then trek back to Creplet-Brussol on the place de la Madeleine to buy the very best butter to smear on it, Paris is the place for you. There are, of course, easier ways to shop for food in Paris. The easiest of all is to find an epicerie fine with a wide range of goods. Fauchon has been selling gourmet groceries on place de la Madeleine for over a century. The store, which not only sprawls across several floors, but also different buildings, is so packed with Japanese tourists that it sometimes seems more like a tourist attraction than a shop. But the quality and quantity of Fauchon's stock, with its range of 4,500 spices and penchant for very rare delicacies, is as high as ever, making it well worth trekking around and teetering out ladened with its brown and white carrier bags. It also has the inestimable advantage of a private parking service which is a godsend, as anyone who has ever tried - and tired  -to find a parking space in central Paris will attest. Alternatively, you could pop into one of the Fouquet shops, on rue Lafitte or rue Francois-Ier, which also sell a wide range of food but are particularly tempting for their chocolates, or into the quaint, old Faguais on rue La Tremoille, famous for its jams, honeys and freshly roasted coffee. As for food specialists, Paris is packed with them. Gault Millau has a lengthy lists of shops specialising in everything from tea to truffles. The bustling Marks and Spencer store on boulevard Haussmann even merits a mention in its 'Ethnic' section scoring high marks for its 'meaty, smokey' bacon with 'no nasty bits of bone' and for providing 'ample evidence that British gastronomy is not, as Parisians tend to think, a joke.' Tasty though M and S's bacon may be, the ingredients of a British breakfast tend not to be high on any foodie's Parisian shopping list. Wine, however, comes close to the top and the present plight of the French wine industry means that there are lots of bargains to be found. The best sources of really good wines at low prices are the French hypermarkets, Carrefour and Auchan, both of which have branches on the outskirts of Paris. Until recently, French wine distributors, the negociants, were too snooty to sell to hypermarkets, but the recent fall in prices and the decline in their export markets, means they no longer have a choice. Some negociants sell directly to hypermarkets. Others have dumped consignments of wine sent back from depressed export markets such as the US. Stories of people picking up 1988 or 1989 Grands Crus Classes - sometimes still bearing their US Customs labels - for a song are standard fodder at Paris dinner parties. If bargain hunting at the hypermarkets does not appeal, there are lots of excellent wine shops in the city. Legrand Filles et Fils in Galerie Vivienne by the Banque de France is a lovely, old-fashioned shop full of interesting French country wines and the very best Bordeaux and Burgundies. There is also a tiny epicerie fine with a good selection of coffee and chocolates at the back. Caves de la Madeleine on rue Royale also offers a wide selection of French wines. Unusually for a Paris wine shops, it is run by a Briton, Steven Spurrier, who still scrutinises every wine himself. Au Verger de la Madeleine on the nearby boulevard Malesherbes is renowned for its very rare, very expensive cognacs and for first growth Bordeaux. Vins Rares et de Collection-Thustrup further out of the centre on rue Laugier in the 17th arrondissement is famous for antique Yquem, Petrus and Mouton-Rothschild. Cheese is another staple souvenir. Most quartiers have their own fromagers, many of them excellent. But there is also an elite band of really good cheese shops to which fromage fiends flock from all over the city. Alain Dubois on rue de Toqueville in the 17th is renowned for his Gruyere and also has the kudos of supplying many of the smartest Paris restaurants, including Lucas-Carton and Guy Savoy. Lecomte on the Ile Saint-Louis has a huge selection of cream and goats cheese. Specialites Fromageres on rue de Grenelle selects cheeses from farms all over France. While Creplet-Brussol on place de la Madeleine is the place to go for Camembert and Brillat-Savarin, as well as for butter and cream. Chocaholics should head for the aptly-named La Maison du Chocolat on rue Francois-Ier for its classic chocs with buttercream fillings or to Peltier on rue de Sevres for palets d'or, dark chocolates with buttercream centres garnished with gold leaf. Christian Constant on rue du Bac is on the cutting edge of Parisian chocolate-making with funky shapes and innovations such as his 80 per cent cocoa bar. But traditionalists will probably prefer the old fashioned grandeur of Debauve et Gallais on rue des Saints-Peres where the chocolates taste as good as the 19th century shop (now a Beaux Arts landmark) looks. CAFFEINE addicts can choose from the world's best coffee beans at Verlet on rue Saint-Honore, where you can taste the house blends and exotic imported beans before you buy. Brulerie des Ternes on rue Poncelet is also noted for its blends and records the details of each customer's choice on a computer. L'Espace Cafe on boulevard de Charonne is even more futuristic. Its computer produces a 'sensorial analysis' of each customer to identify the blend that bests suits their personality. Paris also has a coterie of tea specialists, despite the dreadful French habit of making tea by dangling tea bags into cups of hot, or tepid, water. Perhaps the prettiest tea shop is Mariage Freres on rue du Bourg-Thibourg in the Marais, which boasts 350 different teas from 30 countries, every tea pot you can imagine, a tea room, where you can sample its wares, and even a tiny tea museum. Finally, if you fancy some really smart pots and pans to go with your newly purchased ingredients, you should browse around the specialist catering equipment suppliers at the back of Les Halles. Mora on rue Montmartre prides itself on selling even the most esoteric kitchen utensils. But the most famous of all is Dehillerin on nearby rue Coquilliere, which has been a treasure trove of copper pots and kitchen knives since 1820.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel slips into red MACMILLAN Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forest products company, has cited the unremitting slump in the newsprint market and higher interest payments as the main causes of a first-quarter loss. MacMillan Bloedel's loss before payment of preferred share dividends was CDollars 11m (Dollars 9.2m) or 12 cents a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 3.8m, or zero per share, for the same period a year earlier. Sales increased to CDollars 718.5m from CDollars 677.6m. The company said that pulp prices rose marginally and that markets for lumber and containerboard showed solid improvements. An operating loss of CDollars 400,000 last year was turned into a CDollars 9.1m profit in the latest quarter. Newsprint prices have continued to weaken, and machines have been shut down to adjust to over-supplied markets. In addition, quarterly interest charges jumped to CDollars 34.6m from CDollars 25.8m. Producers have announced further price increases for pulp and for containerboard. The company said lumber markets were clouded by uncertainty over the US housing industry and by the 14 per cent countervailing duty imposed by Washington last month on softwood lumber imports from Canada.</p>

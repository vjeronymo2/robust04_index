			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Gusev, the head of the State Tax </F> Service of the Russian Federation, by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent Nikolay Ulyanov, under the rubric "Firsthand";  place and date not given: "Russia Has More Than 40 Taxes and  Duties: Last Year the Tax Service Collected R38 Trillion and  $380 Million"]    [Text] The Russian State Tax Service lately is  increasingly subjected to attacks by both entrepreneurs and  members of the "fourth estate." Complaints against the tax  service frequently are mutually exclusive and range from  accusations of incompetent tax collection, which hurts the  revenue part of the federal budget, to accusations of  thoughtlessly excessive tax burden on trade and producer  organizations, which hampers the development of entrepreneurship  in Russia. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent asked Vladimir  Gusev, the head of the State Tax Service of the Russian  Federation, to respond to these complaints.    [Ulyanov] Vladimir Vasilyevich, the tax reform in Russia has  been under way for two years. Over this time, a principally new  tax system has been created. What are its general features, and  how similar is it to tax systems of other countries?    [Gusev] Briefly, it is a total of more than 40 types of  taxes, duties, and dues that represent a variety of forms of  taxation; the tax service carries out control over their receipt  into the consolidated federal budget. Largely, the same  principles of tax system design and structure are typical in the  West and in the world practice in general.    The forms of taxation depend on the source and form of  income  (profit, earned income, interest, dividends, etc.); on whether  property itself is taxed (land, real estate, or other property,  etc.) or the act of its transfer (inheritance or gift); income  formed in production or the process of consumption, import and  export of goods in and out of the territory of the country; and  so on. On the basis of the experience of developed countries,  the following main types of taxes have been introduced in  Russia: tax on profit (income), property tax, and value-added  tax, as well as other taxes on goods and services.    Both the level of revenue from the same kind of taxes and  the  tax rates of taxes of the same name differ considerably in  different countries and also depend on the economic situation.  For instance, income tax collected from physical persons in  Russia last year amounted to 12 percent of the total volume of  tax receipts, while in the United States it accounts for more  than 45 percent of budget revenue. In Japan, one-fourth of the  tax burden is composed of the corporate tax (tax on income of  legal entities), which is approximately twice as high as the  share of similar revenue in Great Britain and considerably  higher than in Germany and the United States. The value-added  tax is the highest in Germany and Great Britain. In Russia, 75  percent of the budget revenue currently is formed by tax on  profit and indirect taxes.    [Ulyanov] On the basis of the experience of two years of  work, what changes need to be done to the Russian tax system?    [Gusev] In any case, nothing drastic. In order for the tax  reform to be completely implemented, a certain time is required  for the new tax relations to get established. Nevertheless,  further improvement and fine-tuning of the system are needed, of  course. For instance, currently the State Tax Service together  with the Ministry of Finance is completing the preparation of  the Law on Amendments to the Russian Federation Law on the  Foundations of the Tax System in the Russian Federation.    We propose to considerably expand the right of local bodies  of authority in setting regional and local taxes, to reduce the  multitude of existing types of taxes, and make some other  changes as well. Also submitted to the State Duma for  consideration are the Law on Amendments to Some Russian  Federation Laws With the Aim of Implementing Additional Measures  on Timely and Complete Transfer of Taxes and Other Compulsory  Payments Into the Budget, and draft amendments to seven tax  laws, as well as the draft of the new version of the Law on Road  Funds and a draft Law on Transportation Tax.    Under conditions of acute budget deficit and limited  financial resources, it is important to establish procedures for  forming and controlling the use of state nonbudget funds. In the  estimate of the Russian State Committee on Statistics, the total  volume of means in these funds amounted to 19.9 percent of the  GDP, while the share of all tax revenue comprised 23.4 percent  of the GDP. Hence the necessity to ensure rational use of these  enormous means.    [Ulyanov] Do you feel some resistance to your work on the  part of higher state bodies and regional leadership?    [Gusev] We have established very constructive relations in  the government. All of our proposals--developed jointly with the  Ministry of Finance on amendments and additions to tax laws--the  government, after making certain changes, promptly submits for  the consideration of the State Duma. How the work on the  proposed draft laws will proceed in the State Duma we do not  know yet, since we have no experience of working with it, but,  in my opinion, there are currently no reasons for concern in  this respect.    Relations with Russian Federation components and regions are  another matter. Last year, and actually this one, too, we  frequently had various problems and misunderstandings, and, in a  number of cases, even conflict situations. For instance, last  year 38 regions did not transfer the full amount of VAT into the  federal budget, and 14 regions did not transfer a full amount of  taxes on profit. With some republics (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan,  Karelia, and Yakutia), agreements have been signed on the  transfer of part of the tax collected on their territory into  the federal budget.    Overall in 1993, the budget received more than R38 trillion  and $340 million [as published] in tax revenue. The bulk of the  income was received through tax on profit and indirect taxes  (more than 74 percent of all revenue). Of other types of taxes,  income tax from physical persons provided a steady flow of  revenue. Last year resource fees and property taxes began to  play a more serious role in forming the income part of the  budget.    [Ulyanov] What kind of tax violations did you encounter most  often last year?    [Gusev] The most typical violations were concealing or  understating income, falsifying accounting data, incorrect  application of tax rates and preferences, and depositing foreign  currency earnings in foreign banks for the purpose of tax  evasion. In these conditions, we considered it very important to  monitor the activities of commercial banks, which by their  actions often create conditions that help to conceal profit from  taxation by illegally using the payments due to the budget as  their credit resources. That is, dishonest businessmen deposit  their receipts into accounts not registered with the tax organs.    In addition, tax laws are frequently violated in the part of  tax revenue. For instance, an audit conducted by specialists of  the State Tax Service's central staff in the Ingosstrakh  joint-stock insurance society found understatement of income by  more than R9 billion.    [Ulyanov] To what extent does the tax service personnel meet  the tasks set for the service?    [Gusev] Overall, as of 1 May of this year, the tax system  had  a staff of more than 149,000. Of them, 96.8 percent have higher  or vocational high school education (in the beginning of last  year, this figure was lower--91.8 percent), including 50.9  percent with higher education. The leading educational centers  for training tax service specialists are the Financial  Continuing Education Institute of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Finance, the Financial Academy under the Russian  Federation Government, and professional training centers in St.  Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod, as well as continuing education  courses in Kaluga. Currently similar retraining centers are  being opened in other cities as well.    Successful interaction with the Organization of Economic  Cooperation and Development, the EU Commission, and Denmark's  Ministry of Taxation led to establishing in Moscow in September  of last year an International Training Tax Center for training  specialists for tax organizations. By the way, 300 specialists  already have taken a training course there, and another 900 are  currently studying there. Within the framework of this project  and simply on the basis of bilateral relations, training and  methodology seminars are held for the State Tax Service  personnel in Russia and abroad, with the participation of the  tax services of the United States, Denmark, Sweden, FRG, and  France.    [Ulyanov] Taxpayers quite often complain that they cannot  always find the new tax laws. What does your service do in this  very important sphere of relations with the population?    [Gusev] Such complaints have indeed been received in the  past, and frankly, they still come. The information service does  not yet exist in the scope we have envisaged it. This does not  mean, however, that we do not see the problem and do nothing  about it. No, we have set up our press center, beefed it up with  personnel and technical equipment. But we also have unused  reserves. For instance, this year we plan to begin publishing  VESTNIK NALOGOVOY SLUZHBY, in which we will publish, along with  official documents, comments of our staff on various aspects of  tax practice.</p>

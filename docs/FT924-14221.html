			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Feydeau as tragedy - Malcolm Rutherford goes to the World's End to see Janet Suzman direct NEW theatre in London this week is concentrated in the capital's nooks and crannies. After the magnificent Dutchman by Leroi Jones at the Albany Empire in SE8, a little-known Noel Coward in at the King's Head in Islington and Ibsen in Kentish Town, we have Janet Suzman, no less, directing a Feydeau farce at the far (unfashionable) end of Chelsea's King's Road. Suzman is a most accomplished actress who has played many of her best roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. The pedigree shows in her production. She directs No Flies on Mister Hunter as if she is looking forward to directing Othello or possibly even Otello. Mister Hunter is not an hilarious play. Some of the jokes in this new English version by Peter Kenvyn have clearly been written in. They are about Fortnum and Mason, Chipping Sodbury and the Wigmore Hall. As a farce, it is not in the same league as Feydeau's own A Flea in her Ear or the complete works of Ray Cooney. There is a lot about trousers being lost and people being embarrassingly in the wrong place at the wrong time. Most of the stock elements are there, but as Suzman sees it, Mister Hunter is rather intense. It is a play about marital infidelity, and some of the wounds hurt. The set is black and white, very much in the current fashion of the London stage. Tamsin Greig as Mrs Hunter is elegantly dressed - and never undressed  -in black throughout. Even when the men change to less formal gear, their trousers are in black and white check. The background of black and windows and doors could be equally well designed for a modern production of Mozart as for a Feydeau farce. As a director, Suzman is experimenting, presumably wondering what she might do next. Clearly she knows that one of the vices of the English theatre is that lines are spoken too slowly. Some of the lines here come out breathtakingly fast, yet retain their intelligibility: often the speed enhances it. She also knows when to change pace. In a Noel Coward way, she can put pathos into farce. The ending is terribly earnest. The trouble is that the play is not quite up to it, or at least not up to Suzman's serious treatment. The second half of the second of three acts is quite intolerably long. One wonders what can possibly happen next, there must, one assumes, be some kind of climactic denouement. In fact, nothing much happens at all. There are some wonderful performances, in particular, Alistair Petrie as the impecunious Wodehousian young man. The star is Sally Mates who plays both the maid and the so-called countess. She has a marvellous line about a donkey. The chief pleasure of the evening is watching Suzman on the learning path as a director. She has picked up a farce and seen it as a potential tragedy. It is a pity that you should have to go to World's End Place, which is the precise address, to see it, but perhaps you should. I rather enjoy such out of the way venues. They are where you see some of the most interesting theatre in London. They are not attracting, however, a regular, large theatre-going audience. Somehow we need more established small theatres which are neither the West End nor huge institutions like the Barbican and the National. It would be encouraging if Suzman could launch the Chelsea Centre along such lines where other performers could try their hand at directing. No Flies on Mr Hunter. Chelsea Centre until October 31. 071-352-1967</p>

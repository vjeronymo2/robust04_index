			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Bankers to roll over CIS debt WESTERN bankers agreed yesterday to grant the former Soviet Union a further 90 days to start repaying the principal due on its foreign debt, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The decision was announced by Deutsche Bank, which chairs a 12-bank panel representing 600 banks worldwide, after talks between western bankers and officials of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But the committee won a promise from the CIS representatives to improve controls on their export revenues, a key source of money for servicing the massive debt.</p>

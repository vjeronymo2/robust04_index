			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva 21 April TASS -- The next round of  Georgian-Abkhazian talks is due to be held in Moscow on 10 May.  This was a decision passed in Geneva where the negotiating  teams of the two conflicting sides have discussed over the  latest three days a political status to be granted to Georgia's  breakaway province of Abkhazia, which is the most sensitive and  complicated problem of Abkhazian settlement.    During the meeting, mediated by U.N. and Russian diplomats  and arranged in full accordance with the agreements signed in  Moscow on 4 April, the two sides failed to come to any  compromise.    "So far, we have not reached understanding", said Sokrat  Dzhindzholia [name as received], Abkhazian prime minister and  chief negotiator. In an interview with TASS, he suggested that  the concluding meeting on Friday would hardly break the deadlock  either.    The Georgian delegation does not pin hopes on tomorrow's  meeting either. When asked if there were any chances of signing  some agreement on Friday, Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister  Mikhail Ukleba said it was hardly possible.    On Thursday, the mediators forwarded two draft documents to  the negotiating teams. One of them lists "political and legal  components of all-round settlement," the other provides for  creation of a coordinating commission to solve political issues  in the fields of energy supply, transport, communications and  others. The conflicting sides are to come up with their  preliminary remarks on the documents on Friday. However, the  central discussion is likely to get under way in Moscow on 10  May.    The main "stumbling-block" during the talks was difference  in  approaches by the two sides to the problem of Abkhazia's  political status. The Georgian delegation insists that dialogue  should proceed from the idea of Georgia's territorial integrity.  The Abkhazian team does not agree. "We proceed from the fact  that Abkhazia and Georgia are presently independent of each  other," Dzhindzholia told TASS.    U.N. and Russian diplomats tried to span a bridge between  these two stances by proposing a compromise wording, under which  Abkhazia is to be "a subject vested with sovereign rights within  a union state" built within the boundaries of the former  Georgian Soviet Republic as of 21 December 1991. The warring  parties are to recognize the territorial integrity of "the union  state", the name for which will be chosen in the course of  further negotiations.    As for the proposal for a coordinating commission, Russian  and U.N. experts believe it may comprise four representatives  from each side. It was also suggested that the commission hold  its meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, beginning from 1  June, under the chairmanship of a U.N. envoy and with the  participation of a Russian mediator and a CSCE observer.</p>

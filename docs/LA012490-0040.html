			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Two boys were arrested Tuesday after they set fire to their house and one day  after they and two other boys torched a nearby home, fire officials said.  </P> <P> In the Monday fire, arson investigators said, four boys, three of them age 10  and one age 13, set fire to a residence in the 3500 block of Fairmount Avenue  about 5 p.m., using flammable liquid and matches.  </P> <P> Damage to the one-story house was estimated at about $130,000.  </P> <P> Two of the boys then set fire Tuesday morning to their own house in the 3600  block of 44th Street, fire officials said, causing $50 in damage. That fire was  extinguished by the time firefighters arrived. The two, the 13-year-old and a  10-year-old, were arrested and were being held at Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> It took firefighters 30 minutes to bring the Monday blaze under control. No one  was in the house, Fire Department Sgt. Frank Barone said.  </P> <P> He said neighbors saw the children, who all live in the area, and alerted  police, who then went to the homes of the children and rounded them up. The  youths were released to their parents after Monday's fire because of their age.  </P> <P> The same children vandalized the same house Sunday, Barone said.  </P></p>

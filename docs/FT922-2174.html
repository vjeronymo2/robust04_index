			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (5): How to speed up inquiries - Order-Handling ORGANISATIONS with large volumes of telephone calls for telesales, repair and service enquiries have the apparently conflicting object of blending fast, efficient call-throughput with impressive, personal attention to the caller. This is the compound target of call-centre systems. There are three computer-based functions within the umbrella call-centre title: automatic call-distribution; voice processing and computer-supported telephony. Once distinct, the integration process is now well advanced. Automatic call-distribution, ACD, manages call-input so that every caller is answered as quickly as possible and call-handling efficiency is kept at peak. Voice processing, VP, deals with callers using automatic voice systems, rather than human call-handlers. Computer supported telephony, CST, is the automatic screening for the call-handler of database information about the caller. Both ACD and CST also have outgoing call handling roles. ACD queues incoming callers before answering them. The first-come-first-served principle may be varied by such programmed influences as priorities given to callers using certain telephone numbers and call handlers' specialisations in given subjects or products. Calls are allocated to call-handlers to give an even work flow unless the system is programmed to release certain handlers when possible and bring them back when required. Such reconfiguration may be by supervisor command or automatic as call traffic levels fluctuate, or both, and may involve co-ordinating several sites on a network. The ACD function may be on dedicated hardware or may be optional software in the PBX. Either way, it should provide supervisors with full management information both in real time and as statistical trends. Special Telephone Systems' Supercall series contains both dedicated ACD systems and ACD/PBX hybrids based on their SDX switch and with computer-supported telephony links. The company suggests that in most cases the hybrid answer will suit smaller installations of less than 50 call-handlers. Hybrids include Northern Telecom's Meridian ACD addition to its PBX range of the same name, Mitel's Supervision system for its SX 2000 range and DTS International's ACD 25 package call-handlers. Voice processing may precede the ACD function if callers are simply to be asked their account number, phone number and type of enquiry to route them correctly - although good ACD integration will queue them, putting them to the VP only when they will be forwarded to the relevant call handler without further delay. Linked to a host computer, VP may complete the call where enquirers simply need recorded, mailed or faxed information. Computer-supported telephony, CST, starts with some identification of the caller - such as an up-front VP system would provide - and obtain information about that caller from a host database. BT describes four roles for C Capturing dialled-number information service data from the incoming call and matching with product or service information from the host computer (where each product or service has its own number). Transfer of a call, together with data pertinent to the call, to others without the need for the caller to repeat information or questions. Proactive generation by the host computer of outgoing calls along with presentation of data on the reason for those calls. Matching CLI (calling-line identification) where available, to the host for customer information to be presented to the call handler with the call. One CST-user is Hong Kong Bank. Harris Telecom Systems linked to an IBM mainframe use a recorded announcement to ask callers for their PIN number with which the system locates their customer file. The customer is also asked the required service so that the agent given the call has the customer's name and the nature of the enquiry and has the information on screen to deal with both. Norweb take this one step further. Their Aspect Telecommunications system has links to sales representatives' electronic diaries. Call-handlers make appointments directly and provide sales staff with the information they will need when they arrive. Butlins' reservation centres illustrate the outgoing calls role. After seven days, an Aspect system automatically calls back people who made unconfirmed provisional reservations, allocating the call to a call handler along with a scripted screen to confirm the sale. To obtain data from - and eventually update it back into - a database, CST requires a fast interface. Industry standard interfaces are well supported by vendors - X25, 327OSNA (for IBM, LAPB (typically Digital and Hewlett Packard) and so on. Further, the European Computer Manufacturers' Association is working with other bodies influential on standards issues on sets of CST messages. The next development awaited eagerly by call centre systems purveyors is Caller Line Identification, CLI, by which the public telephone service tells the PBX or telephone the number of the person calling it. The CST system, therefore, can obtain database information on callers still in the queue and can identify, for later callback, any who ring off before getting through.</p>

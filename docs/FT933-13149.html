			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Fall in ads for top jobs bottoms out A FOUR-YEAR decline in the number of jobs for executives advertised in national newspapers has bottomed out, according to figures released by the MSL consultancy today. For the second consecutive quarter recruitment figures stabilised, although demand was still more than 2 1/2 times below the mid-1980s peak, the figures show. Mr Garry Long, MSL chief executive, said: 'The last time we saw this kind of result was in early 1981 as that recession was ending. Three consecutive quarters of stable results preceded the 1980s boom.' MSL said its analysis of more than 4,000 executive jobs advertised showed strong regional variations. There was more activity in London and the south-east in the second quarter of this year than at any time since early 1991 - the region now accounts for 70 per cent of executive jobs advertised in the UK. Yorkshire and Humberside also saw increases in advertising in the second quarter, but declines were registered elsewhere, apart from the north-west and Scotland, which have been relatively stable. The figures illustrated large differences between sectors. High-technology recruitment was up 36 per cent between the first and second quarters of 1993 and 23 per cent up over the year. Retailing rose by 28 per cent and was up 10 per cent from a year previously. Recruitment of executives in the food, drink and tobacco sector fell 9 per cent from the previous quarter but was up 20 per cent on last year. Energy-related industries had the largest fall over the year - down by more than a third. Marketing and sales had the strongest increase - up 40 per cent on the year and 23 per cent between the first and second quarters. Accounting/ finance and personnel had sharp rises in the first quarter, but fell in the second by 8 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.</p>

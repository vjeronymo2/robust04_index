			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 24 May (AFP) -- A group of 17 pro-democracy  activists arrested during an election of delegates to a  constitutional conference called by the military regime,  appeared in court here on Tuesday [24 May] to be formally  charged, a human rights activist said. They were charged with  attempting to disrupt the election, unlawful assembly and  causing a breach of the peace, said the human rights activist,  who is a lawyer.    The arrested activists -- who included Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a  special assistant to Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe, Senator  Bola Tinubu and Olusegun Mayegun ex-president of the National  Association of Nigerian Students -- were arrested in several  parts of Lagos during the election exercise on Monday. Twelve  of them were granted bail after paying a mandatory fine of  10,000 naira (455 dollars) imposed on them by the Yaba  magistrates (lower) court, said the source.    Meanwhile, a 17-year-old pro-democracy activist, Sunday Saji  also arrested on Monday is still being detained, a statement by  the Campaign for Democracy (CD) said. The CD, which is the  umbrella group for about 40 human rights and pro-democracy  associations in Nigeria, called for the immediate release of the  teenager.    Pro-democracy groups called for a boycott of the elections  held at ward level on Monday for the constitutional conference.  Instead they want the military to step down and a sovereign  national conference to be convened to debate the country's  future.</p>

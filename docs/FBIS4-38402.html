			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1720 GMT on 27 May broadcasts an approximate  25-minute recorded speech by Ukraine's Supreme Council Chairman  Oleksandr Moroz. However, due to technical difficulties, the  first 10 minutes of the appearance was missed.    Oleksandr Moroz says there is a possibility that two more  deputy Supreme Council chairmen will be elected, thereby more  fully reflecting the different political forces in the Supreme  Council. He says that it had been hoped that the parliamentary  commissions would be formed quickly. The process is indeed  coming to an end, and given the commissions' composition, he is  sure that they will work fruitfully. However, says Oleksandr  Moroz, political differences have emerged on the issue of the  commission chairmen. According to Moroz, the principle of  proportionality has been taken into account in this, too. But  some groups, above all those of a right-wing tendency, although  not numbering many representatives in parliament, are claiming  and insisting on key positions and key commissions.    Although this may seem boring to viewers, who are waiting  for  some results from parliament, Moroz says:    "We must now create the conditions so that those results  really will appear and so that the changes, which people are  waiting for, occur in our state and in our society. The point  is that we should change policy, first of all policy in the  economic sector. We should move toward reforming the economy,  but along which path? The one we have been going along until  now? No, that is not right. For people understand very well  that this path does not construct one's own economy, this does  not strengthen the state. This destroys production, this robs  the state. Everyone now understands this. And if someone wanted  to reproach me or my supporters, or those who supported my  candidacy, saying that we do not want to agree to a compromise,  we have sufficient arguments to contradict them."    Moroz then cites as examples support for Mykhaylo Kosiv for  the commission for culture issues and support for Hryhoriy  Omelchenko for the commission for issues of the campaign against  corruption and crime, and adds that similar examples of their  compromising may be found in all commissions.    He continues: "Unfortunately, it appears that not everyone  needs the work of the Supreme Council at all. Speculation has  begun today on the matter of collecting signatures for the  dissolution of the Supreme Council and the introducton of direct  presidential rule. Nowhere in the world can one introduce the  practice whereby, while the president's activity is coming to an  end, he would risk introducing direct presidential rule. There  are no grounds for it anyway. Moreover, there is no doubt that  we will form working bodies of the Supreme Council on Tuesday 31  May, that we will make, so to speak, a base for legislative  work, and in order of their urgency the draft laws, which people  are waiting for, will start to work.    "And to demand the introduction of direct presidential rule  now, with unrest within society, which is caused above all by  the collapse of the economy, unfair privatization, and many  other ills, is at the very least irresponsible. I think the  electors will understand that this is socially conditioned, that  someone is directing their representatives toward such steps. I  am convinced that the president would not resort to such steps  and that he is not involved in this. I and he do not in fact  have differences on the matter of the important steps which both  the executive and legislative authorities must now take. It is  above all about forming a strong executive power."    Moroz adds that a new Cabinet of Ministers and prime  minister  should be appointed urgently without wasting any time, and  without waiting for the presidential election. He adds:    "One can say, for instance, that the president has now  assumed responsibility for executive power, this is  understandable. But the combination of the functions of  president and head of government, and also the incomplete nature  of the vertical structure of executive authority, confirm the  necessity of concentrating power in the Cabinet of Ministers, in  particular I mean executive power. And I am convinced that the  Supreme Council supports such approaches, and that the president  also agrees in principle with these approaches."    Moroz dwells on the methods used by those not wishing the  Supreme Council to work efficiently, for example, not  registering for the parliament sitting. If this method  continues to be used, Moroz says he will ask the media to print  the names of deputies refusing to register. In another case  Moroz can see that a deputy from a right-wing group wants to  cooperate, but is dependent on a certain political force.    Moroz says that he promised deputies today that the  organizational process would be completed on 31 May, that he  would submit candidacies for heads of commissions, and that the  candidacies would be confirmed by voting, taking into account  the proposals of all groups as much as possible, but bearing in  mind that there can be no ideal solution.    He continues: "While understanding the complex situation in  our state, I and my deputies have to intervene in specific  matters, in the life of the regions, and not only Crimea, not  only in the problems of, for instance, agriculture, preparations  for the winter, problems of the energy complex, problems of the  banking system. We also have to get involved in these problems,  although I understand that to some extent these issues are more  for the executive power to deal with. But now such intervention  is truly needed, because those processes which ensure the  freedom of production, facilitate commodity turnover, and an  increase and consolidation of the budget should be speeded up."    Moroz concludes by saying: "Appealing to you, esteemed  electors, I would like to ask you, please support those deputies  who conscientiously work in the Supreme Council, who do not  endeavor to resort to speculation, to disrupt the sittings, but  honestly fulfil their obligations to you. I am convinced that  their example will be a good model for other deputies, so that  from next week the Supreme Council finally works constructively  and efficiently, as current time demands, and as envisaged by  the status of the state's highest legislative body. Thank you  for your attention."</p>

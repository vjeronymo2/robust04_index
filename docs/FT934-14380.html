			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Property: Agents who fail to move houses MANY French agents were keen enough when it came to finding properties for British buyers in the heady days of the late 1980s, but few showed much enthusiasm for marketing them when, bitten by recession, so many owners wanted to sell. That is the opinion of London estate agent Maurice Lazarus. He wonders how many hundreds of British owners must have French properties they would like to sell but whose particulars are getting dog-eared on a French agent's files because he does nothing to promote them Lazarus, who runs Domus Abroad, suggests part of the problem is that the smaller French agencies do not usually present re-sale properties in a way that attracts British buyers. They do not, for instance, produce a spread of colour photographs, as do many British agents, relying instead on a photo-copied sheet. Referring to properties in square metres, instead of sizing them by by the number of bedrooms in the British way, might be a good system but confuses UK buyers, says Lazarus. So does the practice of referring to 'habitable areas.' Lazarus's main criticism, however, is that many French agents wait for buyers to come to them and do not seek purchasers actively in the way that many British agents do. Yet, he feels there is a market - albeit small - that is worth attracting. One possibility is that people getting little on investments elsewhere might be prepared to put money in a holiday home or something bringing in rental income. 'Such properties are getting a good return just now,' he says. Lazarus suggests that re-sales put on the French market by other Britons might suit very well in such cases, adding that his agency would be happy to try selling properties in France for UK owners who have been unable to find a purchaser through a French agent. He stresses he is not criticising French agents, some of whom work very hard and drive long distances to show people property. Indeed, he would be offering his service in co-operation with agents and notaries in France. But his agency's approach would be very different. 'By working closely with the seller, we are able to produce a simple but comprehensive brochure with colour photographs, and the essential information always sought - but rarely found - by prospective buyers looking for property in France,' he says. Lazarus stresses that his agency can take on only properties that it considers to be priced sensibly, with a reasonable chance of selling. Such properties would be offered to potential buyers already on the agency's file and would be included in its corporate programme of exhibitions, advertising and public relations activity. An individual marketing programme could be organised if a seller wished. Domus Abroad (071-431 4692) charges a commission of 5 per cent, or a minimum of Pounds 2,300 - but only if a sale results.</p>

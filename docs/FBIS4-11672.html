			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the APF on the 18th anniversary of Land </F> Day]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Masses of our militant Palestinian people, sons of our people in  the diaspora, sons of our Arab and Islamic nation, and free men  of the world, 30 March 1994 is the 18th anniversary of Land Day.  Our heroic Palestinian people are facing the ugliest conspiracy  to liquidate their national cause through the Oslo and Cairo  agreements in which 'Arafat gave in to all the Zionist-U.S.  dictates and conditions, relinquished the Palestinian people's  historical and national rights, and canceled all their  sacrifices over 70 years.    The Land Day anniversary this year falls on the 40th day of  the massacre in the Ibrahimi mosque in steadfast Hebron. This  massacre highlighted the reality and essence of the  Zionist-'Arafatist peace when scores of glorious martyrs fell,  and hundreds were wounded. The fascist Zionist army followed  this with other massacres in the same city and the other  occupied territories in response to the wave of popular wrath  that unfolded throughout the occupied territories and which  resulted in more heroes, martyrs, and wounded.    This anniversary this year also coincides with the uprising  of our militant masses in the 1948 occupied territories. This  confirms the unity of our people, the unity of their land and  fate, and their endless readiness for struggle to foil all the  Zionist schemes to liquidate their national cause.    Masses of our people, and sons of the land: This land has  been yours since time immemorial. The signature of a defeatist  traitor will not constitute an edict that changes the name of  the owner of the land. The land is yours, and yours is the sea,  the river, the valley, and the mountain. Yours are the oranges,  grapes, figs, and olives.    O Hebron, the deep wound of Palestine, the mother of  martyrs,  we shed tears on your doorstep but we will not give in. The  pledge remains as it. O Hebron, you remain in the lap of  Palestine and in the heart of the nation. The series of  massacres the occupation army has carried out and is  perpetrating under direct orders from Rabin -- 'Arafat's partner  in the Washington, Oslo, Taba, Cairo agreement -- have stepped  up the Palestinian popular call for the resignation of 'Arafat  and his deviationist clique, for halting the farce of  negotiations, and for toppling the U.S.-Zionist settlement  course. The massacres have also led to the stepping up of calls  for the withdrawal of the negotiating delegation, for the  dismantling of the settlements, for international protection for  the sons of our people throughout the entire occupied  territories, for their right to determine their fate on their  national soil, and for toppling the deviationist clique and its  main emblem, which have placed our people and cause in this  dilemma. The recent agreement with the Zionist enemy has  constituted a cover for the Hebron massacre and what took place  before it. All this confirms the unequivocal fact that  coexistence with this enemy is impossible and that the struggle  against it will continue.    O people of Palestine inside and in the diaspora, o people  of steadfast and mujahid Hebron: The popular situation caused  by the massacre, and the militant momentum the heroic intifadah  is witnessing -- in spite of the comprehensive siege and  systematic acts of mass killing at the hands of Rabin's army  gangs, 'Arafat's partner -- force the Palestinian and Arab  nationalist and Islamic forces to understand the features of  this stage and to work to develop struggle and jihad to higher  and more effective standards on the ground. They must close  ranks and adopt militant programs inside and outside the  occupied territories in order to pull the rug out from under the  feet of the capitulative leadership, to confront the onslaught,  to restore respect to struggle and jihad, to put to use the  furious popular sentiment, and to work to topple 'Arafat and his  deviationist and relinquishing clique on the path of continued  struggle and jihad in order to realize all objectives of the  Palestinian people to attain full liberation and independence.    Our observation of Land Day and the 40th day since the  martyrdom at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque reemphasizes our  adherence to the unity of the people, the unity of land, and the  unity of blood that we will not relinquish no matter what the  pressures, difficulties, and obstacles might be. We pledge to  the souls of the martyrs -- the martyrs of Land Day in the  Galilee, and the martyrs of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron -- to remain faithful to their pure blood. We in the APF  [Alliance of Palestinian Forces] emphasize that there will be no  peace in the region without the collapse of the sin represented  in the presence of Israel in the heart of our Arab and Islamic  nation. We promise our people that we will carry out serious  and unionist actions, burn the occupied land under the  occupiers' feet, and topple the symbols of relinquishment,  capitulation, and treason.    On these two anniversaries, we ask our people to carry out  the following activities:    1. In the occupied territories: To escalate the intifadah  and emphasize the unity of land and people.    2. In the diaspora: To observe a general and full strike on  Wednesday morning 30 March 1994 in all camps and Palestinian  residential areas in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. To stage a  sit-in in front of the offices of the International Committee of  the Red Cross in the diaspora countries on the morning of 5  April. We also call on the masses of our people to participate  in the popular rally the APF will sponsor at al-Nujum Cinema in  al-Yarmuk Camp, southern Damascus, at 1800 on Tuesday 5 April  1994, and to take part in all rallies that will be held in  Amman, Beirut, Aleppo, Hims, and all Palestinian camps.    O relatives of noble martyrs: Your martyrs are in heaven and  will be a mercy for you and the nation. They will remain in the  hearts. Hail to the souls of the our martyrs in Hebron, the  Galilee, and Gaza, and all martyrs of Palestine and nation.  Hail to all sons of our people in the homeland and abroad.  Shame and disgrace to the fascist Zionists, shame and disgrace  to 'Arafat and his deviationist clique, glory to the martyrs,  victory to the fighting masses.  [Signed] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces</p>

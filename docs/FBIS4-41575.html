			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said today it  was premature to discuss the possibility early elections.  Commenting on the proposal to extend the powers of the  parliament and the president for a second term Rybkin said that  first people should feel the economy is being stabilized and  life improved as a result of actions taken by the Federal  Assembly (parliament - IF) and the government. The proposal to  extend the president's and parliament's powers was put forward  by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko.    Before leaving for Siberia and the Far East Rybkin answered  questions during a press conference by phone organized by the  Russian State Duma's press service and Interfax.    Rybkin said that the legislative process must be seen to be  working.    He said if the work was properly carried out and the  legislative bodies of at least two thirds of the federation's  constituent members spoke for this, the chamber could discuss  the postponement of elections. However, he added that it was  unreasonable to speak on the postponement of elections in  advance.    Rybkin stressed that during his trips across Russian regions  voters kept saying they were tired of elections.    Commenting on the recommendation of the State Duma to  suspend  the president's anti-crime decree, Rybkin said the president had  been asked not to enact the decree until a resolution on its  implementation is adopted. Rybkin stressed that the decree was  not simple and that its basic idea -- the fight against crime --  could not be rejected.    Rybkin said he was sure that the decree would soon become  law. He repeated that the State Duma had decided to set up a  working group in order to draft the appropriate law with the  participation of representatives of the president, the  government, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office.    When asked his opinion on proposals to declare direct  presidential rule in the country, Rybkin said he doubted that  Boris Yeltsin would introduce it and that the whole concept was  inadmissible in a country trying to establish the rule of law.</p>

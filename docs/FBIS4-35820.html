			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdallah al-Franji, head of the PLO office </F> in Bonn, by Hero Buss; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Buss] Good morning, Mr. Al-Franji.    [Al-Franji] Good morning.    [Buss] Mr. Al-Franji, yesterday, REUTERS ran the following  statement, and I quote: Israel has called on PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat to tackle effectively the problems of the  self-administrated areas Gaza Strip and Jericho. Regarding  'Arafat's complaints about international financial aid, which  was promised but has not been provided yet, a spokesman for the  Israeli Government reacted with criticism and said that 'Arafat  had acted like a beggar instead of taking action. Government  spokesman Drori said that it was time for 'Arafat to stop  behaving like a beggar and stop whining, and that he should  tackle the problems there effectively. End quote.    Mr. Al-Franji, apart from the polemical rhetoric, the  Israelis seem to be worried.    [Al-Franji] I would say that this is not the right way for  Israel to deal with 'Arafat. 'Arafat is a partner in the peace  process in the region, and 'Arafat has actually done a lot to  advance the peace process to the current stage. Of course, the  problems left by Israel after 27 years of occupation are  enormous. One cannot solve these problems overnight. We have  financial problems. The countries that promised to support the  Palestinian people insist on certain conditions that cannot be  fulfilled so easily. The Israelis, who took a lot of money off  the Palestinians in those years, and who committed themselves to  pay parts of this money to the Palestinians and to 'Arafat, have  not done so. This is why 'Arafat cannot overcome the problems  alone. And it is understandable that 'Arafat cannot and will  not cope with the problems alone.    [Buss] Is there a practical reason for 'Arafat and the PLO  leadership not to have moved yet to the now autonomous  Palestinian areas?    [Al-Franji] One reason is that 'Arafat has been ill for a  week. Actually, it is the second time he has been ill. This is  the only reason that our move has been delayed. Nevertheless,  we have sent some people there, and we have taken over  responsibility in the Gaza Strip, and things are working,  working not too badly. One has hardly heard of people being  injured or killed in this region since we took over. I hope  that 'Arafat gets better soon and that he will soon be able to  assume his duties.    [Buss] Is there anything at all that the PLO leadership  might be able to administer or solve better from Tunis than from  a base in the autonomous regions?    [Al-Franji] Certainly not. Any Palestinians bearing  responsibility within the PLO would like to go there right away.  However, there are many conditions that are making this  difficult. And these conditions are one part of the agreement  between us and the Israelis. If I were to react today to the  declaration of the Israeli or the Israeli Government Spokesman  Drori, then we would thwart this peace process [dann werden wir  diesen Prozess des Friedens platzen lassen], which is why we  have to deal with one another with patience, with a sense of  responsibility, and with understanding. This is what I cannot  see on the part of some Israelis. There are other Israelis who,  of course, do not talk like that official Israeli spokesman or  say such things as he just has.    [Buss] Could you elaborate on that? What exactly is it that  could thwart the process?    [Al-Franji] I do not want to talk about the failure of this  process. All I would like to say is that we are now bearing  responsibility together, and that we must help one another. It  is very difficult. It is not so simple that one could say:  Well, the PLO must now rapidly get all the problems under  control left by the Israelis after 27 years of occupation. We  cannot do that. We must get help from the Israelis and from the  Arab world, and help from Europe and the United States. I  cannot imagine that the United States, which promised a lot and  bears great responsibility for this process, that it will remain  so passive toward us. One must not really do that. Peace in  this region is not just a matter for the Palestinians and  Israelis alone, it is a matter for the international community.  And I hope that the other parties will now assume their share  in responsibility so that the PLO will be able to get the  problems in the occupied territories under control.    [Buss] As far as the Israeli heritage, the legacy in  Palestine is concerned, people in Israel hold a different view.  It has been said, for example, that one even considerably  extended the infrastructure in the formerly occupied territories.    [Al-Franji] Well, I do not want to discuss what the Israelis  did and what they did not do. It was an ugly time, during which  we could not see the Israelis as a -- let us say -- liberator,  or a helper. We did not act any differently from other peoples  that were occupied, for example. We are glad about it. Of  course, the transition is very difficult and complicated. The  problem is not that the Palestinians and the PLO are  unqualified, but simply that we lack the funds. For many years  we spent money on the occupied territories, and we -- and not  the Israelis -- continued to build up many things during the era  of occupation. We built the universities there, we established  the committees, the organizations, the trade unions, everything,  while the Israelis had laws that prevented us from operating  these institutions in the appropriate way.    [Buss] Mr. Al-Franji, let us briefly talk about the  financial aid. It has been said that you were promised $2.4  billion in aid, money that is badly needed. Who promised how  much, and who is now unwilling to pay?    [Al-Franji] The United States has promised a lot -- $500  million. The European Community promised $600 million, the  World Bank, and many other institutions also promised money.  The way in which the donor countries or the countries that  wanted to provide the money are dealing with one another is not  smooth enough so that one party would say: we now give the  Palestinians so much money for the next two or three months or  the coming six months to make sure they can work. They also  have difficulties and are facing complications, and one can say  that there is not a single organization that would be  responsible for all the donors that have so far provided money  or intend to do so. On the part of the Palestinians, we have  not yet nominated all members of the government that is to  assume responsibility. However, we hope that we can do that  within a week, and we are also hoping that the World Bank will  not continue to place its conditions so firmly and difficult on  the head of the Palestinians [passage as heard] so that we will  be able to take the necessary steps to overcome this difficult  situation.</p>

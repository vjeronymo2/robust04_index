			<p>BFN     [Text] Dushanbe, April 11 (AFP)--Gunmen using submachine  guns fired Monday on the home here of Tajikistan's Foreign  Minister Rashid Alimov, who is away in Moscow negotiating with  the Central Asian state's Islamic-based opposition, authorities  said. They said security forces cordoned off the district after  the attack that did not claim any victims.    A senior ministry official said the minister had good reason  to be concerned about safety, since influential sectors of the  neo-communist regime objected to the parley with the opposition.  Alimov was foremost among government members in following up a  Russian suggestion for peace talks with the opposition, which  has mounted raids from neighbouring Afghanistan since the  neo-communist takeover in 1992.    Victims of the raids have included Tajikistan's deputy prime  minister Muzabsho Nazarshoyev who was killed here March 11 and  Alimov's brother-in-law who was murdered in January.</p>

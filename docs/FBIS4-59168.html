			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic </F> Union of Kurdistan, by Gabriel Bertinetto; place and date not  given: "If Saddam Falls, I Will Give Up the Kurdish Dream"]    [Text] "Uniting all the Kurds under a single state by  overcoming the current artificial borders remains the common  dream of our people. But politics is not made of dreams. We  are therefore aiming at a federal and democratic state inside  the current Iraqi borders, as long as the country is freed from  Saddam's dictatorship." This is how Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani, who was received yesterday by  President Scalfaro and trade union and political leaders  (including [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary Occhetto),  summarizes up the objective of his party, the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan, in this interview.    [Bertinetto] Mr. Talabani, the news that comes from Iraqi  Kurdistan is not very positive. In addition to the continuing  economic crisis, there are reports of divergencies and even of  some armed clashes between your people and supporters of  Barzani. What is happening?    [Talabani] In effect there are difficulties. Despite the  considerable progress made in relaunching agriculture,  industrial activity is stagnant, also because of the three-sided  embargo of which we are the victims: the internal embargo  imposed upon us by Baghdad, that of the neighboring countries,  and the international embargo decreed upon by the United Nations  against Iraq (which, though directed at Saddam, also involves  Kurdistan). The same holds true for the production of  electricity and for infrastructure work in general, which are at  a very low level. Among our major problems is the forced exile  of 300,000 Kurdish people who the Iraqi authorities are  preventing from returning. As for the incidents between our  forces and those of our allies, these are restricted to certain  areas and have been caused by the mistakes made by the local  leaders of the Democratic Party, as Barzani himself admitted.  The situation is now getting back to normal.    [Bertinetto] What do the two parties agree and disagree on?    [Talabani] There is accord on participating in an alliance  whose objectives are the democratization of society, defense  from outside aggression, and the consolidation of a regional  self-government. There is disagreement on the types of reforms  to be implemented. In general, one can say that a national  democratic trend and a social democratic trend are face-to-face.    [Bertinetto] How do you judge the support given by the  United  Nations to Iraqi Kurdistan?    [Talabani] I would say that not enough is being done. A lot  of money has in fact been spent, but a lot has also been wasted  in the bureaucratic management of aid. We would prefer to see a  decision on the use of funds made in coordination with our local  government. If this does not happen, I do not think that it is a  matter of our not being trusted, since all the foreign visitors  recognize the fact that we have made great steps ahead.  Especially if you consider that we started from practically  nothing after the devastation caused by the Iraqi military,  which also left us with 22 million mines spread throughout our  territory, many of which are Italian made.    [Bertinetto] Kurdistan is currently much more than an  autonomous region but much less than an independent state. What  would you like to become in the future?    [Talabani] It depends. If the dictatorship were to fall, we  would be in favor of a democratic and federal state that would  comprise the Kurds and Iraqis. If tyranny remains, the Kurds  will have to seek other paths.    [Bertinetto] Do you think that Saddam is still strong?    [Talabani] Things are worsening in Iraq. Discontent is  increasing among the people and even in the Army. However, you  must not overlook the groups in the Armed Forces and the police  that consistently pledge absolute loyalty to Saddam.    [Bertinetto] Let us assume that the dictatorship is  overthrown. Would the creation of a federal state mean  abandoning the historical project of uniting all the Kurds in a  single state between the existing borders of Iraq, Iran, and  Turkey?    [Talabani] It is a known fact that Kurdistan was  artificially  divided after the World War I. We Kurds are the victims of a  conspiracy against us. However, we must be realistic. At  present it is impossible to modify the borders between all the  countries in the area. The unity of all the Kurds does remain  the final objective, because a divided nation cannot give up its  dream to be united. It remains inside us, but it is a dream,  and a responsible political leadership cannot act on the basis  of dreams.    [Bertinetto] Last year you tried to mediate between the  Turkish Goverment and the PKK [Workers' Party of Kurdistan]  rebels. A truce was reached, but then, unfortunately, fighting  started again, and it was even bloodier than before. Why?    [Talabani] One of the reasons was the death of President  Turgut Ozal. He was one of the Turkish authorities most willing  to negotiate. One also can say the the atmosphere was still not  ready for a political solution.    [Bertinetto] The Turkish Kurds, the PKK, and affiliated  groups complain that Europe is not showing any interest in their  cause, and in this way they justify the often clamorous, and  sometimes violent, protest demonstrations they incite in the  cities of countries where there are massive numbers of Kurdish  emigrants, primarily Germany. What do you think?    [Talabani] I do not think that Europe has shown little  interest in the Kurdish issue. The European Council and the  European Parliament voted on resolutions that call for human  rights to be respected, Germany has stopped the supply of  weapons to Ankara, and the Bundestag has asked for a political  solution to the conflict. Perhaps all of this is not enough,  perhaps certain Kurdish groups expect more, but this cannot  justify the violation of laws in countries in which they are  guests, because in this way they would lose support and sympathy.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SURPRISE: SYD STRAW RISES TO ANOTHER CHALLENGE . . .  </P> <P> Singer Syd Straw must have a knack for placing herself in challenging  situations. Three years ago, the loosely constituted group the Golden Palominos  played to audiences expecting its on-disc stars such as John Lydon and Jack  Bruce to front the band. Instead, they got Straw, and found it wasn't a bad  trade at all. Her current debut album "Surprise" finds her musical and lyrical  vision riding herd over a fat roster of musicians who are known for packing  their own encompassing visions, including Michael Stipe, John Doe, Van Dyke  Parks and Richard Thompson.  </P> <P> Though confined to a short set before an unacquainted audience when opening for  Adrian Belew at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Sunday, the willowy,  pig-tailed singer connected with a set that was nothing short of fearless in  its mix of powerful, personally felt music and unfettered sense of play. Backed  by a quartet that included Dave Alvin and X's D.J. Bonebrake, Straw's  performance was both muscular and cerebral, with songs by such disparate  sources as Sons of the Pioneers and X coming off as her own fresh possessions.  </P> <P> Straw's lyrics and delivery can seem precious at times -- "Unanswered  Questions" sounded like an unholy cross between Carly Simon and T Bone Burnett  -- and on a couple of songs the arrangements seemed half-baked. But those were  minor flaws compared to Straw's fresh, informed take on popular American music,  which draws on Stephen Foster rather then David Foster.  </P> <P> Straw and headliner Belew also play two shows at the Roxy tonight. -- JIM  WASHBURN  </P></p>

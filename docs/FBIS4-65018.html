			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yvonne Van Der Heijden report: "Belgium To Exchange </F> Economic and Social Data With China"]    [Excerpt] Belgium has moved closer to the center of  economic decisionmaking in China. The [Belgian] Economic  Affairs Ministry has signed an agreement with China's State  Planning Committee to exchange information and experiences.  Belgium is the first country to have signed an agreement of  this kind with the People's Republic of China.    "It is an interesting agreement. Through the more intensive  high-level contacts, we will both come to know and trust each  other better. We ultimately will obtain a better understanding  of how the economic system operates in China and also vice  versa," Cabinet Chief Gilles de Kerchove said two days ago in an  interview with DE FINANCIEEL EKONOMISCHE TIJD in Beijing. He  believes this is evident from the experiences gained through a  similar agreement with the Japanese Ministry of International  Trade and Industry.    Mr. de Kerchove signed the agreement last Friday [6 May] on  behalf of Melchior Wathelet, deputy prime minister and minister  of economic affairs. Chen Jinhua, president of the State  Planning Committee, signed for China. The agreement includes  provisions for an exchange of economists and scientists to  undertake scientific research. Seminars also will be held on  specific topics relating to economic and social developments in  the two countries. China has reached agreements of a similar  nature with three other industrial countries, Japan, South  Korea, and Germany, but these are not laid down in writing.  [passage omitted]</p>

The drug is called DNCB, and  has been used for decades against warts.    ``People in San Francisco infected with the HIV virus have  used DNCB on their own for years without any formal approval  from the health care system,'' said Linda Morfeldt-Mansson, a  physician at Danderyd Hospital, who specializes in infectious  diseases, and who is a member of the network of Swedish HIV  physicians.    ``Until now, the drug has only been the subject of a single  study, which was conducted in the United States. This study,  however, was based on such a narrow base that we hardly can draw  any conclusions from it,'' she noted.    The Swedish study is supposed to include 200 HIV patients  from all over Sweden.    ``We will also include a number of patients who are  seriously  ill and who are not expected to survive for very long with the  use of normal treatment methods. They may also test DNCB if they  so choose. It is for their sake that we are eager to start the  treatment as soon as possible,'' said Linda Morfeldt-Mansson.</p>

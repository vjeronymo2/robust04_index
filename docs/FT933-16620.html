			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Crest Nicholson reduces interim deficit to Pounds 3.9m CREST Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder, incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.9m in the six months to April 30. The outcome compared with a restated loss of Pounds 4.39m last time; figures for both periods were calculated on the basis of the new FRS 3 accounting standard. Directors said that in the light of the outcome they had decided it would not be appropriate to pay an interim dividend but would review the position at the end of the year. After all deductions, the group incurred a retained deficit of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 4.55m), equivalent to losses per share of 4.84p (5.95p). Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, said the group had made a loss despite a 'robust improvement' in the UK housing market since the new year. Housing sales and reservations were up about 15 per cent since the end of October. The rate of recovery, however, had slowed since the end of May. Housing operations made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.45m, against losses last time of Pounds 1.64m. Mr Callcutt said that this was a creditable performance given that the first half, traditionally, is weaker for house sales. The results were also helped by a 20 per cent reduction in overheads compared with a year ago. Crest was let down by its commercial property operations which incurred a Pounds 3.9m pre-tax loss (Pounds 1.45m loss) and by its construction division which lost Pounds 255,000 compared with profits of Pounds 2.55m. The market for commercial property had improved in recent weeks. During the past three months Crest had agreed to let or sell 161,000 sq ft of the 263,000 sq ft of premises either built or under construction. Mr Callcutt said most of the deals were for letting but this should make the sale of the properties easier to achieve. Sale proceeds would be used to reduce net debt, which by the period end had climbed from Pounds 54m to Pounds 72.1m, equivalent to a rise in gearing from 53 per cent to 71 per cent. Borrowings were well within the company's bank facilities of Pounds 150m, said Mr Callcutt. Despite the rise in debt, interest charges were reduced from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 3.29m reflecting lower UK interest rates. COMMENT Crest's performance in surviving the recession intact is to be congratulated. Borrowings, which at one stage exceeded Pounds 110m, have been steadily reduced through property disposals, land sales and sales of non-core businesses. It is a case of so far so good. Further progress will depend upon the company's ability to make additional property sales to reduce debt to a target level of Pounds 50m. It may also need some housing land sales if it is to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m this year to justify payment of a small final dividend. There is still ground to be made up and those wishing to invest in a housing recovery may get better value by looking elsewhere.</p>

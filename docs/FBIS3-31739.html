I am an active military  man, I am enjoined by the Constitution not to get involved in  politics and I do not even intend to do that. Therefore, this  war is waged unilaterally, without an adversary. All I can do  is clarify things for the public, through decent means that are  specific to the army. The accusations against me are gross  inventions." This is a statement made by the minister of  national defense, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, and was  caused by the "war" being waged against the leadership of the  Ministry of National Defense by Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor  through the pages of ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA.    Certainly it is unpleasant that such a stage has been  reached. In similar situations, the prime minister of a Western  government would have supported or dismissed one of the members  of the government that he is heading, depending on whether the  respective person had been accused without justification or had  been accused on the basis of fact. Mr. Spiroiu chose a  dignified way, rejecting point by point all the accusations  against him. The Military Prosecuting Magistracy's  investigation of the "Kent" affair has established that the  renting of the storage rooms that belonged to the Autonomous  Public Corporation "Romtechnica" (which is not subordinated to  the Ministry of National Defense) was legal, the only violations  resulted from customs tax evasion by Lebanese citizen Nassar  Elias, who used fake stamps. The military cadres who are guilty  of negligence, through which customs evasion could have been  committed, have been removed from their positions and turned  over to the appropriate legal authorities. The money  representing the damage to the Romanian state was recovered  entirely and Nassar Elias, after being arrested, paid a  substantial penalty. The Lebanese citizen was able to benefit  from the respective facilities because he was the brother of the  person who represented Romania's best client, covering 95  percent of the "special" trade that any arms producing country  practices.    The Ministry of National Defense leadership was also accused  of reducing the country's combat capability, whereas Romania did  nothing except reducing combat technology in accordance with the  provisions of the programs established under international  treaties approved in the parliament. The minister of defense  also denied those accusations regarding the import of tanks from  Israel. On the contrary, our country exports tanks, and Romania  has not imported anything from Israel except special technology  required for the modernization of MIG-21s in Bacau, and it seems  that Israel is the country that will purchase the Romanian  IAR-109 that is currently being tested. The army's supply of  equipment is ensured 74 percent by the national defense  industry, which guarantees to fulfill export orders and provide  products intended for civilian use. Mr. Spiroiu affirmed that  he could not possibly damage the prestige of the army through an  argument with Vadim Tudor at various district Tribunals, and  therefore, he preferred the action that he has currently chosen.  The only effect of Vadim's attacks was that, as was said at the  news conference, "nobody in the Military Command reads ROMANIA  MARE anymore."    Regarding the Partnership for Peace, Mr. Spiroiu said that  Romania derives no advantage whatever from being the first to  sign the document. There follows now the drafting of the  presentation documents (a stage finalized by the Ministry of  National Defense) after which, in the second half of this year,  the partnership "contract" will be signed. Certainly, the whole  nation is concerned about what is currently happening in the  former Yugoslavia. Eventually, a NATO intervention seems  imminent. In this case, it is well known that international  accords provide that, in the event of an intervention of NATO  troops in a certain country the neighbors of that country should  not become involved. The National Defense Ministry leadership  believes that in case of Sarajevo one should take into  consideration only political-diplomatic solutions.    Romania has signed seven international military accords. As  was stated at the news conference, another accord with Spain  will be signed in Madrid in March. Mr. Spiroiu said that  relations with Russia have continued uninterrupted. An accord  with that country was missed twice. Once after the Moscow coup  and the second time because of demonstrations in front of the  Russian Embassy in Bucharest, where the Russian defense minister  was expected. "An accord that is similar to the ones signed  with the Netherlands and Spain will soon be concluded also with  Russia," Mr.Spiroiu affirmed.    The restructuring process and the reform in the army also  depend on the speed of implementation of the army law, the law  on the status of conscripts, and people employed on a contract  basis, as well as of four other specific laws. General Spiroiu  claimed that structures similar to NATO will be achieved, that  is, highly mobile units that would participate in actions under  the aegis of the United Nations and CSCE.    Referring to a documentary broadcast on 30 December 1993 [on  Marshal Antonescu's execution], the defense minister said that  he did not know about it, although he is a government member and  the respective documentary was produced by the government  studios. As is known, the rehabilitation of General Antonescu  provoked a certain reaction from Moses Rosen [chief rabbi of the  Jewish Community of Romania], a reaction to which the minister  of national defense did not respond because the military  historians will do it and they will soon publish four volumes of  documents referring to that troubled period in Romania's history.    It is worth mentioning that the Romanian Army contributed  numerous documents to the Holocaust Museum in New York [city as  published].</p>

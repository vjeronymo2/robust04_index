			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> REWARD SET FOR RUMOR SPREADER  </P> <P> An Australian bank today offered an $8,300 reward in an effort to catch the  source of rumors that the bank was near collapse.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Brisbane-based Metway Bank said he believed the bank had been  the target of a deliberate and malicious campaign that should not go  unpunished.  </P> <P> "We do not see why the company should be exposed to this sort of scurrilous  lies," the spokesman said by telephone.  </P> <P> The reward would be paid for information leading to the conviction of the  culprits, he said.  </P> <P> Nervous depositors lined up at branches of Metway this week when rumors began  circulating about the bank's financial health.  </P> <P> The Reserve Bank, Australia's central bank, stemmed the rush Thursday when it  assured depositors that Metway is sound and that speculation about its  stability was unfounded.  </P></p>

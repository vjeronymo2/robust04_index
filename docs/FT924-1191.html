			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Home Office reverses prison pay decision PRISON service staff who transfer to the private sector if the management of Strangeways prison, Manchester, is contracted out will retain existing pay and conditions, the Home Office conceded yesterday. Unions say this is a further example of confusion in the contracting out process created by the 1981 employment protection legislation, passed to comply with a 1977 European directive. They say the government's efforts to contract out the management of Strangeways are in disarray. Strangeways has been rebuilt after suffering serious riot damage in 1990, and the government has asked its prisons department and the private sector to tender for the contract to manage it. If a company wins the Strangeways contract, it will become the first established prison under private management. The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations mean companies may not cut the pay and conditions of staff when an 'undertaking' is 'transferred' between employers in acquisitions, mergers and when some public services are contracted out. Sir Clive Whitmore, Home Office permanent secretary, has told unions and contractors the department had originally been advised that the regulations would not apply to the Strangeways contract. The Home Office said the new situation was that the regulations would apply. It added: 'This stems from conflicting legal advice being received on what appears to be a very complex issue.' It will consider whether the regulations apply to future tenders on a case-by-case basis. Unions say prisons will be far less attractive propositions to private companies if they have to honour existing conditions of employment and union recognition agreements. Uncertainty over whether transfer of undertakings regulations apply to contracting out of public services has caused confusion among councils, public service unions, lawyers and contractors. Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, last month dismissed the discussion about the application of the regulations as 'a complete red herring'. He said the regulations applied only when an undertaking was transferred. Whether they applied when delivery of a government service was awarded to a private-sector tender or when a council service was contracted out would depend on the facts of the case. York Crown Court was told yesterday that a remand prisoner was tortured and injected with heroin by other inmates at the Wolds remand centre - Britain's first privately managed prison. Judge Gordon Atkinson said he had received a letter outlining what had happened to the man at 'this so-called up-to-date prison'. He said it disclosed a 'deplorable state of affairs'.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: BRENLY THINKS HIS PARTNER WAS MORE MEDIEVAL THAN MEDIOCRE  </P> <P> Former Chicago Cub star Ron Santo, now a radio announcer for the club, was  saying, "In my day we didn't have all these fancy training aids, like magnetic  resonance imaging."  </P> <P> Said his broadcast partner, former San Francisco Giant catcher Bob Brenly: "In  your day they were still using leeches."  </P> <P> Nothing to fear: St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Joe Magrane, who finally won his  first game since last August, wears a T-shirt that says: "Throw strikes. Babe  Ruth is dead."  </P> <P> Add forgettable quotes: Jack McIvor of Sonoma uncovered a Pro Football Weekly  that had these comments on a couple of the San Francisco 49ers' picks in the  1979 draft.  </P> <P>  -- Joe Montana: "Alarming lack of consistency and poor technique are most  disturbing."  </P> <P>  -- Dwight Clark: "Slow hands."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What major league record did Kansas City Royal Manager John Wathan  set as a player?  </P> <P> He called it: Chicago Bull Coach Phil Jackson, who majored in psychology and  religion in college, told the Washington Post: "I never thought I would be a  pro basketball coach. It had been suggested to me a lot of times, but I just  thought there was an awful lot of b.s. you had to put up with as a coach."  </P> <P> And what did he find?  </P> <P> "I found there's a lot of b.s. to put up with."  </P> <P> More striped shirts: When the Cleveland Cavaliers move into a new downtown  arena, plans call for the Richfield Coliseum to be turned into a prison.  </P> <P> Born slugger: Detroit Tiger slugger Cecil Fielder told the New York Times about  a ball he hit during a Little League game in West Covina: "It went into  somebody's backyard about 150 feet beyond the 200-foot mark on the center-field  fence. I think I was about 8 or 9 years old."  </P> <P> New boss: Ron Borges of the Boston Globe reports that Richie Giachetti, former  trainer of Larry Holmes, has taken over at the Mike Tyson camp, reducing the  regular trainers to supporting roles.  </P> <P> Borges: "For an example of Giachetti's expertise, one round into the Meldrick  Taylor-Julio Cesar Chavez fight, Giachetti told a ringside observer that  Taylor's mouthpiece was too tight and could become a problem.  </P> <P> "Several rounds later, Taylor began bleeding from the mouth and eventually  swallowed more than a pint of blood. Taylor and Manager Lou Duva later said the  mouthpiece was new and apparently too tight."  </P> <P> Add Borges: "Tyson," he said, "has opened a new gym in Catskill, N.Y., above a  children's clothing store. It is kitty-corner to the gym run by his former  trainer, Kevin Rooney. The police station is between them, which seems  fortunate."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Most stolen bases by a catcher in a season, 36, in 1982.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Pittsburgh Pirate center fielder Andy Van Slyke, on a fly ball hit  to him: "It wasn't a high fly. It wasn't a low fly or a line drive, either. It  was more of a medfly." HARLEY TINKHAM  </P></p>

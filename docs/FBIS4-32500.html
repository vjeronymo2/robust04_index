			<p>BFN     [Text] In New York, President Michal Kovac confirmed the  government's intention to vigorously continue the privatization  process during his meeting with representatives of Merrill  Lynch, an important U.S. investment and consulting company.  Kovac considers the inability to analyze economic processes  with sufficient precision as well as the poorly defined concept  of a long-term orientation to be the reason for the slowdown in  the transformation process last year. We consider the emergence  of businesses that are able to develop and survive in the  international market environment to be the main privatization  objective, said Kovac, who is continuing his visit to the United  States.</p>

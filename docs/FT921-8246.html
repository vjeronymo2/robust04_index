			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Steady growth at Akbank AKBANK, Turkey's largest private bank, saw after-tax profits for the year to December 31 rise 6 per cent to USDollars 265m. Profits rose from TL733bn to TL1,343bn, although this does not reflect Turkish inflation at around 70 per cent, and depreciation of the lira during 1991. Mr Erol Sabanci, bank chairman, predicted Akbank would continue to be the most profitable bank in Turkey in 1992. Akbank is majority-owned by Sabanci Holdings, Turkey's largest industrial group, and has proven one of the most conservative of Turkish private sector banks. Unlike its competitors, it has not ventured into fund management and equity trading. The bank's deposit base remains strong at around TL2,511bn, while loans extended was slightly down at TL1,708bn.</p>

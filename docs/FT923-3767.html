			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Waterford workers reject plan THE MANAGEMENT of Waterford Crystal, the Irish crystal division of Waterford Wedgwood, may have to add sweeteners to its latest rationalisation plan or face industrial action and possible closure. This follows rejection on Tuesday night by the workforce of the plan which calls for 500 voluntary redundancies from the 1,900 employees by the end of the year. An urgently-called round of talks between management and unions was yesterday adjourned after three hours to allow time for consideration of each side's position. The company said: 'It is the first step of what will be a long and difficult negotiation. Both sides have agreed not to make any statements while negotiations are underway'. Further talks are expected today. Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of Waterford Crystal, announced the latest rationalisation plan three weeks ago. Besides the redundancies, the company is seeking across-the-board wage and piece-rate reductions, a pay freeze until February 1994 and an industrial peace agreement for a five-year period. The crystal division had suffered losses totalling IPounds 72m since 1986, and although an improvement was made during 1991, a deterioration occurred again this year - the company reported a doubling of pre-tax losses to IPounds 6.4m for its 1992 first half. It also warned that rationalisation costs will again affect the full-year result. The company had shed 400 of its workforce since a costly strike in 1990. A further 750 jobs went between 1987 and 1990. The new redundancy plan will result in the halving of the workforce from its 1987 level, but unions are concerned that further redundancies are planned, as imported stemware begins to displace products manufactured at Waterford. Union leaders have said that industrial action to oppose the plan has not been ruled out, but Mr Galvin warned last month that the company's survival is at stake and that if costs cannot be reduced then Waterford faces closure.</p>

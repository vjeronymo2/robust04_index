			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Persimmon sees signs of land price rises LAND PRICES are showing signs of hardening in response to the recent sharp rise in house sales, according to Persimmon which yesterday raised Pounds 10.56m from a share placing. The group said it needed the cash to finance land acquisition following several large purchases completed recently. Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said: 'There are indications that land prices are starting to increase in one or two instances. It is important to make purchases early in case the market takes off.' The company is placing 4.6m shares at 230p. The share price slipped 1p to 233p following the announcement. Persimmon earlier this month said that it intended to finance most of its land purchases by raising borrowings rather than equity. Mr Davidson said that this remained the intention. The placing represented less than 5 per cent of the equity. It had been made because several opportunities to buy sites had become available.</p>

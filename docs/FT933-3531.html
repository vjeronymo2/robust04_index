			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Paris may shuffle state jobs in finance THE Balladur government appears to be weighing possible changes at the top of the country's largest bank, Credit Lyonnais, and the largest insurance company, Union des Assurances de Paris, to speed their eventual privatisation. According to an identical leak appearing in five newspapers yesterday - on which the prime minister's office subsequently refused all comment  - the government plans to exploit the expiry next month of the three-year term of Mr Yves Lyon-Caen, the socialist-appointed head of Credit National, to set in train a small bout of musical chairs. Credit National has the very peculiar feature - even for France - in that because it was set up in 1919 with the public service function of repairing war damage its top three officers are public appointees, even though the bank is privately-owned. The government apparently intends to give the job of Mr Lyon-Caen (whose previous association with Mr Michel Rocard ensures also that he does not have President Mitterrand's support either) to the socialist-appointed Mr Jean-Yves Haberer to save his face on leaving Credit Lyonnais. Controversy has surrounded Mr Haberer's management of Credit Lyonnais, which lost FFr1.9bn (Pounds 210m) in the second half of 1992 and recorded a reduced loss in the first six months of this year. But Mr Haberer, whose current mandate expires next June, is understood to have so far resisted being prematurely moved on to an institution one-tenth the size of Credit Lyonnais. If he moves on, Mr Jean Peyrelevade has been slotted to move from UAP to Credit Lyonnais - though the insurance chief denied the possibility yesterday - and Mr Jacques Friedmann, who is a close friend of Mr Balladur and architect of the 1980s privatisation programme, would move to UAP.</p>

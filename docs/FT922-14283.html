			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Whitbread takes charge for pub debts WHITBREAD, the UK brewer and retailer, yesterday announced its 1991-92 after-tax profits would be reduced by Pounds 25m because of 'abnormally high' charges for bad debts among its loans to recession-hit pubs and bars. At the same time, the group said it will not invest further in the Pizza Hut franchise in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, which had been seen as an area of growth. The double blow to the group's retailing business knocked 19 1/2 p off Whitbread's shares which closed at 358 1/2 p. Analysts revised their estimates of pre-tax profits from Pounds 260m to Pounds 223m-Pounds 230m. Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief executive, warned five months ago that the risk of bad debts among its free trade customers - then estimated at about Pounds 10m - was worsening due to lower consumer spending and the fall in property prices. After a review of Whitbread's Pounds 250m loan portfolio, Mr Jarvis said yesterday, it had been decided an exceptional charge of Pounds 37m would be needed to cover bad debts. This would reduce after-tax profits  - which totalled Pounds 151.5m last year - by Pounds 25m. About 3,000 of its 11,000 free trade customers are experiencing difficulties. Most of the accounts at risk were opened during the late 1980s when Whitbread sought new business as property prices were soaring and beer volumes grew rapidly. Whitbread's decision not to invest further in the European franchise development of Pizza Hut, the PepsiCo-owned pizza chain, had been taken 'with regret', Mr Jarvis said. Whitbread and Pizza Hut International had been unable to agree revisions to their franchise agreements which Whitbread considered were necessary to safeguard the long-term interests of its shareholders. The 45 outlets in France, Belgium and the Netherlands make little contribution to profits, but were seen as an important source of growth. 'Expansion required a huge investment and we were unable to obtain satisfactory terms for recovering those assets if at any time we wanted to quit the business,' said Mr Jarvis. The two companies are exploring alternative ownership arrangements and remain committed to their joint venture in the UK which operates 300 Pizza Hut outlets. Lex, Page 20</p>

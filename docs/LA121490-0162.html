			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> '37 CHINESE MASSACRE ADMITTED  </P> <P> An Imperial Japanese army major left behind an affidavit saying the army dumped  the bodies of 150,000 Chinese into the Yangtze River during the 1937 "Rape of  Nanking," the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported today.  </P> <P> Maj. Hisao Ohta's 44-page confession is further evidence of the existence and  the extent of the massacre, which some Japanese right-wing historians and  politicians say never occurred.  </P> <P> According to Ohta's confession, written while he awaited trial in 1954 in  Fushun, his army unit dumped the bodies of 19,000 Chinese into the water at the  Nanking river front over three days starting on Dec. 15, 1937.  </P> <P> A neighboring unit "processed" 81,000 victims at the same time, and elsewhere  in Nanking, units took care of another 50,000, Ohta's confession, preserved in  China's Nanking Massacre Memorial Hall, says.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KAREEM DENIES HE WILL PLAY IN ITALIAN LEAGUE;  </P> <P> MAGIC SIDELINED FOR GAME; COOPER EXPECTS TRADE  </P> <P> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar says he won't be playing for a team in Italy. Magic Johnson  won't be playing in Indianapolis. And Michael Cooper figures he might not be  playing anymore in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar retired at 42 last week after the Lakers were swept by the Detroit  Pistons in the National Basketball Assn. championship. The Italian sports  daily, Corriere Dello Sport, then reported that two Italian pro teams were  bidding for his services, and that he was seeking $1 million a year.  </P> <P> The report is not true, Abdul-Jabbar's publicist said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Cooper said that he would not be surprised if he was traded by the  Lakers, now that the team needs a center to replace Abdul-Jabbar, and it was  confirmed that Johnson, who was forced out of the NBA Finals because of a  hamstring injury, will miss the Larry Bird Pro All-Star Scholarship game Sunday  night in Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Lorin Pullman, Abdul-Jabbar's publicist, denied the Italian report.  </P> <P> "He is not seeking any type of long-term basketball contract and has not  received any kind of offer for that kind of money," she said.  </P> <P> Said Abdul-Jabbar in a statement issued through Pullman: "I'm committed to  games on a world-wide basis. I'm not sure I want to be in regular team  competition again."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar will play in Australia and Taiwan next month with a team of former  NBA stars against national teams. The games are scheduled in Melbourne (July  24), Sydney (July 26), Brisbane (July 28) and Taipei (July 30).  </P> <P> Otherwise, Pullman said, Abdul-Jabbar will be concentrating on a career in  entertainment.  </P> <P> As for being involved in a possible Laker trade, Cooper said: "The Lakers need  to make a move to get a center or to get someone to help fill that position.  The talk is the Lakers don't want to break up the starting unit, and if I was  the Lakers, I would agree with them.  </P> <P> "And after the starters, Michael Cooper is the most marketable player they  have.  </P> <P> "If they have to make the move, I'll understand it. It's a pure business  decision."  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / BMA knew it risked complaints over fees BRITISH Medical Association leaders yesterday admitted that they had realised they risked complaints to the Office of Fair Trading by publishing guideline charges for doctors' private work. Mr Richard Marcus, a surgeon and vice-chairman of the BMA's consultants committee, said that the association had nonetheless decided to go ahead with publication because it had believed its action was justified. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Tuesday to investigate the way in which consultants set fees for private work. Concern over the BMA fees guidelines, which first appeared in 1989 and have just been republished, gave rise to the decision. The BMA emphasises that its schedule of rates is merely advisory, and that consultants should always discuss fees they charge with their patients. In its most recent set of guidelines, it says: 'It is essential to stress that this document is only to be used by practitioners as a guide. Consultants must always decide themselves on what the appropriate fee is for the service provided.' The annual report of the consultants committee contains a similar message, saying that 'it is, of course, always for individual consultants to determine their own professional fees and the BMA guidelines are intended as a helpful source of reference'. Mr Marcus pointed out that the medical profession had a responsibility to the public to try to avoid total chaos in private medical charges, and the guidelines were intended to help achieve that. He said: 'The government has seen the difficulties involved in trying to have a free market in health care during its reforms of the National Health Service, and talks now of wanting a managed market. The thinking behind the guidelines is quite similar to the managed market notion.' Mr Tim Baker, business development manager with Norwich Union Health Care, a private health insurer that has welcomed the MMC investigation, said: 'There is no competition in a downwards direction on fees. People do not take consumerism into health care. It is not quite the done thing.' He said that private rates being highlighted by the BMA guidelines were excessive because they were based on historical information from a period when private medicine contributed a far smaller proportion of consultants' income than it does now. The BMA does not accept that the guidelines prevent downward pressure on fees. Mr Marcus said that the development of the guidelines was providing an opportunity to restructure suggested prices to reflect developments in medical practice. The MMC yesterday announced the appointment of the four remaining members of its inquiry team, which will be headed by Mr Peter Dean, a deputy chairman of the commission and freelance business consultant. They are: Mr Alexander Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. He is also a non-executive director of Harland and Wolff shipbuilders and a member of the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Engineering Training Authority. Mr Nigel Matthews, group secretary of J. Sainsbury, who previously worked with the CBI, the Association of British and Irish Flour Millers and was a law lecturer at Dundee University. Mr Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool University, a guru of monetarism and an adviser to a number of government departments. Mr John Montgomery, fellow and tutor in economics at Oriel College, Oxford, and former economic director at the National Economic Development Office. Letters, Page 17</p>

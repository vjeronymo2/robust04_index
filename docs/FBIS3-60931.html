The explosion injured nine persons and  caused considerable damage. The store's windows shattered into  fragments injuring various persons, including two children.  According to witnesses, the cart was left by two men and a  woman shortly before the explosion.    A branch of the same store located in Lima's Miraflores  District was attacked with a car bomb last November, shortly  after one of its owners was released by the Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Four Chileans affiliated with  the MRTA were arrested on that occasion. They will be  sentenced, probably to life, today or tomorrow, it was reported  on Tuesday by Daniel Espichan, special prosecutor for cases of  terrorism.    Today's attack follows the detonation of three car bombs  that  were placed in Lima beginning 28 December and which resulted in  one death, 40 injured persons, and the destruction of numerous  stores and houses. The National Police attributed these and  other attacks to the Maoist Shining Path band.</p>

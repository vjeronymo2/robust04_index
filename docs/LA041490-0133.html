			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> INDIANS WIN ACCESS TO ARCHEOLOGY DIGS  </P> <P> Irvine Co. officials assured a group of local Indians on Friday that they will  have a new role in monitoring future archeological digs at the Newport Coast  development between Laguna Beach and Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> But company officials refused a request to change their policy of digging up  ancestral Indian remains and burying them in areas that are earmarked for open  space.  </P> <P> "We are doing everything according to state law," said project director Bernard  A. Maniscalco.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Gabrieleno Indian tribe, whose territory once stretched from the  coast to the San Gabriel Mountains, have accused the Irvine Co. of desecrating  the burial grounds of their ancestors and destroying ancient artifacts during  construction work.  </P> <P> "It's terrible," said tribal chairwoman Vera Rocha, who spent Friday morning  inspecting a variety of archeological digs in the sage-covered hill country.  "They have no respect for our people."  </P> <P> Rocha and others had planned to picket the Irvine Co. headquarters on Friday to  press company officials for access to the dig sites. They wanted to check out a  complaint that bones unearthed by a backhoe had been carelessly tossed aside.  </P> <P> But the picketing was not necessary. After a last-minute round of negotiations,  Irvine Co. officials agreed to escort the Indians to various digs, where they  watched teams of archeologists and field workers catalogue shells and animal  bones and inspect hillside caves for signs of human habitation.  </P> <P> The handful of Gabrielenos who went on the tour were accompanied by David  Belardes, chief of the San Juan Capistrano-based Juaneno Indian tribe, and  several local environmentalists, who criticized the company for building on  land considered sacred by the Indian tribes.  </P> <P> After the tour, the Irvine Co. agreed to allow Rocha or her representative to  monitor future digs. They also agreed to consider turning over some of the  artifacts to Rocha. Currently, they are given to the Natural History and  Science Foundation of Orange County, which plans to open a museum in Laguna  Niguel.  </P> <P> Rocha said that the company has violated the state Historic Sites Preservation  Act of 1966 by failing to notify her or other members of her tribe of the  various finds.  </P> <P> According to the law, companies that unearth artifacts or human remains must  notify a tribal member. The human remains must either be turned over to a  descendant or reburied within the project site.  </P> <P> Maniscalco said that the company has contracted with Jim Velasques to monitor  archeological activity. Velasques is a registered Gabrieleno with the state  Native American Heritage Commission and the U.S. Interior Department.  </P> <P> Rocha has long refused to recognize Velasques as a member of the tribe. She  also questioned whether there is a conflict of interest because Velasques is on  the Irvine Co. payroll.  </P> <P> Maniscalco said the tour "went as good as you can expect." He agreed to  investigate the charges that a backhoe operator mishandled human remains.  </P> <P> Rocha said she will continue to demand that human bones be left undisturbed.  </P> <P> "I know they won't go to Greece and tear up their dead," Rocha said. "They  should have the same respect for our culture, our heritage." JAMES M. GOMEZ  </P></p>

Zhuge Ren, director of the provincial Taiwan Affairs Office,  said that Taiwan firms have invested a total of 374 million U.S.  dollars in Anhui since the first Taiwan-funded company was set  up in 1986.    In 1993 provincial authorities approved 192 new  Taiwan-funded  businesses, up 35 percent over the year before. The province  now has 370 such businesses, Zhuge said.    Government statistics show that more than 180,000 people of  Anhui origin now live in Taiwan, while 230,000 residents of  Anhui are relatives of Taiwan residents.    "The scale of Taiwan investment has been increasing over the  past two years," Zhuge Ren said.    Today, 100 Taiwan-funded companies involve an investment  exceeding one million U.S. dollars each and 40 such companies  involve an investment of at least three million dollars each, he  said.    Taiwan companies used to invest only in such labor-intensive  industries as shoemaking, garments and plastics processing, he  said.    But now, more and more Taiwan companies are investing in  high- tech and capital-intensive industries such as electronics,  computers, telecommunications, chemicals, machine building,  building materials, electrical appliance, real estate, tourism  and transportation industries, he added.    Zhuge said Anhui will further improve its investment  environment and provide better services for Taiwan investors  this year.    For example, a new company will be launched later this year  to provide consultancy services for Taiwan companies with regard  to trade, export and investment in building production  facilities.</p>

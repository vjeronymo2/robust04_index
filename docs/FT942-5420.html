			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: US economy Financial markets did not know quite what to make of yesterday's US unemployment figures. A jobless rate as low as 6 per cent seems calculated to fuel worries about inflation as it is the level at which wage pressure is traditionally expected to appear. But a payroll increase of just 190,000 points to some slackening in the recovery, especially since part of it was accounted for by the return to work of 70,000 striking truck drivers. Put the figures together with other recent data, for example on retail sales and durable goods shipments, and it looks as though tighter monetary policy may be starting to bite. The Labour Department itself has some reservations about the accuracy of the jobless rate, both because it is based on relatively new methods of data collection and because of the size of the fall from 6.4 per cent in April. There thus seems little to dispose the Federal Reserve to tighten again in the near term. But neither can the markets relax. May represents only one weak month in a trend of generally strong employment growth this year. Also yesterday's data do show some acceleration in average earnings. Though the year-on-year growth is only 2.75 per cent, May's increase was 0.5 per cent. That figure, too, may have been affected by the return of the truckers, but it could come back to haunt the markets if other signs of incipient inflation appear.</p>

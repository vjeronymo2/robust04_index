			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RIDDLE RUNS RANCHO ALAMITOS TO 9-7 VICTORY OVER COSTA MESA  </P> <P> Dana Riddle rushed for 317 yards in 37 carries to lead Rancho Alamitos High  School to a 9-7 victory over Costa Mesa in a nonleague football game Friday at  Garden Grove High School.  </P> <P> Riddle scored Rancho Alamitos' only touchdown on a 95-yard run in the first  quarter. Playing inside linebacker, he also gave Rancho Alamitos two points  with a fourth-quarter safety.  </P> <P> "He had a 48-yard run called back because of holding in the third quarter,"  Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller said. "It's too bad we had so much called  back or he could have had 400 yards."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa scored on a 56-yard pass from Duby Ostina to David Phillips in the  second quarter.  </P> <P> In other nonleague games:  </P> <P> Fullerton 21, Whittier 0 -- The Indians (2-0) scored two first-quarter  touchdowns and used a strong defensive effort in front of 2,100 at Cal High.  </P> <P> Early in the first quarter, Fullerton fullback Marcus Roberson ran 75 yards  with a short pass from Rene Arias for the first touchdown. Later in the first  quarter, tailback Chris Escalera ran five yards on an option play for the  second touchdown.  </P> <P> Arias completed a three-yard pass to Bobby Patel for the final score midway  through the second quarter.  </P> <P> The defense "did a superb job stopping the run all night long," Fullerton Coach  Reginald Hill said.  </P> <P> Troy 46, El Dorado 0 -- Chad Brasington scored three touchdowns to lead the  Warriors (2-0) in front of 2,000 at Fullerton High School. Brasington scored on  runs of 35, 11 and four yards and finished with 75 yards rushing. Quarterback  Greg Windle threw a pair of touchdown passes, both to wide receiver Ryan  Russell. Windle connected with Russell on a 30-yard touchdown pass in the first  quarter. The two teamed again on a 17-yard scoring play in the second quarter.  Eldon Davis also scored two touchdowns on runs of one and four yards. Troy  forced seven turnovers in posting its second consecutive shutout.

Garden  Grove is 1-1.  </P> <P> Walnut 20, Magnolia 9 -- Linebacker Dave Flores, a 5-foot-5, 150-pound junior,  led a stingy Mustang defense with a 85-yard interception return for a  first-quarter touchdown to pace the visitors in a nonleague game at Western  High School. Flores also had a fumble recovery as the Mustangs held Magnolia to  minus 35 yards rushing.  </P> <P> For the Sentinels (0-2), senior running back caught four passes for 97 yards  and Magnolia's lone touchdown. Magnolia quarterback Elliott Parker was nine of  16 for 168 yards, but had two interceptions, including the one by Flores.  </P> <P> On offense, visiting Walnut (1-1) featured a balanced rushing attack which ran  up 183 yards and saw four players gain more than 40 yards apiece. Corona del  Mar 9, Marina 0 -- Fullback Jerrott Willard caught a 10-yard touchdown pass  from quarterback Todd Kehrli and kicked a 44-yard field goal to account for all  of Corona del Mar's scoring at Davidson Field.  </P> <P> In eight-man nonleague football:  </P> <P> Claremont-Garden Grove 34, Ambassador Baptist 8 -- Eric Tessaorre scored three  touchdowns and had nine rushes for 82 yards to lead visiting Claremont.  Claremont was in control the whole way and had a 26-0 lead at halftime.  </P></p>

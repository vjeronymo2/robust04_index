			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Growth upturn 'will shrug off' April increases Economic growth will be barely hindered by last month's tax rises, although in the long-term the current account deficit will rise and public borrowing will remain above Pounds 30bn a year, says a report published today. Oxford Economic Forecasting, the independent research group, says in a broadly optimistic May report: 'Economic recovery is two years old, interest rates are low, spending is on a strong upward trend and incomes are forecast to rise.' The recovery will be supported by a strong upturn in investment spending driven principally by better company finances and higher profits. Inflationary worries have been exaggerated, says the report, noting that inflation forecasts have been consistently revised downwards during the past 18 months, including those of the Bank of England. 'The level of spare capacity in the economy will be sufficient to keep the lid on prices for several years to come,' it says. Interest rates will rise slowly over the next three years, says the report, from a 1994 three-month interbank figure of 5 per cent to 5.6 per cent in 1997. Recent data suggest that the rise in wages has also been 'modest', partly because the increase in employment has been fuelled by greater numbers working in part-time jobs. Unemployment will continue on its present gentle decline from 2.56m to 2.24m in 1997. One of the motors of recovery is the company sector, where profits have risen for seven successive quarters. In manufacturing there are a number of positive factors which point to 'a more buoyant picture in the period ahead': Better company finances are easing restraints on spending. Output of goods for investment rose strongly during this year's first quarter. Evidence of investment intentions has improved during the past year, especially in manufacturing where the January and April Confederation of British Industry surveys recorded the best figures on plant and machinery since 1989. Manufacturing investment should grow by 5.8 per cent this year and by 8.6 per cent in 1995, says the report. UK Economic Prospects: May 1994.

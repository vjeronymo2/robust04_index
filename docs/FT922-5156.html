			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Disposals help Faber Prest advance to Pounds 1.84m SHEDDING less-profitable businesses helped Faber Prest, the industrial and distribution services group, lift pre-tax profits in the first half by 2 per cent to Pounds 1.84m. Mr Roger Feaviour, the former Norcros executive who took over at Faber in September, said the company had taken out 'elements which contributed large turnover' but not much profit. The result was a 12.5 per cent decline in sales to Pounds 34.7m for the six months to March 31, and steady operating profits of Pounds 2.2m. At the same time, Faber reduced debt from Pounds 9.5m at the year-end to Pounds 6m at the interim stage. About half of the decline was achieved through disposals and the rest by cash management. Gearing stood at 32 per cent and interest was 4.5 times covered with payments 48 per cent down at Pounds 530,000. The dividend is maintained at 4.3p, payable out of earnings marginally ahead at 11.69p (11.65p). The most surprising performance in the first half came from the industrial services division which concentrates on recycling slag for use in road surfaces. In spite of the depressed steel industry, this division managed to increase margins from 9.9 to 10.8 per cent. As a result, profits were maintained at Pounds 1.3m, on sales 8 per cent down. The rise in margins had been achieved through increased efficiency, said Mr Feaviour, while at the same time offering lower-than-inflationary price increases to hard-pressed. The bad news came from Faber's share in slag recycler Appleby Group - which swung from a Pounds 208,000 profits contribution to a Pounds 126,000 loss. This depressed profits from associated undertakings by 54 per cent to Pounds 194,000. Distribution increased its profits contribution by 14 per cent to Pounds 900,000.</p>

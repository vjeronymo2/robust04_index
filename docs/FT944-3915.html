			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Global airline stocks follow Wall Street lead Problems peculiar to the short-haul market in the US hit airline share prices around the world yesterday, after falls in Continental Air and Southwest Air in New York overnight, writes Our Markets Staff. In Europe, KLM dropped Fl 1.60, or nearly 4 per cent, to Fl 41.60 and Lufthansa by DM4.20, or 2.2 per cent, to DM185.20. This had nothing to do with European airline operating conditions, and everything to do with fragile bourse sentiment, said Mr James Halstead, airlines analyst at SBC. FRANKFURT also saw weakness in carmakers as the Dax index lost 13.88 to 2,028.33 on the session, and slid further to an Ibis-indicated 2,024.19 by the end of the afternoon, down 0.8 per cent on the week. Turnover fell from DM4.2bn to DM3.8bn. In the automotive sector BMW lost DM11.50 at DM739, Conti DM3.50 at DM210.50, Daimler DM13.50 at DM736 and Volkswagen DM8.50 at DM410. At Lehman Brothers Mr Christopher Will, the motor industry analyst, said the carmakers were following a trend evident across Europe: 'Car stocks have underperformed gently since cyclicals saw their peak in April, but they have been extremely vulnerable in recent weeks.' Mr Will added that institutions were being cautious about the sector, perhaps on the prospect of relatively modest profits recovery in 1995. 'But this might be the time to buy,' he said, 'given that, in a month's time, people will be looking at prospects for 1996.' PARIS continued to track the US situation and the CAC-40 index fell 17.10 to 1,936.99, for a week's decline of 2.3 per cent. Turnover was about FFr3bn. Michelin eased FFr1.70 to FFr192.9 in good volume. Outside the CAC-40 index Eurotunnel went against the trend, rising 95 centimes to FFr22.85, on news that the company would get permission to run passenger shuttle services from December 15. Switching out of Elf Aquitaine into Total continued, the former losing FFr5 at FFr379.20 and the latter rising FFr1.20 to FFr321. MILAN fell to an 11-month low as worries resurfaced about the outlook for the Berlusconi government and its budget prospects. The Comit index lost 12.08 to 601.52, down 4.7 per cent on the week. Telecom Italia fell L175, or 4.4 per cent, to L3,780, foreigners selling the stock after prospects faded for a cut in its payment to government for its mobile telephone concession. Stet, the parent company, lost L165 to L4,437. Against the trend, Cartiere Burgo, the paper group, put on L312 to L10,450, taking its rise over the last two sessions to 6.4 per cent. Mr Roger Hornett at Societe Generale Equities International, who recommended the stock this week, forecast a 29 per cent surge in current year sales, a return to strong profits in 1995 and added that the share price still had the potential to double. AMSTERDAM closed the week on the downgrade, the AEX index losing 2.97 at 406.32 for a 0.9 per cent decline on the week. VNU resisted the downtrend for most of the session, after Thursday's news that it was in talks with a rival television production company. The shares saw a high of Fl 175 at one stage, before retreating to close unchanged at Fl 171.50. KPN, the telecommunications group, off 10 cents at Fl 54.40, confirmed it had been having talks with Belgacom, the Belgian operator, which is due to be privatised. Akzo Nobel was down Fl 2.90 at Fl 191.60 and announced that it was setting up a joint venture in China to manufacture and sell organic peroxides. ZURICH finished lower in very thin trading, with the firm dollar and bund futures limiting losses. The SMI index lost 13.3 to 2,576.0, with Wall Street and the Orange County bankruptcy still taking their toll. The index was little changed on the week. Banks provided the day's feature. CS Holding, which announced plans on Thursday for a single class of registered share, saw the registered hold steady at SFr105 while the bearers declined SFr4 to SFr524. SBC, which said it had no plans to follow CS Holding and UBS in creating a single share class, fell SFr6 to SFr355. Interdiscount, the electronics retailer, extended the week's sharp loss on analysts' lower earnings forecasts, declining SFr60 to SFr1,440.

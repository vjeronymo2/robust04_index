			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Conti in black after six months CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, said yesterday that it made an operating profit in the first six months of the year, compared with a small operating loss in the first half of last year. Turnover climbed 8 per cent to DM4.95bn (Dollars 3.13bn). Helped by good sales for tyres and technical products - and a cut in losses at General Tire, its US subsidiary - the group forecast that it was on course to make a profit for the whole year after a net loss of DM128.2m for last year. Continental said shareholders would benefit from the improvement, but that it was to early to make a pronouncement about dividend policy. No dividend was paid last year. The statement came a few days ahead of Friday's annual meeting in Hanover, at which the company will face a challenge from Pirelli, the Italian tyre company which owns 5 per cent of Continental and has options over a further 34 per cent stake. For the second year running, Pirelli is seeking to overturn the rule which limits shareholder's voting rights in the German company to 5 per cent, no matter how big their stake. The companies abandoned merger talks in December. The outcome of the meeting is likely to hinge on the technicality of whether Pirelli is allowed to vote the full 39 per cent stake. It seems likely that Mr Ulrich Weiss, chairman of the Continental supervisory board and a main board director at Deutsche Bank, will order that Pirelli can speak for no more than 5 per cent of the votes. This would mean that Pirelli would not be able to command the necessary majority.</p>

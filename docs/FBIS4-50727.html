			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Liu Tai-ying, president of  the Kuomintang [KMT] Business Management Committee, said Friday  [13 May] that KMT-run enterprises will strengthen cooperation  with South Korea, Japan, Russia, Indonesia, and Vietnam.    Liu, a renowned economist, made the statement upon his  return  from a week-long visit to South Korea and Japan. He said  KMT-owned firms have made plans to work together with South  Korea's financial sector to open banks and leasing companies in  Indonesia in line with the government's "southern strategy,"  which encourages Taiwan investors to increase investments in  Southeast Asia.    He said he had visited the Mitsubishi Co. and the Mitsui Co.  in Japan to seek bilateral cooperation in shipping, energy,  transportation, tourism, and trade.    The ruling party is also considering investing in Russia's  salmon, cement, and forestry industries, Liu said. Russian made  goods could be shipped to Hong Kong for resale to Indonesia and  Vietnam, while Taiwan's electronics products and Indonesia's  petrochemical goods could be exported to Russia, he elaborated.    To help promote the "southern strategy," he said, senior  executives of KMT-run enterprises will make a trip to Jakarta  and Surabaya in Indonesia next month to talk with their  Indonesian counterparts on cooperative ties.    Liu said that he will visit Indonesia again in July to make  a  final decision on the investment plans. He first visited the  Southeast Asian country in early April.    The KMT-owned companies are also planning to make inspection  tours of Myanmar [Burma], North Korea, and Palau this year as  part of their efforts to explore new outlets, he added.</p>

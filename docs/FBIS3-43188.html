			<p>SUMMARY                                    Japanese press reporting over the past few weeks suggests that  Tokyo is divided over its strategy for the Japan-U.S. framework  talks and over its assessment of the U.S. position in the talks.  In the absence of any clear direction from Japan's political  leadership, elements of the Japanese bureaucracy that reportedly  favor a hard-line approach appear at present to have the upper  hand.  However, there appear to be some sections of the  bureaucracy that are arguing for a more conciliatory approach.  Some Japanese press reports suggest that, as the deadline for  concluding the negotiations nears, the hard-liners may be forced  to modify their stand somewhat in order to avoid scuttling the  talks and souring Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's summit with  President Clinton on 11 February.                              END SUMMARY      The Japanese Government appears to have developed no clear  strategy for resolving the current impasse in the U.S.-Japan  framework negotiations, in part because the sections of the  Japanese bureaucracy responsible for conducting the talks seem to  be divided over what approach to take.  On the one hand, one  group appears to favor continuing to take a hard-line in the  talks, categorically rejecting any U.S. demands to establish  objective criteria to measure Japanese trade performance.  This  group also appears to be insisting that the talks address  measures that Japan wants the United States to take to improve  its competitiveness, and to be refusing to consider setting any  guidelines for imports in specific industrial sectors.  This  position, which appears to be held primarily in the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Ministry of  Finance (MOF), has received wide coverage in the statements made  by key Japanese officials in the Japanese press.      -- In an interview in the 27 December-3 January issue of the  English-language Nikkei Weekly, targeted at a foreign audience,  MITI Vice Minister for International Affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu  rejected a U.S. suggestion that imports into Japan should be  measured against the level of imports in other G-7 countries.  Using a familiar Japanese argument, Okamatsu asserted that Japan  could not be measured against other G-7 countries because the  foundations of its economy were different, requiring the country  to "import natural resources and export manufactured goods," in  contrast to other G-7 countries that  have greater natural  resources.  He also insisted that the talks should address steps  the United States should take to improve its competitiveness as  much as measures Japan should take to increase imports.  "Mutual  efforts should be the starting point of the framework talks," he  said, adding that Washington seemed to be "concerned only with  pressing Japan rather than concentrating on the lack of effort by  U.S. industry."      -- The 11 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted an unidentified  MITI official as stating, in connection with the framework talks,  that "criteria that can lead to agreeing on targets cannot be  accepted."      -- An 11 January Kyodo report quoted MITI Minister Hiroshi  Kumagai as rejecting any effort to set guidelines for imports in  various sectors, saying that Japan "cannot practice managed trade  or allow administrative guidance alone to reduce the surplus with  the United States by using double standards at home and abroad."  Kumagai reportedly argued that to do so would run counter to the  Hosokawa government's efforts to "create transparency" in  Japanese markets.      -- According to the 28 November Nihon Keizai Shimbun, as far back  as the fall of 1993, MITI and MOF became concerned that the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) might be too inclined to make  concessions to the United States.  According to the paper, MITI  and MOF therefore agreed to coordinate their positions in the  talks, to staunchly reject any U.S. demands to set objective  criteria to measure Japan's trade performance, and to resist any  pressure to present compromise proposals to the Prime Minister  unless the United States dropped its demands.      A major concern of those advocating a tough stand against the  United States, particularly on the issue of objective criteria,  appears to be that the United States might invoke sanctions  against Japan if the criteria are not met.  In his interview with  the 27 December-3 January Nikkei Weekly, MITI Vice Minister  Okamatsu voiced this concern by  commenting that "it remains  unclear whether Washington would use unilateral sanctions against  Japan" if Japan failed to meet any of the objective criteria  Washington is calling for.      At the same time, however, Japanese press reporting has suggested  that there are some elements of the Japanese bureaucracy--mainly  within MOFA--that maintain Japan should be more flexible and make  some concessions to the United States.  In late December, in the  wake of reports in the Japanese press that Washington might be  softening its position, various MOFA officials began to signal in  comments to the press that they believed Japan's large trade  surplus placed Tokyo in a weak position in the negotiations, and  would eventually force the country to compromise with the United  States.      -- According to the 25 December Nihon Keizai Shimbun, an  unidentified senior MOFA official told the paper on 24 December  that "fundamentally, the United States will be making demands on  Japan at the Japanese-U.S. framework talks because Japan has a  huge trade surplus with the United States."  The official  reportedly added that, for the negotiations to succeed, Japan  would therefore have to "make further compromises."      -- Similarly, the 27 December Asahi Shimbun, in a report sourced  to an unnamed senior MOFA official, stated that although Tokyo  plans to continue to reject numerical targets for specific trade  sectors, it "understands that it is necessary on the  macroeconomic level to show some degree of a positive stance  toward U.S. demands for expansion of Japan's domestic demand and  reduction of its trade surplus."      -- The 4 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun also reported conciliatory  statements by an unidentified senior MOFA official, quoting him  as saying that Japan would be "required to make more concessions"  in the talks than the United States because of its trade surplus.      Another official possibly advocating a more conciliatory approach  is Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama.  The 12 January  Asahi Shimbun quoted him as telling U.S. Under Secretary of State  Joan Spero that he believed "it is possible for Japan and the  United States to hold talks to work out something that is  acceptable to both sides."      None of these reports indicated what compromises the officials  quoted have in mind.      Divisions over Assessment of U.S. Position      The bureaucracy also appears to be divided in its assessment of  the U.S. position in the talks.  Some sections of the Japanese  bureaucracy appear to have interpreted remarks reportedly made by  President Clinton at the APEC Summit and by U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor in a 20 December letter to Nihon  Keizai Shimbun as indicating that the United States has softened  its stance on the issue of setting objective criteria for  measuring Japan's trade performance.  For example, the 19  December Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unidentified Japanese source  close to the framework negotiations as stating that President  Clinton indicated during talks with Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa in Seattle in November that the U.S. would back off the  concept of numerical targets.  The paper also cited the same  source as saying that an unidentified senior U.S. embassy  official had also told the Japanese Government that Washington  would abandon numerical targets in favor of some other type of  objective criteria to measure Japanese trade performance.  The 20  December Nihon Keizai Shimbun, possibly reflecting thinking of  the paper's sources in the bureaucracy, described the wording of  Ambassador Kantor's letter as "slightly toned down" on the issue  of objective criteria and noted that Kantor did not discuss the  issue of setting a target for reducing Japan's trade surplus.      At the same time, however, other sections of the bureaucracy have  voiced skepticism that the United States has backed off from its  demands for the setting of numerical targets.  According to the  22 December Asahi Shimbun, an unidentified senior MOFA official  described reported U.S. statements that Washington was not  seeking numerical targets as a "feint."  The official reportedly  added that "the substance of U.S. policy--attaching more  importance to trade results than to the market opening processes,  and pressing Japan to raise the share of foreign goods on the  Japanese market to levels comparable with other G-7 countries-  -remains unchanged."  Similarly, the 23 December Nihon Keizai  Shimbun quoted an unnamed MOFA source as stating that reported  U.S. calls for Japan to increase the Japanese market share of  imports to levels similar to the share of imports in other G-7  countries was "as bad as setting numerical targets."  The 29  December Yomiuri Shimbun reported that some MITI officials were  also concerned that the objective criteria demanded by the United  States "could actually turn out to be new targets."  According to  the 12 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun, unidentified sources in MITI  responded to a U.S. Government report on the U.S. position in the  talks, "In Search of a New Partnership," by commenting that "a  careful reading" of the report showed that Washington remained  "preoccupied with numerical targets."      At present, both schools of thinking about the current U.S.  strategy appear to be agreed on one point--that the best way to  deal with the United States is to continue to take a hard line.  Bureaucrats who apparently think that the United States has  backed off from its demands on objective criteria appear to  believe that the United States may eventually make even further  concessions in order to conclude the talks.  A 20 December Kyodo  report quoted an unidentified Japanese Government source as  stating that Washington's reported decision to back off numerical  targets would provide a "solution" to the framework negotiations.      Similarly, bureaucrats who believe that the United States has not  changed its position appear to be arguing that Japan should  redouble its efforts in the face of what they expect will be  increased pressure from Washington.  The 4 January Nihon Keizai  Shimbun quoted an unnamed top MITI official as stating that Tokyo  would "reject" any criteria that resembled numerical targets,  regardless of how they were described or packaged.  The official  commented that it was "unclear" whether there is any difference  between what the United States means by such terms as "standards"  and "indicators" on the one hand and "targets" on the other.      U.S. Position on Hosokawa      A third area of disagreement appears to be in the Japanese  Government's assessment of the U.S. stance toward the ruling  coalition government.  Some officials appear to believe that  Washington will eventually compromise because it does not want to  jeopardize the coalition by pushing Prime Minister Hosokawa into  a corner.   For example, the 23 December Asahi Shimbun reported  that the United States might be softening its position on  objective criteria because of its concerns for the Prime  Minister's "difficult" position.  Similarly, the 23 December  Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale  had strongly advocated that the United States take a more  conciliatory approach to Japan in order to avoid exacerbating  Hosokawa's problems.      Other officials, however, appear to believe that Washington may  be prepared to get tough with Hosokawa at the February summit.  The 7 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted unidentified "close  aides" to the prime minister as stating that they were concerned  that Washington's patience might be running out and that  President Clinton might be "asking for results" at the February  summit.  Such views appear also to have some currency in MOFA,  where some officials apparently advocate a more conciliatory  approach to the framework talks.  According to the 31 December  Tokyo Shimbun, at the end of December, MOFA issued a position  paper on Japan's foreign policy in which it warned that the off-  year election in the United States in November would force  President Clinton to seek progress in talks with Japan which he  could present to U.S. voters.  The paper concluded that Prime  Minister Hosokawa would therefore probably face pressure to take  "concrete steps" to reduce the trade imbalance.      Confusion in the Bureaucracy      Infighting within the bureaucracy may also be contributing to the  lack of movement in Japan's framework strategy.  The 1 January  Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that progress on the talks may have  been disrupted by an internal power struggle in MITI that led to  the resignation of the Director General of the Industrial Policy  Bureau, Masahisa Naito.  The paper stated that MITI was obliged  to cancel meetings between Naito and U.S. negotiators aimed at  resolving some of the issues under dispute in the talks after  Naito was charged with abusing his office.      Outlook      Tokyo will probably continue to take a hard-line stance in  upcoming sessions of the framework negotiations in the absence of  any internal political pressure to take a more flexible approach  to the negotiations.  Prime Minister Hosokawa and other key  political leaders are currently preoccupied with getting the  coalition government's political reform package through the upper  house of the Diet and with putting together a package of measures  to stimulate the floundering Japanese economy.  Until these  issues are resolved, few of the key leaders are likely to devote  much attention to the framework talks.  Once the political reform  bill and the economic stimulus package are out of the way,  however, the coalition is likely to face some political pressure  to break the impasse in the framework talks.  If the political  reform bills pass and the government draws up and passes a  stimulus package, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party may  turn to criticism of the coalition's handling of Japan-U.S.  relations and the framework talks in an effort to discredit the  government.  To prevent this, and also to avoid souring the  atmosphere at the February summit, Prime Minister Hosokawa and  other political leaders may put pressure on the bureaucracy to  reach face-saving compromises with the United States on key  issues in the talks.

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV PLANS TO SPEED ECONOMIC REFORM  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told workers in the industrial city of  Sverdlovsk that falling production had convinced him that economic reforms must  be speeded up, the official Tass news agency reported Friday.  </P> <P> His remarks were reported the same day statistics were released saying Soviet  industrial production amounted to $381 billion in the first quarter of 1990,  down 1.2% from a year ago.  </P> <P> "We were planning to move more slowly, but then we saw the process of industry  of the last three or four months," Gorbachev said in a speech Thursday during a  visit to Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains.  </P> <P> "We noted that negative tendencies are not disappearing. On the contrary, they  are increasing," he said.  </P> <P> "One should not wait any more. Everything that was scheduled for 1992 and 1993  we should begin carrying out now. This year something should be done and the  main work on transferring to the market (economy) should start next year."  </P> <P> An economic plan proposed by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and adopted by  Parliament in December called for price reform starting in 1991, but postponed  until 1993 other moves toward a market-based system and did not provide for  monetary reform.  </P> <P> After two days of addressing residents' worries about the sagging economy in  the Ural Mountains city, Gorbachev traveled to nearby Nizhny Tagil and  confronted a new issue: pollution.  </P> <P> Gorbachev was besieged with complaints Friday about foul water and air in a  city of 403,000 so polluted that children have drawn pictures of smog and  written: "I don't want to die!"  </P> <P> "Metal is metal, but people, Mikhail Sergeyevich, are not iron," a metalworker  told the president as they met on the shop floor of the Nizhny Tagil  Metallurgical Complex. The comment was reported by the Tass news agency.  </P> <P> Huge demonstrations have been reported in Nizhny Tagil and other Soviet cities  as residents demand a cleanup of air and water.  </P> <P> Gorbachev took a walking tour of the sprawling metallurgical complex, stopping  occasionally to field workers' questions.  </P> <P> "I know about the situation with your water and air," Gorbachev responded. He  said the solution lies in a government plan for modernizing local factories'  equipment.  </P></p>

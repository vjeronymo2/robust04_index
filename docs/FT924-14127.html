			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Hybrid production from Walt Disney EUROBOND investors were last week offered a new type of debt/equity hybrid, when Walt Disney, the US entertainment company, launched a bond issue with interest linked to its film revenues. More than half the deal is being placed in the US, under a Rule 144A option. With US interest rates at a low point, US insurance companies, no longer able to gain double digit coupons even in the junk bond market, are particularly hungry for the potential yield the structure offers. However, the deal, which was extensively marketed prior to launch, requires an understanding of the company not normally required of bond investors. 'If you like the movie part of Disney equity and not the theme park part, then this offers the right exposure,' said one banker. The Dollars 400m Eurobond issue of senior participating notes due 1999 pays interest of 7 1/2 per cent for the first 18 months and 1 1/2 per cent thereafter. In addition, payments of contingent interest will be made if film revenues generated by a Dollars 400m portfolio of live action films exceed Dollars 800m over the life of the notes. Subsequently, eligible revenues are split with the company, up to a maximum of Dollars 240m Thus interest payments will fall in a range of 3 per cent to 13 1/2 per cent, according to Citicorp. The deal is arranged by Citicorp Investment Bank, with US placement arranged by Lehman Brothers. Revenue participation is already an established part of film financing. Loans with profit participation for lenders developed from the traditional means of financing through limited partnerships. The latest deal is a public offering of a structured transaction which works on the same principle as these loans with profit participation. For Disney, the deal also has a strategic goal. The company is cash rich, and could use its internal cash flow to finance its films. However, the structure of the deal - which means that interest costs fall and rise in line with revenues - will have the effect of smoothing out its earnings profile. This is desirable since Wall Street marks down shares with a volatile performance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Russians in Finland are about to set up a  national organization to pursue their rights. The aim is to  develop the language, culture, and minority rights of the old  and new Russians. The reform of civic rights that is being  discussed in parliament mentions small minority groups such as  Jews and Tatars. During the preparation of the language rights  paragraph that is to be included in the constitution, the  Somalis were discussed, but there was no talk of the Russians in  Finland. According to a researcher of minority rights, a  mention of the Russians would have been appropriate. Tapani  Leisti reports:    [Leisti] According to the Central Statistical Office, a few  years ago, there were just over 9,000 Russian speakers in  Finland. The number is rising; the highest unofficial figure is  about 20,000. It is estimated that some 3,000 of those are  descendants of Russians who settled in Finland in the last  century and at the turn of the century, i.e., old Russians. The  old Russians have integrated well into the majority. Those who  have arrived from the territory of the former Soviet Union since  the 1950's are new Russians. The old Russians, who have  remained quiet, seem to be waking up as a result of the changes  in Russia and the new Russians.    A report by a working group of Russians in Finland was  completed last spring. The aim is, among other things, to bring  about the official recognition of the Russian-speaking minority  and to set up a representative body like the consultative  committees on Lapp and Romany affairs. The report has been sent  to many ministries.    Minority languages are gaining recognition in the reform of  civil rights in the Constitution that is currently being  discussed in parliament. In addition to the national languages  of Finnish and Swedish, under the government's proposal, the  paragraph on language rights will also include the indigenous  Lapp people and the Romanies, who have lived in Finland for  hundreds of years. The explanatory memorandum on the paragraph  mentions the Jews and Tatars as other minority groups that have  been resident in Finland for a long time. During the course of  drafting the law, Somali refugees came up, but there was no talk  of the Russian speakers. [passage omitted]    Eugen Novitsky, member of the working group of Russians in  Finland, says this about the explanations for the language  rights paragraph.    [Begin Novitsky recording] Naturally, this matter has its  own historic background. We must note today that, if and when  we regard the Swedish language as a national language, then the  first foreign language today is the Russian language -- if we  count the population that uses or would like to use and preserve  that language. For this reason, the working group thinks that,  after studies, official and stronger recognition, as well as a  position, should be accorded to the Russian language in our  country. [end recording]    [Leisti] Novitsky says that a meeting will be convened next  month to set up a representative body to champion the rights of  the Russian-speakers as a citizens' organization.    There is no internationally binding definition of  minorities.  There is an agreement between Finland and Russia under which  Finland must protect languages of the Russian language group and  Russia must protect Finno-Ugric languages on their territories.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has  urged the people of Sabah to discard parochialism. They should  regard themselves as Malaysian in equal terms with people in the  other states. Speaking at a gathering in Kota Kinabalu, the  prime minister said the spirit of solidarity is important for  the people to discard any feelings of alienation. Everyone in  the country enjoys the same rights, including holding top posts  regardless of the state of origin, community, or religion.  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir added that federal government  supervision of the new Sabah administration is necessary to  ensure that the abuses of past governments do not recur. The  supervision is not deemed as colonizing Sabah but to make sure  that the state is administered well.</p>

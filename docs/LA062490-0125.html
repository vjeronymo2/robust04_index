			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS: GARDENING;  </P> <P> WATER-SAVING CLASSES FLOURISH IN DROUGHT  </P> <P> Four years of drought have prompted some interesting classes, seminars and even  sales scheduled for this summer.  </P> <P> "Drip Irrigation for the Home Gardener" is a one-day UCLA Extension program on  Saturday, July 7, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Paul Moore, horticultural specialist at  the University of California, Riverside will instruct.  </P> <P> "Xeriscape: Gardening for a Dry Climate," taught by Kathleen Sommer,  horticultural consultant with Roger's Gardens, meets on five Wednesday  evenings, 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., at UCLA, July 18-August 15. The fee is $95.  </P> <P> You can enroll in either class by phone using a credit card; call UCLA  Extension at (213) 825-7093 for registration information.  </P> <P> The William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom has scheduled "Gardening with Natives  Nature Walk" on Sunday, July 29, at 10 a.m. Join a professional gardener and  nature guide to learn about the large assortment of plants to choose from for  your garden. Meet at the Sooky Goldman Nature Center, 2600 Franklin Canyon  Drive, Beverly Hills. The event is free. For more information call (213)  858-3834.  </P> <P> The Theodore Payne Foundation is having a special summer sale of native plants,  from June 26-June 30, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily. The foundation's nursery,  which has over 600 species to browse through, is at 10459 Tuxford St., Sun  Valley. Call (818) 768-1802 for additional information.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lotusland Conserved  </P> <P> Lotusland, the grand and somewhat whimsical estate of the late Madame Ganna  Walska in Santa Barbara, has become the second garden sponsored by the Garden  Conservancy.  </P> <P> The Conservancy is a newly formed group dedicated to preserving notable gardens  throughout the United States (though the first two sponsored gardens happen to  be in California, the Ruth Bancroft garden in Walnut Creek being the other).  The Conservancy hopes to help Lotusland get the necessary permits to allow  visitors. For the moment, visits are restricted to groups with a horticultural  or botanical affiliation (they may request visits to Lotusland by contacting  Dr. Steven Tambrook, Director, Ganna Walska Lotusland, 695 Ashley Road, Santa  Barbara, Calif. 93103.)  </P> <P> For more information, write the Garden Conservancy at 1388 Sutter St., San  Francisco, Calif. 94109.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zoo Plants Labeled  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park is as full of interesting plants as it is  of animals, but they have never been labeled or identified. Now some 600 have  labels and 300 more are on order. As volunteer Joan Booke points out, "this is  not the Huntington and the plants are not as manicured, so it is a good place  to see what trees and shrubs for Southern California look like with minimal  care," such as they might receive in a garden. It is hoped that by next spring,  tours of the plants at the zoo will be offered. -- R.S.  </P> <P> Gray Water System  </P> <P> Santa Barbara gardeners should sit up and take note, using gray water is now OK  in their drought-stricken town (in other parts of the state, it is a murky  legal question though many have gone ahead and installed devices).  </P> <P> Gray water is the waste water from washing machines, sinks, showers and  bathtubs. One of the earliest proponents of its use, Robert Kourick, is selling  a kit for around $400 that takes the safest of gray water, from the washing  machine, filters and stores it, then pumps it out to any drip system that is  attached.  </P> <P> A lot of water runs through a washing machine and this is one way to make it do  double duty. He even offers a specially-developed laundry soap that acts as a  mild fertilizer in the garden.  </P> <P> The basic kit includes all the pumps and plumbing and is a snap to install. For  information on The Water Cycle, write to Robert Kourick, P.O. Box 1841, Santa  Rosa, Calif., 95402, or call (707) 874-2606. Kourick also publishes the only  book the subject, also available from him. Robert Smaus  </P></p>

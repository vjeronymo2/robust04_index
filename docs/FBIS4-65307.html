			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 14 KYODO -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) will send a five-member inspection team to  North Korea on Sunday [15 May] to conduct a weeklong inspection  of a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon starting Tuesday, an  IAEA spokesman said Saturday.    The IAEA needs the additional inspection now that North  Korea  has started preparatory works for exchanging spent fuel rods at  its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers  north of Pyongyang, the IAEA spokesman said.    North Korea notified the IAEA of the start of preparatory  works in its letter on Friday, he said.    If North Korea commits a serious violation of the nuclear  safeguards agreement, such as peeling seals off the fuel rod  container, the team may suspend inspections, the spokesman said.    IAEA sources said the international nuclear watchdog could  determine if North Korea has exchanged fuel rods by monitoring  records from cameras and counters installed at the nuclear  reactor.    The Yongbyon complex has been the focus of allegations that  North Korea is pushing a clandestine nuclear weapons program.    In February, the United States and North Korea agreed to  resume high-level talks on condition that Pyongyang allows full  inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites.    But North Korea in March denied IAEA inspectors' access to  the laboratory in Yongbyon, considered crucial in verifying  whether fissionable radioactive material had been diverted to  make nuclear bombs.    On March 1, the United Nations Security Council adopted a  presidential statement calling on North Korea to allow full  international inspection of its nuclear facilities.    This time the IAEA inspectors will conduct necessary checks  at the nuclear facility, including radiation measurement, the  spokesman said.    The IAEA has repeatedly insisted that if North Korea goes  ahead with the fuel rod exchange at the nuclear reactor without  the supervision of IAEA inspectors, it would constitute a  violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement.    South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY said in a dispatch from  Seoul that North Korea told the IAEA it is regrettable that  Pyongyang had to start changing fuel rods without IAEA  inspections.    North Korea, however, made clear that there is room for  negotiations, saying that there are a lot of opportunities as  North Korea has just recently begun replacing the fuel rods,  according to the YONHAP report.    The U.S. has also said that it would suspend a third round  of high-level negotiations with North Korea if it changes the  fuel rods without U.N. inspectors present.    North Korea said Thursday that the replacement of the  uranium  fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986  and is almost exhausted, is a very urgent matter that cannot be  deferred indefinitely.    The IAEA maintains that the sampling and analysis of the  fuel  rods would provide information on the North Korean nuclear  program and any past activities in retrieving plutonium from  spent nuclear fuel.</p>

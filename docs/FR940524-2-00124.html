Funding Preference in Accordance With Section 6(p)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 6(p) of the USHA requires HUD to provide a funding preference for applications in areas with an inadequate supply of housing for use by low-income families (i.e., a ``tight'' housing rental market). The implementation of this preference shall be in accordance with the process described in section V.A.2 of this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The PHA must furnish data relative to rental vacancy rates in the market area where the project is proposed. This data should include a description of the data sources and methods used to obtain survey information. (It is recommended that PHAs consult with local community development agencies relative to their housing needs before submitting applications under this NOFA, since most of these agencies will have participated in the development of a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Factors such as the following will provide evidence of conditions which, when taken together, will demonstrate a pattern of inadequate supply (generally, no one factor, taken alone, is conclusive);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The current rental housing vacancy rate is at a low level (typically six percent or lower) which results in housing not being available for families seeking rental units (unless the housing market area is not growing and, as a result, is experiencing low levels of demand);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The annual production of rental housing units is insufficient to meet the demand arising from the increase in households, or, where there is little or no growth, is insufficient to meet the demand arising from net losses to the available inventory;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

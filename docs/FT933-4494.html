			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (4): Drive for the mass consumer market - Personal Communications Networks TELECOMMUNICATIONS network operators throughout the world will be watching developments in the UK closely this autumn as the first of a new generation of low-cost digital mobile telephone services are launched. The advent of Personal Communications Network services marks a watershed in the development of high-capacity sophisticated mobile telecommunications using pocket-sized handsets and targeted at domestic customers and small business users. Their arrival promises customers an expanding choice of feature-rich services and significantly greater competition between cellular network operators. PCNs - touted by their advocates as the future shape of mobile telephony - are a high capacity derivative of the pan-European GSM digital cellular standard employing smaller-sized cells and higher frequencies. Unlike the high powered GSM which was principally designed for use in cars, PCN has been designed from the outset to work with small, lightweight, low-power handsets carried in people's pockets. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute produced the DCS-1800 PCN specification in 1991. Because PCNs operate at 1800 MHz, double the frequency of GSM, they have a much higher capacity which enables PCN operators to set call charges which are much more directly competitive with the hard-wired networks run by the public telephone operators. However, the drawback is that using high frequency signals with a relatively short range means that double the number of base stations are required and the cost of building a network to reach 90 per cent of the population is around Pounds 1bn. In the UK, where the PCN concept was born, the government awarded PCN licences to three international consortia at the end of 1989. However, since then forecasts of the number of cellular subscribers by the end of the century have been scaled back, forcing many of the PCN licence participants to reassess their involvement. As a result, there has been a wave of stake sales and mergers and one of the three original PCN licences has been handed back. The two remaining licences are held by Mercury One-2-One, formally called Mercury Personal Communications, which is a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless and US West, and Hutchison Microtel, part of the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa group. Hutchison Microtel has been looking for a partner to share the costs of building its PCN service which is due to be launched in April next year. So far, Hutchison is believed to have spent more than Pounds 300m developing the service, to be targeted initially at the business and small business sector. Mercury One-2-One was due to be launched in the summer but a number of technical problems emerged during a 'Beta' field test of the system so the launch date has been pushed back. Initially the service will be limited to the London area bounded by the M25, but it is due to expand throughout the south-east to reach a quarter of the UK population by the middle of next year. The big challenge for the new digital network operators will be whether they can broaden the customer base for mobile telephony to reach the mass consumer market. Existing analogue cellular telephone services in the UK and elsewhere, though highly successful, have mostly appealed to business customers because of their relatively high charges. Recently both Vodafone and Cellnet in the UK have introduced new tariff structures designed to appeal more to low call volume customers. However, these still fall short of offering consumers a realistic alternative to basic 'fixed-wire' telephone services for only a modest premium. Mr Richard Goswell, managing director of Mercury One-2-One, says its research shows that 'if you get the prices right the consumer market is definitely interested'. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that until handset prices fall from their initial level of Pounds 250 to Pounds 300, the service is unlikely to reach a mass consumer audience. 'There will be lot of sales to small businesses and the consumer market will develop over time,' he predicts. But by the turn of the century he believes PCN handsets will be sold in plastic 'blister packs' by high street electrical stores and will provide a real, feature-rich alternative to the domestic hard wired telephone. In the interim he expects PCN handsets to start appearing as a second telephone, providing the additional advantage of mobility. Mercury has set two standard tariffs, one called BusinessCall targeted at higher volume business customers and the other called PersonalCall for small businesses and low call volume individual customers. Both tariffs offer savings of between 30 and 40 per cent over the equivalent tariffs on Vodafone and Cellnet's existing national analogue tariffs. In addition to more aggressive pricing, Mercury is betting that it will attract customers to its PCN service by including some sophisticated features, such as an integrated 'voice mail' answerphone service, call barring, call divert and call waiting facilities. Like GSM handsets, PCN telephones are operated using a smartcard which contains customer billing and other information. This means handsets can be shared and customers can make calls from any handset and be billed at home. Links with GSM networks will allow the smartcard to be used in any other country which has GSM or PCN. However Mr Goswell emphasises: 'There is nothing magical about PCN.' It is an approach to marketing rather than the technology which makes it different, he says. One of the prime motivations of the UK government in licensing PCN operators was to promote competition. Vodafone and Cellnet have both cut tariffs inside the M25 to counter the impact of Mercury One-2-One. Vodafone will also be launching its own version of a digital personal communications service called MetroDigital early next month. MetroDigital, a microcellular regional cellular service previously called MCN, is based on Vodafone's existing EuroDigital GSM network and will provide a low-cost urban-based service, initially in south-east England. Like PCNs, the service is aimed at consumers and small businesses. But unlike PCNs, it will operate at the same 900MHz frequency as GSM and will use the same handsets as the GSM network which are expected to cost around Pounds 400 initially. MetroDigital's pricing struc- ture emphasises the 'local' nature of the service. Local calls will cost 20p and national calls 25p a minute, but MetroDigital subscribers who make calls from rural areas via the GSM network will have to pay a punitive rate of 65p a minute. All calls off-peak will cost just 10p a minute. By the end of next year Vodafone plans to cover all towns with a population of 50,000 or more and in the interim MetroDigital customers will be able to receive calls anywhere in the UK covered by Vodafone's GSM service. Additional competition, at least in the business and corporate markets, could come from low cost regional varieties of GSM itself. Cellnet plans to introduce what it calls Local System for Mobile communications (LSM) regional services in January next year, ahead of the launch of its national GSM network. The LSM service will be available in an extended London region, as well as Leeds, Birmingham and Manchester. In Europe, only Germany has followed Britain's lead and licensed a national PCN opera- tor. The E-Plus consortium plans to launch its PCN service in Berlin and Leipzig early next year. However, PCNs are also being studied in Spain, Italy throughout Scandinavia and in Switzerland. But PCN has stalled in France - blamed by some on the 'not invented here' syndrome. Outside Europe, Thailand has licensed a PCN and Australia is in the middle of consultations. However in the world's largest mobile telephony market, the US, where PCN services are known as Personal Communications Services, their introduction is still dogged by debate and the lack of any agreed standards. The Federal Communications Commission has issued over 150 licences for experimental PCS systems - often using different and incompatible technologies. The complicated regulatory process in the US and a wrangle over radio spectrum threaten to delay the introduction of commercial PCSs until the second half of the decade - a delay which analysts say could cost the US economy billions of dollars and would leave the US trailing Europe and the UK in particular. Over the next few months British consumers will have the first opportunity to pass judgment on the PCN concept and whether it does indeed point the way towards mass mobile telecommunications. Mercury One-2-One's Mr Goswell says: 'I believe there is the opportunity in the UK to turn this market into something much larger than it has been.' He argues that consumers are willing to pay a premium for mobility or 'extended cordlessness' but not as much as has been demanded to date.</p>

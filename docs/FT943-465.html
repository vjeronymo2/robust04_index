			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Bank share of home loans falls by 23% Fresh evidence that the share of new lending held by UK banks in the relatively subdued mortgage market has slipped came yesterday with figures released by the British Bankers' Association, Alison Smith writes. The seasonally adjusted figures for banks' new net lending show a 23 per cent fall between the Pounds 607m figure for last month and the Pounds 785m for August last year. The statistics show that new gross lending by banks in August was Pounds 1.78bn, compared with Pounds 1.81bn in the previous month and Pounds 1.77bn in August last year. However, Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, contrasted the rise in the number of new loans approved but not yet undertaken by banks last month with the fall in the similar set of figures for building societies. He suggested that this might reflect customers' anticipation of the rise in interest rates this month, as they sought to take advantage of the fixed-rate mortgages being promoted by banks.</p>

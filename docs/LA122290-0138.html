			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GENENTECH GETS OK ON DRUG FOR IMMUNE ILLNESS  </P> <P> Genentech said Friday that it received Federal Food and Drug Administration  approval to market a genetically engineered drug to fight chronic granulomatous  disease, a rare, inherited disorder of the immune system.  </P> <P> The drug, Actimmune, is a form of interferon gamma and is the first approval in  the United States of a interferon gamma product. It is Genentech's third  approval of a recombinant drug that it will market itself.  </P> <P> Genentech developed Actimmune under the Orphan Drug Act, which will give it  exclusive rights to market it for this particular disease for seven years.  </P> <P> The company used the announcement of the approval as an opportunity to reaffirm  its support for act.  </P> <P> Although President Bush earlier this year vetoed one bill that would have  altered the act, Genentech expects additional challenges to the law.  </P> <P> Actimmune marketed for this disease won't be a blockbuster for the South San  Francisco-based company -- although it hopes other proposed uses of interferon  gamma will prove important sources of revenue.  </P> <P> But for as many as 400 children across the country who suffer from chronic  granulomatous disease, the FDA approval means they have a better chance of  making it to adulthood.  </P> <P> This rare immune system disorder used to be called "deadly granulomatous"  because it so often claimed children before they reached age 12.  </P> <P> Larry Hudson, a 13-year-old with the disease, will spend Christmas at home in  Prospect, Ore., this year. Just this week, he went snow tubing for the first  time. These ordinary events have special meaning to Larry's parents, Laqueta  and Daniel Hudson.  </P> <P> Laqueta Hudson perhaps makes the case for continued support of the drug act  more elegantly than the company could. "This is a real blessing to have this  drug," she said. "We're not living in terror anymore" and waiting for the next  infection to strike.  </P> <P> Larry is one of many children who have received the drug as part of clinical  trials.  </P> <P> He gets injections three times a week, which he says he doesn't like and tries  to put off.  </P> <P> But even that is better, he readily admits, than going through the hassles and  pains of previous drugs and treatment. And especially, the infections.  </P> <P> Five years ago, Larry was in the hospital for two months -- including Christmas  -- recovering from surgery to remove a large growth on his brain and to treat  many small tumor-like formations in his lung, both caused by the disease.  </P> <P> For many parents, the treatment costs have been devastating, especially  because, as an inherited disease, it often afflicts more than one child in a  family.  </P> <P> Dr. John Curnutte, an expert in the disease who conducted trials of Actimmune  through Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, said that in trials  of the drug, there was a 70% decline in the number of serious infections and  that patients spent only one-third the usual number of days in hospital.  </P> <P> In Hobbs, N.M., two of the three children of Jeannene and Lenard Wagner have  the disease.  </P> <P> Having the drug approved is "an excellent Christmas present," said Jeannene  Wagner.  </P></p>

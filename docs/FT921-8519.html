			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Israeli arms workers in jobs protest THOUSANDS of workers yesterday shut down production at Israel Military Industries (IMI), one of the country's biggest state-owned weapons exporters, and staged an angry demonstration outside Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office to protest at plans for heavy lay-offs at the loss-making company, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. The one-day strike at IMI, best known for producing the Uzi sub-machine gun, follows a steep decline in the fortunes of Israel's military manufacturers. It is an uncomfortable sign for Mr Shamir's government, which faces a general election in June, of growing unease at the level of unemployment - at more than 10 per cent of the workforce. Mr Shamir and Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, met the IMI workers' leaders after some 7,000 demonstrators broke through police lines. The ministers agreed to seek ways of preventing implementation of plans by IMI to dismiss up to 1,500 of its 9,000-strong workforce.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Black Sea Fleet officers have urged the  Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean presidents, the CIS heads of  state and heads of parliament to settle complicated state and  regional issues only through normal negotiations.    The Black Sea Fleet press center told INTERFAX that the  statement had been adopted by the fleet officer meetings  coordinating council in Sevastopol on 24 May. Officers  recommended that the CIS leaders give the appropriate evaluation  to representatives of the Ukrainian power structures stating  their readiness for any decisive actions and to warn them about  personal responsibility for possible consequences.    Due to the concentration of troops in Crimea the Black Sea  Fleet officers proposed that the Ukrainian, Russian and Crimean  presidents guarantee that no force would be used. The Ukrainian  Security Service and Interior Ministry must report on the  additional military formations arrived in Sevastopol without any  notification to the local authorities, the officers emphasized.    The statement underlined that military officers must not be  hostages during struggle for posts and reorganization of the  society among politicians.</p>

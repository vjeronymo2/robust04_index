			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: C&amp;S asks for share suspension CENTRAL &amp; Sheerwood, the engineering and property development group headed by Mr Robert Maxwell, the media magnate, has asked for a temporary suspension of its shares, pending an acquisition announcement. The shares were suspended yesterday at 3 1/4 p. The announcement came as C&amp;S reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.94m (Pounds 2.55m) for 1990. It also announced that it was withdrawing from its property development businesses. The suspension of the shares was described by Charterhouse Bank, its financial adviser, as 'entirely a precautionary move and not on the back of any rumour or speculation.' The rise in profits, achieved in spite of the adverse economic climate in the UK, came on the strength of the group's exports to continental Europe, which constitute 70 per cent of turnover. The entire turnover, up 6.6 per cent to Pounds 53.17m (Pounds 49.87m), and the bulk of the profits, came from the engineering division, where profits rose 53 per cent to Pounds 3m (Pounds 1.95m). Mr Maxwell said the ability of the group's engineering companies to maintain profits depended to a large extent on the level of demand in other EC countries. The property division suffered from the downturn in the UK commercial property market and was not able to make any external property sales at acceptable prices, he said. The decision to cease property development activities came in the wake of a substantially lower property profits of Pounds 134,000 (Pounds 714,000). Earnings per share increased to 0.62p (0.54p) and a final dividend of 0.01p is recommended making a total of 0.2p (0.1p).</p>

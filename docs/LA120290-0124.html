			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING;  </P> <P> 'SHERIFF' AND HIS BRETHREN ARE ON GUARD  </P> <P> When an odds-on favorite named Historically lost a race here, horseplayers did  what their counterparts anywhere in the world would have done: They cursed his  jockey.  </P> <P> One week earlier, jockey Ron Durden had won a steeplechase aboard Historically  by leading all the way. Now, in a similar spot in which the horse looked  unbeatable, Durden put him under wraps and permitted a rival, Snow Gypsy, to  open a 15-length lead. Historically never had a chance of catching him.  </P> <P> Almost anywhere else in the world, bettors would have harbored dark suspicions  about that race that would never be resolved. In the United States, stewards  rarely probe even the most flagrant form reversals, and never question  run-of-the-mill bad rides that cost a horse a victory. In Australia, however,  the system works differently.  </P> <P> Moments after Durden dismounted, he was summoned to the stewards' room, which  is located just a few yards from the jockeys' quarters. Reporters followed him  to the hearing room, for stewards' inquiries here are open to the press. Durden  sat at a table facing six officials, but the eyes boring into him were those of  chief steward John Schreck, a man dubbed by the press as "Sheriff Schreck" for  his commitment to law and order on the track.  </P> <P> The sheriff peered over his spectacles. "We are concerned," he said gravely,  "with the manner in which you rode your horse." Schreck proceeded to grill  Durden about every aspect of his ride. He played films of the race, from  various camera angles, in slow motion and stop-action, quizzing Durden point by  point. Meanwhile, another official was leafing through computer printouts of  the betting patterns on the race.  </P> <P> When Schreck finished his interrogation, he decided the jockey had been at  least partly excused because of trouble his horse had encountered early in the  race, and his conclusions appeared in the regular "Stewards' Report" that was  made public the next day:  </P> <P> "When questioned, Durden explained ... that he endeavored to go forward, but  was inconvenienced by a riderless horse. ... As he was trying to pull the whip  through into his left hand, it became entangled in the reins and the horse's  mane. ..."  </P> <P> Losing bettors still might not have been happy, but at least they knew the race  had been investigated and they had the satisfaction of an explanation.  </P> <P> When I came to Australia to play the horses, I expected the game would include  a fair amount of dishonesty, because there is so much money to be won here.  Perpetrators of a slick coup could collect millions by betting with bookmakers  around the country. So as I started to scrutinize the films of races for  handicapping purposes, I looked hard for horses who were being restrained, or  at least were being given lackadaisical rides, by their jockeys.  </P> <P> I have considerable experience and expertise in this department after watching  so many races in Maryland. But to my surprise, I have scarcely seen a single  ride in a month's time that I could describe as questionable. The reason is  that the Australians are almost fanatical in their determination to keep the  game free from any taint, and their system works because of the way the  stewards operate.  </P> <P> At least six stewards watch a race, aided by a sophisticated set of nine  cameras, and they consult immediately afterward to decide if they have any  questions about any horse's or rider's performance. If so, Schreck said: "We  take the view that it is better to strike when the iron is hot."  </P> <P> Jockeys and trainers are summoned almost immediately for questioning, with the  press in attendance. These queries may yield the information that a horse threw  a shoe during a race or bumped his head on the starting gate or came back  lame-and all of this will appear in the stewards' report.  </P> <P> But the stewards are looking mostly at jockeys. Schreck said that he puts  questionable rides into three categories. At one end of the spectrum are simple  errors of judgment, which usually won't be penalized. At the other end are  out-and-out cases of larceny and he said: "These days, not much of that goes  on." But the tough middle ground falls where a jockey doesn't seem to do enough  to win a race, when he makes "a combination of errors beyond a reasonable  degree."  </P> <P> Last year, one of Australia's leading jockeys, Jim Cassidy, was aboard a horse  named Cruising and, Schreck recalled: "He came out of the gate slow. He didn't  improve during the middle stages. He didn't ride the horse out satisfactorily  in the straight." This sounded, in short, like the way certain jockeys at  Laurel ride just about every day. They don't do it here. Cassidy was slapped  with a one-year suspension.  </P> <P> That's why the jockeys are whipping and driving in the stretch, even when their  mounts are clearly beaten. "Our system," Schreck said, "has a deterrent  effect."  </P> <P> So even though bettors here, as everywhere, will denounce jockeys and will be  slightly paranoid, Australian racing fans have a greater confidence in the  basic integrity of the sport than their counterparts in most other nations. We  suspicious souls from the United States would love to see some of our favorite  jockeys placed on the same continent with Sheriff Shreck.  </P></p>

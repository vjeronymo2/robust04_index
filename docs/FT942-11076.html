			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / W Europe new car sales fall West European new car sales fell in April by 1.2 per cent to 1.08m according to provisional figures released yesterday by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea) and the Spanish motor industry federation, writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent. The fall was the first year-on-year decline this year and has halted, at least temporarily, the fragile recovery in west European new car demand, which started in the first quarter. In the first four months of the year new car sales in west Europe of around 4.29m were 2.7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. The fall in registrations last month was caused chiefly by a sharp drop of around 12.4 per cent year-on-year in new car sales in Germany, which fell to an estimated 298,000 according to Acea.  ------------------------------------------------------------          WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS*  ------------------------------------------------------------                                      April         % Chg                                       1994      yr-on-yr  ------------------------------------------------------------ TOTAL MARKET                     1,084,620         -1.2 Germany                            297,700        -12.4 Italy                              169,950         -2.8 UK                                 142,010         +4.8 France                             184,930        +17.2 Spain                               69,650         +7.2 Netherlands                         40,670         -1.4 Belgium &amp; Luxembourg                40,170         -4.2 Austria                             30,500        -15.3 Switzerland                         27,500         -6.1 Portugal                            19,570        -16.5 Sweden                              15,450        +41.6 Greece                              12,930        -18.5 Denmark                             11,970        +36.5 Ireland                              8,070         +6.0 Norway                               7,420        +62.0 Finland                              6,130        +15.9  ------------------------------------------------------------ *Provisional figures.  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea)  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

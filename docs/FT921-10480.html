			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Business Law: Capital structures threatened A legislative sword of Damocles hangs over the share capital structures of many substantial EC companies. The companies affected are those with dual or multiple class share structures providing for non-voting, restricted or multiple voting shares. The threat is in the European Commission's draft Fifth Company Law Directive, in the form of a proposal to introduce a mandatory 'one share, one vote' system of proportionality. Although first tabled in 1972, little attention has been paid to this aspect of the draft directive. Now, however, it appears that the Council of Ministers may reach a political agreement or 'common position' on the issue during the next 12 months. Before the sword falls, enfranchising non-voting shareholders overnight and effectively disappropriating the property of others, it is worth examining the legality under Community law of a mandatory 'one share, one vote' proposal. The mandatory impact of the proposed Directive appears to threaten such veteran Community law principles as proportionality and respect for acquired property rights, as well as the principle that legislation should not impose burdens on individuals retroactively. If adopted in its current form, article 33 of the draft would oblige public limited companies throughout the EC (and possibly throughout the larger European Economic Area) to respect the principle of 'one share, one vote'. Currently, the only exception is for certain kinds of genuine preference shares. The main concern from a legal standpoint is that it purports to cover the share capital structure of all public limited companies irrespective of when or how their capital structures were established and not just those which come into existence after the Directive has been adopted. The Commission's political will on this issue has hardened over the years. It started from the premise that equity and modernity required a Community standard of 'one share, one vote' on the basis that it would facilitate the reduction of any 'democratic deficit' in a company's shareholding. However, as part of the takeover package proposed by Commissioner Bangemann in 1990, the Commission tabled amendments to the proposed Directive, including article 33, with the aim of creating a level-playing field for takeovers within the EC. The Commission's philosophy now seems to be that the principle of 'one share, one vote' enhances its takeover package because it facilitates transfers of control. Non-voting, restricted voting or multiple voting shares, it argues, can make transfers of control and, in particular, hostile takeover bids, more difficult because they allow a concentration of votes in certain hands. The Commission's views are also incorporated in the current proposal for a Council Regulation introducing the Statute for a European Company ('Societas Europeas'), which includes parallel provisions prohibiting restrictions on voting rights. This Regulation could well be adopted during 1992, thereby creating a precedent for the draft Fifth Directive. However, the approach of the Commission to share voting proportionality may be questionable. First, unequal voting rights are not necessarily inconsistent with the principle of corporate democracy. Investors who are given a choice between voting and non-voting shares may choose the latter because they are more interested in the investment potential than they are in voting rights. The acquisition of shareholdings in a company consists of a series of contractual relationships freely entered into by economic players in a market to maximise their joint welfare. Secondly, the Commission's implicit equating of non-voting, restricted voting or multiple voting shares with defensive tactics in response to the threat of takeovers may require further thought. It needs to take account of the historical perspective which shows that many companies have had multiple class share structures for several generations, long before hostile takeovers became common. Moreover, differential share structures can be seen as attempts to maintain control of the company in the light of additional equity financing rather than attempts to prevent outsiders from taking over the company. It has also not been clearly established how far the introduction of the principle of 'one share, one vote' would in fact contribute to achieving the objective of a level playing field in the EC given the many other obstacles which exist. Even if the gains were significant, it is questionable whether the objective is important enough to justify undoing the balance of established contractual relationships in a company's capital structure. This is a crucial point from the perspective of Community law. If it cannot be established that the means chosen (introduction of the principle of 'one share, one vote') are both appropriate and necessary to attain the objective of a level playing field then a fundamental principle of Community law, the principle of proportionality, will not be respected. However, the draft article 33 also raises other concerns under Community law. As currently worded, the article requires existing companies to adjust their share structures to respect the 'one share, one vote' principle irrespective of when or how those structures were established. Therefore, it disrupts existing legal situations created by the company's statutes on which shareholders based their decisions to invest in the company. Inevitably, existing voting shareholders in those companies affected will find the value of their shareholdings dramatically diluted overnight and non-voting shareholders will be likewise automatically enfranchised when their original contractual bargain did not provide for voting rights. It is this element of disappropriation which may further taint the current formulation of article 33. It is, arguably, in breach of both the acquired property and other rights of a defined class of shareholders in a manner incompatible with Community law. Any resolution of this problem would necessarily involve payment of compensation to the holders of the voting shares for their dilution of voting power. This issue is not yet addressed in the draft Directive and presumably the intention is to leave it for EC countries to resolve when they implement the provisions of the Directive into national law. If so, it will be up to each country to choose, at its discretion, whether and how to deal with it. This could lead to differences in treatment between EC states. If a state does act then - quite apart from the extraordinarily difficult computation problems in finding a solution of universal application which puts a value on company 'control' - it will have to decide who should pay the compensation. One possible solution would be for the compensation to come from the holders of the enfranchised shares. However, any attempt to implement compensation along these lines will give rise to a host of other, equally difficult, problems since it would be asking enfranchised shareholders to pay for something they do not necessarily want. Finally, Community legislation should not impose burdens and obligations on individuals retroactively. The proposed article 33 would do this. This general principle is embodied in the legal systems of most EC states and therefore forms part of the Community legal order. It is inspired by the principle of legal certainty as well as the requirements of the rule of law. The exception to this principle which to date has been applied by the European Court of Justice is where the purpose to be achieved by the legislation clearly requires it. The requirements of 'public interest' are material here and the legitimate expectations of those concerned must be duly respected. Neither of those criteria are fulfilled in the case of the proposed article 33. To avoid the legal consequences of the effects of expropriation and retroactivity, the proposed Directive should make some provision for 'grandfathering'. This would allow companies which already have non-voting, restricted voting and multiple voting share structures to continue with them and to make further share issues. That done, the answer to the question of whether the Community should apply a rigid 'one share, one vote' principle for the future to companies which are not grandfathered should depend on establishing that it is an appropriate means of achieving a level playing field for takeovers in the EC.

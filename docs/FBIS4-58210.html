			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 1 May (SUNA) -- Talks between Sudan and an  IMF delegation, led by the director of the fund's Middle East  department, which arrived in Khartoum last Friday [29 April],  ended this afternoon.    Finance Minister Abdullahi Hasan Ahmad, in a statement to  SUNA, said that the two-day talks discussed steps and proposals  to normalize Sudanese relations with the IMF. He said that  Sudan made proposals to the delegation which, if accepted, would  probably result in the sending of another IMF mission around the  end of this month. That delegation would discuss elements of an  agreement on which the fund's governing council would base its  report, concerning its dealings with Sudan, during its June  meeting.    The minister described this round of the talks as fruitful,  and said that agreement was reached on the delegation's  proposals concerning dealings with Sudan, which would be  conveyed to the governing council.    Sudan's delegation to this round of talks was headed by the  finance minister. Today the delegation met Dr. Muhammad Khayr  al- Zubayr, the minister of state for planning, and Dr. Sabir  Muhammad al-Hasan, the governor of the Bank of Sudan.    The IMF had resolved to compel Sudan to a forced withdrawal  from the organization last February, on grounds that it had not  settled its debt, which amounts to half a billion dollars.</p>

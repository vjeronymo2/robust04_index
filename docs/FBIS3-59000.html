			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with General Philippe Morillon, former </F> UN commander in Bosnia, by Philippe Paquet and Christophe  Lamfalussy; place and date not given: "General Morillon: We  Need Air Power"; first paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE  introduction]    [Text] Believe and dare! You have to be  General Morillon to give such a title -- at a time of such  disillusionment -- to a book about the war in Bosnia. But,  although he is seeking to bring a message of hope, particularly  to the younger generations who may be tempted to believe that  the world has gone mad in the former Yugoslavia, the former  commander of UN peacekeeping operations in Bosnia qualifies  these words six months after his departure from Sarajevo.    "Today, I would be inclined to say `dare to believe' as this  is something which is becoming increasingly difficult to do,"  admits Philippe Morillon in an interview granted to LA LIBRE  BELGIQUE. "I refuse to despair. I want to believe that peace  is still possible, that the ethnic divisions are not so deep as  to prevent a return to community life in the future. In the  field, in any case, our men believe in this because they see the  usefulness of what they are doing. But they need the full  backing of public opinion; if ever doubt takes hold, then we  must pull them out."  <H5>  Reply And Retaliation </H5>   Such doubt could stem from what General Morillon refers to  as  "a misunderstanding, or lack of understanding," among the  general public and also on the part of certain politicians "to  whom we have not sufficiently explained exactly what the  military is calling for in Bosnia."    "We need a sufficient reply capability, which should not be  confused with a retaliation capability which we are not asking  for. It is a question of guaranteeing legitimate defense and to  do that air power is essential. It is the only way of replying  to artillery attacks with the necessary precision as the  batteries which must be taken out are often located behind  civilian shields -- hospitals and schools, etc. -- which must  not be touched. An armed plane or helicopter can fulfill this  mission as was shown in the Gulf War. Also, this force would  also have a deterrent value. People may be brave, they are not  necessarily reckless."  <H5>  The Somali Trap </H5>   "The one thing we must avoid," continues Philippe Morillon,  "is to confuse intervention and humanitarian aid as we did in  Somalia. That is a mistake, a disastrous confusion of different  kinds of activity. Our task is to see that humanitarian aid  gets through, without which no survival is possible -- at least  during winter -- and we must not fall into the trap of those who  claim that by providing this aid we are simply prolonging the  war. And if we have chosen not to intervene -- that is not to  side with any of the belligerent parties -- it is because we  believe the remedy would be worse than the disease, that we  would be serving to deepen the divide between the communities."  <H5>  There Is Still Time </H5>   General Morillon believes that "it is not too late to stop  the ethnic cleansing, but the situation gets worse by the day,  due to the continuing destruction which deepens the divide, and  people being exiled. This is an absolute necessity. We must,  for example, oppose the creation of a Muslim state in the heart  of Bosnia because that would give a doomed hope to Muslim  fundamentalism and create a Gaza Strip in Europe. This is why  the Western objective is to reestablish a multicultural  democracy in the former Yugoslavia."    Despite the protracted Bosnian conflict, Philippe Morillon  wants to believe that this objective can still be met but, he  stresses: "We must be careful not to become impatient. The new  international order cannot be established overnight. This  country will escape from its present drama when its citizens  have understood that they must no longer allow themselves to be  led to collective suicide by a handful of extremists who hold  power. I believe that if free elections were held in Bosnia  today, the extremists would be driven from office. Failing  this, we must give notice to all the protagonists to act in  accordance with the desire for peace they profess."  <H5>  Stop the Hypocrisy </H5>   In the meantime, concludes the hero of Srebrenica,  "countries  must stop the hypocrisy of refusing to grant the United Nations  the necessary resources to implement the missions they confer  upon it. Countries which do not even pay their debts with  respect to an international organization which -- in any event  -- we simply cannot do without."</p>

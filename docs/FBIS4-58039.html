			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Apr. 27, INA--AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper of  Baghdad today said ideas of the former American President  Richard Nixon had greatly influenced the behaviours of President  Bill Clinton and boosting his antagonism to Iraq.    A paper editorial said that viewpoints of President Nixon  toward Iraq, which were reflected in his book had equalled  between the danger of Iraq to the West with that of the Soviet  Union and pointed out that Bill Clinton insists on obstructing  the lifting of the embargo so that Iraq would not resume its  liberation role for peace, stability and justice in the region.    The paper said that Nixon, in his book admits that the  influence of Saddam Husayn's Iraq bypasses its geographic size  and makes it in the same level of influence of the Soviet Union  toward international events.    The Iraqi paper further said that the former American  president added in his book that Saddam Husayn's Iraq and the  Soviet Union represented the most significant dangers and  challenges that had faced the world.    It explained that Nixon assessments were based on various  political and geopolitical realities that could not be  concealed, prominent among which is that Iraq is considered one  of the few countries that would have an essential role in world  economy, the world technological growth and the balances of  regional and international forces.    Referring to the factor of oil, the paper said that oil is  an  effective power in the hand of Iraq and that oil would remain  the major source of energy in the world for another century and  consequently the one who dominates oil would have an effective  role in the world of tomorrow.    AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper said the second effective power is  technology which started to be acquired by most nations and had  minimized the importance of some countries that had  technological supermacy.    The paper added that patriotic policy also influences the  role of countries in international events and that the  independent political course of some world countries has become  a giant power feared by the big powers which try to place the  world under their hegemony.    The paper linked this reality with the plots and aggressive  plans and said that America resolved to destroy countries that  maintain an independent course like Yugoslavia and that its  attempts with Iraq had failed.    AL-JUMHURIYAH expressed conviction over having oil as a  strong weapon in the hands of Iraq alongside other weapons for  the sake of confirming its effective role and position in the  region and said that the independent policy of Iraq represents  the basic guarantee for having oil away from imperialist  domination and turning technology into a striking power in  steadfastness and progress.    The paper said that all those facts interpreted Nixon  outlook  toward Iraq and were represented in the fact that Saddam  Husayn's iraq constitutes an obstacle that could not be removed  before the attempts of American imperialism dominates the world  and that is why we see Clinton insists on obstructing the  lifting of the embargo imposed on Iraq.</p>

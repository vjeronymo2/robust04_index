			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Corporate bribe structure starts to crack: Robert Thomson on changed relations between Japan's politicians and contractors WHEN a television microphone was rammed in his face and reporters pursued his black limousine down a Tokyo back street, Mr Teruzo Yoshino, the patriarch of Japan's construction industry, must have sensed that he was falling from grace. The end of courtesy in Japan means the beginning of trouble for accused politicians and executives, guilty or not, as associates and journalists are indicating that they no longer feel compelled to cultivate a long-term friendship. By arresting the venerable Mr Yoshino, 75, head of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors and chairman of Shimizu, the country's leading construction company, the prosecutors' office is attempting to alter the terms of a most important friendship, that between the politician and the contractor. Mr Yoshino, taken into custody on Monday, and two other Shimizu executives arrested yesterday - Mr Hirokuki Koyama, a vice-chairman, and Mr Akikazu Matsumoto, a managing director - are claimed to have given Y10m (Pounds 63,000) to Mr Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of Ibaraki prefecture north of Tokyo. This was in the alleged hope that their company would win a share of a planned prefectural complex and medical university. Before a rush of arrests over the past year, most Japanese were aware that politicians and contractors had stitched together unsavoury deals. Politicians provided the projects and the construction companies ensured their local member had cash to cope with an expensive election campaign. But the prosecutors' office was surprised by the depth of personal corruption uncovered during investigations. Tolerance of illegal links was based on an understanding that, a few banquets aside, most contractors' money went on political fighting funds and not into personal bank accounts. Not that Mr Yoshino was guilty of excess, nor necessarily of anything else, though the Construction Ministry has already suspended Shimizu from bidding for public works contracts for four months. 'I would never do anything as silly as attempt to bribe someone,' insisted Mr Yoshino shortly before his detention. Wedged between two investigators, Mr Yoshino, without the dignity of a tie, was driven to the Tokyo Detention Centre and took with him the reputation of Japan's construction industry, allegedly corrupt in its collusion and competition to win contracts. US criticism of Japan's construction market has been aimed at the collusion embodied in dango, the cartels which traditionally organised the outcome of contract awards. But the 18 arrests arising from alleged corruption in prefectures north of Tokyo can be traced to the breakdown of industry collusion and the outbreak of fierce competition. Leading contractors admit to courting Mr Takeuchi, who resigned as Ibaraki's governor after having been charged with receiving Y55m in bribes. Mr Yoshino, who went to the same high school as Mr Takeuchi, says he visited Ibaraki after learning that executives from rival companies had done the same in the hope of winning contracts. The executives were right to respect the influence of Mr Takeuchi, who is said to have informed officials presiding over contract awards that 'I met Mr X of Y company and he is a wonderful guy'. Prosecutors have leaked details of restaurant dinners at which an empty shopping bag was allegedly left behind for a contractor to pay financial tribute to the then governor. By targeting Mr Yoshino, the prosecutors were suggesting that the pre-bid bidding for the Ibaraki governor's favours was a national trend which had to be stopped. The prosecutors judged that a lower-profile investigation into lesser officials would not have the necessary impact on politicians or their contractor friends. Having struck at Shimizu, the prosecutors are concentrating on two other leading companies. The campaign is directed more at a corporate culture than at individuals, but companies are often quick to disown executives taken into custody. As Mr Yoshino knows, regardless of his guilt, the next stage of his fall will come if the company suggests that he acted alone and that it 'regrets' the incident. Shimizu is still defending the chairman: 'We had conducted an internal investigation into the bribery allegations and we cannot believe that they are true.' Industry specialists said Shimizu, which receives just under a fifth of its total orders from the public sector, could miss out on contracts worth as much as Y100bn. However, that figure does not include potential losses from private clients now unwilling to hire the company. The arrest of the Shimizu executives puts added pressure on the Construction Ministry to devise a bidding process for public works projects that gives value for money and ensures fairer competition. US officials want an end to a system in which bidders are designated by government officials, who are supposed to use technical competence, safety records and financial health, not conviviality, as their guide. The Construction Ministry says the designated system ensures that only qualified companies compete for projects, but it has never made clear how companies are assessed, making the system prone to abuse. If the prosecutors have their way, the ministry will be more open about the designation process and less open to overtures from politicians.</p>

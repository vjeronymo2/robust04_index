			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Banesto deal is key step in sale of Acerinox THE sale of Acerinox, the Spanish integrated stainless steel producer, to a multinational group has taken an important step forward with the sale of 24.9 per cent of its equity by Corporacion Banesto, the industrial holding group, to its parent, the retail bank Banesto, for Pta22.8bn (Dollars 202m). The bank, which is understood to be negotiating with several groups interested in Acerinox, paid Pta9,500 per share to Corporacion Banesto compared with the market price of Pta6,340. This puts a price tag in excess of Pta100bn for Acerinox against a market value of between Pta60bn and Pta70bn. The deal between the conglomerate and its controlling shareholder was viewed as window dressing for the industrial holding company's balance sheet, which will realise capital gains of about Pta4.9bn from the deal, and as an important step towards the sale of Acerinox, a company which for several months has been cited as ripe for disposal. Under new guidelines governing ownership by banking institutions of industrial assets, Banesto, which consolidates its accounts with Corporacion Banesto, has to reduce its stake in companies such as Acerinox. Analysts believe that the change in the steel producer's equity from the industrial holding to the parent bank smooths the path towards its sale in addition to setting a notional price for the company. Groups cited as expressing an interest in Acerinox include Ilva of Italy, South Africa's Gencor and Anglo American, France's Usinor-Sacilor and Nisshin Steel of Japan. Acerinox has a 33 per cent stake in a 110,000 tonnes Mexican cold rolling mill controlled by Mexinox and shares ownership with Armco of the US of North American Stainless with its 120,000 tonnes cold rolling mill in Kentucky. Acerinox's first half consolidated profits this year fell by 69 per cent to Pta1.2bn.</p>

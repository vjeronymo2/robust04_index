			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: The cost of credit card queries SOME OF the credit card charges being introduced by banks are more insidious than they look. It now seems that if customers dispute a transaction, they may in some cases be charged for having the item checked and a replacement voucher provided. An FT reader writes that he is trying to get Barclaycard to investigate why he appears to have paid twice for a British Airways London to Glasgow air ticket. He notes that he was travelling with a colleague who shared the same surname and also paid by Barclaycard. A letter to Barclaycard produced a promise to check out the details - and a warning that, if he was wrong, he would be charged Pounds 3. Credit card operations are highly computerised these days and there is little personal service. A customer who rings an issuer is likely to be sent a cumbersome form to be filled-in, rather than being given an on-the-spot explanation. Barclaycard sticks to its guns on this. 'It is very costly for us to go back to the original bank which issued the voucher to the retailer and request a copy of it. The Pounds 3 charge, in fact, doesn't even cover the cost of doing that,' a spokeswoman said. She added: 'It is sometimes the case that people simply forget what they have paid for, or don't keep their vouchers, so we may have to charge them for issuing duplicate ones.' No other mass retailer would dream of charging customers for writing them a letter or checking their account details to see if they are accurate. Banks commonly make mistakes and, as some of them admit in private, these tend to be at the customer's expense. If clients know they may be fined for challenging a payment, they will be even slower to defend their rights.</p>

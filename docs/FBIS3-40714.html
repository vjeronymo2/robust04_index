			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--In a significant observation, the  foreign secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, has said India was willing to  discuss with Pakistan some compromise to resolve the Kashmir  issue, reports UNI.    Making the comment in an interview with "Asianet" satellite  channel, the foreign secretary said that during his talks with  his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Shaharyar Khan, in January next  year, he would have a "limited brief, that is to emphasize to my  colleagues in Pakistan that we are willing to reason with them  to find some compromise to this difficult problem."    Mr Dixit said unilateral and "absolute claims cannot be the  basis for solving this problem."    "We have to take into account the developments of over 40  years on both sides of the line of control, in seeing where we  should go," he added.    The foreign secretary noted that "previously we were saying  that we will not discuss Kashmir at all unless interference and  support to terrorism was stopped."    "We have now been told that they (Pakistan) are willing to  discuss this aspect. If that is so, we can take the next step  for dealing with Kashmir directly.    Referring to the Clinton administration's decision to  withdraw the Pressler amendment, Mr Dixit said that Washington  was pursuing a policy of non-discrimination and pressure to push  countries towards non-proliferation.    The first step would be to withdraw the Pressler amendment  and then introduce legislation, which will apply to all  countries about whom they have doubts.    He said that in the last 18-19 years "We have constantly  taken a decision not to make N-weapons."    The foreign secretary expressed views on a number of topics  including India's relations with China, the U.S. and other  issues.    On India's relations with China, Mr Dixit said both sides  have an equal level of reasonableness in interacting with each  other.    He said then Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi's visit to  China  was a landmark. The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's  visit in September laid firm foundations, which culminated in  the signing of an agreement to maintain peace and tranquility on  the line of actual control.    The foreign secretary said China is not only a regional  power, but a global power. He said India should not also  underestimate the capacity of three continental  states--Kazakhstan, Russia and Japan.</p>

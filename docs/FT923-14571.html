			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Twelve may delay new deal for Turks TURKEY'S failure to introduce human rights legislation before parliament went into recess last week could jeopardise British efforts to secure Turkey a better deal with the EC during the UK's six-month Community presidency. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, is set to present a special report on Turkey in mid-July, and diplomats believe Ankara has missed an historic opportunity to improve its human rights record, the main blight on relations with the EC. The delay, with the draft now not due to be brought to parliament before September, represents a personal setback for the prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, whose election pledge 'to make the police stations out of glass' was warmly welcomed by western governments. Since forming his coalition government in October, Mr Demirel has created a Human Rights Ministry and assigned an ethnic Kurd to run it, signalling a new approach to the long-running problems faced by Turkey's minority Kurdish community. For the first time, Turkey encouraged open debate on human rights. The proposed amendments to the criminal procedure code - central to stamping out the problem of torture - came unstuck when ministers were unable to agree the treatment of political and terrorist offences, and in particular the period of police detention. President Turgut Ozal earlier vetoed the draft, arguing that any reduction in detention periods would hamper investigations, an attitude Mr Demirel appears to support. For all the rhetoric, in Mr Demirel's first 200 days in office, both the number of deaths in custody and the incidence of unexplained disappearances and killings in the Kurdish region appear to have increased. The draft proposed that police custody for 'conspiracy' crimes be limited to eight days, extended to 16 on referral to a judge. The current anti-terror law allows for a maximum 30-day detention. Mr Demirel and his Social Democrat coalition partners were then unable to agree a compromise which would have allowed the law to take effect for all but those cases handled in military controlled state security court - in effect making an exception for Kurdish prisoners.</p>

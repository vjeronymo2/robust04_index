			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THOMPSON HASN'T DECIDED ABOUT BECOMING MANAGER OF THE NUGGETS  </P> <P> John Thompson said today that he still hasn't decided whether he will leave  Georgetown, where he has coached for 18 years, to become general manager of the  Denver Nuggets.  </P> <P> Thompson is considering an offer worth more than $6 million from the NBA team.  Reports said he was presented with a four- or five-year deal worth $700,000 per  year and as much as 4% ownership of the Nuggets. That percentage would be worth  about $2.8 million.  </P> <P> "If you think I'm considering an offer, you're absolutely right. If you think  I've made up my mind, you're absolutely wrong," the basketball coach said at a  news conference at the school.  </P> <P> Thompson said he was just starting to talk to Georgetown officials about the  offer and would not set a timetable on making a decision.  </P> <P> Thompson's agent, David Falk of Arlington, Va.-based ProServ, was in Chicago  today, as were Nuggets General Counsel Glen Grunwald and team President Carl  Scheer. But Thompson said the three had no plans to meet.  </P> <P> "David's not there on my behalf," Thompson said at a news conference at the  school. "He also happens to represent a young man named Michael Jordan."  </P> <P> Scheer confirmed that an offer was made to Thompson, adding: "The ball's in his  court."  </P> <P> This is not the first time an NBA team has tried to woo Thompson from  Georgetown, where he has a 423-142 record and guided the Hoyas to the 1984  national championship. Several NBA teams have approached Thompson, including  the New York Knicks and Seattle SuperSonics, Falk said.  </P> <P> "This is an annual thing with John," Falk said. "Where it goes from here is up  to John. There have been discussions, but no agreement."  </P> <P> Falk, who also represents Jordan, Patrick Ewing and Boomer Esiason, said  Thompson already has had two meetings with Nuggets owners Peter Bynoe, Bertram  Lee and Bob Wussler, the last a lengthy Sunday session in Washington.  </P> <P> Bynoe's only comment was: "The organization stands by the statement of Carl  Scheer. I am not at liberty to discuss the details of our meeting."  </P> <P> Thompson said in Monday's late editions of USA Today: "I would say I'll be  coaching at Georgetown next year. That's what I believe will happen, (but) we  are exploring our options. I think I owe it to myself to listen any time  somebody proposes something to me."  </P> <P> Thompson earns more than $400,000 as Georgetown coach and has a contract with  Nike Inc. that pays him about $250,000 a year.  </P></p>

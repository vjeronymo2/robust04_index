			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Calls mount in Japan for surplus cuts The Keidanren, Japan's influential business federation, yesterday joined leading businessmen and politicians in urging the government to adopt voluntary targets to reduce Japan's surplus in the medium term. The move reflects increasing public frustration in Japan over the government's inability to deal with mounting friction with the US. Among the measures called for by the Keidanren is the adoption of future targets to cut Japan's current account surplus. In a paper it said the Japanese government needed to reformulate its US policy as soon as possible. The 'period of reflection' was not long, it said, referring to a cooling-off period agreed between Tokyo and Washington after failure to reach agreement on key issues in framework trade negotiations. To improve relations 'the government must carry out its promises to the US in a reliable manner,' the Keidanren said. On the macro-economic side, the government should adopt voluntary medium-term targets for 'a highly significant reduction in the surplus,' as agreed between the two countries. This is the first time the business federation has specifically asked the government to adopt such targets and goes against stated government policy of not adopting targets it cannot guarantee it will achieve or which could lead to managed trade. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, said on Sunday that Japan could adopt a mid-term voluntary target to help create a better environment in negotiations with the US after recent talks ended in deadlock. While emphasising that it would be dangerous to set such targets at a micro-economic level, Mr Hata said it would be possible to calculate what part of GDP would be served by domestic production over the medium term. The Keidanren's position and Mr Hata's remarks reflect a growing feeling that Japan must send a clear signal to the US of its intent to reduce the current account surplus. In the immediate aftermath of a US-Japan summit last month, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, won acclaim for resisting US pressure to impose targets. But as the US has tightened the screw with its revival of the Super 301 trade act, which provides Washington with ammunition to retaliate against what it considers unfair trade practices, the Japanese public is becoming increasingly frustrated with the government's failure to smooth tensions. The Ministry of Finance, however, has staunchly opposed the setting of targets on the country's current account surplus.</p>

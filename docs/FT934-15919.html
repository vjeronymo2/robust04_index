			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (9): Chasing the Chinese dragon - Company Profile, Acer Group THE Acer Group, Taiwan's largest computer company, is pursuing the 'Chinese dragon dream', aiming to establish itself as the first Chinese company to become a world leader in the computer market. It is an ambitious goal, but already the company is among the top 10 in the personal computer field. Acer's progress has made Mr Stan Shih, its founder, chairman and chief executive, a hero in Taiwan. As one of the island's most influential business leaders, he is now playing a central role in efforts to shift the island's industrial base from low-cost manufacturing to more advanced product development and marketing, or from 'the bargain basement to the luxury goods department' as they say in Taiwan. 'In Taiwan we must establish our own technology development and international marketing capabilities if we are to remain competitive,' says Mr Shih. The Taiwanese electronics industry has become the island's biggest source of exports largely as a result of its ability to provide low-cost, high-volume, sub-contract manufacturing services to US, Japanese and European personal computer companies. Yet its future is clouded by rising costs that are undermining Taiwan's competitive advantages in world markets. As Taiwan's newly industrialised economy begins to mature, the need for large-scale investment in technology development and international marketing is becoming critical, Shih maintains. 'In the long run there is no other way for Taiwanese manufacturers to compete with China or south-east Asia where costs are much lower,' he says. His message has not been lost on the Taiwanese government which is spending about Dollars 450m a year on research and development programmes, much of it aimed at the information processing industry. Manufacturers also get tax credits for investments in R&amp;D, training, automation or international brand name promotion. Yet many in the business community remain sceptical. The typical Taiwanese high tech business spends only 1-2 per cent of revenues on research and development, and another 1-2 per cent on marketing, Mr Shih estimates. 'That is why they can offer low prices.' Acer's R&amp;D spending runs at about 5 per cent of revenues, with an addition outlay of more than 5 per cent on marketing. Even this is well below many of its foreign competitors. While there is a broad consensus that Taiwan needs to become less dependent upon foreign technology, the need for marketing efforts is less widely accepted. Spending money on international advertising and promotion is a relatively new concept in Taiwan where many manufactured products end up bearing the brand name of a western company. Acer is one of very few Taiwan companies to have established it own name in world markets. Others include Pro Kennex, the tennis racquet maker and Giant bicycle. Four years ago, Mr Shih became the founding chairman of a business group aimed at boosting the marketing skills of Taiwan's industries. The Brand International Promotion Association (Bipa) has attracted about 100 members who can participate in training programs in marketing, public relations, advertising , corporate identity and image building. Bipa, initially hailed for its forward-looking efforts, came under fire two years ago when several of its member companies fell into bankruptcy and Acer itself recorded losses. 'The general public blamed spending on brand promotion for the financial problems, but they were unrelated,' Mr Shih recalls. Brand promotion is considered too risky, and it takes too long to see a return on the investments, he explains. 'It takes perhaps two years to see returns from manufacturing. Technology development may take three to four years and require 10 times as much effort. Image building takes one hundred times the effort. It takes a very long time.' Yet from Mr Shih's point of view, establishing Acer's brand name is a matter of necessity. 'Without your brand name, without a good image, your business is unstable because you are totally dependent upon the performance of the companies that you supply.' A mix of brand name and sub-contract business is ideal, he says, because one offsets the risks of the other. Acer has also moved faster than other Taiwan companies to establish a presence in international markets. The group now has operations in more than 70 countries, many of which operate as semi-autonomous business units. Some are partly owned by local employees. Acer's approach to 'globalisation' reflects Taiwan's small-business culture. 'The textbooks are all from a US or Japanese point of view, but we have to do it our own way,' says Mr Shih. 'The Chinese are individuals, but they are not so good at teamwork,' he explains. 'A chinese manager can lead perhaps 1,000 people; in the US it might be 5,000; and in Japan maybe 10,000. That is our nature.' Three years ago, Acer decentralised its management to create independent business units and began spinning off ownership of subsidiaries to employees and local investors. The group's Taiwan manufacturing operations were split into two affiliate companies, while its most profitable sales unit, serving Latin America and Asia-Pacific, also became independent earlier this year. In international markets, Acer has formed partnerships with its distributors, transforming them into local assembly operations by shipping sub-assemblies from Taiwan and purchasing other components locally. The goal, says Mr Shih, is to create a consortium of 'real borderless global companies with a local-touch global brand name.' While prizing entrepreneurial independence, Mr Shih, unlike many of his western counterparts, welcomes government involvement in Taiwan's high-tech industry. 'We need a national strategy,' he says, 'to set a direction for the private sector.' The government should also create the right infrastructure for the high-tech industry to flourish, he believes. 'The government is like a parent, motivating its children to study hard, and rewarding them for their efforts.' In many regards the Taiwan government has served the industry well, Mr Shih believes. But 'the most difficult government strategy we lack is on Taiwan-China relations.' There is a growing conflict in Taiwan between business and government over rising Taiwanese investments in mainland China. 'The Ministry of Economics really understands that China is a great opportunity for Taiwan's business, but because of political issues this strategy cannot be realised,' says Mr Shih. Current government regulations prohibit the transfer of Taiwan's most advanced technologies to mainland China. Taiwan's computer companies are allowed to establish assembly operations on the mainland, but are required to prove that their investments in Taiwan outstrip those on the mainland. However, the regulations are widely ignored, even government officials acknowledge. As one of Taiwan's most visible companies, Acer is moving slowly to establish itself on the mainland. The group has committed itself to open a keyboard and computer monitor manufacturing operation in China by the end of next year and has begun building up a network of service and distribution offices. Some of Acer's US competitors are steaming ahead. Over recent weeks both Compaq Computer and AST Research have announced joint ventures in China. Ironically, despite their proximity to mainland China, Taiwan's computer makers may be at a disadvantage in exploiting the potential of this emerging market. 'Today, the requirement for us to invest in China is not so critical. But it may be critical next year or in two years,' says Mr Shih. He is optimistic that the Taiwan government will recognise the problem and ease its China-investment regulations in the near future. Mr Shih compares Acer's efforts to achieve its 'Chinese dragon dream' to the ancient game of 'Go'. It will take patience, endurance and strategic planning if Acer is to win market share, or territory, away from its competitors. The Taiwanese are hardly new to this game. The computer market is merely a new playing field.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA AND WHITE FOE OF APARTHEID REUNITED AFTER 28 YEARS  </P> <P> Jailed black leader Nelson R. Mandela held an emotional reunion Thursday with  an 84-year-old white woman who was his co-defendant in a landmark  anti-apartheid trial 28 years ago.  </P> <P> Helen Joseph, who in the 1960s was one of the first whites banned by the  government, spent four hours with Mandela in Victor Verster Prison near Cape  Town.  </P> <P> "He was in very good form, full of jokes, full of laughter," Joseph said  outside the prison gate. "He looks forward to coming home, but he doesn't know  when it will be."  </P> <P> Joseph, who is now confined to a wheelchair, described the meeting as a  "wonderful, friendly, loving visit."  </P> <P> Mandela, 71, heads the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.  He has been imprisoned for more than 27 years and is serving a life sentence  for plotting to overthrow the white-run government. His release is widely  expected within weeks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, South African officials have for the first time allowed Mandela to  talk by telephone with exiled African National Congress leaders from his prison  cell.  </P> <P> Alfred Nzo, general secretary of the ANC, said Thursday that he spoke to  Mandela for the first time in 26 years Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "I know his voice. When he came on the line, I immediately knew it was Nelson,"  Nzo said. He said he last spoke with Mandela in 1963, when both were in  Pretoria prison.  </P> <P> Mandela and Joseph emerged as leading voices of the anti-apartheid movement in  the 1950s. They were among more than 150 co-defendants at a 1956-61 treason  trial.  </P> <P> All the accused were acquitted, but the trial made clear the government's  intention to clamp down on opponents. Mandela went underground shortly after  the trial to form the ANC's armed wing. He was arrested in 1962 and has been  imprisoned since.  </P> <P> Joseph resumed her anti-apartheid activities after the trial but was placed  under police restrictions, including house arrest, for most of the 1960s and  1970s. Police lifted the restrictions in 1982, when she was 77. A year later,  she was arrested for singing and giving a clenched-fist, black power salute  while attending a treason trial.  </P> <P> Last year, the African National Congress awarded Joseph its highest award for  her "outstanding contribution to the struggle to end apartheid and transform  South Africa into a united, democratic and non-racial country."  </P> <P> Joseph still attends anti-apartheid rallies and is greeted with rousing cheers  by black audiences.  </P> <P> She said Mandela has agreed to meet government leaders, including President  Frederik W. de Klerk, because "the time has come for peaceful talks between the  government and the ANC."  </P> <P> "The ANC can't give up the armed struggle at this stage, but he (Mandela) is  very hopeful," Joseph said.  </P></p>

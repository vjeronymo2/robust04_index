			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Observer: Worldly wise Whisper it quietly. The World Bank is about to get a new spin doctor, and not before time. Just when it should be basking in the glory of its 50th anniversary, all sorts of people have been taking pot-shots at it for spending far too much money on its new headquarters and nowhere near enough on helping the world's poorest countries. Instead of '50 more years', there is an increasing body of opinion that the World Bank slogan should be '50 years is enough'. Those on the right argue that the markets can take over its role as investors in developing countries, while those on the left counter that the bank's programmes hurt rather than help the poor. Its public image would seem to be in need of urgent repair. The hunt has been on for some time to find a replacement for Alex Shakow, the current head of the bank's external relations, who is going to another job inside the World Bank. However, the smart money is on Mark Malloch Brown, 40, a Brit who used to write for The Economist and currently works for a political consultancy in Washington. In between he has worked for the UNHCR, helped Corazon Aquino get elected in the Philippines, and been involved in Refugees International. Clearly a man who knows his way around the world's trouble spots.</p>

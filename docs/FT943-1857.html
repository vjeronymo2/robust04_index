			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Fares discussion change rejected A railway passengers' watchdog yesterday threw out a British Rail proposal that up to 72 hours should be allowed for 'consultation' over fare changes. The Central Rail Users' Consultative Committee rejected the BR plan at its quarterly meeting on the grounds that 72 hours was not long enough for genuine consultation. Its stand won the backing of the Office of the Rail Regulator. The committee, which brings together regional passenger committees, was considering a draft proposal from BR on fares consultation. Last year's legislation privatising BR gave the committee the right to be consulted over fare changes. Yesterday's move could force the train operating companies which take over services from BR to involve local passenger committees at an earlier stage. At present BR announces one set of fare changes a year, but monitoring fares will become more complicated as the 25 train operators announce their own tariffs. Major-General Lennox Napier, committee chairman, said 72 hours 'amounts to information, not consultation'. Mr John Nelson, managing director of BR's south-eastern train operating companies, said any proposal for a longer consultation period would have to take into account the impact on the train operators' ability to manage their businesses. Maj-Gen Napier said the committee and BR needed to go 'back to the drawing board' to look at the Railways Act in detail to produce a new proposal for fares consultation.</p>

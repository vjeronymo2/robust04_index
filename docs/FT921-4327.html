			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Royal Mail seeks to end 'Buggins' turn' system ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, wants to scrap its promotion system for postal workers, which relies on 'Buggins' turn' - advancement through long service. Management had originally set a deadline of yesterday for reform of the rules but has run into union opposition. The UCW postal workers' union says more than 20 of its branches want to hold ballots for industrial action on the issue. 'Buggins' turn' is increasingly under siege. From the end of this month British Rail station workers will be promoted on merit rather than length of service. RMT, the transport union, has already largely agreed to the changes at BR. Candidates for Postman Higher Grade (PHG) jobs take a written test but, if there is more than one candidate, promotion goes to the applicant with longest service. PHG workers supervise sorting and earn 15 per cent more than basic-grade postal workers. Royal Mail management has argued that the system works against equal opportunities but the UCW says promotion by seniority prevents favouritism or prejudice against women and ethnic minorities. The Equal Opportunities Commission says it is generally against promotion by seniority because it could, for example, work against women who take career breaks to care for children. It favours promotion solely on merit. The union said Royal Mail tried to reform the system last summer. It added that a circular was issued but was implemented by local managers only in areas where there are now threats of industrial action. Royal Mail says that negotiations with the union are 'amicable' and are aimed at 'codifying the way experience balances against merit'. Experience would still play a part in selecting PHG workers, described by management as the 'non-commissioned officers of the sorting-room floor'.</p>

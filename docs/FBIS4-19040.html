			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Rwandan Ambassador to Belgium, Francois </F> Ngarukiyintwali, with unidentified correspondents in Brussels;  from a "special newscast"--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Some of your people in Rwanda say  that the Belgians are responsible [for the downing of the  president's aircraft]. Can you refute this?    [Ngarukiyintwali] Now, listen, in this tragic situation,  particularly with regard to this issue, let us remain calm. Let  us wait for the results of the investigation which already has  begun. This investigation, which already has begun, must be an  objective exercise which will determine who was responsible.    [Correspondent] You were summoned by the Belgian foreign  minister yesterday. What did you tell him in particular about  how this anti-Belgian campaign, which currently is ravaging  Rwanda, should be stopped?    [Ngarukiyintwali] I admit that I was summoned to the Belgian  Foreign Ministry, where I met with that ministry's cabinet  director. He has informed me about the considerations and  worries of his government, and it is my role as ambassador to  transmit these to my government for its review and  consideration. But, in principle, I can tell you that the  Rwandan Government has asked me to do everything possible to  avoid irritating Belgian-Rwandan relations.    [Correspondent] You distributed a note here from the  [Rwandan] minister of foreign affairs and cooperation that  accuses the [Belgian] blue helmets, who were entrusted with  guaranteeing the airport's safety, and which says that the  president's plane could have been downed by criminals because of  the Belgians' failure. Do you believe that the blue helmets  were responsible?    [Ngarukiyintwali] You say that I think...[changes to]  thought  I only gave you a document for your information which our  Foreign Ministry submitted to the UNAMIR [UN Mission in  Rwanda]....    [Correspondent, interrupting] You represent this government.    [Ngarukiyintwali] I represent this government. So, this  document was submitted to UNAMIR, and you will have to wait for  the UNAMIR's answer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation treats the change of control of a registrant with the SEC as a change of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA. For other corporations not closely held, the regulation treats as a change of ownership and control any action by which a person who has or thereby acquires a legal or beneficial ownership interest in that corporation obtains both ownership of 25 percent of the voting stock of the corporation, or the right under a proxy, power of attorney, or similar agreement to vote that share, and actual control. Conversely, relinquishing that control would also constitute a change within the meaning of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters believe that a change from a for-profit to a nonprofit status should not be considered a change of ownership and control within the meaning of section 498(i) of the HEA at all; others thought that so long as management remained the same, or the facility, staff, and management remained the same, that the regulations should not treat changes in tax-filing status as significant under section 498(i) of the HEA. Other commenters felt strongly that a change from for-profit to nonprofit status should be considered a change of ownership and control within the scope of this section, and noted the various changes already made in the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and in particular those proposed in regulations, that were designed to prevent program weaknesses and abuse among for-profit institutions. The commenter stated that these measures would readily be frustrated by unscrutinized conversion to nonprofit status, and would be contrary to the objectives of increasing protection for students and the public. The commenter believed that there was little reason to expect that the institution would improve its financial strength by such a conversion, and that it may in fact have increased its liabilities in the process, yet under the proposed financial responsibility standards, the school upon conversion would claim the benefit of a more lenient financial responsibility test than that which it would have faced had it remained a for-profit entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary recognizes that institutions that change from for-profit to nonprofit status may well retain the very same faculty, management, programs and facilities. The very fact that the institution retains these characteristics through the conversion, however, points out the logic of ensuring that section 498(i) of the HEA be applied to these conversions in a way that is consistent with congressional intent to impose a range of precautions and restrictions on for-profit vocational schools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the strong congressional intent evidenced in these statutory changes to restrict title IV, HEA program participation by proprietary trade schools, the Secretary considers it reasonable to treat changes in business form by such institutions to a status to which those restrictions do not necessarily apply as significant changes warranting the same scrutiny section 498(i) of the HEA dictates for other, perhaps far less consequential changes in governance by schools. Moreover, a change from taxable to nonprofit, tax-exempt status contains sufficient elements of a change in ownership and control to fall within the scope of section 498(i) of the HEA. Although changes in the form of incorporation from for-profit to nonprofit are governed by a variety of State laws, only those nonprofit organizations that meet the further restrictions of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code qualify to participate in the title IV, HEA programs as nonprofit institutions. (See 34 CFR 600.2 and 600.6(a).) To so qualify, a corporation must not merely ensure that its net earnings do not benefit private individuals, but that, unlike a general corporation that may engage in any lawful business, this nonprofit institution must be organized and operated exclusively for educational or other qualifying purposes. Furthermore, unlike other corporations, including those nonprofit institutions that are not tax-exempt, the incorporators or shareholders must forego any residual claim to a distribution of corporate assets upon dissolution of the corporation. Acceptance of these restrictions include relinquishment both of ownership rights and the independence in choice of business objectives and method of operation formerly enjoyed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, although a corporation may affect the change in form from taxable to tax-exempt, nonprofit status with little formality, and may not be required, under local law, to reconstitute itself as a new or different corporation, these consequences of the change make it a change cognizable under section 498(i) of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is charged by section 498(h)(1)(B)(ii) of the HEA with provisionally certifying institutions that undergo a change of ownership and control. Provisional certification means, as the Department has spelled out in proposed &sect;668.13(c)(4)(ii), 59 FR 9564, certification subject to conditions, and the change from for-profit to nonprofit status warrants adopting as those conditions of the required provisional certification those restrictions that would have applied to the institution had it remained a for-profit entity. The Secretary therefore expects to include such provisions for a limited period in certifications given to converting schools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation clarifies that a change from a taxable to a tax-exempt entity that qualifies under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or vice versa, constitutes a change of ownership and control under this section of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 600.32&blank;Eligibility of Additional Locations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nine commenters expressed concern that the provisions governing the acquisition of an institution that owes a liability on improperly expended or unspent title IV, HEA program funds would discourage the practice of ``teaching out.'' A commenter suggested that the Secretary should not apply the ``two-year rule'' to the acquisition of an institution owing a liability on title-IV, HEA program funds, even if the liability is not being paid properly. Another commenter suggested that the Secretary make clear that the eligibility of additional locations under this section is also subject to the provisions of &sect;&sect;600.8 (concerning the treatment of branch campuses) and 600.10 (which contains provisions governing the date, extent, duration, and consequences of the eligibility of an institution with respect to the institution's locations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary does not agree with the first two commenters for the same reasons that were given by the Secretary when this provision was originally published as a final regulation in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 31, 1991. (See 56 FR 36685.) In the three years since the implementation of those regulations, the Secretary has seen no evidence that the provisions discourage ``teach-outs'' to students, or that the application of the ``two-year rule'' has not served its purpose. The Secretary agrees with the last commenter that clarification is necessary with regard to the relationship of this section to &sect;&sect;600.8 and 600.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

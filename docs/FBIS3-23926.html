Nevertheless, the fight for control over this region has  intensified sharply of late. The reason for this is the  departure of Igor Ustinov from the post of chairman of the  administrative committee (AC) of the Nakhodka FEZ after his  election as a deputy to the State Duma of Russia. With the aim  of not permitting the appointment of Aleksandr Kotikov, the  director of the department of investments of the administrative  committee, to the position of FEZ manager, the city  administration accused Ustinov's "team" of corruption and  incompetence. In this connection, a regular commission of the  Maritime administration of the tax service yesterday initiated a  check on the financial activity of the FEZ administrative  committee.    [begin boxed item]  <H5>  Economic Potential of the Nakhodka FEZ </H5>   --four ice-free ports    --70 percent of the port capacities of the Far East    --50 percent of the port capacities of Russia    --20 percent of the export-import operations of Russia    --272 joint enterprises    --48 enterprises with 100 percent foreign capital    --$128 million of foreign investments    --2,000 new enterprises in two years    [end boxed item]    The Nakhodka FEZ today can be characterized as a zone of  clashes of interests of a whole number of major corporate and  authoritative Russian and foreign structures. Among them are the  city and kray administrations, a consortium of South Korean and  American firms, and large international and interregional  associations and corporations associated with them. However, the  former unity in lobbying for governmental decrees and laws  necessary for the development of the FEZ, which has continued  over the course of two years, changed to tough confrontation  after everyone was faced with the need to determine the  candidate to the post of chairman of the administrative  committee--in other words, to decide the question concerning to  whom in these influential groups the FEZ leadership will belong.    As early as last year the Nakhodka administration took  specific steps for the purpose of replacing the functioning  administrative committee of the FEZ and removing Igor Ustinov  from the job. Thus, Viktor Gnezdilov, head of the Nakhodka city  administration, sent a letter to the apparatus of the president  and the Council of Ministers in which Ustinov was accused of  "wrecking work" and "corruption." The result of this step was a  whole series of financial and tax inspections of the activity of  the administrative committee. Despite the fact that the  operating commissions did not confirm cases of violation of  financial and tax discipline, a commission of the Maritime Kray  tax service office began another check on the activity of the  FEZ administrative committee.    The absence of cases of violation in the activity of the  "Ustinov" administrative committee can only indicate that the  usual fight for control over the activity of commercial  structures was going on, including with the participation of  foreign capital. The fight between various groups reached its  apogee after Igor Ustinov relinquished his authority in  connection with his election as deputy of the State Duma. The  vacated position was most realistically vied for by Aleksandr  Kotikov (director of the department of investments of the FEZ  administrative committee), Sergey Dudnik (general director of  the Nakhodkagrazhdanstroy), and Gennadiy Ukrainchenko (first  deputy mayor of the city of Nakhodka), who represented the  interests of various authoritative and corporate groups.    As a result of a series of negotiations, the opposing sides  were unable to reach an agreement, and the tension only mounted.  Then followed the removal of the candidacy of Gennadiy  Ukrainchenko, with the subsequent concurrence of Sergey Dudnik  to subordinate the administrative committee of the FEZ to the  city authorities in the event he is appointed its head. The next  step was the adoption last week of a joint decision of the city  administrations of Nakhodka and Partizansk concerning the  appointment of Sergey Dudnik to the post of chairman of the  administrative committee. Thus Ustinov's "team" suffered a  defeat.    The most negative result of this collision can be considered  the fact that the interest of the city authorities in the future  development of Nakhodka as a free economic zone was replaced by  an apparatus fight for authority over the territory. The  previous administration of the zone planned to return privileges  to FEZ enterprises on the basis of conferring on it the new  status of a "free economic territory." The draft decree on the  experiment, which was calculated for 10 years, was developed by  experts of the government and the former Supreme Soviet of  Russia jointly with representatives of the administrative  committee of the Nakhodka FEZ. In accordance with the draft, the  territory could acquire a single governing organ and a single  legislative authority consisting of representatives of the two  cities and one agricultural rayon. However, as recent events  have shown, the local administration does not intend to share  authority in a region subordinate to it with some other organ of  administration. In principle, this kind of position fully  satisfies the federal departments, mainly the Ministry of  Finance and the state tax service. The fact is that in the event  of the appearance of an independent organ of administration on  the territory of the FEZ (as this was before with the  administrative committee of the Nakhodka FEZ), the enterprises,  under whose aegis they are established, are granted tax  benefits, and problems would arise with the receipt of taxes in  the full amount. However, when everything is lumped into a  common city pot, it is very difficult to show who is exempt from  taxes and who is not. A precedent can serve as an example, when  the regional tax service after the adoption of the Law "On the  Customs Tariff" demanded from all joint enterprises operating on  the territory of the FEZ payment of the full amount of taxes for  two years in the sum of 2.5 billion rubles [R]. In addition, the  favorable tax system that operated for joint enterprises before  the adoption of the law was not taken into consideration. The  recent events in Nakhodka have already led to concrete results:  Work has been stopped in the government on the "free economic  territory" project, and many foreign investors have postponed  negotiations on investment projects for an indefinite period.

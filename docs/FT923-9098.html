			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): First to find the fault When equipment involving electronics breaks down the most common approach is to identify the faulty circuit board and then exchange it for a good one. But while 'board-swapping' is quick, it can carry a high price tag. This led Polar Instruments to develop a low-cost maintenance tool, known as the T6000 D-I-Y electronics fault finder. It uses a technique called impedance signature comparison (a kind of 'electronic finger-printing') to locate the fault. Every electronic component responds in a particular way to electrical stimulus, so by stimulating components on a board and recording their response, the T6000 identifies a behaviour pattern for a 'good' circuit board or component. If a fault develops the component causing the problem can be identified by measuring the new behaviour pattern and comparing it with the old. Polar Instruments: UK, 0481 53081.</p>

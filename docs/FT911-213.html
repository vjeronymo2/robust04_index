			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: ECGD pressed to boost export cover for Iran BRITAIN's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is facing mounting pressure from industry to restore medium-term cover on export credits to Iran, following the liberation of Kuwait and the release of Mr Roger Cooper, the businessman held hostage in Tehran for more than five years. Businessmen say they are concerned that without fresh cover, the UK could lose market share in Iran to other industrial countries such as France, Germany and Italy whose exports have been growing much faster than those of the UK as Tehran opened up to the west. Italy has, for example, agreed to provide Iran with Dollars 1bn (Pounds 592m) in credits for building two power stations and other industrial projects, the Iranian News Agency IRNA reported last week. Even Japan, which made large losses on loans to Iraq originally extended during the boom years of the 1970s, is now considering resuming the issue of medium-term credit guarantees. The trading house Nissho Iwai has applied for cover from Tokyo's Ministry of International Trade and Industry for its share in a Dollars 450m petrochemical plant ordered earlier this year from a consortium led by Technip of France. ECGD, which has been under fire for its restrictive attitude on developing-country risk, would say yesterday only that the question of cover for Iran was 'under review'. An official could not say how long the review would take. Businessmen think the UK is reluctant to offer fresh cover for Iran until British citizens held hostage in Lebanon are freed. Despite the UK embassy re-opening in Tehran, this problem is thought to have delayed exchange of ambassadors. On a separate issue, ECGD yesterday denied reports it was insisting all short-term credit insurance to Kuwait be backed by irrevocable letters of credit. It said it had done some business on open account since liberation. This did not involve irrevocable letters of credit, but overall volume of business remains small, with sales treated case-by-case. Businessmen said it would be normal for ECGD to require irrevocable letters of credit on most business where the Kuwaiti importer was a private-sector company. It was to be expected some importers would find it hard to establish letters of credit, as the records of local bankers might have been lost during the Iraqi occupation.</p>

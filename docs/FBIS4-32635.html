			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Srdjan Radulovic: "Borislav Mikelic Is Preparing </F> To Travel to Trieste"]    [Excerpts] The recent invitation by Gianfranco Fini,  leader of the Neo-Fascist Union of Italy, to the Krajina prime  minister, Borislav Mikelic, to meet in Trieste and discuss  current political issues has caused suspicion in Zagreb and  attracted the attention of political circles in the West. The  revival of the Krajina authorities' links with certain Italian  politicians almost coincides with the assertions that the  National Union in Berlusconi's coalition "team" is in fact the  one that is indirectly "promoting" territorial pretensions  toward Istria, which is directly manifested by demands for the  revision of the Osimo Agreements. This was why new Italian  Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said, first in Bonn (!), and  then in the House of Representatives of the Italian Parliament,  that "Italy does not have territorial designs on Slovenia and  Croatia."    The Krajina authorities, pressed by accusations that they  are  responsible for the failure of the negotiations [with Croatia]  and by Croatia's threats that it will not extend the mandate to  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] after 30 September, responded  quickly to Fini's invitation.    "Mikelic has accepted the invitation and we will maintain  contacts with Italy at the levels at which this is possible. In  any case, we have been pleasantly surprised by the invitation,  because this is a signal that the RSK [republic of Serbian  Krajina] has become a subject in international relations, even  though it has not been recognized." This was stated for BORBA  by Slobodan Jarcevic, president Martic's adviser for foreign  affairs and foreign minister in the previous government.    The first Krajina-Italian contact at a "higher level" was  established last September, when socialist Arduino Agnelli  attended the session of the Krajina assembly, which declared him  (and his wife) a "honorary citizen of the RSK." [passage omitted]    Mr. Agnelli told us that many members of the European  Parliament held the view that the alteration of borders that was  allowed in 1991 would not be frozen on the "AVNOJ" [Antifascist  Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders of the  former Yugoslav republics. He assured us that Europe realized  that the ethnic rights of the Serbs are their historical rights,  and that the right to self-determination is stronger than formal  communist borders, drawn without taking into consideration any  historical or ethnic principles. This was the first  encouragement from the Italian side that the RSK's destiny would  not be subordinated only to `AVNOJ' borders and the UN Security  Council's resolutions," Jarcevic said.    Apart from Fini's message of support to the Krajina assembly  at the end of last year, there have been no contacts or exchange  of messages until the recent one that attracted public's  attention. Two visits by Slobodan Jarcevic to Italy did not  receive much publicity. In Italy, he met the representatives of  the Association of Expelled Italians from Istria and Dalmatia  and with Italian intellectuals in Milan and Trieste. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): High hopes of paper groups tearing ahead - Stora/MoDo A picture of an industry in a strong recovery phase should emerge this week when Stora and MoDo, two of Sweden's leading pulp and paper groups, report their nine-month figures. Expectations are high, not least because AssiDoman and SCA, their two main domestic competitors, both raised their full-year profit forecasts last week. Pulp and paper groups worldwide are benefiting from higher demand and a strong rise in prices after three difficult years. The impact has been felt all the more strongly by Swedish companies because of the weak krona and impressive productivity gains. Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, is expected to announce a nine-month profit of around SKr2bn (Dollars 275m) when it presents its figures on Wednesday. The figure will be inflated by capital gains and reduced financial costs, but it will also show a stronger underlying performance. One difference from the six-month result is that the group should finally be feeling some impact from the price rises that took effect in the first half. MoDo, which reports on Thursday, will feel the price effect more strongly because of its big exposure to pulp and fine paper where prices have increased most. Analysts expect a profit of up to SKr980m. The company is also expected to confirm it will go ahead with a SKr2bn investment in a new newsprint machine at Braviken.</p>

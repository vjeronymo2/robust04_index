Some $500  million had been allocated for its construction.    Former First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar, leader of the  "Russia's Choice" bloc, had objected strongly to the plan to  construct the new parliamentary center and the allocation of  $500 million, describing the decision as one reason why he  refused to join the reorganized government.</p>

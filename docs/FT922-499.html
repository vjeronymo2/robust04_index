			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: China Steel offer undersubscribed THE PUBLIC offer of shares in China Steel worth TDollars 10.8bn (Dollars 437m) has closed just 38 per cent subscribed, dealing a severe blow to the government's privatisation programme, Reuter reports from Taipei. The 509.5m shares being offered by the government were priced at TDollars 21.14 each. China Steel, which is already listed in Taipei, ended at TDollars 21.90 yesterday. Underwriters were yesterday scrambling to place shares with institutional investors, but clearly will be forced to hold on to many of the shares themselves. The issue was linked to last month's offer of global depositary receipts in the US, Japan and Europe, the first overseas share offer by a Taiwan company. The GDR issue, 360m shares for some Dollars 320m, was heavily oversubscribed with demand exceeding supply by a ratio of three to one.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Sport: Antarctic voyage success The crew of the Sir Ernest Shackleton, on a voyage to retrace the rescue mission of the British explorer after his ship, Endurance, was crushed by the polar pack ice (FT, December 18), landed safely on South Georgia writes Roderic Dunnett. Trevor Potts and three colleagues left Elephant Island in Antarctica on December 24. The 23ft boat was becalmed at first but made several days' good sailing, helped by currents, before hitting 36 hours of gales. By noon on January 3, the party was 100 miles east of South Georgia. Having made landfall, they ran into force 8 gales - recalling the harsh lee shore conditions encountered by Shackleton in 1916 - but found shelter in Elsehul, a rocky harbour at the north west tip of South Georgia and landed on January 5. The crew plans to cross the neck of land known as the Shackleton Gap on foot, tracing, in reverse, part of the route the explorer took on his mountain trek to Stromness, the Norwegian whaling station, where he found help for his marooned companions. Potts' arrival coincided with the start of the International Boat Show, at Earls Court, where Shackleton's boat, the James Caird, is displayed.</p>

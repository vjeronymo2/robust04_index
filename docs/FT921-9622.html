			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Turkey discovers a new role in former Soviet central Asia: Leaders of 50m Turkic-speaking peoples look to Ankara as a political and religious model THE receptionist in Azerbaijan's largest hotel shrugged her shoulders and said slowly in Russian: 'I'm sorry. I don't know English or good Russian. Do you speak Turkish?' It is a question which is assuming increasing importance, not just in Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan, but right across the southern rim of the former Soviet Union. For after decades of being stereotyped as the poor relation of Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Turkey is now discovering a new geo-political role for itself. The Soviet break-up is offering it the opportunity to build, with US encouragement, a new domain of political influence not just in the neighbouring ex-soviet Caucasus, but also among the 50m Turkic-speaking Moslems in ex-soviet central Asia, where Iran is a powerful competitor. One illustration of this came earlier this week in Istanbul. After months of diplomatic jockeying, Turkey succeeded in persuading nine of the so-called Black Sea nations to sit down at the first ever Black Sea regional conference. Eight of the participants - Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria and Romania - initialled an accord to create a new Black Sea regional economic plan in which Turkey seems set to play a central geographical and political role. However, it is to the east, in vast central Asia, that some believe the richest diplomatic pickings for Turkey lie. Turkey's role in central Asia has long been an emotive issue. In spite of being separated from the region by the Caspian Sea, Turkey shares close ties with the region - all the central Asian republics apart from Tajikistan speak Turkic dialects. The school curriculum in Turkey, moreover, teaches that all Turks came from the plains of central Asia. Although central Asia was never part of the Ottoman empire, earlier this century pan-Turkic sentiments led some central Asians to call for the creation of a common Turkic union. These dreams were squashed during the Soviet period, but they are re-emerging. In Turkey, pan-Turkism, once a secret and conspiratorial movement, has acquired a respectability. The Turkish government itself has strenuously denied any charges of pan-Turkic aspirations. But some political voices have been heard expressing pan-Turkic sentiments. Central Asia's leaders are overwhelmingly ex-communist. Although they have cautiously embraced the cultural aspects of the Islamic revival that has swept through the region in recent years - and are adamant that they do not want blindly to ape Russia or the west - they are also determined that they do not want to copy Iran or Saudi Arabia's model of Islamic orthodoxy. They hope that by aspiring to Turkey's mix of moderate Islam and western economics - the 'Turkish way' as Mr Islam Karimov, the Uzbek president, calls it - they will stave off the threat of radical Islam. In recent weeks the Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Kazakh presidents have all been effusive in their praise for Turkey. Leaders of the region's fledgling opposition democratic parties, such as Mr Muhhamad Salikh, leader of the Uzbek Party 'Erk', repeatedly cite Turkey as their model for democracy. And even the highly-influential Persian-speaking Tajik Moslem leader, Qazi Akbar Turanjonzoda, commented recently that 'Turkey is the best religious and political example for us'. Turkey claims to be the first country to have embassies in all the central Asian republics, and was first to extend recognition to Azerbaijan's declaration of independence. The Turkish government has offered courses for Turkic republics' bankers and drafted legislation to despatch its own moderate Islamic teachers to the region. But these diplomatic moves seem relatively limited when compared with the enthusiastic overtures being made by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and above all Iran - countries scrambling to gain a foothold in this vast new Moslem market, with its array of raw materials such as cotton, uranium, silk, natural gas and oil, not to mention nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia has already donated considerable religious aid to the region, including over a million Korans. Pakistan has said it would be prepared to support the central Asian republics in applying for membership of international organisations. Iran is rapidly building both religious and political ties with the region, in particular with neighbouring Turkmenistan and Persian-speaking Tajikistan - backed up by offers of oil and economic aid. Similarly, although Turkish entrepreneurs are now the most visible foreign businessmen in Azerbaijan, they appear outnumbered in central Asia by Pakistanis, Afghans, Iranians, and South Koreans. One reason for Turkey's apparent caution may be a cold-headed appraisal that its best future business prospect is Russia, not central Asia. Russia is the supplier of the natural gas underpinning Turkish-Soviet trade, which was worth more than Dollars 1.7bn in 1990. Another reason could be that Turkey is still cautious about being sucked in too deeply into a region which faces enormous problems as it moves towards a market economy.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes Cadbury Schweppes' acquisition of a further 20 per cent of the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up group for Dollars 231m (Pounds 154m) could inject a lot more fizz into the UK company's growth prospects. The investment will only make sense if it leads to closer operating links or outright acquisition. Either outcome would greatly enhance Cadbury's position in the US market. This would be useful considering Americans guzzle 34 per cent of the world's soft drinks. At present, Cadbury controls 3 per cent of the US market. The addition of Dr Pepper's share would give it 14 per cent. This is still way behind Coca Cola and Pepsico, and it is worth recalling Cadbury's unhappy experience of filling the weak number three slot in the US chocolate market. But Cadbury and Dr Pepper would command 40 per cent of the faster growing non-cola drinks sector. That would make their market position far more defensible. In the absence of a bid, the worry is that Cadbury's existing trading relationship with Dr Pepper could turn flat, since the suspicion is that Dr Pepper is not ecstatic about Cadbury's latest purchase. It is unclear whether the two sides will be able to reach amicable agreements about trading co-operation and board representation. Cadbury could contemplate launching a full bid for Dr Pepper even though it would have to turn to shareholders for fresh funds. Since 1986, Cadbury has shrewdly spent Pounds 1bn on safe, relatively small, non-dilutive acquisitions. Spending the same sum again at one throw would certainly shift the risk profile for Cadbury.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] MBC has obtained the first reaction to Algerian  President Zeroual's call for dialogue. Rabah Kebir,  spokesman-in-exile for the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], said  yesterday in an interview with MBC--despite the ban imposed on  his activity by the German authorities--that the FIS will go  along with the call for a dialogue, provided all prisoners are  released. Here is a report from our correspondent Anis  Abu-al-'Ila in Germany:    [Begin recording] [Kebir] I believe that the conviction that  negotiations are the key to a solution in Algeria is a suitable  and civilized approach. However, we must wait for actual deeds.  Although there is some seriousness, as I can see from some  paragraphs in the speech, there are some contradictions as well.  On one hand, Liamine Zeroual insists on using violence once  again, while on the other he is insisting on dialogue. A  clear-cut stance needs to be adopted. Yesterday, for instance,  (al-Qulb) mountains were bombed by aircraft while the speech was  being delivered, and these are confirmed reports. Once again we  say that if there is a serious desire to hold negotiations, it  will have to begin with releasing all prisoners, first and  foremost the FIS leaders, and then allowing a meeting among FIS  key figures under the leadership of its leaders, Abbassi Madani  and Ali Belhadj.    [Abu-al-'Ila] Does that mean you are ready for such a  meeting  as a first step toward a dialogue with the Algerian Government?    [Kebir] What I am saying is that a final decision on this  matter is up to the FIS leaders, once they are able to meet with  their historic leadership. [end recording]</p>

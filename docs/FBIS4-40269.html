			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian United Republican Party parliamentary  faction has categorically protested the introduction of the  Russian parachute regiment stationed in Gudauta (Abkhazia) to  the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    The faction, which includes 21 deputies, circulated a  statement saying that this very regiment was fighting against  the Georgian Armed Forces in Abkhazia and was the first to come  to Sukhumi.    Deputy Jaba Ioseliani said in parliament today that under a  special Russian-Georgian agreement the Gudauta regiment would  not be brought to the security zone on the Inguri River.    Ioseliani intended to meet Russian First Deputy Defense  Minister Georgiy Kondratyev on June 15 in order to discuss the  details of implementation of the peacekeeping operation in the  conflict zone.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The "new alliance" of leftist forces proposed by  [Socialist Party, PS, Secretary General] Michel Rocard has  elicited new and quite diverse reactions. Roland Dumas thought  that it is "a good, but not a new idea." Deferring this debate  until after 12 June, the former minister noted sanctimoniously  that "if the results turn out to be in line with opinion polls,  they will not be good," and that "for a large party such as the  PS, this would certainly have consequences for the party...and  on Michel Rocard's presidential candidacy."    Bernard Tapie called on Rocard "to be with the Left if he  wants to become president of the Republic one day." He  anticipated a victory of the Left in the presidential election  "provided that, alongside the PS, there is a force with its own  identity which would be able to attract the 22, 20, 18, or 17,  or whatever percentage of the vote needed" to win the election.    Jean Pierre Chevenement affirmed that the reconstruction of  the Left "cannot be achieved only through Mr. Rocard's party and  `Mr. Finance' Bernard Tapie." "The future of the Left lies in  its unity. But it is not the pact for unity and progress of  [Communist Party leader] Robert Hue, nor Michel Rocard's new  alliance which will tell us anything about its contents," the  deputy mayor of Belfort complained. Finally, Francis Wurtz  [head of the Communist European election list] called the "new  alliance" proposal a "political coup four days before the  ballot," and he accused Rocard of "not having broken with the  old tradition of crippling compromises."</p>

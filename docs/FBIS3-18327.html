"I hope that the return of the prime minister's post to an  elected member of parliament, considering the Italian tradition,  will be seen as a positive sign for Italy, a signal that Italy  is returning to normalcy and ending a critical phase," Ciampi  said.    Ciampi, a former central bank governor, has been in a  caretaker position ever since he tendered his resignation on  January 13. He is not running in the March 27-28 elections and  intends to withdraw from politics after his present government  is sent home, presumably after the new parliament takes office  on April 15.    "I was personally involved in this government because this  transition was seen as best carried out by a non-parliament  member," he said, referring to the decision by President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro to give Ciampi a mandate in April of last year.    Italy over the last two years has been caught up in  burgeoning corruption scandals, which decimated the traditional  parties, discredited many members of parliament and initiated  widespread calls for voting and institutional reforms. A spate  of car bombings in the spring and early summer of last year,  combined with two rounds of local elections, deepening recession  and the birth or mutation of many political parties, all added  to growing political uncertainty.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Zuyao (0060 4371 1031) of the Economics Institute of </F> the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, edited by Xiao Yang  (2556 7122): "The Theoretical Basis for Developing a Socialist  Market Economy -- Study of Volume 3 of Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping"]    [Text] Just as China's socialist economic reform entered  the crucial moment of accelerating overall structural change,  the publication and distribution of Volume 3 of Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping have provided a scientific  theoretical basis and guiding principle for China to draw upon  and accelerate the overall construction of a socialist market  economy. Moreover, they have also provided the best teaching  material for economic circles to study and explore the Marxist  economics of New China, and provided a scientific guide for us  in striving to found a socialist market economy.    China's socialist reform has gone through a short course,  but  its brilliant achievements have gone down in the annals of  mankind. The initiator of this unparalleled feat is Deng  Xiaoping. The chief designer of this magnificent edifice of the  socialist market economy with oriental national style is Deng  Xiaoping. It can be said without the least exaggeration that  without the initiative of Comrade Deng Xiaoping there would have  been no world-shocking changes in China. Without the guidance  by the brilliant banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics it would have been  impossible for China's reform to have made great achievements  that have attracted worldwide attention. At present, China's  great cause of reform has entered the stage of storming  fortified positions of overall structural change. The road  ahead is tough, but the reform cannot stop here, much less  should we fall back. If we do not make progress, we are falling  back, and falling back "can only be on the road to ruin." Now  the targets and direction are clear, the road is open, and the  plan of decisive battle will soon be put into effect. Under the  new situation it is absolutely necessary and timely to study  systematically and seriously Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially the  theory on socialist reform. It can be affirmed that should  China depart in future reform from the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and should China deviate from the course  pointed out by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist  reform, it would be difficult to build up the system of a  socialist market economy and reform would even be led onto a  wrong path.    The cause of China's socialist reform can only take Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, especially Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist  reform as the banner and the guiding principle, and should by no  means take any other theory as guidance. The guiding position  of this theory of Deng Xiaoping's is not artificially  established, but is an inevitable selection by history. After  the victory of the democratic revolution, the Chinese people and  the CPC went through a difficult and tortuous course, and paid  huge cost determining how to build socialism in a country like  China, which was backward in economy, culture, science, and  technology. Useful explorations were made, too. Early during  the period of the democratic revolution, proceeding from China's  national conditions, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively put forward  the theory on a new democratic society. After the founding of  the PRC, during the period of the restoration of the national  economy, we put this theory into practice, rapidly restored the  national economy destroyed by a protracted war, and smashed the  imperialist economic blockade, and the people lived and worked  in peace and contentment. It seems that if we should continue  making explorations along this idea, the new democratic society  would probably be a road leading to socialism which we would  inevitably follow. However, by mid-1950's the pace of  transition of new democracy was quickened, and it was replaced  by socialism "large in size and collective in nature."  Afterward, the Soviet Communist Party's criticism of Stalin  impelled the CPC to think back on the economic management system  and the road of industrialization. The Eighth CPC Congress and  Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Ten Major Relations" challenged the  Soviet model of socialism, and put forward the considerations of  reforming the management system.    It should be said that in the international communist  movement, the CPC's consciousness of reform was fairly early.  If China should continue forging ahead along the road of the  Eighth CPC Congress, the system of a socialist market economy  with Chinese characteristics might have stood erect in the East  long ago. However, this valuable experiment that had just begun  soon died out, the development of the productive forces was  replaced by endless political movements and escalation of  ownership, "take economic construction as the center" was  replaced by "take class struggle as the key link," and the  objectively existing market mechanism was replaced by the  "official's will." The ten-year long turmoil that neither  wanted culture nor was revolutionary pushed all the more this  rigid leftist system to the extremes, and declared "exercising  all-round dictatorship" over commodities, market, and currency  without exception. Finally, it did great damage to the  productive forces and the national economy was pushed to he  brink of collapse. After this unprecedented calamity of  self-destruction ended, the whole party and the entire Chinese  people thought seriously: How has this catastrophe has  happened? How can we prevent its repetition? China was again  faced with the problem of re-selecting the socialist model:  Where to go. To go in for "whatever" and continue maintaining  the old system, line, and policies, or to "seek truth from  facts, emancipate our minds," and continue exploring the  socialist road by combining Marxist fundamental tenets with  China's practical conditions? Precisely at this important  moment that determined the future and destiny of the party and  the state, Comrade Deng Xiaoping upheld the brilliant banner of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and sounded the  advance of all-round reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping correctly  summed up the successful experiences, frustrations, and lessons  of the CPC in exploring the road of building socialism, and drew  the experiences and lessons of the rise and fall, success and  failure of other socialist countries, and led the Chinese people  in the great practices of reform and opening-up to achieve  another historical leap by combining the Marxist fundamental  tenets with China's practical conditions of socialist  construction. It can be said that the theory he founded on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the  continuation and development of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On New  Democracy" and "On Ten Major Relations" in the new period. The  reform he initiated is the direct inheritance and development of  the reform experiment that the CPC started carrying out in the  mid-1950's and was later interrupted. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics has  opened a new chapter in the history of Marxist development. The  reform he initiated has ushered in a new epoch in the history of  mankind.    Various socialist countries originally carried out the  administrative mandate-type planned economy system according to  the Soviet model. This kind of system had considerable  superiority in mobilizing and concentrating limited resources on  key construction projects, but lacked life and vitality. Since  the 1970's, many counties have embarked on the road of reform  with the market as orientation. There is no precedent yet that  these countries have achieved success in reform, but on the  contrary most of them have been bogged down in the quagmire of  economic, political, and social crisis, and the people have no  means of livelihood. This "therapy" and that "plan" invented by  those foreign advisers and "brain trusters" all vanish like soap  bubbles, and have become bitter fruits which they can neither  swallow nor spit out. The economy and culture of China are far  more backward than those of these countries, China's national  conditions are more complicated, and therefore the difficulty of  reform cannot be compared by that in these countries. However,  China's reform has made universally acknowledged achievements.    From 1978 to 1992, China's GNP increased from 358.8 billion  yuan to 2,400 billion yuan, total import and export amount  increased from 20.6 billion dollars to 165.6 billion dollars,  per capita income of the peasants increased from 132 yuan to 784  yuan, per capita income of city and town staff and workers  increased from 382 yuan to 1,826 yuan, the savings balance of  urban and rural residents increased from 21.1 billion yuan to  1,380 billion yuan, and the life of the people is transitioning  from enough to eat and wear type to comparatively well-off type.  In the world today, many countries are going through recession  and crisis, and only China's economy has since reform maintained  a momentum of powerful and high-speed growth. The reason lies  precisely in: We uphold "thinking independently and taking our  own road," firmly believe that "one can never achieve success by  copying indiscriminately the experiences and the model of other  countries," and persist in combining the Marxist fundamental  tenets with China's concrete practices. We have forsaken the  Eastern dogmatism, and have also guarded against the disruption  by Western dogmas. We have always placed Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform in a position of guiding  principle for reform. The practices of reform require learning  from the successful experiences of other countries, and the  theories of reform should assimilate the scientific composition  of contemporary Western economics. But learning from and using  for reference cannot substitute for one's own creation, much  less can foreign books replace Marxism of New China and serve as  the guiding principles for China's reform. China must carry out  reform; if not, "it can only be the road to ruin." China's  reform can only be guided by the theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and whenever we run counter to or  deviate from this theory, reform will go astray.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on China's socialist reform  is  a scientific system gradually built up and developed in the  practices of China's reform. This scientific system is the  outcome by combining the fundamental tenets of historical  materialism and scientific socialism with China's practical  conditions, and has also assimilated the scientific composition  of contemporary Western economics. It has the characteristics  of practices, inheritance, openness, systematics, science, and  criticism. It is rich and profound in contents, and various  components parts are interrelated and constitute a complete  scientific system. Only by studying systematically Volume 3 of  the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping can we fully  comprehend Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform. Take the  important parts, for example: Concerning the theory that reform  must first straighten out the ideological line, uphold  "emancipating the mind, and seeking truth from facts," proceed  from China's national conditions in everything, be bold in  making explorations through practices, and forsake book worship  of every description, and concerning the dialectical relations  between reform and upholding the socialist road. On the one  hand "we must never take the Western capitalist road" in reform,  and "if China with one billion people should take the capitalist  road, it would be a disaster to the world, and it is pulling  history back." On the other hand, if we do not carry out  reform, "it can only be the road to ruin" and "poverty is not  socialism."    Concerning the theory that reform is the road we must follow  in emancipating and developing the productive forces. "After  the establishment of the socialist basic system, it is still  necessary to change fundamentally the economic system that  fetters the development of the productive forces," and "reform  also means liberating the productive forces. In the past, we  only talked about developing the productive forces under the  socialist condition, and did not talk about the fact that it was  still necessary to liberate the productive forces through  reform. It was incomplete. We should completely talk about  both liberating and developing the productive forces." With  regard to the nature of reform, "reform is China's second  revolution," and "we look upon reform as a kind of revolution,  of course not the kind of revolution like `the Cultural  Revolution.'" But "the nature of reform, like that of the  revolution in the past, is also to remove the obstacles that  hinder the development of social productive forces." Concerning  the essence of socialism, "the essence of socialism is to  liberate the productive forces, develop the productive forces,  eliminate exploitation, remove polarization, and finally achieve  common prosperity." About the central task of the socialist  stage, "the central task of the whole socialist historical stage  is to develop the productive forces." "To go in for socialism,  the central task is to develop the productive forces," and we  must always take economic construction as the center.    Concerning the socialist fundamental principles, "one  principle is that public ownership constitutes the main body,  and the other is common prosperity. These are the socialist  fundamental principles we must uphold." Regarding the  compatibility of socialism with the market economy, and the  integration of planning with the market, "there is no  fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market  economy," and "it is not the essential difference between  socialism and capitalism whether there is a bit more of planning  or a bit more of the market. The planned economy is not equal  to socialism, there is planning too under capitalism; the market  economy is not equal to capitalism either, there is also the  market under socialism. Both planning and the market are  economic means." "Planning and the market that serve socialism  are socialist; those that serve capitalism are capitalist."  "Both planning and the market are methods, and can be made use  of so long as they are advantageous to developing the productive  forces." With regard to the relations between reform and  development, "grasp the opportune moment, develop ourselves, and  the key is to develop the economy," "only development is a tough  argument," "as long as we talk about performance, about quality,  and go in for export-oriented economy, there is nothing to be  worried about," and "China should strive to enter a new stage in  economic development after every few years. Of course, we  should not encourage impractical high-speed, but should be  realistic and pay attention to performance, and make stable and  coordinated development." "The law of China's economic  development may still be advancing wave upon wave, with a leap  and jumping over a new stage after every few years."    Regarding the building of material civilization and  spiritual  civilization, we should stick to paying attention to dual  tactics, and both tactics should be tough: "We should oppose  corruption in the whole process of reform and opening-up."  Concerning the relations between economic reform and political  reform, and the tasks of political reform: "Now for every step  forward made in economic structural reform we deeply feel the  necessity of political structural reform. Without political  structural reform we cannot continue making progress in economic  structural reform, which would obstruct the development of the  productive forces." "The political structural reform includes  first of all separating the functions of the party from those of  the government, and solving the problem of how the party can be  good at leadership. It also includes decentralization and  simplification of the administrative structure". "The purposes  of the political structural reform are: Always maintain the  vitality of the party and the state; overcome bureaucracy, raise  working efficiency; mobilize the initiatives of the basic  levels, and those of the workers, peasant, and intellectuals,"  and "develop the socialist democracy." About expanding opening  to the outside world, we uphold maintaining independence and  keeping the initiative in our own hands and self- reliance;  oppose hegemonism and power politics. Concerning the exposition  that reform must be carried out under leadership and in an  orderly manner, and that it is necessary to maintain stability  and a stable social environment, "to go in for reform and  opening- up, the key lies in stability," "China's overriding  problem is stability, and without a stable environment, nothing  can be achieved;" "for the reform to succeed, it must be carried  out under leadership and in an orderly manner," and "the central  authorities must have authority."    About the criteria for examining reform, we should uphold  taking whether or not the reform measures are favorable to  developing the productive forces of the socialist society,  enhancing the overall national strength of the socialist  country, and raising the living standard of the people as the  basic criteria for deciding which measures to use and their  success and failure.    Moreover, there are also expositions about rural and urban  reforms. These interrelated aspects constitute the basic  contents of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist  reform. This complete scientific system includes the  theoretical basis and the guiding principle of China's reform,  its nature and tasks, its strategy selection and measures for  implementation, its external environment and conditions, and its  target model and orientation. A red line that runs through this  scientific system is to achieve through overall reform a linkage  between the socialist basic system and the operational mechanism  of the market economy, and to integrate the superiority of the  socialist system with the basic role of the market economy in  optimizing resources allocation, thereby pushing the productive  forces to develop at a rate faster than that under the  capitalist system, and achieving common prosperity among the  people. The core of this scientific system is to re-select  through the second revolution a socialist model that conforms  with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of  the productive forces. We should strive to study and put into  practice Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist reform,  whether the whole system or a particular thesis, completely and  not one-sidedly, objectively and not subjectively as one  pleases, accurately and not quoting out of context, and  profoundly and not superficially. Otherwise, it will not only  do harm to the reputation of the theory itself, but will be more  detrimental to the great cause of reform.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist reform and  the great practices of China's economic reform have evoked a  profound revolution in the history of Marxist economic theories,  and have written a brand new chapter in the Marxist socialist  economics. The reform is intensifying, and practices are  developing. This theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's will be  constantly enriched and become more mature. With this theory as  the basis, it will be possible for us to found the Marxist  socialist political economics with Chinese characteristics.  Only with this theory as guidance will it be possible for us to  deal with Western economics correctly, assimilate its essence,  reject its dross, and make use of it without letting ourselves  degenerate into Western dogmatism. The Chinese people have  performed a spectacular world-shocking drama on the stage of  reform, and created a miracle that links socialism with the  market economy. So long as we base ourselves on China's  practical conditions, thoroughly study a great deal of difficult  problems brought up in the practices of reform, and seriously  sum up the experiences of reform, the Chinese economists will  surely make their own contributions to mankind.</p>

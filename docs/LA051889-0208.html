			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SEN. KASSEBAUM TO SEEK 3RD TERM  </P> <P> Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), saying she had struggled with the  decision "for some time," announced today that she will seek reelection to a  third term. Her decision dampened hopes of Democrats to win their first Senate  seat from Kansas in 50 years.  </P> <P> Kassebaum said she will run in the 1990 elections because she does not want to  hurt the state by retiring and leaving it without her seniority.  </P> <P> Noting that she had pledged to serve only 12 years when she first ran for the  Senate, Kassebaum said she had "struggled with it for some time." But she said  she decided to seek another term because there is no limit on the number of  years a senator can serve.  </P></p>

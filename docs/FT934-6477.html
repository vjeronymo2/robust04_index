			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Kiev faces sanctions in nuclear row The Russian government may cut off gas supplies to Ukraine and impose other economic sanctions to force it to destroy or return the nuclear weapons on its territory to Russia. Officials in the Russian capital say the pressure will be used 'reluctantly' but add they are determined to use it if Ukraine does not carry out its obligations to return the missiles. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said at the weekend that Ukraine was becoming a 'new nuclear power'. Ukraine's parliament in Kiev ratified the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start I) treaty last week but, in doing so, proclaimed itself a nuclear state and defined the treaty as applying to only about one-third of the 1,600 missiles it holds. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said on Monday that 'Ukraine wants to and will destroy its nuclear weapons'. At the centre of the issue is Ukraine's demand for money from the west to pay for the destruction of the nuclear stockpile. The US has proposed Dollars 175m to assist, which Ukraine says is not enough. Mr Vladimir Kryzhanovsky, the Ukrainian ambassador to Moscow, said yesterday that 'our requests for compensation cause nothing but surprise on Russia's part' and said that the destruction or transfer of the weapons could 'not be speeded up'. Mr Anton Buteiko, the Ukrainian president's foreign policy adviser, said on Monday that 'the status of Ukraine is unique. This is a new situation - Ukraine is not a nuclear state but owns nuclear weapons.' Ukraine is, however, highly vulnerable to Russian pressure. The Ukrainians depend heavily on their neighbour for oil and gas supplies and are already deeply in debt for their extensive energy needs. An accord between Mr Kravchuk and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, on the handing over of nuclear weapons and of Ukraine's half of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia reached earlier this year in the Crimea now seems to be a dead letter. This has prompted charges from Russia of bad faith on the part of Ukraine.</p>

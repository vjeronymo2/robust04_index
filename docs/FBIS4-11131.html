			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina announced today that in the next few hours  he will decree a state of national emergency in light of the  serious energy crisis affecting the country. In statements at  the Government House, the president said the decree will be made  public this Thursday as part of a search for solutions to the  serious problem of the electricity shortage, a situation which  forced authorities to regulate the service three months ago.    Reina declared that he has spoken to the presidents of  Panama  and Nicaragua, Guillermo Endara and Violeta Chamorro, as well as  to advisers of Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon to  ask for their help in solving the problem. The president said  that Honduras will ask these countries to sell their energy  surplus to Honduras so as to try to cover the daily deficit of  over 80 megawatts that now exists in local electricity supply.    Three months ago, the National Enterprise for Electric Power  (ENEE) implemented an energy rationing plan that has caused  losses estimated in the millions for the private sector, in  addition to interfering with the government's activities, as  well of those of citizens in general.    The crisis was brought on by a lack of water at the  "Francisco Morazan" hydroelectric plant, which supplies 63  percent of the national demand, as well as by a lack of planning  by previous administrations, according to official sources.    Operations at the hydroelectric plant could come to a  standstill in the next three months if the rainy season is not  good, ENEE experts concluded.</p>

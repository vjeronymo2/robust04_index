			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST BEATS HARBOR, 30-12  </P> <P> The L.A. Southwest College football team held Harbor College scoreless in the  second half of their Western State Conference contest Saturday and capitalized  on several Seahawk miscues for a 30-12 victory.  </P> <P> With the win, Southwest improved its record to 7-1-1 (6-1-1 in conference  play). Harbor fell to 3-6 and 2-6.  </P> <P> Bill Harris returned the game's opening kickoff 95 yards for a quick Harbor  touchdown. The Cougars replied with a 22-yard Jason Thomson field goal. Then,  after Ahmed Mortis blocked a Seahawk punt, Southwest quarterback Craig Manigo  hit Damon Beckom with a 10-yard TD pass.  </P> <P> Harbor recovered a fumble at the Cougar 11 and regained the lead, 12-10, when  Corey Henry plunged in from the one. But Southwest's Beckom caught a 17-yard  touchdown strike in the third quarter, and Manigo scrambled for two more TDs in  the fourth. KEN BANKS  </P></p>

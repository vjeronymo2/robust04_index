			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (19): Risks must fall as costs rise - How customers are reacting to higher insurance rates HIT BY heavy losses after rapid growth in the late 1980s, motor fleet insurers have increased premium rates and reduced the terms of cover available in the past two years. But the rising cost of insurance is prompting many motor fleet managers to buy less insurance and look to other ways of reducing risks. The cost of insurance - a Pounds 1m-plus item for many of the biggest fleets  -is leading to boardroom interest in risk prevention. 'You were in a situation where premiums were simply chasing claims upwards. It was an expensive funding exercise,' says Mr David Ney, risk management director at Willis Corroon in London, who says buying insurance for its motor fleet is one of the biggest 'insurance spends' for many organisations. While competition among insurers drove premium rates down in the late 1980s, the increased frequency of accidents and escalating court awards to accident victims pushed up the cost of claims. Drivers of company cars are - on average - roughly twice as likely to have accidents as other drivers. Accident frequency rates - which measure the number of accidents as a percentage of insured drivers each year - average between 50 and 70 per cent, compared with a rate of between 20 and 25 per cent for private motorists. Some motor fleets have accident frequency rates as high as 120 per cent, says Mr Ney, who is critical of many company car drivers. 'It is really about attitude awareness. Everyone thinks it is someone else's problem,' says Mr Ney. In line with general trends in the motor insurance market, theft rates have also increased sharply in recent years. Motor fleet premiums are much higher than those for private cars because policyholders do not obtain the benefit of no claims bonus and because cover is more comprehensive. The recent deterioration in losses pushed up rates by an average of about 25 per cent in 1992, after more modest rises in 1990 and 1991. Fleets with particular poor safety records have found themselves paying much steeper increases. Standard excesses - the part of any claim paid by the policyholder - have increased. Two years ago insurers would have charged excesses of Pounds 100 for each accidental damage claim. That amount is now typically Pounds 250, and is charged against claims for fire and theft, as well as accidental damage, says Mr Fred Whitworth, commercial motor manager at Eagle Star. Cover for damage to windscreens is frequently excluded. Insurers are also more likely to introduce restrictions, refusing to pay for the loss of personal effects or stipulating that replacements for stolen stereos must be the manufacturer's model. In addition, many policyholders are prepared to retain a substantial tranche of risks on their own books in exchange for lower premiums or simply buy less cover - fire, third party and theft, for example - for the same premiums. Mr Whitworth says that 17 per cent of Eagle Star policyholders renewing in 1992 'traded down' in this way. At the same time, insurers have become much keener to press policyholders to manage risks in order to reduce claims. Because premium rates reflect claims experience over a three-year period, action taken by policyholders to reduce accidents will eventually results in lower claims. According to Mr Chris Palmer, motor underwriting manager with Zurich Insurance, 'the strategy is to move the debate away from price, towards better service standards to persuade policyholders to take a long-term view'. Increasingly, insurers are pressing motor fleet managers to administer their fleets more tightly, inspecting driving licences more frequently and monitoring the condition of cars more regularly, in order to weed out potential problems. Most fleets are now restricting the number of family members who can drive a company car, in order to reduce the access of younger drivers, typically teenage sons and daughters, who are more prone to have accidents. Insurers are also beginning to press policyholders to select particular kinds of vehicles, especially those which are less prone to theft. Several fleets have stopped buying hot hatches, for example replacing GTI Volkswagens and Astra GTEs with Vauxhall Cavaliers. Insurers are also supplying better quality data to policyholders, making it easier for fleet managers to identify particularly poor or accident prone drivers. 'You've got to supply ammunition to help the statistical departments,' says Mr Palmer. According to Mr David Voss, managing director of Velo, which provides a insurance management service for motor fleets, good information can allow fleet managers to pinpoint which regions and drivers are contributing most to insurance costs and enable them to vary charging within the organisations accordingly. 'Suddenly the local manager, with one eye on his profit-related bonus, may take a different tone with his errant drivers,' says Mr Voss. Although no insurer offers reduced premiums in return for the adoption of risk management measures, one company, Perth-based General Accident is prepared to subsidise the cost of driver improvement programmes for policyholders. GA pays Pounds 40 of the Pounds 75-a-day fee charged by driving instructors for what it calls a 'defensive driving' course. Instructors must be on GA's own approved list. Opinions about the value of the scheme vary. Mr Ney is convinced of its value. 'The problem is frequently the 40-year-olds who work 16-hour days under great stress. You have to knock away the common perceptions. Driver training is a very good way of targeting the issue.'</p>

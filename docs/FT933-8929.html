			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery deal hint Speculation that Grand Metropolitan may be making renewed attempts to sell its Chef and Brewer chain of pub-restaurants helped spur the shares on in a strong drinks sector. Analysts said the rumours had been prompted by the sale earlier this week of 44 pubs by Bass to Greene King for Pounds 17.5m. The drinks sector has been alive with talk of the imminent sale of Chef and Brewer for several months, but the consensus in the market was that negotiations with several parties had foundered over price. Grand Met was thought to be seeking around Pounds 750m for the 1,600-strong chain. However, drinks specialists said that the company may now be considering splitting up the division into more saleable parcels. Whitbread was one name being linked to the speculation yesterday. Shares in Grand Met, boosted also by Procter and Gamble figures from the US, gained 14 to 442p. Bass gained 8 to 490p as it announced good trading at its Holiday Inn chain. Whitbread powered ahead on further speculation that the group may consider enfranchising its non-voting shares. The shares added 17 1/2 to 533p. BP was one of only a handful of Footsie 100 stocks to lose ground on a day when the market raced ahead to an all-time high, the shares coming under increasingly heavy bouts of straight selling and switching pressure. Some of the big international funds were said to have sold BP and switched into Shell, with the performances of the respective share prices giving added credence to the market stories. BP lost 3 1/2 to 305 1/2 p, having been as low of 303 1/2 p at one point during the session. Turnover was a heavy 12m shares. Shell, on the other hand, rose 8 to a 10-year high of 652p. 'There seems to be growing scepticism among the institutions about BP's recovery story,' said one analyst who added that 'BP shares have lost their momentum'. The exploration and production sub-sector remained firmly in the doldrums, beset by the recent poor performance of crude oil prices. The resignation on Tuesday of Mr John Walmsley, Enterprise Oil's finance director and one of the architects of the oil company's success during 1980s and 1990s, continued to weigh on the company's shares which fell further to 435p before stabilising and settling 2 easier at 437p on relatively high turnover of 2.1m. NatWest Securities oil team said the resignation 'will do little to assuage the market's faltering confidence in Enterprise'. Hopes that Lasmo shares might progress at the expense of Enterprise failed to materialise, with Lasmo closing marginally easier at 135p. Standard Chartered, due to announce interims this morning, recovered strongly from an early poor performance triggered largely by worries that the figures could be accompanied by a sizeable cash call. 'If there is a rights issue, and that is by no means certain, then the market is quite prepared,' said one trader. Standard fell to 880p at the outset, but early selling quickly dried up, to be replaced by strong buying interest which drove the shares back up to a closing level of 898p, a net rise of 16. Standard's profits are forecast to rise from last year's Pounds 64m to around Pounds 1215m to Pounds 180m with the dividend expected to be increased to 8p from 7p. HSBC aced up 23 to 744p, reflecting the bank's exceptionally strong interests in the Pacific Rim and its purchase of Midland Bank at what is seen as just about the bottom of the banking cycle. The property sector was the best performer in the market as investors sought both recovery potential and yield attractions. British Land, buoyed by its deal with the Quantum Fund, gained 8 to 366p, Hammerson added 11 to 349p, Land Securities 15 to 66p and MEPC 15 to 493p. Bargain-hunters were again seen in Owners Abroad as investors, soothed by Tuesday's appointment of a new chairman, sought stock. Dealers said one block of 2m shares was bought at 78p and sold on at 78 1/2 p. Total turnover was 5.6m. The shares added 2 to 79p. Switching out of rival tour operator Airtours left the stock 6 adrift at 369p. Theme park operator Euro Disney recovered on news of the French rate cut and the shares appreciated 22 to 705p. Kingfisher, which owns the Darty French retail chain, surged 19 to 654p. Guinness gained 11 to 472p. The group has a 24.6 per cent cross-holding with the French luxury goods group LVMH. Shares in Reuters Holdings, the global data transmission group, were active again after Daily Mail &amp; General Trust issued a Pounds 50m bond convertible into Reuters stock held by the trust. Reuters shares eased another 19 to 1505p on the realisation that this move will make more stock available in the market. Further profit-taking after the recent strength of the share price was also a significant factor.</p>

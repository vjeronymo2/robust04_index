			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (11): A spanner in the works / Profile of Istvan Csurka HUNGARY now has its own hobgoblin. His name is Istvan Csurka and he believes in things such as the 'Paris, New York, Tel Aviv' conspiracy. His goal is to defend what he sees as true Magyars from the machinations of international bankers, former communists, liberals and Jews. Mr Csurka, a slow-moving, portly writer, with a mane of grey hair swept straight up from his forehead, is one of six vice-presidents of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the leading member of Hungary's three party coalition government. On August 20, he threw a fire-cracker into the outwardly placid Hungarian political pond with the publication of his political manifesto. It was a rambling tract of 18,000 words, the political musings of what fellow-writers see as a talented but essentially irresponsible man steeped in Hungarian lore and traditions but ignorant of foreign languages and places. A solitary figure, fond of horse racing and gambling, Mr Csurka appeals to racial bigots, those who fear for the survival of this small nation with its distinctive language and those alienated by the dramatic social and economic changes unleashed by the opening up of the economy to large scale foreign investment. Having inherited right wing, nationalist views from his father, a journalist close to the wartime Arrow Cross fascist movement, Mr Csurka was subjected to periods of enforced silence by the former communist regime. However, under the same regime he also received several prestigious literary prizes. His plays and novels have received critical and popular acclaim while his weekly radio programme, broadcast every Sunday, is widely listened to. For good or ill, Mr Csurka is a force to be reckoned with in Hungarian affairs. His decision to stir up Hungary's political waters was ostensibly motivated by the ill health of Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, and the need to designate an eventual successor and redefine the role and policies of the HDF. In so doing he has staked out his position as the ideologue of the right wing nationalist faction of the HDF. Mr Csurka sees plots and enemies on all sides and he vehemently attacked Mr Arpad Goencz, the Hungarian president (and fellow writer) for his refusal to sign a government decree sacking the heads of Hungarian state radio and TV. But what set alarm bells ringing was his attacks on gypsies, Jews, bankers, communists and foreigners and his proposal to enlist 'healthy' young Hungarians in the recovery of a wider Lebensraum for the the Christian Magyar people. Ironically this xenophobic populism, with fascist undertones, makes him closer to former communists such as Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia, Ion Iliescu, the newly re-elected president of Romania or Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia than to the free market-orientated democrats of his own party or the liberal Hungarian opposition. The communist-nationalist leaders in surrounding states are making Hungarian and other minorities scapegoats for economic and political difficulties in areas which once were once totally or partially included in the greater Hungary that disappeared with the 1920 Trianon treaty. Against this background, Mr Csurka looks like the classic man in a glasshouse throwing stones. With Serbia threatening to destabilise the ethnic Hungarian areas of Vojvodina by resettling Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia, and ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia worried about their fate under Mr Meciar, Mr Csurka's brand of national intolerance and support for Hungarian irredentism risks leading to a dangerous escalation of provocations and abuse throughout the region. That might confirm Mr Csurka as a prophet in his own country. But such an outcome would inevitably draw Hungary ever deeper into the intrigue and instability for which Balkan politics has long been famous. It would be incompatible with the image of contemporary Hungary, a country striving for democracy with prosperity, and full integration into the European Community and the wider world.</p>

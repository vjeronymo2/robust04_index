			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> G.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that projected future uses of land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and water within the region are impossible to make given the unknown length of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time this waste may remain on site and the options for both cask and reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license renewal beyond 20 and 40 years, respectively, and the fact that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known man-made structure can last for the length of time that this waste must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be isolated from humans and the environment. If an MRS or repository ever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become available, this waste may have to be repacked. Each handling of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste increases the likelihood of an accident, spill, contamination, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worker and public exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Projected future land and water use can be made based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the continued safe operation of a reactor and its associated dry cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage facility. The continued operation of these facilities should have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater impact on land and water use in the future than they do today. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously noted, the NRC Waste Confidence decisions concluded there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable assurance that safe disposal of spent fuel by the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government will be available by the year 2025. Therefore, the spent fuel will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not remain at a reactor site for the length of time it must be isolated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> humans and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that the absence of significant environmental impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from dry cask storage at a reactor site is the conclusion of NRC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental assessment for the Standardized NUHOMS and for previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved dry casks analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR Part 72,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984 (August 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In the 1984  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant environmental impacts, for at least 30 years beyond expiration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter questioned whether the NUHOMS canister  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will fit the conceptual design for the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC). If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE chooses to use vertical casks (like the VSC) at the MRS, will the NUHOMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inner canister fit into the vertical outer concrete shell in the MPC design?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If local reactors choose the VSC&hyph;24 or the NUHOMS, will either inner metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> canister fit into the overpacks for DOE, or will they have to be opened after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage, returned to the pool, the fuel put in a new canister, and the old one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discarded as radioactive waste?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS is intended for the interim storage of spent fuels and is not required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conform to, and has not been evaluated by NRC for conformance with, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conceptual design for the DOE MPC. DOE has not yet made final decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding design or deployment of the MPC. Therefore, it is not possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speculate on conformance of the Standardized NUHOMS to the MPC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked what are the criteria for 20-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewal of this cask design? How will this be checked? If the design is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewed, what is the plan?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1989 proposed rule (May 5, 1989; 54 FR 19379) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> add Subparts K and L to Part 72 indicated that the 20-year period represents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what the Commission believes to be an appropriate increment for cask design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvals. The application for design reapproval would have to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cask's ability to perform the necessary safety functions for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reapproval period. The application would be evaluated by NRC against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission's regulatory requirements. If a cask design is not reapproved, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee would have to remove casks from service as the 20-year approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage life expired. This could mean removal of the spent fuel and storing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it elsewhere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wanted to discuss the need for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional cask design, including how it would better meet the need of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim dry cask storage of high-level waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NWPA) provides the following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private sector, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor power sites,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all available data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72, entitled ``General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' Therefore, there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a need for casks to be approved by NRC to implement the NWPA to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand of the interim dry cask storage of spent fuels in the nuclear power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants. However, the variety of cask designs submitted by vendors for NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review and approval is mostly dictated by economic reasons that do not involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

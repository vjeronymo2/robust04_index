			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Daohan, chairman  of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  [ARATS], told a XINHUA reporter today: Under the new situation  of deepened reform and widened opening up on the mainland,  cross-strait economic and trade exchanges have developed  rapidly. In addition, visits by personnel and other kinds of  exchanges have continued to increase. In the favorable situation  of the further development in cross- strait relations, there  unfortunately occurred the malignant criminal case of robbery,  arson, and murder at Qiandao Lake at the end of March which  killed 32 compatriots from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.  I express my profound condolences to the murdered compatriots  and my deep sympathy to their family members.    Wang Daohan said: Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council attached great importance to the "Qiandao Lake  case" after it happened, and the relevant Zhejiang authorities  put in full efforts with an earnest and responsible attitude to  crack the case. The criminals have now been arrested, and the  judicial department will severely punish them in accordance with  the law. Meanwhile, the relevant mainland authorities have  properly dealt with the aftermath of the incident, taking into  consideration the overall situation of safeguarding the  development of cross-strait relations. The relevant mainland  experts gave a detailed account to personnel of the Strait  Exchange Foundation [SEF] and relevant Taiwan experts on how the  case occurred and was cracked. In addition, they answered  various doubts of the Taiwan side about the case and also  arranged for Taiwan experts to visit the scene. This has  demonstrated the mainland's sincerity in making the greatest  efforts to explain the truth of the case to the Taiwan side.    Wang Daohan said: After the case occurred, compatriots from  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait shared the same sorrows and  regrets, and Taiwan circles have also put forward many opinions  and suggestions. We feel that in the powerful tide of thriving  cross- strait exchanges and unstoppable economic cooperation,  the "Qiandao Lake incident" was only an unexpected and  unfortunate case of murder and that it should not affect the  normal development of cross-strait relations. Furthermore, it  should not be used by a small number of people with ulterior  motives as an excuse to oppose the mainland, block cross-strait  exchanges, and advocate Taiwan independence. The two sides of  the Taiwan Strait should value the overall interests of the  Chinese people and rationally, calmly, and objectively treat the  case and various problems arising from it in the course of  handling the incident, as well as earnestly draw a lesson from  it. The mainland side will continue to tighten security  controls to ensure the security of Taiwan compatriots who visit  the mainland.    Wang Daohan said: The successful convening of the Wang-Gu  [Wang Daohan-Koo Chen-fu] talks one year ago has played an  active role in promoting the development of cross-strait  relations. In accordance with the agreements signed at the  talks, the ARATS and SEF have established a systematic  communications channel which has played an important role in  enhancing understanding and mutual trust as well as in  minimizing differences. With the continued development of  cross-strait relations, it should be said that there are bright  prospects for ARATS-SEF cooperation, and compatriots from the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait are placing high hopes on the  ARATS and the SEF. The two sides should further strengthen  their communications channel, particularly in strengthening  high-level contacts, increasing dialogue, eliminating  misunderstandings, resolving differences, and promoting  cooperation. Only with this can we comply with the wish of  compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and shoulder  the heavy responsibility entrusted by history.</p>

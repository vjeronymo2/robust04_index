			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Retention scheme fears hit coffee price COFFEE PRICES in London slipped by Pounds 17 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 1,216 a tonne for the second position futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange. Trading was lacklustre as buyers became nervous about the small amount of purchases made by Brazil on Wednesday when the coffee producers' retention scheme came into force. Brazil is co-ordinating buying on behalf of the world's main producers, who want to boost prices by holding back supplies. Brasilia has said it wants to purchase 200,000 bags of coffee, but it only picked up 1,750 in its first foray into the market on Wednesday. Market traders say producers will have to pay higher prices for the retention scheme to succeed. Traders will be watching Brazil's moves today when it makes its next purchases. 'If the Brazilians only buy 1,750 bags again, the market will fall on Monday, but it could buy, say 50,000 bags, and we'd see a complete reversal,' one trader said. Producers are hoping they will erode stocks in consuming countries by holding back supplies. Stocks in the US - the world's largest consuming nation - have been drawn down in the past two months as the market enters the peak consumption period of the northern hemisphere's winter.</p>

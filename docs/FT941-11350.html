			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern acquires Reject Shop Reject Shop, the USM-quoted furniture and household goods retailer which has suffered mounting losses through the recession, is to be acquired for Pounds 2.5m by Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the Middlesbrough-based department store group revitalised by new management. Mr Jeffrey Gould, Upton's chief executive, said Reject Shop, heavily focused on south-east England and the recession-prone 18-35 year old first time housebuyer, had erred by trying to move upmarket. Upton planned to reduce prices and rationalise the product range, turning Reject Shop into a town centre rival to Ikea. 'The idea is to be very competitive,' he said. The enlarged group will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 13m, annual turnover of Pounds 35m and 36 stores, including the 31-store Reject Shop chain. Upton's value before the purchase was Pounds 5.37m. Reject Shop will be Upton's core business. The offer consists of three 5p Upton shares for every five Reject Shop shares valuing them at 22.4p, a discount of about 60 per cent on Wednesday's close. There is a partial cash alternative. In addition, four Upton shares are offered for every three Reject Shop Pounds 1 preference shares, valuing them at 49.7p for a total of about Pounds 179,000. Reject Shop's ordinary shares lost 21p to close at 38p, while Upton rose 1p to 6p. Upton has received irrevocable undertakings from holders of 83.1 per cent of the ordinary shares and 92.5 per cent of the preference. Most of these shares are held by Reject's founders and co-chairmen, Mr Anthony Hawser and his ex-wife, Mrs Anna Vinton. To fund the buy Upton is raising a net Pounds 4.5m through a 4-for-30 rights issue of up to 17.3m 5p shares at 30p each. There is also a share consolidation of 10 0.5p shares into one 5p share. The issue is underwritten by Townsley &amp; Co. Founded in 1973, Reject Shop initially sold seconds, but later moved into discounted perfect stock. The name will be retained, at least initially, although one London store will become a renamed pilot unit. Mr Gould said Reject Shop was top heavy in management. A hard view would be taken of the business's costs. Upton has been looking at Reject since July but it had been a struggle to complete the deal. 'The level of price we have agreed in my opinion reflects the value of the business. In their opinion it doesn't' Mr Jim Hodkinson, the former international development director at Kingfisher and former B&amp;Q deputy chairman and chief executive, will remain Upton's chairman. Mrs Vinton has been offered a non-executive directorship, and Mr Geoffrey Frost, Reject's managing director, will become executive director. Mr Ian Steven, at present a non-executive director of Upton, will become finance director. Mr Hawser will no longer be involved in the business he built into a national name. 'It's a sadness and an opportunity,' he said. He had been impressed by Mr Gould and thought he would do a good job. He will now pursue his boat building interests. 'I don't see myself competing with Jeffrey and Ian, they would eat me alive.' Reject Shop's results for the 28 weeks to October 3, announced yesterday, showed a higher pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 884,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9.13m). Losses per share were 17.29p (6.01p) and the interim dividend is passed after a payment of 0.5p last time.</p>

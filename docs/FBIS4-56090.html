			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Djordje Milosevic] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 26 (TANJUG) -- The Moscow pro-government  paper IZVESTIYA has recently showed that the principle `innocent  until proven guilty' does not apply to the Serbs which it holds  responsible for the murder of Russian reporters Viktor Nogin and  Gennadiy Kurenoy, reported missing near Kostajnica in the  Republic of Serb Krajina on September 1, 1991.    IZVESTIYA's reporter Vladimir Mukusev, member of the special  parliamentary commission set up to inquire the case, quotes a  testimony by `star witness' Stevo Borojevic as saying that the  two reporters were ambushed on the Bosnia-Croatia border and  later executed by one Ranko Borojevic on charges of spying for  Croatia. The Serbs were thus found guilty of murder of the two  reporters on the basis of a single testimony and without any  conclusive evidence.    IZVESTIYA's reporting has been strongly criticized by  Vladimir Solovev of the Russian Ostankino television who was  also on the investigative team. Solovev said in an interview to  the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA paper that Mukusev's statements cannot  be independently verified. In a series of articles on the  situation in former Yugoslavia, IZVESTIYA has always referred to  the Serbs as the sole culprits for everything that has gone  wrong.    The way the paper has presented speculations as solid facts  and the timing of the story only testify to malevolence and an  unhidden desire to harm the Serbs. By portraying the Serbs as  the arch villains, the paper is actually trying to persuade the  Russian public that the Serbs started the war in former  Yugoslavia. All this is aimed into justifying Russia's position  on anti-Yugoslav sanctions, support for a series of inconsistent  solutions detrimental to the Serbs and lack of reaction to  another Moslem-Croat onslaught in Bosnia.    IZVESTIYA believes the Russian public should be constantly  reminded of the Serb guilt to minimize criticism of Moscow's  erroneous policy towards developments in former Yugoslavia, its  biasness, double standards and what some analysts describe as  total subordination to the west.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE SEEMS UNLIKELY TO PASS CAPITAL GAINS CUT;  </P> <P> BUDGET: LAWMAKERS TRY TO PARE PET PROJECTS FROM THE DEFICIT-REDUCTION BILL AS A  MONDAY DEADLINE NEARS.  </P> <P> As the Senate began slogging through a $14.1-billion deficit-reduction bill  Thursday, both Democrats and Republicans agreed that there probably are not  enough votes to include a capital gains tax cut in the measure.  </P> <P> But Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said that his party would make  several attempts to amend the Senate budget bill to add the capital gains tax  cut supported by President Bush. If that effort fails, Dole said, Republicans  will attempt to add the tax cut to other essential legislation, such as a bill  on the federal debt limit.  </P> <P> "We're going to offer it every chance we have," he told reporters.  </P> <P> This could include using a variety of delaying tactics, such as a move to force  a vote on the House bill that includes the tax break.  </P> <P> "Capital gains threatens to freeze us altogether," said Senate Budget Committee  Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.).  </P> <P> Earlier Thursday, White House officials said it was doubtful that they would  insist on a showdown when the Senate votes on the deficit bill today. But they  vowed to pursue Bush's campaign pledge to reduce capital gains taxes.  </P> <P> At the same time, leaders of both parties were moving toward an agreement on a  plan aimed at dropping more than 100 extraneous items from the deficit measure.  But numerous disputes are expected over such issues as child care and dozens of  special interest tax breaks.  </P> <P> Although the major purpose of the spending bill is to reduce the deficit in the  current budget year to about $110 billion, most of its bulk is attributable to  hundreds of lawmakers' pet projects. In a brief session of the Senate Budget  Committee, members complained that many of the items will actually add to the  budget deficit in future years.  </P> <P> One feature of the bill would benefit owners of tuxedo-rental stores; others  would reduce borrowing costs on rural electric loans, aid small farmers and  allow wealthy families to continue taking advantage of a loophole whereby  grandparents can give their grandchildren up to $2 million.  </P> <P> "What we're seeing is the trashing of the budget process," said Sen. William L.  Armstrong (R-Col.).  </P> <P> Because lawmakers are certain to fail to complete action on the bill before a  Monday deadline, the deficit-reduction law will trigger automatic,  across-the-board cuts of about $16 billion in a wide variety of federal  spending programs.  </P> <P> But Congress is expected to restore the cut funds as soon as it finishes the  deficit-reduction bill.  </P> <P> The House has already approved a $10.9-billion deficit-reduction bill that  contains a two-year capital gains tax cut. Any differences between the Senate  and House versions would be ironed out in a conference committee, which is  expected to be at work for several weeks.  </P> <P> Instead of the capital gains tax cut advocated by the Bush Administration, the  Senate bill includes a plan pushed by Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen  (D-Tex.) to allow more taxpayers to take at least partial deductions for  individual retirement accounts.  </P> <P> Republicans and a handful of Democrats have been working together on a proposal  for a permanent capital gains cut of no more than 35% from current levels. They  plan also to offer investors an alternative of adjusting investment profits to  eliminate the effects of inflation and to provide additional tax breaks for  venture capital.  </P> <P> During the first hours of debate on the bill, the Senate approved only one  amendment, agreeing to spend an extra $40 million to aid rural hospitals.  </P> <P> Sasser acknowledged that the bill "does not boldly address a deficit problem"  but insisted it was better than imposing automatic budget cuts and at least  meets the guidelines agreed on by the White House and Congress last April.  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The moral victory that is still to be won The British Labour party, which for all its much vaunted policy reviews, still remained statist and anti-market, lost the UK election. And I noted that there was another group of losers as well: the more embittered Conservative Europhobes who were so obviously sharpening their knives for a bloodbath against anyone in the Conservative party, or outside it, who had anything to do with the decision to join the exchange rate mechanism. The latter argument can wait quite a few months until much more evidence becomes available of Germany's success in countering the inflationary effects of reunification, and hence the prospect for European interest rates. The day before Good Friday, I want to touch on a more fundamental theme. This is that the anti-collectivists won the general election, but have yet to win the moral argument. The evidence that market capitalism still has to win the moral victory comes from the contrast between public opinion polls and the actual votes in the polling booths. A significant margin of people evidently thought that in some sense Labour policies for increasing the role of the state were right and respectable and the thing to tell others they supported; but they shied away from what they feared might be the personal consequences to themselves and their families of a Labour government. This feeling of moral inferiority is embedded in that awful proverb: 'Anyone who is not a socialist before the age of 21 has no heart; and anyone who remains one after the age of 21 has no head.' Nor is it at all comforting that, in spite of the collapse of state socialism in the former Soviet world, that so many of our own intellectuals and artists parade their leftwing leanings. It is as vulgar to sneer at Islington woman as it is to sneer at Basildon man. With all respect to David Mellor, a minister of culture is not the complete answer to the anxieties of artists and authors about a capitalist environment. I know the glib answer: that men and women of letters, artists and musicians, have to live under state socialism to turn against it. It would be more satisfactory if they could bring themselves to see the moral case for capitalism without such experiences. Let me be more specific on two issues. All incomes do not belong to the state; and two-tier or multi-tier health, education and other services are inescapable in a free society. It was the assumption that all incomes belong to the state that was the ultimate rationale of John Smith's confiscatory Shadow Budget. If we are in the position of children who are being given portions of pie by a mother, then the only prima facie fair distribution is equality; and departures from it have to be justified. If, on the other hand, adults have obtained their holdings in exchange for their labours, or through transactions with others, or by a gift or bequest, then the pie theory does not hold; and it is the compulsory transfer to others that has to be justified. The anti-collectivists' case needs to be stated with great care. Rights to income and property are not facts of nature. They are enforced by agencies such as the police and courts; they are not unlimited, and they can gradually change. It is quite legitimate for people to be required after due political process to hand over a fraction of their income for the provision of collective services or for redistribution to the poor. But if we want more of some collective provisions - whether state education or anything else - then most of us must contribute and not just the better off. What in the end made the Smith-Kinnock approach immoral rather than moral was their repeated assurance that they could fund a vast and open-ended expansion of collective activities without the average family having to pay any more in tax. The Shadow Budget went beyond even that. The increases in taxes at the upper end of the income distribution were more than required to finance the promised increase in pensions and child benefit. The object was to churn enough money around so that there could be 'more winners than losers'. As I tried to explain at the beginning of the campaign, the Smith Shadow Budget was devastatingly simple in its reasoning. If you have 10 piles of coins of different heights and take from the two tallest piles to put something in each of the others, then there will be more gainers than losers. The Conservatives might have made people fear that there would be bad side effects, or that Labour would not stop at the one or two tallest piles. But there was no fundamental challenge to the right of a government elected on a plurality to indulge in such confiscation. This collectivist fallacy that our personal property comes from some mythical entity called the state is enhanced every time any chancellor of any party boasts of how much his Budget has 'done' for so many people. This naturally encourages television reporters to go into the pubs and pick up complaints that 'this Budget has done very little for me' or 'it will all be taken away by the poll tax', or whatever. The object of Budgets is not to provide people with something for nothing. It is to raise money for collectively-provided or financed services. The state can take more or less for this purpose. It has nothing to give. To move on. The forces of freedom will not have won the moral battle so long as they wince when accused of being in favour of 'two-tier' health or two-tier education. There will always be different levels of provision so long as people are free to spend their own incomes in their own ways - and that would be true even if incomes were equal. Two-tier provision could only be abolished if people were forbidden to purchase private medicine or private education. In other words, people's incomes would have to be treated as pocket money which they can spend on gambling or holidays or restaurant meals, but not on anything they regard as of prime importance. The immediate response from the leftwing is the charge of queue-jumping. Serious cases are supposedly left untreated so that a privately-insured person can be pampered in a private ward. Here a tiny piece of microeconomics does help to refute the charge. It all depends on the 'elasticity of supply' of medical services. If the total number of doctors, nurses, surgical appliances, drugs, and hospital buildings were fixed, then the leftwing charge would be difficult to answer, like the case for food rationing in wartime. But if, as is so obviously the case, the supply of such services is over a few years responsive to demand, then the willingness of people to pay themselves for treatment leads to a large expansion. More doctors stay in this country. Others are attracted here from abroad. More hospitals are built, and in the end there are more resources devoted to medical purposes. * * * The heroic anti-collectivist period of the 1980s is over. Those of us with a preference for the market and personal over collective choice will have to make our own case, with governments preferring to avoid high theory. For there was always a paradox in those who proclaimed the belief in freedom wanting one person to remain in power for ever and ever, and to amass more and more centralised authority. We are back to the 1960s in the exciting sense that the battle of ideas will be fought outside the corridors of power.</p>

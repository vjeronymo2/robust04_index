			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Motoring: Learn to drive like a boy racer CHANGING lane twice in a double swerve at 85 mph (137 kph) is something few M25 thrusters would think of doing, especially if they were driving Pounds 86,000 worth of V12 engined Mercedes-Benz 600 at the time. But last week I was encouraged to do just that. No, not on a motorway but on a coned-off runway of an old airfield. Mercedes-Benz was demonstrating what it means by intensive driving safety training. Owning or leasing a Mercedes means you drive one of the world's best cars but it does not follow that you appreciate how to get the best out of it. Which is where Guido Moch comes in: his driver training programme does just that. Moch's courses are normally available only in Germany. He encourages drivers to discover the limits of their skill and of their cars' capabilities in surroundings where no harm is done if both are exceeded. Then they are told how important it is to stay well below those limits on roads. 'The purpose of driving safety training is not to allow people to drive faster in future,' he says. 'Its sole purpose is to increase safety, promote calm and familiarise people with a correct and safe style of driving. Spectacular driving is always slower and more stressful and therefore ultimately pointless.' The training is quite exciting. I spent a giddy 15 minutes driving a 190E around a water-soaked circle, experiencing the difference between understeer (the car has to be held into a turn) and oversteer (the back tyres lose grip and the tail swings out). Next, the Moch Snake - a course with as many left and right-hand corners as Hampton Court maze - had to be driven round at increasing speed in a 300SE. Then it was the double-swerve in the 600SEL, back into a 190E for a smaller, faster Moch Snake followed by slower, slipperier exercises. First came a slalom, followed by stopping, spinning the car through 180 degrees in reverse and then back though the slalom again. Second, a low speed swerve under ABS braking on a surface like black ice. And finally, all the tests in quick succession against the clock. One ends with various impressions: the sheer nimbleness of the great V12; the reserves of roadholding and handling a 190E displays when pushed to the limit of tyre grip and beyond; the danger in thinking that ABS brakes allow normal speeds to be used on ice. They do not. All they can do according to the laws of physics is to make best use of what tyre grip there is. On ice, the only safe way to drive an ABS-equipped car with normal tyres is slowly and gently. Back to Guido Moch. 'Anyone trying to defy these laws is neither an expert nor a superman but is ignorant . . . tired of living . . . or stupid,' he says. Such thoughts never enter the minds of the high-speed, wet weather tailgaters who make motorway travel less safe and more stressful than it need be.</p>

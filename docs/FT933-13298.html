			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / A heart-searching time for Boots: Why the withdrawal of Manoplax has been welcomed Yesterday was not a good day for investors in UK drug stocks. Medeva, a high-flying newcomer to the industry, saw its shares crash after a profits warning. Wellcome's shares fell heavily, as did those of Glaxo and Zeneca. To cap it all, Boots announced it was killing off its most important new drug, the heart treatment Manoplax. Oddly enough, Boots's share price went up on the news. There were two reasons for this. First, as the company explained, the fact that it has given up hope on Manoplax will save it Pounds 20m this year in marketing costs. Granted, there will be a one-off charge of up to Pounds 35m for stock write-offs and possible redundancies. But even this year, Boots said, there should be a small net gain in profits and cash flow. There was a more fundamental strand to the market's thinking. Boots' management has been suffering from what analysts politely call a credibility gap. It has seemed unwilling to acknowledge the existence of two serious problems in its operations: its loss-making DIY business, and Manoplax, which the market mistrusted even before the news in April that in large doses it caused more deaths than a placebo. The decision to bite the bullet on Manoplax is, therefore, welcomed as evidence of a new realism. Specifically, the market now hopes that Boots will unlock value by admitting what outside observers have believed for years: that its drugs business is too small to be viable and should be sold off. The idea was specifically rebutted by the company yesterday. Indeed, this would be an odd time for such a move. Drugs stocks have been hit heavily this year by the threat of hostile action from the Clinton administration. But the President's plans have not even been published yet. Plainly, it would make sense to wait until the dust has settled. But there seems little doubt that Boots' drugs division would be worth a good deal. Without the costs of Manoplax, operating profits are running at around Pounds 130m a year. On that basis, according to Mr Ian White of Kleinwort Benson, the business could be worth Pounds 700m. Equally, there seems no real chance now of the business continuing on its own. Boots drew attention yesterday to its drugs in development: treatments for obesity and schizophrenia, an anti-diabetic, an asthma drug and an anti-depressant. But only the obesity drug is anywhere near the market. The last two are not even in clinical trials. A direct comparison can be drawn with another, somewhat larger, but struggling drugs company, Fisons. Both companies suffer from a chronic inability to discover worthwhile new drugs. Fisons has only come up with two related asthma drugs, Intal and Tilade. Boots has come up with two related arthritis drugs, ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, both of which are now off patent. In a world where drugs giants, such as Merck and Glaxo, are feeling the squeeze, it is a meagre diet to survive on. But if Boots cannot yet bring itself to sell off its drugs business, it is at least in the process of reorganising it. Its interim figures will for the first time break down the division into its constituents: prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines and products made under contract. If decisions have not been made, there is at least more room for manoeuvre. However, getting rid of all or part of the drugs division would not necessarily solve Boots' problems. As Mr John Richards, of NatWest Markets, remarks, it would merely wind the clock back to the late 1980s, before Manoplax had come to prominence and before the ill-judged acquisition of the retail group Ward White. 'Boots is a company with a very strong core business generating cash, which needs to do something else strategically if it is to get above-average growth', Mr Richards says. 'The question is, where does it go in the longer term?' Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK construction orders rise UK CONSTRUCTION orders rose slightly during the final three months of last year thanks to strong performance from public-sector housing and housing associations and from public works such as road building. Private investment in residential, commercial and industrial property, fell compared with the previous months. Total orders, according to the Environment Department, were 1 per cent higher than during July, August and September last year and 2 per cent higher than in the final three months of 1990.</p>

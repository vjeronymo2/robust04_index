			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Men under 45 form bulk of redundancies Men under the age of 45 make up the largest number of those made redundant in Britain and are twice as likely to lose their jobs as women, according to statistics published yesterday by the Department of Employment. A total of 262,000 redundancies were recorded for the three months prior to the 1993 labour force survey, of which 169,000 were men and 93,000 women. Two out of every three men made redundant were under the age of 35. One in five of those made redundant had found paid employment by the time they were interviewed compared with one in four a year earlier. The Department of Employment said this showed that 'although fewer redundancies had been made in 1993, a smaller proportion of those made redundant managed to find jobs afterwards'. As many as a third of all those made redundant in the period covered were from south-east England (77,000), though the number was down from the 101,000 recorded in that region a year earlier. Wales and East Anglia produced the lowest numbers of redundancies. Half those losing their jobs were from the service sector and roughly a third from manufacturing industries. Construction had the third-highest number of redundancies. Craft and skill-related workers accounted for about 20 per cent of all redundancies while higher than average redundancies took place among plant and machine operatives as well as clerical and secretarial jobs. The highest proportions of people receiving redundancy payments last spring were professional and technical staff. The figures also showd that as many as 440,000 Irish nationals live in Britain, with more than a third of them in London and more than half over the age of 50. They are more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the population, with 13 per cent jobless last spring compared with 10 per cent for the labour market as a whole. Irish nationals are also more than twice as likely to work in the construction industry compared with the rest of the population. As many as 38 per cent of them over the age of 16 have no qualification compared with 26 per cent for the rest of the population. Employment Gazette, January 1994, HMSO. Pounds 4.95.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Storm shows strong advance to Pounds 0.4m Storm Group, which is aiming to become one of Europe's leading animation and licencing companies, lifted profits from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 407,000 pre-tax for the six months to June 30. Turnover increased to Pounds 4m (Pounds 605,000), due in part to the completion of three animation productions for the ITV network in the UK. Earnings per share rose to 0.38p (0.07p). The company joined the USM in 1989 and has yet to pay a dividend. However, directors said that if the first half level of profits continued, they expected to be in a position to recommend a final distribution.</p>

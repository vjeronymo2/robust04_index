			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel De la Guardia from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] Cuba has already denounced the myth that Cubans  cannot voluntarily leave their country before the United Nations  and all other public forums it has access to. It is a myth  created by reactionary propaganda media, both in and outside of  the United States, which dissolves in its own steam while  maneuvers are made to discover ways to present a twisted image  of Cuba to the world.    The great majority of Cubans, more than 95 percent, who have  migrated to the United States and other countries, have done so  by legal means, or at least with the approval of the Cuban  Government. The basic reasons for these migrations has to do  with the economy, given that these people did not want to  resist, together with their people, the difficulties that a  small country has to go through if it wants to be free and  sovereign in the face of opposition by an imperial power like  the United States, which is also a very close neighbor.    For 35 years, the Cuban people have resisted the hostility  of  successive U.S. Governments, which have launched all sorts of  aggressions, both overt as well as covert, against Cuba for the  declared purpose of overthrowing the revolutionary government,  wiping out its will for independence, and inflicting  Washington's political will on this small country.    The evidence behind this statement has repeatedly been given  by the U.S. Government itself when it has publicly stated it  will only lift the economic blockade and begin normal relations  once Cuba makes the political changes the United States wants  and replaces the revolutionary government, headed by Fidel  Castro, with another, supposedly democratic, which will have no  qualms in subordinating itself to U.S. political and economic  interests.    To this end, the U.S. Government has developed an  immigration  policy that scandalously favors Cubans who abandon their country  on improvised rafts, defy the dangers of the open sea in the  hope of being rescued by a Coast Guard vessel and taken to  Florida where they are forced to make politically hostile  statements against the Cuban revolutionary government. Only then  do these Cubans earn preferential treatment by the U.S.  authorities.    With regards to the thousands of Cubans who wish to travel  to  the United States to visit their relatives and then return to  Cuba, they are treated very differently. Last year, of 100,000  Cuban citizens who tried to obtain a U.S. Government visa to  legally travel to the United States, 70,000 were turned down.  Day after day thousands of Cubans form long lines outside the  U.S. Interests Section's doors in Havana with the hope of  receiving the required visa. Only 30 percent have accomplished  this; the rest, after putting up with being humiliated and  mistreated by diplomatic officials, leave disappointed and their  only hope is that one day this will change. Quite a few, after  being turned down by capricious arguments, have undergone the  raft adventure and been received as heroes in the same country  that rejected them because they may have chosen to stay in U.S.  territory and perhaps become a public burden.    It is for this reason that Cuba insists on stating that this  policy is criminal and violates all humanitarian principles. It  is a policy that stubbornly disregards human rights.</p>

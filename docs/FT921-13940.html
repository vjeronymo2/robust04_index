			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling wave hits Fisons PHARMACEUTICAL group Fisons suffered the biggest percentage fall of all the FT-SE 100 stocks yesterday and recorded the highest turnover. The shares fell 27, or 7.5 per cent, to 334p with a closing volume of 15m. The effect of the heavy switching out of pharmaceutical stocks in New York was accentuated by negative press reports. Specifically, an article yesterday said Fisons' most promising product, the asthma drug Tilade, had been criticised by the US Food and Drug Administration. Analysts said they were slightly surprised by the effect of the press reports. One said: 'We are not learning anything new here but clearly shareholders are still nervous. This sort of news is already reflected in the price but there does tend to be a knee-jerk reaction.' BET falls Strong rumours of a downgrade in 1992 profit forecasts for international support services company BET by one securities house led to a sharp fall in the share price. The shares had been up about 10p for much of the day. Then, speculation swept the market that securities house Robert Fleming would on Monday be reducing its 1992 forecast for BET to Pounds 135m, well below the range of analysts forecasts which stands between Pounds 150m and Pounds 165m. The shares tumbled sharply to close 19 off at 186p with 6.3m traded. A number of houses mentioned Fleming but the house had no comment to make. BP hit again The recent see-saw performance by BP continued yesterday with the shares heavily sold and finally 8 lower at 284p - one of the Footsie's poorest individual performances. Earlier in the week BP shares, along with most of the oil stocks, posted good gains as crude oil prices recovered in the wake of production cuts. Adding to the bullish trend in the stock was a flurry of broker buy notes in the sector. Yesterday's notable weakness emerged after Strauss Turnbull, the broker, issued a swingeing downgrade of the 1992 profits forecast on the basis of an increase in the company's tax charge from 45 per cent to an average of 50 per cent during 1992; 'this means a substamntially uncovered dividend for two years,' said Mr John Toalster at Strauss. He also spsoke of the company's refining margins coming under more pressure. Strauss chopped their 1992 forecast from Pounds 930m to Pounds 750m. Construction group AMEC remained one of the pacemakers in the contracting sub-sector despite the placing of a hefty block of shares in the company via a 'bought deal.' The Seaq ticker revealed that two large blocks of AMEC were traded, a line of 7.1m at 145p and a block of 7.1 at 146p. Smith New Court, widely regarded as the market's 'bought deal' specialist, was said to have transacted the business which caused little more than a murmur in AMEC shares. They closed a net 7 higher at 152p with turnover, made up largely of both sides of the bought deal, reaching 15.2m. An early fall in Wellcome was reversed after the group said sales in the first four months of its financial year to the end of August had risen by by 20 per cent. The shares a closed 12 up at 1034p with 3.6m traded. The slide in pharmaceuticals stocks continued yesterday. Glaxo dropped 28 to 838p, and SmithKline Beecham lost 34 to 889p. Cyclical switching benefited RTZ (up 15 537p) and ICI (33 better at 1255p). Hanson appeared to find a level at 216 1/2 p but saw good two-way business with 11m shares dealt. Shell, a good performer for much of the week, ran into profit-taking and settled 6 off at 497p on a heavy turnovver of 7.7m shares. British Gas, remained firm at 243p on 5.7m. Dealers noted persistent demand for Burmah Castrol, which ended the day 11 higher at 519p, on stories that the first in a series of disposals associated with the Foseco business acquired by Burmah last year, is imminent. Burmah shares have risen 33p over the week. Property shares gained from the move into cyclical stocks as buyers were spurred on by Thursday's mortgage rate cuts. As prices rose, some brokers issued urgent sell notes and the market was hit by profit-taking. However, many analysts believe the rises are sustainable. Of the leading stocks, British Land was up 7 to 262p, Greycoat gained 7 to 75p, Land Securities added 13 to 473p, while MEPC rose 11 to 395p. Hammerson, which announced the part-letting of a Fifth Avenue office block, saw its Ordinary shares gain 12 to 535p, the A shares closing 10 ahead at 475p. Medeva fell 12 to 216p. It was announced that the Bank of New York, which holds American Depositary Receipts for its clients, had increased its interest in Medeva by 1.5m shares to almost 28m (14.13 per cent). Arjo Wiggins Appleton fell 17 to 258p on announcing the breaking off of negotiations for the sale of its 42.8 per cent stake in Soporcel. Leisure stocks with significant property exposure benefited from the rally in property shares. Ladbroke jumped 8 1/2 to 222 1/2 p and Rank Organisation rose 15 to 616p, while the less-exposed Forte gained 3 to 234p. Unusually heavy turnover of 16m at Cityvision left the shares only  1/4 p higher at 51p, with Blockbuster, the company making the agreed Pounds 75m takeover for the video rental group, active in the market. Hopes that the latest cuts in mortgage rates will quickly filter through into retail spending prompted another bout of out performanceby stores shares. Leading the sector higher was Marks &amp; Spencer, up 10 to 302p on turnover of 6.5m. Alexon was another strong performer, the shares settling 18 higher at 349p after a recent presentation at BZW attended by around 20 leading institutions. and profits estimates for next Burton edged up 1 1/2 to 40p with hefty turnover of 16m substantially boosted by an agency cross of 5m at 39p. Thursday's mortgage rate cuts by leading UK lenders triggered another burst of buying interest in building materials and construction stocks. In the former group RMC took pride of place in advancing 23 to 579p while Rugby, heavily bought on Thursday, raced up 9 more to 196p. The Steetley/Redland bid battle hotted up with speculation that ECC, formerly English China Clays, is about to enter the fray, driving Steetley higher. They closed 11 better at 381p, well below the Redland terms, while the latter, moved up 15 to 473p. Significantly, according to dealers, ECC fell 3 to 485p, having been as low as 478p earlier in the session. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (124).

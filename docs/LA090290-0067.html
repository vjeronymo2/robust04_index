			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL IN TROUBLE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IS LOW AT GAGE JUNIOR HIGH IN HUNTINGTON PARK.  THE PRINCIPAL, TEACHERS AND PARENTS ARGUE FIERCELY ABOUT WHAT TO DO.  </P> <P> Everyone agrees that improvements are needed at Gage Junior High School, where  students have consistently scored below the national average on tests of  reading, writing and mathematics. But agreeing on a solution is a different  matter.  </P> <P> The poor achievement record has triggered a heated battle among the principal,  teachers and rival parents groups over what to do about it.  </P> <P> One group of parents and City Councilman Luis Hernandez have called for the  ouster of David R. Almada, who has been principal at Gage since September,  1988. They are backed by key members of the teaching staff who say they have  lost confidence in Almada's ability to improve the school.  </P> <P> "We're looking for leadership," said Sergio Palos, president of Community in  Action, which collected about 200 signatures from parents and other residents  calling for Almada to be replaced.  </P> <P> "They're creating a whole generation of second-class citizens who can only hope  to hold jobs at McDonald's," Palos said.  </P> <P> But another parents group says that instead of the principal, five of the  teachers should be fired to restore harmony to the school and its 3,200  students.  </P> <P> The Rev. Horacio Quinones, an East Los Angeles education activist and a member  of the Hispanic Parent Coalition, made up of more than 1,000 parents, has  accused the Anglo teachers of rebelling against the Latino principal, creating  havoc at the school.  </P> <P> "If (Almada) had had the support and help of his staff, there wouldn't have  been any difficulty," Quinones said. "But they started cutting him down as soon  as he got there because he is Hispanic."  </P> <P> The teachers denied that allegation and filed a defamation lawsuit against  Quinones on Aug. 24 in Superior Court.  </P> <P> The dispute reached such proportions that Los Angeles school Supt. William R.  Anton recently met with Almada and the teachers and urged them to work out  their differences. Anton also assigned four specialists to the school to help  improve its educational program.  </P> <P> "We couldn't stand there and let the school fall apart instructionally," Deputy  Supt. Sidney A. Thompson said.  </P> <P> The conflict at Gage has been brewing for months. It came to a head in recent  weeks during a series of meetings organized by Palos to inform parents about  how the school could be improved. Almada, 45, and several teachers spoke at the  meetings.  </P> <P> Palos and other parents in his group soon decided that Almada was the problem.  They reached that conclusion after a meeting July 26 in which teachers Rhonda  B. Nalisnik and Edward J. Zschoche described a disorganized school where  teacher morale was low and students were not receiving the instruction they  need to succeed, Palos said.  </P> <P> "When the questions came up (about) who was responsible to make the decisions,  the conclusion was that the principal was," Zschoche said in an interview. "We  can come up with all the ideas in the world, and unless we're permitted to  implement those ideas, nothing happens."  </P> <P> In addition to Nalisnik and Zschoche, teachers William T. Higbee, Paul Shapiro  and John A. Duhaime have been targeted by Quinones' group.  </P> <P> The five teachers are all Gage veterans who have served on school committees  over the years. In addition, Nalisnik is a mentor teacher, and Zschoche and  Higbee are union representatives at the school. Palos calls the five teachers  some of the best at Gage.  </P> <P> Palos' group and the teachers have the backing of Councilman Hernandez, who has  been involved with school affairs as an alternate member of Gage's Shared  Decision Making Council, a body of community and school personnel that decides  school policy in various areas. Palos is a full member of the council.  </P> <P> "The parents have come to a decision," Hernandez said. "They see what they call  a lack of leadership."  </P> <P> But Almada said that academic achievement has been low at Gage for years and  that it is unrealistic to expect him to turn things around in the two years he  has been principal.  </P> <P> "I've had teachers and parents saying we need more academic programs, and we're  moving ahead," said Almada, who noted that he has added several algebra  classes.  </P> <P> But Palos said his group's resolve to remove Almada was strengthened by a  recent school review performed by Los Angeles Unified School District personnel  for the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> The review team found that some Spanish-speaking children at Gage were not  receiving adequate instruction in English. It also found that record-keeping  for students in the school's bilingual program was poor and that some parents  were not being notified that their children had been placed in the program.  </P> <P> Almada said he is working to correct the deficiencies, which he blamed  partially on budget constraints. He also noted the school's high transiency  rate: About 20% of the students come and go each year.  </P> <P> "We have so many kids coming in that it is difficult," Almada said.  </P> <P> The reviewers also found deficiencies in the school's math program and in its  English classes for students who speak little English.  </P> <P> One of the most striking findings concerned relations between the  administration and the teachers at Gage.  </P> <P> The review team said it "found that a lack of cooperation and communication  adversely affected the quality of . . . the (educational) product itself."  </P> <P> The team urged the staff to resolve its conflicts, saying: "All students at  Gage Junior High School deserve a collegial, professional learning environment  and instructional program."  </P> <P> Almada said he will work to improve relations with his staff. He declined to  comment on the actions of the teachers who oppose him.  </P> <P> For their part, the teachers alienated some parents at the same July 26 meeting  where they won over Palos' group.  </P> <P> At that meeting, Nalisnik spoke forcefully about the school's problems:  </P> <P> Academic achievement is low. Since 1986, Gage students have scored below the  40th percentile on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, a nationally  standardized test of reading, writing and mathematics. That means 60% of  students nationwide scored better than Gage students.  </P> <P> District records show that Gage students also consistently scored below the  district and statewide averages on a similar state test, the California  Assessment Program.  </P> <P> At the meeting, Nalisnik urged parents to press for change at the school.  "Otherwise," she said, "you may as well simply take out your matches and burn  the school down." Then she lighted a match.  </P> <P> A week later, Quinones and about 40 other parents and students demonstrated in  front of Gage calling for the ouster of the five teachers.  </P> <P> The demonstrators carried signs that said, "Don't burn our school" and "Let's  clean our school of useless teachers." They chanted: "We don't want Miss  Nalisnik."  </P> <P> "(Nalisnik) incited to riot," Quinones said. "She took a book of matches, and  lighted it and said this is the way you do it. We do not want that kind of  teacher to be a model to our children."  </P> <P> Nalisnik declined to comment, but Zschoche said the veteran teacher was not  urging parents to burn the school.  </P> <P> Nalisnik's statement was metaphorical, Zschoche said. "Then she took out a  single match and lit it. Rhonda was our drama teacher, and she has a flair for  the dramatic."  </P> <P> But Ernestine Mansour, a member of Gage's Shared Decision Making Council who  was at the demonstration alongside Quinones, said the teachers have not acted  in the best interests of the students and should be dismissed.  </P> <P> Mansour, a volunteer and part-time employee at Gage whose daughter attends the  school, said that Gage has its problems but that Almada has done what he could.  </P> <P> "(Almada) could do better if everybody cooperates," Mansour said. "They haven't  taken into consideration what he's done in two years. It's quite a bit."  </P> <P> Quinones said the low achievement at Gage is typical of what is happening  throughout the district at inner-city schools with large numbers of minority  students and few minority teachers. Only 19 of Gage's 145 teachers are Latinos.  </P> <P> He pointed to a 1989 district report titled "The Children Can No Longer Wait,"  which acknowledged that institutional racism prevented minority youngsters from  receiving the same quality of education as Anglo students.  </P> <P> Quinones accused the five teachers of racist acts against students. He declined  to give details, saying he feared retaliation against the alleged victims.  </P> <P> But Quinones did allege that Shapiro called students "dumb Mexicans" when they  joined the recent demonstration.  </P> <P> Shapiro denied that he made a derogatory remark to the student demonstrators.  </P> <P> The teachers' lawyer, Lawrence Trygstad, denied that his clients have  mistreated Latino pupils or contributed to the school's problems.  </P> <P> "The teachers are just concerned with the education of the students," said  Trygstad, who works for the United Teachers of Los Angeles. "They feel (Almada)  is not really being an educational leader."  </P> <P> Two district officials interviewed children, teachers and parents but found no  evidence of racism at the campus, Region Supt. Maria Casillas said.  </P> <P> Despite the recent efforts and wishes of district officials, there appears to  be little chance that peace will come soon to Gage Junior High.  </P> <P> Palos said Community in Action is considering a second, and larger, petition  drive calling for Almada to be removed.  </P> <P> And Quinones said his group plans another demonstration against the five  teachers.  </P></p>

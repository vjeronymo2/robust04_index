			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Break in the US rains: Worst may be over as some floodwaters start to recede BRIGHT sunshine and a break in the rains yesterday gave some hope that the worst might be over for the drenched farmers and townspeople of the Upper Mississippi basin. Although weather forecasters continued to warn that the chance of renewed rain had not gone away, some tributary rivers seemed to have stabilised and floodwaters began to recede in a few areas of the six-state region devastated by weeks of flooding. The federal government was also looking on the bright side. As Vice-President Al Gore flew to St Louis to inspect the flood damage, Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, suggested that the flooding might actually improve the employment outlook in the short term. 'You're going to have so many state dollars and federal dollars, so much rebuilding of the area, that a lot of people are going to have to be put to work to rebuild,' Mr Reich said. Mr Gore's visit yesterday appeared designed to head off criticism of the administration for not taking a close enough interest in the disaster areas. Although President Bill Clinton visited the region a week ago on his way to the Tokyo summit, his stopover for a holiday in Hawaii on the way back had given ammunition to those who wished to attack him. However, the river began battering an area south of St Louis after floodwaters forced thousands of people to flee the Des Moines, Iowa, area, where the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers merge in the Mississippi watershed. Officials said that about 7,000 residents had been evacuated from their homes and an estimated 300,000 people left without drinking water and an estimated 35,000 without electricity. Federal officials have declined to give an overall estimate of the cost of the flood damage, but federal disaster relief has been promised, and an emergency spending bill is expected to be required to provide the money. Even if the rains stop, it may take some time for flooding to subside, because many up- stream dams, built to provide flood containment capacity, are overflowing and will have to continue to release water. At the same time, earth and sand levees built along the riverbanks remain saturated and could continue to give way long after the floodwaters have crested. Meanwhile the heatwave that has baked areas of the US east coast eased yesterday. A storm that caused showers in the northern Rockies early yesterday was moving east, bringing hope that it would break the heat in the east by midweek. A second front, pushing down from Canada and the Great Lakes, is also expected to bring cooler weather. Philadelphia saw one of the worst death tolls from the hot spell, with 24 people declared dead of heat-related causes, raising the city's death toll to 41 by Sunday, according to Dr Robert K. Ross, the city's health commissioner.</p>

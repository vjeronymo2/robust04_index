			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS TO AGREE ON BUDGET FALTER  </P> <P> Republican and Democratic negotiators retreated from earlier positions on  spending reductions and tax increases Friday, slowing down work on an  already-overdue state budget.  </P> <P> Legislative leaders said the Assembly and Senate would work today and Sunday,  but they held out little hope that agreement could be reached before the end of  next week.  </P> <P> "We'll be here a few days," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San  Francisco) after a meeting with Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti  (D-Los Angeles) on the Senate floor.  </P> <P> Lawmakers had been scheduled to adjourn Friday for a monthlong recess. "I don't  think we can -- or should -- leave town without a budget," Brown said.  </P> <P> The lawmakers are working to produce a combination of spending reductions or  tax increases that will total $3.6 billion, which is said to be the size of the  gap that exists between available tax revenues and service requirements.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian has issued a budget that would increase spending by 7.4%  and he is holding firm against tax increases. Democrats are pressing for a  budget hike of more than 13%, arguing that soaring school enrollments, prison  inmate populations and fast-growing welfare rolls are producing more demands  for spending than the tax structure can support.  </P> <P> Although negotiations are still wide open, sources said a $729-million tax  proposal by Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno is under intense fire.  With Republicans expressing little support for Maddy's proposal or other  tax-increase measures, Democrats were pulling back from their agreements on  spending reductions.  </P> <P> Brown said lawmakers were "peeling off" various tax proposals because of  lobbying pressure put on them by various interests whose businesses or  industries would be hit by tax hikes.  </P> <P> In the face of opposition to tax increases, Roberti, the Senate leader, began  backing away from a $1.5-billion package of spending reductions he supported as  recently as Thursday.  </P> <P> Roberti said that in order to back the kind of budget reductions sought by  Deukmejian and GOP legislators, Democrats would have "to see $1 billion in  revenues (tax increases)."  </P> <P> Maddy said: "We don't think there are enough cuts, they don't think there are  enough revenues, so we are trying to work it out."  </P></p>

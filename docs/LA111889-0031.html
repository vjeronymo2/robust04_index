			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MORE 'CHICKEN SOUP'  </P> <P> I am neither Catholic nor Jewish, and I want to say that I loved Jackie Mason's  character on "Chicken Soup."  </P> <P> My word, he was always handing out sensible advice, saving the situation and  being funny at the same time! What could possibly have offended the Jewish  people?  </P> <P> Frankly, the Irish should have been offended. The program showed the Irishman  in a much less attractive light.  </P> <P> GWEN WILLSON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

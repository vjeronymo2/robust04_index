			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Surface images - Victor Pasmore Looking today at the safe and inoffensive work of Victor Pasmore, which has come to the Serpentine Gallery from the Center for International Contemporary Art in New York (Kensington Gardens W2, until May 27), one finds oneself hard put to remember quite how controversial a figure he once was. Admittedly his notoriety hardly extended beyond the interest of the British public for contemporary art, but within that little world, the stir he made around 1950 by his abandonning of figuration in favour of abstraction, was considerable. The word was passed: 'Pasmore's gone abstract', and to those very British patrons, would-be and active alike, who rather like the idea of contemporary involvement but also know quite well what they like, it was a real and desperate betrayal. It was of course nothing of the kind for, as any fairly chosen retrospective must show, that shift to abstraction was a natural and gradual development, clearly prefigured in the earlier work, most especially in the Hammersmith landscapes of 1947 and 1948. The flat schematic swirls and eddies of the later abstracted sea are already there, in the branches of the trees in the gardens, even the bolster that supports the model's back. Professor Norbert Lynton was curator of this exhibition and his choice, necessarily constrained by the size of the gallery, is as fair and comprehensive as could be. But here we come to the central problem of Pasmore and his work. If his reputation as a major figure of the post-war British avant garde is now questionable, it has undoubtedly stuck and rather to his advantage. For with that frisson of betrayal there came also a whiff of that danger and excitement by which the nervous educated British sense that an intellectual is come among them, like a fox in the chicken-run. While Pasmore's shift to abstraction was decidedly worrying, the thought that it was at least founded in some principle and system, won it a grudging and, as it has proved, a lasting respect. He must know what he is doing, so ran the argument, for why else should someone who could paint nude and landscape, lamplight and twilight, so seductively, suddenly give it all up? His subsequent career as a teacher throughout the 1950s, latterly at the School of Fine Art at what is now Newcastle University, would only confirm his standing. The art educational principles of basic form and basic design, which he developed in those years with his fellow theorists, notably Richard Hamilton, Harry Thubron and Tom Hudson, haunt us still. The trouble with Basic Form and Basic Design, which cause Pasmore and his friends argued so persuasively, is that it embraces the heresy that anyone can be an artist, if only they submit to the system, finish the project, jump through the hoop. Nothing so tiresome as studying the model through long hours in the life-room, learning to draw: to be an artist you need only think like an artist. The effective destruction of our art schools by casting aside the old system, with its essentially technical preoccupations in favour of the new, which Pasmore and others, in all sincerity of purpose, achieved in the 1960s, has been already long apparent. The sad fact is that the idea of being an artist is infinitely seductive. And Pasmore, that early reputation notwithstanding, has never enjoyed a natural facility as painter or draughtsman. At the Euston Road School just before the war he learnt the uses of seriousness and application, but in his paintings of that time, tone, form and space alike are fuzzy, unclear and unresolved, the colour little more than the conventional Euston green. And we look again at the famous nudes, with their pert turn of hip and head and provocative smear of lipstick, to find the drawing awkward, weak and unsure, the figure uncoordinate and misunderstood, a leg unrelated and unmeasured, a clumsy hand that cannot reach the knee it rests on. So to the landscapes, to trees reduced to a spidery formula, shrouded in mist that hides the sheer difficulty of setting objects together in a coherent pictorial world. His solution to his difficulty was simple, direct and as we now see, necessary. By 'going abstract' he simply accepted that for him image, form and space were to be simplified, flattened, schematised, brought to the surface: that was all he could manage, all he could do. And so he has continued, more or less, these 40 years.</p>

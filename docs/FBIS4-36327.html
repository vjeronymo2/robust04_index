			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Secretariat of the General People's </F> Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation;  date not given]    [Text] The U.S. assistant secretary of state has been  quoted expressing his country's concern over the nuclear  activities of a number of states, among which he mentioned the  Great Jamahiriyah.    The Secretariat of the General People's Committee for  Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation would like to remind the  American official of the remarks made by the Directer of the  International Atomic Energy Agency while visiting the Great  Jamahiriyah at the head of a team of the agency's experts in  January 1993 confirming what we have repeatedly announced and  affirmed about Libya's noninterest in possessing weapons of mass  destruction This prompted it to sign the nuclear  nonproliferation treaty and to participate in all conferences  seeking to ban the use or the threat to use weapons of mass  destruction.    What has been said by the assistant secretary of state  irrefutably confirms that nobody is able to believe the claims  of the United States and this therefore erodes its credibility  before the peoples of the world. Instead of warning the Great  Jamahiriyah, this official should have referred to his country's  measures against the Zionist entity which refuses to sign the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Moreover, western sources  friendly to that entity confirm its possession of nuclear  warheads. Instead of warning it, the United States is supplying  it with means to enable it to intimidate the states of the  region by the threat of using those weapons against them.    The tone of warning and intimidation is no longer useful  against the Great Jamahiriyah. American officials spare no  opportunity to include its name whenever they circulate false  and unfounded accusations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today began an  official two-day visit to Mexico amid agitation among public  workers, despite an agreement the president himself signed with  a group of government workers yesterday afternoon. The  agreement between the government and the National Federation of  Public Employees Unions, Fenasep, establishes wage increases of  between 100 and 120 quetzales through a so-called emergency  bonus program. The agreement also establishes Fenasep's  inclusion on the Wage Policy Commission -- a strategy designed  to bolster consumer protection and to make government services  more efficient.    President de Leon Carpio referred to this agreement in a  news  conference at the airport this morning, minutes before leaving  for Mexico.    [Begin De Leon recording] The government has nothing more to  discuss in light of the fact that yesterday it signed an  agreement that ends the strike, which was clearly illegal and  even criminal in nature because it did not meet the legal  requirements for declaring a strike. From this moment onward,  the government declares that the problem has ended. Perhaps the  most important point in yesterday's agreement, aside from the  actual point of contention, is the pledge by both sides to make  changes.    The agreement itself reads: The government of the Republic  promises to guarantee the enforcement of the Consumer Protection  Law. Both sides have agreed on the need to review the  government's current organizational structure to make it more  efficient and thereby offer an effective response to the needs  of the Guatemalan people. In view of Fenasep's need to  implement more consistent general policies, from this date  onward -- in other words, yesterday -- Fenasep is joining the  government team on the Wage Policy Commission. This is being  done in an effort to establish a framework that will define wage  policies on a continuous basis and not just when the need arises.    This means that the agreement that has been signed not only  resolves this problem, but from this moment onward, both sides  will sit at the negotiating table to review the state employment  structure. If through these talks we see an opportunity to  increase wages to bolster efficiency or because we encounter a  reduction in the number of state workers, we can change wage  policies at that time. This will be a result of the review  process.    We can say with satisfaction that the strike ended today,  just as the media has announced. Any further job action will be  considered illegal. Just as illegal acts were controlled  yesterday, some of which were carried out by criminals, the same  holds true today under acting President Arturo Herbruger. As of  today, all public administration should be working normally in  light of the fact that the government has accepted the emergency  bonus, whose cost can be covered without affecting the  Guatemalan people.

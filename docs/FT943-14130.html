			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Fund managers stay close to the benchmarks - Bonds / There is a broad view that government bonds, in Europe particularly, must be close to their lows, though conviction is lacking Despite some recent flickers of a revival in the fortunes of the world's bond markets, the first half of 1994 has been a bleak period for bond investors. Since the US Federal Reserve reversed its easing policy by hiking short-term interest rates on February 4, the world's bond markets have entered a bearish phase, marked by high volatility and a decline in liquidity, which have combined to create the most difficult conditions many traders and institutional investors can remember. In the UK, 10-year gilt yields had risen more than 2 1/2 points since the beginning of January, to 8.64 per cent at the end of June. Longer-dated gilts have fared even worse. While there is now a broad consensus that bond markets, at current levels, offer good value in theory, the lesson of the past six months has been that other factors can override the dictates of economic fundamentals. Although there has been sporadic talk of hedge funds moving back into bonds, the current environment does not favour large bets on the direction of the markets, due to the persistence of volatile trading conditions. Instead, most fund managers are tending to stay close to one of the benchmark government bond indices, such as J P Morgan or Salomon Brothers, and trying to improve returns by 'spread-trading' - that is, taking positions on the relative performance of two markets. However, while battle-weary fund managers and traders still lack real conviction, there is a broad view that government bonds, in Europe particularly, must be close to their lows, that the unwinding of long positions has taken its course and that it could be time to buy selectively. There is certainly a case for arguing that the sell-off in bond markets has been overdone relative to equities. Some analysts believe that high expectations on corporate earnings in the US, based on ambitious economic growth targets, may not come through. Further, the steepening of yield curves across most markets makes it increasingly unattractive for managers to stay in cash, earning short-term interest rates, for very long. 'I think we will see an appreciation of bond prices,' said Mr Rob Gambi, manager, international fixed interest and currencies at AMP Asset Management, the London-based fund management arm of the Australian insurance company. 'But yields will not suddenly fall 200 basis points, back to their lows earlier this year. It is not going to be a one-way bet.' Consequently, the predominant strategies are likely to be defensive. 'Investors will start going into core markets (such as Germany), then extending duration, and only then moving into high-yielding markets (such as Italy),' said Mr Adrian James, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets. He added that the first stage has been reached, with investors putting money into the short end of the core markets. This has already caused the differential between three-month and two-year rates in markets such as Germany to start to narrow. There has also been some improvement in the performance of core markets recently. In June, the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were the only markets in the J P Morgan government bond index to post positive returns - though all returned less than 1 per cent. 'We had quite a lot of cash until the end of March and we have been gradually putting money to work in the European bond markets, but we prefer the core markets, specifically Germany,' said Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore, the UK fund management group. 'The inflation dynamics are more favourable than elsewhere in Europe.' 'We see value in Germany over the US, particularly in the long end of the yield curve,' said Mr Gambi. 'Inflation worries have been overdone and the story on capital shortage has been overdone.' He also thinks that the gilts market has been oversold, and that the yield spread between the UK and Germany could narrow from its current level of about 175 basis points to around 120 basis points. Another attraction is the high real yields currently on offer in some markets, for example Canadian government bonds are currently offering real interest rates of about 9 per cent. At a yield spread of 200 basis points over the US, the market also offers good relative value. On the high-yielding markets, such as Spain, Italy and Sweden, investors remain rather cautious. Although they are seen as offering good value, investors have been concerned by the lack of liquidity in these markets during periods of extreme volatility.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / AT&amp;T 'ready to dig up Britain's streets' AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US telephone company, is ready to dig up Britain's streets to build its own telephone network if its application for a UK telecommunications operator's licence is granted. It said yesterday that it was prepared to spend millions of dollars on the infrastructure necessary to reach private and business customers and that no option was being ruled out. The possibilities include buying lines from BT and Mercury, strategic alliances with cable television operators with licences to offer telecommunications services, radio links to homes and business premises and laying underground cable. AT&amp;T applied on Thursday for a licence to provide communications services in the UK and between the UK and the US. Its application is direct retaliation for BT's equivalent approach to the US Federal Communications Commission last month. Sources close to both companies said yesterday reciprocal licences were likely to be granted within a year. Both the government and BT have welcomed the AT&amp;T move. The government is keen to open the UK market to competition, while BT sees it as a lever in its efforts to enter the US market. AT&amp;T plans to move into the UK market in three phases if it wins its licence. In the first it would offer international business customers the same voice and data transmission services it offers in the US. A company based in the US would be linked with UK subsidiaries by a single network. Network management and billing would be handled comprehensively by AT&amp;T. In the second phase it would add advanced services that are not marketed extensively in the UK. In the US, for example, AT&amp;T handles 135m calls a day  -40 per cent of which are generated by its 'free phone' service. Businesses pay for their customers to make toll-free calls to them, generating business worth Dollars 6bn a year to AT&amp;T. The third phase would involve extending the service to domestic customers. In the US customers pay Dollars 6 for their own free phone number on which, for example, their children can call home without charge. Mr David Haddington, director-general of the UK Telecommunications Managers Association, welcomed the prospect of a new competitor in the UK market prepared to invest heavily in the telecommunications infrastructure. Both quality of service and prices would benefit. He was concerned, however, that to boost cash flow AT&amp;T would concentrate in the first instance on 'cherry picking' the more lucrative business services, upsetting the delicate balance between BT and its smaller rival Mercury. He said the emergence of global superplayers such as AT&amp;T and BT would benefit business, leading to: Harmonised global numbering schemes, where customers would 'own' their telephone numbers and so be free of interference and manipulation by the telephone operators. Harmonised tariff structures. Mr Haddington said he did not expect uniform pricing, but he did believe telephone calls between subscribers should cost the same regardless of which of them initiated the call. Harmonised standards for inteconnection between different telecommunications systems to create a seamless global network. BT plans to offer similar services in the US if granted a licence, through its 'international virtual network' service - codenamed Cyclone - expected to start this autumn with switching in London, New York, Sydney and Frankfurt. The key issue remains terms on which reciprocal licences will be granted. AT&amp;T is determined that it should not have to negotiate with BT over access to the UK company's network. In the US terms for access are published and standard. There are signs that BT finds the prospect of competing in the US market sufficiently enticing to soften its stance on the price of access to its network. About 40 per cent of the world's multinational companies have their headquarters in the US and would be potential customers for Cyclone.</p>

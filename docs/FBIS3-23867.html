			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Shipunova: "Lefortovo Passions"] </F>   [Text] The State Duma amnesty decision has eclipsed all  other events in the political life of Russia, including the  president's long-awaited state of the union address to the  parliament. It is, of course, being mentioned, but more out of  politeness, while all attention is on the main event--the  freeing of the October "mutineers." The reaction to this event  is panic, of the kind seen in the American action movie "The  Russians Are Coming." Before the Lefortovo prisoners even got  home our watchful television began to warn the population of the  threat of civil war every couple of hours on all the channels.    In reality the threat is different. Imagine for a moment  that  the person who walked out of Lefortovo gate Saturday night is...  a future president of Russia. This immediately explains the  panic on television (the cat knows whose meat he has stolen),  Kostikov's hysterical statements, and some bureaucrats' feverish  attempts to "put things in reverse gear"--through an immediate  ban on political activities.    Note: The amnesty also covered GKChP [State Committee on the  State of Emergency] members, but somehow nobody remembers that.  Which means that it is not because "principle prevailed" (in  this instance the principle of inevitable punishment)--it is  about concrete individuals. The elderly "putschists" of 1991,  their health already undermined, no longer represent a real  danger. The young, full of vitality and energy, "mutineers" of  1993 are a completely different matter, and one of them is  especially dangerous. Had they all been released, while this one  remained behind bars, there probably would be less clamor and  fear in presidential and television circles.    The "magnificent seven" who have been released represent a  threat, of course, but not to society, to ordinary people--they  are a threat to the authorities, to their--nor our--safety. They  will not rush, as soon as they have a quick cup of tea with the  family, to rouse people to storm the Kremlin; when the time  comes they will run in elections. And these elections for some  are worse than an assault--an assault can be repelled; after the  elections, whether one likes it or not, it will be time to say  goodbye to Kremlin accommodations.    By the time this amnesty happened--so unexpectedly for  everyone--a certain equilibrium had established itself in  Russian political circles, a sort of "calm before the storm."  The president is well and alive (suffering, perhaps, from a mild  cold), and all the current political forces, without paying  particular attention to him, began to quietly, surreptitiously  prepare for the next presidential elections. Everybody suddenly  remembered about party organizational development and urgently  got busy creating new parties and strengthening existing ones.  Everybody suddenly became concerned about their own image, and  the press is doing its best to help them. ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, for  instance, reminds us through the mouth of a Moscow University  psychologist: "You need to find the right smile, gestures,  stance, facial expressions...."    The political leadership in Russia currently is experiencing  a crisis stemming from the fact that the old leaders have  practically outlived their utility while the new ones--their  replacements--have not yet shown themselves to the full extent.  By inertia Yeltsin is still recognized as an all-Russia leader,  but his political useful life is largely exhausted. He has  already destroyed everything he could, and there is no "work" of  this sort left for him to do in the country. At this point there  is no new national leader in Russia. He may not appear in an  environment where the nation is split, stratified; a man whom  some love and others hate, and vice versa. We can only talk of  recognition of some or other leader by a relative majority of  society.    Such leaders come forward, however, not on a wave from the  grassroots, from the people, but from the top--from parties,  state and social structures; the base of such advancements are  often the unrestrained personal ambitions of some or other  individual, who uses a favorable historic moment for  self-assertion. Troubled times in Russia have always produced a  large number of pretenders, and our time is no exception.    So far the disposition of forces on the political scene is  rather simple. On one side of the spectrum are parties and  movements set up by former members of the president's inner  circle; on the other--by his political opponents; he himself is  in the middle, practically alone. None of his former  confederates is there with him--neither the early Burbulis, nor  the late Gaydar, nor the eternal Poltoranin; even his pet  Shumeyko now keeps his distance. Some new people, whose names  evoke no recognition, currently "advise" and "help" the  president, interpret his statements, or sometimes speak for him.  All those who were earlier in the orbit of the powerful figure  of B.N. Yeltsin have now gained political independence as  parliament members, leaders of parties and blocs, and heads of  centers and foundations, and do not want to leave the political  scene with him, and are therefore increasingly distancing  themselves from him. Closer to the elections they will make him,  pardon me, a "scapegoat" and sacrifice him many times over in  the election battle for the president's job.    All the leaders of the democratic wing are strong insofar  they have access to administrative levers and can actively use  them to achieve personal political goals--as, for instance,  Gaydar did in organizing the Russia's Choice bloc or Shakhray in  setting up his PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]. Had  they not been deputy prime ministers in the government at the  time, it is unlikely they would have managed to accomplish this  as fast and easily.    Still, the democratic movement has been unable to produce a  political figure of Yeltsin's dimensions, and now it is unlikely  that it will. Betting on Gaydar is a loss. Not only is his  appearance a negative factor; most importantly, his idea has  already discredited itself in the eyes of society, as well as  his orientation toward the West.    The leadership situation is different on the other end of  the  political spectrum. Several charismatic figures have appeared  here lately, with a great range of abilities both in terms of  theoretical activities (Zyuganov, Baburin) and organizational  work among the popular masses (Anpilov, Konstantinov, Terekhov).  Zhirinovskiy holds a place of his own--undoubtedly a born  political leader, but a loner. Leaders of this wing have no  levers, no opportunity to use state channels and mass media to  organize their supporters; on the contrary, for quite a while  now all of them have been operating in a mode of bitter  confrontation with the authorities. Nevertheless, behind these  leaders today are far greater groups of the population, ordinary  people, including in the regions, than behind the dwarf capital  city parties of democrats. The explanation is the popular,  patriotic idea that is close and understandable to people.    We have to admit, however, that neither does the patriotic  opposition have a single leader today; there is no large-scale  personality sufficiently popular among the people beyond the  boundaries of one party. Aleksandr Rutskoy probably could become  such a leader in a new environment. This is what politicians and  journalists scared by the amnesty have in mind; it is this  prospect they suspect when they say that a principally new  political situation is now emerging in Russia. They are afraid  of this situation.    Can Rutskoy, after all that has happened to him, win the  presidential elections? If we take as an indicator the  experience of the recent past--yes, he can. The precedent was  set by none other than Yeltsin himself in 1991. Compare: Like  Boris Nikolayevich, Rutskoy was a member of the top national  leadership when he started an open confrontation with it; just  as Yeltsin in his time began a fight against party privileges,  Rutskoy practically alone took a stand against corruption; just  like Boris Nikolayevich, he sacrificed his career as a result  and was subjected to persecution and massive discreditation by  the press, which earned him--again, like it did for Yeltsin in  1990-1991--popularity among the people. As you can see, it all  falls into place. But Rutskoy also has perceptible advantages:  He is younger, stronger, and behind him is not a party  nomenklatura past but the truly tragic biography of a warrior.  Being held prisoner in Afghanistan and Lefortovo is not the same  as falling off the bridge.    Rutskoy's image among the voters is that of a hero, a  fighter, a person who has suffered for the people--precisely  what is capable today of eliciting empathy and trust.    I do not idealize him--if for no other reason than because  no  politician is worth idealizing. Rutskoy has his weaknesses and  vulnerabilities. Of course, he is not all that knowledgeable in  economics and management, but neither is Yeltsin, as it turned  out, knowledgeable about these things at all. He is too  hotheaded, hot-tempered, too straightforward and gullible--in  short, he is too unsophisticated for such a job state job. But  life teaches us a lot of things, and the months spent in prison  should have taught their lessons. Both he and the other  Lefortovo prisoners had enough time to think everything through,  gain an insight into everything--in a way to look into the  mirror of life and politics, see both oneself and others in it,  and understand where they were right and where they were wrong,  and how they appeared in the eyes of their supporters and  opponents, in the eyes of the people. People are not born  political leaders--they become such in the process of struggle.  Sometimes defeat is more useful for personal development than  victory, and prison is of course not the best but, who knows,  perhaps not the worst place for an individual to mature  politically.    The future that emerges with Rutskoy's return to politics  can  easily be figured out, which, of course, is exactly what has  already been done. Therefore we should expect in the near future  the most undemocratic--to the point of human rights  violations--actions on the part of the executive branch aimed at  neutralizing Rutskoy, eliminating him from the "game." It is not  accidental that a likely prospective general procurator is one  of the people who just recently followed Rutskoy's "Swiss  trail..."    So, what has really changed in Russia with the announcement  of the political amnesty? The state Duma for the first time made  a claim to being a serious entity, which undoubtedly strengthens  its authority as a body of representative power. The opposition  got powerful reinforcement and possibly will gain a strong  leader. The president's positions have become even more shaky,  while his attempts to punish "the guilty" will only finally  undermine his authority in society. Democrats are being pushed  into the background; their chances for success in the upcoming  presidential elections are declining sharply.    As to the "civil war"--"civil accord" dichotomy, there  probably will be neither. The opposition has learned from bitter  experience and will not allow new clashes, while reconciliation  with the regime in this situation is impossible. Which leaves  only one way open--to work through the parliament and prepare  for new elections.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Major to re-assert authority over rebels MR JOHN MAJOR will this week seek to re-assert his authority over Tory Euro-rebels after the disclosure of a meeting between two senior rightwing ministers and Baroness Thatcher. Tory party officials were at pains to point out that Maastricht had not been discussed at the lunch last Thursday attended by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary. They also underlined that both cabinet ministers had consistently voted for the Maastricht bill in its passage through the Commons. While the meeting with Lady Thatcher is a sign of the confidence of the Tory right wing, no one at Westminster seriously expects a ministerial exodus over Maastricht. Instead, the most sensitive issue is the government's attitude towards the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major has said that the UK will not rejoin the mechanism this year, but some right-wing ministers are letting it be known that there should be no question of rejoining during the lifetime of this parliament. Although Downing Street was relaxed about the lunch - also attended by Lord Tebbit, a leading Euro-sceptic, and Sir Alan Walters, formerly Lady Thatcher's economic adviser - its timing is particularly awkward. A week ago ministers faced renewed embarrassment over the bill but fought back with a display by loyalist MPs at a private meeting of Tory backbench MPs on Thursday aimed at putting the Euro-sceptics on the defensive. Today Mr Major will discuss the handling of the Maastricht legislation with Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, and other business managers. The bill returns to the Commons on Thursday and ministers are keen that it regains some of the momentum it has lost recently. Mr Major will also discuss today with Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, his speech at the Tory central council on Saturday. The prime minister intends to use the speech to set out more fully the renewed Tory emphasis on crime and press home the causes for economic optimism. The gathering of constituency officers will also give party managers an opportunity to exert pressure on some dissident Tory MPs through their local party associations.</p>

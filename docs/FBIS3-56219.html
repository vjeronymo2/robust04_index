According to the Belorusian leader, although affected by the  Chernobyl catastrophe and floods more than others through no  fault of its own, the republic did not attach prime importance  to humanitarian aid in the past, either. In the opinion of the  head of Belorusian parliament, the state's foreign economic  policy should aim not at "patching up holes but at a search for  ways of proper economic cooperation with foreign partners and,  first of all, with the United States", something to be discussed  during Bill Clinton's visit.    Shushkevich noted that the Belorusian side had drawn up  concrete proposals to be discussed with the American side. It  is not ruled out that conversation will touch upon the United  States' assistance in implementing measures linked to the  withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Belarus.    As regards the Belorusian side's other proposals, he  believed  that it was too early to announce them prior to the meeting with  Bill Clinton.    Answering a question about why the program for the U.S.  delegation's stay in the Republic of Belarus included separate  meetings with the head of parliament and the head of executive  authority, Shushkevich noted that this was in no way connected  with different positions upheld by legislative and executive  authorities. "Since the U.S. President is the head of supreme  executive authority and has great powers in legislative  activity, both sides have agreed to hold two separate meetings,  with the chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the chairman of the  Council of Ministers," Shushkevich said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on implementation of Hebei's 1993 economic and </F> social development plan and its 1994 draft plan delivered by  Gong Huanwen, director of the Hebei Provincial Planning  Commission, at the second session of the eighth provincial  people's congress on 25 February]    [Excerpt] Fellow deputies: Entrusted by the provincial  people's government, I now give a report on Hebei's  implementation of its 1993 economic and social development plan  and its 1994 draft plan to this session for discussions by  deputies and for opinions from members of the provincial  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference and other delegates attending as observers.  <H5>  1. Implementation of the 1993 Plan </H5>   Thanks to the guidance of the guidelines of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's important speeches and the 14th party congress and  the correct leadership of the provincial party committee, the  people throughout the province, firmly focusing on the goal of  building an economically strong province, seized the  opportunity, deepened reform, accelerated development, and  continued the rapid development trend in the economy in 1993  after the rapid growth in 1992. Our gross domestic product  registered a 16.5-percent increase over the preceding year and  an increase of 4.5 percentage points over the target, marking  the largest annual growth since the beginning of reform and  opening up. Science and technology, education, and various  social undertakings also made new headway, and most of the  targets in these areas as defined at the first session of the  eighth provincial people's congress were fulfilled or  overfulfilled.    A. The rural economy developed steadily and township  enterprises grew fairly rapidly. Hebei encountered serious  drought last year, but peasants' enthusiasm was further  stimulated thanks to the series of policies and measures  preferential to agriculture adopted by the provincial party  committee and government to reduce peasants' burdens and ensure  the supplies of funds for agricultural use. Grain output totaled  23.802 million tons, equivalent to 105.8 percent of the target  and also a new record; cotton output totaled 192,000 tons, down  by 37.1 percent from the preceding year and equivalent to 42.8  percent of the target; and the output of oil- bearing crops  totaled 805,000 tons, up 21.4 percent from the preceding year  and equivalent to 107.3 percent of the target. Forestry, animal  husbandry, and sideline production registered fairly rapid  growth, but production of fisheries declined. The annual added  value of agriculture was 29.5 billion yuan, up 3.5 percent.  Township enterprises developed rapidly. Their annual output  value totaled 171 billion yuan, up 65.5 percent; profits 20.1  billion yuan, up 59.8 percent; and taxes paid to the state 3.4  billion yuan, up 37.7 percent. Township enterprises not only  constituted an important pillar of the rural economy, but they  also became new growing points of the rapid economic development.    B. Industrial production grew rapidly, and economic  efficiency continued to improve. Despite the "bottleneck"  restrictions imposed by funds, energy resources, and  transportation, a rapid increase was achieved in industrial  production. Hebei's industrial output value was 260 billion  yuan, up 29.4 percent. Of the total, the output value of the  enterprises at and above the township level was 162.51 billion  yuan, up 17.8 percent. The output of most major products  reached or exceeded the planned targets. Electricity output was  48.37 billion kw hours, equivalent to 99.1 percent of the  target; raw coal output 60.524 million tonnes, 97.6 percent of  the target; pig iron output 8.14 million tonnes, 115.5 percent  of the target; rolled steel output 4.915 million tonnes, 114  percent of the target; cement output 22.28 million tonnes, 106  percent of the target; cotton yarn output 384,000 tonnes, 118.7  percent of the target; and cigarette output 1.181 million  crates, 101 percent of the target. While production developed,  economic efficiency continued to improve. The general index of  the economic efficiency of Hebei's industrial enterprises at and  above the township level that exercised independent accounting  reached 94.9 percent, up 10.4 percentage points from the  preceding year; their profits and taxes 16.34 billion yuan, up  47.1 percent; their profit-tax rate of funds rose from 8.57  percent in the preceding year to 9.94 percent; and the net value  of their fixed assets grew by 24.6 percent. In this way, the  targets of "three increases and one rise in ranking" as defined  earlier last year were attained.    C. Increase in fixed asset investment gained momentum and  construction of key projects was intensified. Fixed asset  investment made by the entire society in the year was 54 billion  yuan, showing a 60.8-percent increase and equivalent to 142.1  percent of the target. Of the total, 31.03 billion yuan was  invested by state-owned units, up 54.8 percent. In the  investment made by state-owned units, 11.35 billion yuan was  invested in local capital construction, up 83.1 percent; and  7.51 billion yuan was invested in technical transformation, up  36.6 percent. Construction of key projects throughout the  province proceeded fairly rapidly thanks to the attention given  by governments at all levels and the support given by monetary  departments. By the end of the year, 9.7 billion yuan was  invested in the 149 continued and new key projects in the  province, equivalent to 103.3 percent of the annual target.  Forty-one projects, including the no. 1 generating unit of the  Xibaipo power plant, were completed and commissioned to increase  production capacity. Investment in the 82 projects that should  be ensured as required by the provincial government exceeded the  annual target by 2.2 percent. Meanwhile, breakthroughs were  achieved in the early-stage work for the large projects that had  a bearing on the overall economic situation of Hebei, such as  the middle-section construction of the project to divert water  from south to north, the Huanghua Port construction, and the  Shuoxian-Huanghua Railway construction.    D. The areas where foreign investment was used increased,  the  scope of foreign investment was expanded, and the stagnant  situation in exports was changed. Throughout the province,  1,879 foreign- funded enterprises of the three types were newly  registered, and their registered foreign capital totaled $1.19  billion, up 44.4 and 27.96 percent, respectively, from the  preceding year and new records both; and 500 foreign-funded  enterprises of the three types were newly built, thus attaining  the target defined earlier last year. The actual amount of  foreign capital Hebei used totaled $480 million, an increase of  68.6 percent over the preceding year and equivalent to 160  percent of the target. Of the total, $360 million were direct  foreign investment, up 100 percent. Last year, the three types  of foreign-funded enterprises in the province created 6.7  billion yuan in output value, earned $170 million through  exports, and paid 210 million yuan of taxes, up 158, 137.2, and  160 percent, respectively, from the preceding year. Foreign  trade increased fairly rapidly. Hebei's imports and exports  totaled $2.35 billion, up 10.9 percent. Its exports totaled  $1.99 billion, increasing by 11.4 percent and equivalent to  106.2 percent of the target; of which exports through ordinary  trade and exports by the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises totaled $1.59 billion, increasing by 12.9 percent  and equivalent to 103.4 percent of the target.    E. Construction of markets was further intensified and the  scope of commodity distribution was continuously expanded.  Hebei's investment in the construction of the markets for  consumer goods neared 1.3 billion yuan, up 30 percent from the  preceding year. Markets for means of production totaled 304 in  the province, and their annual transactions 13.6 billion yuan.  Nearly 2,000 markets for labor forces and employment agencies  at various levels were built, and markets for personnel were  built in the 12 cities and prefectures in the province.  Securities exchange agencies totaled 275 in the province, and  the markets for technology and information also became more and  more vigorous. The scope of commodity distribution was  continuously expanded thanks to economic development and the  cultivation of the market system. The annual commodity retail  sales totaled 57.7 billion yuan, up 16.1 percent from the  preceding year. The general level of retail prices rose by 10.5  percent over the preceding year and was 2 percentage points  lower than the national average.    F. The financial situation improved and revenues increased  substantially. The financial order was rather chaotic in the  first half of 1993. After July, monetary departments at all  levels conscientiously implemented the correct central policy of  strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control  and actively adopted effective measures to gradually improve the  financial order. By the end of 1993, the savings deposits of  the monetary institutions in the province totaled 140.6 billion  yuan, an increase of 24.48 billion yuan over the figure  registered at the beginning of the year; and their loans totaled  146.12 billion yuan, an increase of 25.22 billion yuan, thus  effectively supporting production and construction. Notable  results were achieved in financial and tax work. The annual  revenue totaled 14.39 billion yuan, increasing by 44.4 percent  from the preceding year and equivalent to 132.2 percent of the  budget. Financial balance was by and large achieved.    Science and technology, education, and other social  undertakings were further developed, and the standard of living  was improved. In 1993, Hebei achieved positive results in its  "scientific and technological advance year" activities.  Scientific and technological achievements registered with the  province and ministries totaled 1,082, of which 33 were new in  the world, 155 were advanced in the world, 475 were new in the  country, and 379 were advanced in the country. Fifty advanced  and applicable scientific and technological achievements were  disseminated, and eight permanent technology markets at the  provincial and city levels were built, thus attaining the  targets defined earlier last year fairly successfully.  Education developed fairly rapidly. Ordinary institutes of  higher learning enrolled 38,400 students (including 4,900  students of institutes for adult education), up 39.2 percent  from the preceding year; and secondary specialized schools  enrolled 75,000 students, up 57.6 percent. The increase  resulted mainly from recruitment of self-funded students and  students to be trained on the entrustment of some organizations.  Hebei's natural population growth was 9.17 per thousand, which  was 3.53 per millage points lower than our planned target of  12.9 per thousand. Cultural undertakings were made flourish,  and urban and rural sanitation work was strengthened. Sports,  radio and television broadcasting, press, publication, archives,  tourism, and environmental protection all made new headway.    The living standard further improved on the basis of  developed economy. Hebei's total wage was 20.27 billion yuan,  up 20.4 percent; and the per capita cash income of staff members  and workers was 2,945 yuan, up 18.5 percent. Peasants' per  capita net income was 803.8 yuan, up 17.8 percent.    On the whole, Hebei scored great achievements in the economy  and various social undertakings. However, as our systems and  mechanisms were in the process of transition, there were still  many contradictions and problems in our economic activities.    First, the foundation for agriculture was weak, and capacity  for sustained development was lacking. After the rather large  decrease in cotton production in 1992, 1993 saw another large  decrease, with the output equivalent to about one-third of that  of normal years. The comparable efficiency of cotton and other  crops was rather low, and peasants' income increased slowly.  This restricted the increase in agricultural investment to a  certain extent and affected the capacity for sustained  development.    Second, structural adjustment proceeded slowly, and overall  industrial quality was rather low. In 1993, Hebei's rapid  increase in heavy industry resulted chiefly from the increase in  fixed asset investment, and the proportions of finely processed  goods and goods with high added value were not high. Light  industrial production grew by 12.3 percent, which was 9  percentage points lower than the growth in heavy industry and 10  percentage points lower than the national average. Hebei's  improvement in the industrial economic efficiency was attributed  to the price rises in the raw materials in metallurgical  industry and building materials industry and the increase in  their quantity, and merely a very small part of it was  attributed to management and technological advance.    Third, contradiction between the supply and demand in funds,  electricity, and means of transportation was conspicuous, and  the "bottleneck" restrictions still existed. Contradictions,  such as fund shortages, strained railway cargo transportation,  and shortages of electricity supply, remained conspicuous due to  the rapid economic growth and the increase in investment.  Despite the series of measures for strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control adopted by the state, it would take time  to alleviate these contradictions once and for all, and some  enterprises still had difficulties.    Fourth, our level in opening to the outside world and  reliance on foreign trade in economic development remained low.  Hebei made notable progress in opening to the outside world in  1993. Compared with advanced provinces and the requirement for  building an economically strong province, however, we still  lagged far behind. Major manifestations were the small amount of  foreign capital we had used and the small number of the  foreign-funded enterprises of the three types we had  established, especially the small number of large projects; and  the low percentage, merely about 13 percent, of our imports and  exports in GNP, which was very incompatible with our status as a  coastal province.    We should pay attention to and address the above-mentioned  problems in the new year.    2. The Guiding Thought for Arranging the 1994 Plan  and the Targets of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control    The year 1994 is an important year for China to continue the  good economic development trend and also a decisive year for  Hebei to implement the "outlines of development,"  comprehensively fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan, and attain  the second 100-percent-increase target. In line with the  guiding principles and arrangements of the state and the  province for economic work, the guiding thought for arranging  Hebei's 1994 plan is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide,  conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee, accelerate  establishment of the socialist market economy system to meet the  requirement for seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and  maintaining stability, continue to strengthen and improve  macroeconomic regulation and control, realistically intensify  construction of basic industries and infrastructural facilities,  greatly develop the high-yield, good-quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture and the nonstate sectors of the  economy, intensify the technical transformation of old  enterprises, restructure the economy, improve economic  efficiency, and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development and comprehensive social progress.    In compliance with this guiding thought, we have paid  attention to the following points when arranging this year's  plan.    --Only development is the essential criterion. All projects  that can be accelerated will be as long as conditions permit and  there is a good market and good efficiency so that the gap  between Hebei and advanced provinces can be narrowed. We will  both do our best and act according to our capacity, never  competing unrealistically.    --Promote development by deepening reform. The modern  enterprise system will be established, deep-seated  contradictions in economic activities resolved, and the  financial and tax, monetary, foreign trade, foreign exchange,  planning, investment, and money lending systems reformed in  compliance with the target and requirement of establishing the  socialist market economy system and with a focus on transforming  the operating mechanism of enterprises to invigorate large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, so that the systems will  develop internal impetus to promote sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development.    --Implement the strategy of promotion through the  export-oriented economy. All trades and professions and all  localities should add impetus to the endeavor of opening to the  outside world, give attention to and develop foreign investment,  foreign trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously,  and strive for a new level this year.    --Regard optimizing structure, strengthening management, and  improving efficiency as priorities in economic development.  Based on the existing foundation, we will accelerate the  technical transformation of the existing enterprises through  scientific and technological advance. We will strengthen  enterprise management and fully tap their potential to achieve  better efficiency through better management. Guided by market  demand, we will greatly adjust and improve the product mix and  the industrial composition.    --Achieve a basic balance between total demand and total  supply. We will both make active efforts to achieve dynamic  equilibrium and proceed from reality to consider objective  possibility. We will both fully develop the potential of  resources to facilitate rapid economic growth and prevent large  fluctuation in the economy and notable inflation.    --Develop economic construction and social undertakings in a  coordinated manner and promote social stability. On the basis  of a developed economy, we will continuously improve people's  living standards and quality of life and make particular efforts  to increase peasants' income. Meanwhile, we will strictly  control population growth, strengthen environmental protection,  develop the two civilizations simultaneously, and greatly  promote the socialist spiritual civilization.    Based on the above-mentioned guiding thought and  principles, the major targets of the 1994 economic and social  development plan are as follows:    A. Economic growth rate: GNP growth of more than 11 percent,  which, translated, will be a 4-percent increase in primary  industry, an increase of over 14 percent in secondary industry  (a 12-percent increase in industries at and above the township  level), and an increase of over 14-percent in tertiary industry.    B. Output of major products: Grain output will be 23 million  to 23.5 million tonnes, cotton output 350,000 to 500,000 tonnes,  output of oil-bearing crops 800,000 tonnes, raw coal output 60  million to 63.4 million tonnes, electricity output 53.8 billion  kilowatt hours, rolled steel output 5 million tonnes, pig iron  output 8.5 million tonnes, and cement output 23 million tonnes.    C. Fixed asset investment: Investment in fixed assets made  by the entire society totals 61 billion yuan, up 13 percent from  the preceding year. Of the total, 34.9 billion yuan, an  increase of 12.5 percent, will be investment by state-owned  units, and the investment rate will be 32 percent.    D. Revenue and banking: Calculated according to the new  revenue- sharing system, local revenue is budgeted at 8.03  billion yuan, up 7.9 percent from the preceding year. Savings  deposits of banks increase by 17 billion yuan, up 17 percent;  and their loans increase by 22 billion yuan, up 20.9 percent.    E. Foreign economic relations and trade: The actual amount  of foreign capital used will be $600 million, up 25 percent from  the preceding year. Exports total $2.16 billion, up 8.5  percent; of which exports through ordinary trade and exports by  the three types of foreign-funded enterprises will be $1.83  billion, up 15 percent.    F. Commodity distribution and prices: Commodity retail sales  total 67 billion yuan, up 16 percent from the preceding year;  and the increase in the general index of retail prices is kept  within 10 percent.    G. Scientific and technological advance: We will undertake  140 key scientific research projects, tackle 40 major scientific  and technical difficulties, study and develop 100 new  technologies at and above the advanced level of the province,  and disseminate 50 key scientific and technological achievements.    H. Social development and living standard: Ordinary  institutes of higher learning will recruit 36,000 students,  ordinary secondary specialized schools will recruit 75,000  students, and the natural population growth will be kept within  12 per thousand. Total wage of staff members and workers of the  province will be 24.57 billion yuan, up 21.2 percent from the  preceding year; and efforts will be exerted to make peasants'  per capita net income 900 yuan, up 12 percent.    The above-mentioned targets have been arranged after  calculation and comprehensive balancing, and they are positive  and reliable while leaving some leeway as we have considered  both the tasks assigned Hebei by the state and the requirements  of the "Hebei's outlines of economic development" which were  approved at the first session of the eighth provincial people's  congress and because we have not only considered the favorable  conditions of various fields, but also analyzed the restricting  factors of various fields. In line with the requirements of the  "Hebei's outlines of economic development," we should ensure a  500-percent increase and strive for a 700-percent increase in  Hebei's GNP by the end of this century, raise Hebei's rankings  in the country in terms of the major indicators of the economy,  and turn Hebei into an economically strong province. Judging  from the practice in the first three years of the 1990's, the  500-percent increase in GNP can be achieved as long as it  increases by 9 percent every year in the next seven years, but  an average annual increase of 13.2 percent should be maintained  if we are to achieve the 700-percent increase. For this reason,  this year's GNP increase is planned at over 11 percent. In the  process of implementation, we will strive for a higher increase  and still better results in fulfilling other targets. [passage  omitted]</p>

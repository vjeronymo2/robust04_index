			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (7): 'Interpretation of neutrality' - Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, interviewed by Ian Rodger QUESTION: A year ago, you said the European Community was not to be criticised too much for its clumsiness in responding to the Yugoslav crisis. Do you still feel that way? Answer: It is still true that the instruments embedded in the Treaty of Rome and other regulations were not meant to cope with a crisis like that in Yugoslavia. But I also think that the will to end the shooting there has turned out to be rather underdeveloped. Q: You have favoured applying economic sanctions against Serbia. Do you still think they can work? A: One cannot give a very strong report about the working of sanctions so far. There has been some debate about our sending customs officers on a voluntary basis to one or two countries bordering Serbia. In the meantime, the security council of the UN came to the conclusion that there should be military assistance accompanying the humanitarian assistance, and I think this is a method which should be adopted. Q: How do you feel western Europe has handled the Yugslavian refugee crisis? A All west European countries in one way or another have their hands full dealing with large increases in international migration. Perhaps other western Europeans showed too little readiness to accept that there is an extraordinary situation in Bosnia, and that actually a large number of individuals either had to leave their homes because of the shooting or were forced out by those who thought that 'ethnic cleansing' could be achieved. Q: How worried are you about a deterioration in stability in eastern Europe if western Europeans do not substantially increase their aid? A: I see a very close connection between economic developments and political developments in eastern European countries. They need western help in developing their economies. On their own, they will not be able to reach success. I disagree with those who advocate a wait and see attitude, recommending to east Europeans that they should first develop market economies and then there will be cooperation. They will not be able to develop any kind of free market system without western assistance. I also think that western economic cooperation will have to serve as one of the main elements to develop political stability in these countries. Western European peace and stability could themselves be jeopardised if destablisation develops more in eastern Europe. We see a lot of indicators of destabilisation there. Q: How important is the outcome of the debate over the Maastricht treaty for Austria? A: It has quite some significance. It has become a fashion in Europe to be more critical towards the EC than a couple of years ago. Fashions never develop by themselves, they need creators. So I think that the discussions within a number of Community member countries in which people are being more critical towards the EC, and especially towards Maastricht, influences the psychology here. People here keep saying that if even Community members are doubtful, why should we be so positive? Q: How do you feel about Maastricht? A: The next steps in European integration - namely, arriving at political union and monetary union - are necessary in order to strengthen the idea of Europe of the future. It is very odd that on the one hand people wish Europe to be a strong power and to have a stronger capacity to intervene in, say, Yugoslavia, and on the other hand they are against the Maastricht treaty. Q: If ratification is delayed, will it have an impact on Austria's application to join the EC? A: We have been told that we should prepare for a delay in our entry negotiations if Maastrict is not ratified. In this event, we would try everything to convince the EC people that they should enter into negotiations with us anyhow. Q: Is Austria's neutrality an obstacle to entry? A: I have advocated a modern interpretation of neutrality. We cannot and will not base our foreign policy on a framework that existed in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. We will commit to full cooperation on the basis of the Maastricht treaty, but this is not a contradiction in principle to the status of neutrality. Q: The election of Mr Thomas Klestil, a conservative, as president, has made people wonder if the coalition between your party and the conservative Austrian People's party will last through until the next election in 1994. A The presidential election was certainly a setback for my party, but I do not think it was more than just that. And there is no reason whatsoever to end the present government coalition prematurely, especially when you consider that Mr Haider's party (Mr Jorg Haider is leader of the radical liberal Freedom Party of Austria) is becoming more and more unpredictable on European integration and in dealing with right wing views and opinions. It also seems that Haider's influence on the party is no longer the only one deciding the party's general view. Q: There is talk of a People's Party-Freedom Party coalition. A: I do not see a real chance of changes in the political landscape. Of course democracy - fortunately so - can be a very dynamic phenomenon, but I think the next moment to get a more precise picture of the Austrian political scene will be the election in 1994. Q: Opposition parties complain that you are dragging your feet on privatisation. A: There are some people here who always label themselves as free marketeers and free enterprise people, and at the same time they wish to push the finance minister into selling shares at a time at which the stock exchange is at an historic low. The finance minister would be criticised if he sold shares at a time when he would not get a good price. There is also the question of the difficulties of Austrian Industries. What kind of dividend expectation could you offer to a potential investor in selling equity of a company that would not get out of the red for the forseeable future?</p>

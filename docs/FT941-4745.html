			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Mexico rates up as peso weakens Mexico's interest rates rose for the second consecutive week yesterday after further volatility in the peso/dollar exchange rate. Rates on short-term government paper rose to 9.3 per cent, an increase of 29 basis points from last week. The rise in rates came as the 48-hour peso/dollar buy rate at one point weakened to 3.30 yesterday morning, although it strengthened to 3.2750 at noon. The peso has lost some 5 per cent in a month, and has been close to its central bank limit of 3.357. Currency traders blame the peso's weakness on low economic growth, mounting political uncertainty in Mexico, and higher interest rates in the US. The low growth has encouraged the government - until the last two weeks - to push interest rates down quickly. The government's revised figures show growth fell 0.8 per cent in the third quarter last year, and 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. But as US interest rates have risen, the spread between Mexican and US returns reached historic lows. This has sharply cut the attraction of Mexican government paper to foreign investors, according to Mr Joge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs, the private US investment bank. Other investors blame the weak currency on the uncertain political landscape, especially the rumoured presidential ambitions of Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to the troubled southern state of Chiapas. 'If Camacho registers then there will be so much uncertainty that the exchange rate may not hold within its band,' said a leading money market trader in Mexico City. A number of opposition political parties could replace their existing presidential candidate with Mr Camacho up to a month before August's election. Aides to Mr Camacho make it clear he has not ruled out running for the presidency. His eventual decision may depend on support for Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the candidate of the governing party, in opinion polls.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ALPHA LEAGUE  </P> <P> Western Christian 14, L.A. Baptist 7 -- A 70-yard drive and L. A. Baptist's  chances for an automatic playoff bid ended when tailback Colyn Van Buren's pass  was intercepted by Terry Noice at Western Christian's two-yard line with a  minute to play.  </P> <P> Playing for second place at Monroe High, Western Christian (5-5, 4-1) took an  early lead as Jix Cortes scored on first-quarter runs of 39 and two yards.  Cortes finished with 116 yards in 19 carries.  </P> <P> L. A. Baptist (7-3, 3-2) broke into Lancer territory only once in the first  half, but a Chris Robinson pass was intercepted by Noice, ending its only  threat. Midway through the third quarter, Dinari Williams' fumble was recovered  by L. A. Baptist's Jeff Hampsten at the Lancers' 21-yard line. Six plays later,  Van Buren ran one yard for a score.  </P> <P> L. A. Baptist had the ball on its two-yard line after a Lancer punt, then an  18-yard run by Dan Stepper and three consecutive completions by Robinson,  including two for 51 yards to Kurt Rayners, put the ball on the Lancers' 28  before Van Buren's interception.

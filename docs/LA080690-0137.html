			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DICKERSON EATS WORDS, ENDS HOLDOUT;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: THE RUNNING BACK, WHO HAD VOWED NEVER TO PLAY FOR THE COLTS AGAIN,  REPORTS TO INDIANAPOLIS.  </P> <P> Eric Dickerson, relenting on his earlier vows he would never again play for the  Indianapolis Colts, arrived in town today for a physical examination before  heading to training camp at Anderson University.  </P> <P> Dickerson's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said in a telephone interview from  California that Dickerson changed his mind. "Our sense of it was that valid  contracts need to be honored," Steinberg said. "So it made sense for Eric to go  back and fulfill his commitments."  </P> <P> Steinberg would not say whether Dickerson was happy with the situation.  </P> <P> "He's there to play football. He's under contract to the Colts. He'll play for  the Colts. As to his state of mind, you can ask him," Steinberg said.  </P> <P> Dickerson has been AWOL from training camp since July 26, accumulating $1,500 a  day in fines. He refused to talk to the media as he arrived at a Methodist  Hospital clinic and said only, "I'll talk to y'all later."  </P> <P> Steinberg was brought in by Dickerson last week to help mend a sour  relationship between the NFL's seventh-leading rusher, who has been sharply  critical of the team during the off-season.  </P> <P> Dickerson's verbal war with the team has included threats to retire and  criticism of the offensive line and management. He has been particularly  critical of the trade of perennial All-Pro offensive tackle Chris Hinton to  Atlanta as part of the deal that brought quarterback Jeff George to the Colts  as the league's top draft pick.  </P> <P> George signed a six-year, $15-million contract, a deal that may have been  another blow to the ego of Dickerson -- a six-time Pro Bowl selection.  </P> <P> Dickerson said he doubted the acquisition of George would turn the Colts into  an instant contender for the Super Bowl and demanded a trade. But the Colts  have said they never received a suitable offer for the seven-year veteran.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a second Colts' player AWOL from camp, quarterback Chris Chandler,  was flying to Florida today, and his agent, Mike Sullivan, confirmed that  Chandler had agreed to be traded to Tampa Bay.  </P> <P> "Chris is very, very happy with the deal," he said.  </P></p>

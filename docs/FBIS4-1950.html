			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial forum on developing export-oriented  agriculture concluded in Shenyang on 11 March. Attending the  forum to jointly discuss the issues of developing  export-oriented agriculture, developing agriculture that can  earn more foreign exchanges, and coordinating agricultural  production with foreign trade and exports were vice mayors in  charge of agricultural affairs from 14 cities throughout the  province, responsible persons from the provincial level  departments for foreign economic relations and foreign trade,  and managers from various import and export companies at the  provincial level.    According to the calculation conducted by the foreign trade  department, since the early 1990's the average annual increase  of the province in the exports of farm and sideline products has  been 10 percent. The province realized $800 million in foreign  exchange from exporting farm and sideline products last year,  which accounted for about 20 percent of the total volume of  foreign exchanges earned by local export units in the year.  However, the exports of farm and sideline products still suffer  the problems of inflexible information of markets, insufficient  goods resources, small patches of exports, product quality that  cannot meet international demands, and of separation between  production and sale. All of these need to be handled along with  deepening the reform in the rural economy.    Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu delivered a speech at the forum, in  which he pointed out: Accelerating the production structure in  rural areas to enable agriculture to enter international markets  as soon as possible represents the major task for the province  to deepen the development of the rural economy. The gap of per  capita income between mountainous areas in east and north  Liaoning and coastal areas is over 500 yuan. However, these  mountainous areas are just the bases of developing  export-oriented agriculture. Therefore, building the bases of  farm and sideline products that can earn foreign exchanges  through exports and establishing the production system for these  farm and sideline products represent an emphasis for the  province to readjust its rural production structure in next  step. He pointed out: In building the bases of farm and  sideline products that can earn foreign exchanges, various  localities should do a good job to develop the enterprises whose  products can earn the largest profits and upgrade the added  volume of farm and sideline products. As for the production  projects that can earn foreign exchanges, we should give  preferential consideration in funds and material supply to them.  The provincial people's government will establish its leading  group in charge of the export-oriented rural economy, which will  provide information, materials, services, for export-oriented  enterprises and households in rural areas.</p>

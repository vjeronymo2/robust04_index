Chiang said  Wednesday [16 February].    As a matter of fact, Chiang said, Taiwan might end up  benefiting from the appreciating Japanese yen and eventually  increase its exports of semi-finished products and spare parts  to Japan.    In the wake of collapsed trade talks with Japan, the Clinton  administration is taking steps to impose trade sanctions against  the Japanese.    Chiang said Japanese-made cellular phones could be the first  victim in a string of US trade actions against Japan as the  Clinton administration seeks ways to reduce a trade deficit with  Japan that soared 20 percent last year to nearly US$60 billion.    As the yen soars, Chiang said, the Japanese manufacturers  will be forced to increase imports of semi-finished products and  parts to cut production costs. Such a move would bring more  orders for Taiwan exporters, he added.    Chiang warned, however, that many Taiwan manufacturers will  suffer from the yen's appreciation because of their heavy  dependence on Japanese parts and components.</p>

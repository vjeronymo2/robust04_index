			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Zulu kingdom plans to secede Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is preparing to set up an independent Zulu kingdom in Natal Province, in defiance of the African National Congress and the South African government, he said yesterday. This move, tantamount to secession, will increase tensions following weekend news that the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, headed by King Goodwill's uncle Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, will resist South Africa's all-race elections in April and reject the new constitution. King Goodwill presented a memorandum to President F W de Klerk at a meeting in Durban, rejecting the constitution and saying he would soon promulgate one for a Zulu kingdom in Natal, 'which will establish a monarchy modelled after the best examples of democratic and pluralistic monarchies in the world'. The kingdom is understood to include all of Natal and parts of some other provinces. Zulus retained their 'inalienable right to self-determination,' he said, adding that, if they were unable to co-exist with other societies in the new South Africa, the Zulu nation would exist 'on its own, with its own territorial basis and with its own government'. Mr de Klerk has met the king several times during recent weeks, in an attempt to persuade him to endorse the elections against the wishes of Chief Buthelezi. It seems likely the king will take his political lead from the chief, as he has done throughout his reign, and reject the election. At the weekend, Chief Buthelezi called for Zulu resistance to elections: 'We Zulus must stand with our Tswana and Afrikaner brothers, and fight for freedom, justice and democracy. We must stand together and fight the evil lurking in the midst. If we do not, then we will fail.'</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / French threaten action against UK on Hoover: Anger over switch from Dijon to Glasgow THE FRENCH government yesterday threatened to take Britain to the European Court over the decision by Hoover to close its vacuum cleaner plant near Dijon and switch production to Scotland. The British government has provided Pounds 2.5m in financial assistance to help the Hoover move. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, agriculture minister and president of the regional council in Burgundy, of which Dijon is the capital, said: 'We are going to ask the Community to intervene in this affair.' He threatened action at the European Court of Justice. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, was last night examining the possibility of a formal complaint to the European Commission over alleged misuse of EC regional aid by the British government, a French government official said. Mr Jean Auroux, parliamentary whip for the French ruling Socialist party, urged consumers to boycott Hoover products if the group went ahead. In Brussels, however, a spokesman for Mr Bruce Millan, the European Commissioner for regional affairs, said Hoover, the US domestic appliance maker, received no EC aid for its move. Cambuslang, near Glasgow, where production is to be moved, was eligible only for EC small business assistance, he said. The Scottish Office said the state aid for Hoover was from a discretionary grant scheme operated by the British government within the guidelines and rules set by the European Commission. 'As always these guidelines have been properly applied.' The Scottish Office played an important role in Hoover's decision. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has been directly involved since the autumn in secret negotiations with Hoover's US parent company Maytag on the transfer. Mr Lang was pleased the Scottish Office had 'been able to help in financing the project through regional selective assistance to secure it for Scotland'. Hoover announced the move from Dijon to Cambuslang on Monday, citing its wish to curb production costs and group European production on one site. Closure would lead to the loss of 600 jobs. Workers yesterday occupied the Dijon plant in protest. Hoover said it regretted it had to close production facilities at Dijon but added it had made a commercial decision. Mr Bill Foust, Hoover's European president, said manufacturing costs at Cambuslang were 25 per cent below Dijon's. The French outburst is a rare attempt at intervention in foreign investors' affairs from an otherwise economically liberal-minded government. However, public and private sector job losses have become an increasing concern for Mr Beregovoy as unemployment nears 3m in the run-up to the March parliamentary election which the Socialists are expected to lose comprehensively. Hoover's move has touched an especially raw nerve in that France is one of the keenest proponents of the EC social chapter, designed to reduce differences in labour conditions between community countries. Britain's decision to opt out of the chapter has been one of many factors in French disillusion with the Maastricht treaty.</p>

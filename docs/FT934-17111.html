			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Clarins drop 22% to FFr100m CLARINS, the French skincare company, saw net profits fall 22.5 per cent to FFr100.8m (Dollars 17.7m) in the first six months, from FFr130m in the corresponding period last year. It blamed sluggishness in the cosmetics market, adverse exchange rates and high launch costs. The company, which has expanded rapidly in recent years, mainly through its export markets, also anticipated an overall reduction in net profits for the full year. However, it hoped the rate of decline would be lower than in the first half. Consolidated sales rose 3.6 per cent to FFr999.1m, from FFr964.4m in the first half. However, the depressed economy held sales growth below the group's expectations. Profitability was further depressed by the cost incurred in the launch of Angel, the new Thierry Mugler perfume, and by the impact of the fall in short-term interest rates on Clarins' financial structure. The company was also affected by the relative strength of the franc against other currencies. This trimmed its interim net profits growth by an estimated 6.7 per cent. However, Clarins said that it was determined to continue with its long-term investment strategy, in spite of the difficult economic environment.</p>

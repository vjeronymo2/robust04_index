			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Intel Intel is impressive and aggressive. The group's lock on the global microprocessor market allowed it to boost sales in the third quarter by 28 per cent compared with the previous year. Operating margins have slipped but they were still a mouth-watering 34 per cent. Moreover, the decline is partly due to Intel's diversification into lower-margin products such as video-conferencing kit and partly because margins on 486 chips, which account for the bulk of its production, have shrunk. As production of the more advanced Pentium processors is increased, margin erosion should halt. Fat margins are, of course, a temptation to rivals. It is in fending off the competition that Intel has displayed its aggression. Not only has it pursued Advanced Micro Devices mercilessly for alleged patent infringements, it has embarked on a high-profile campaign to accelerate the industry's move from 486 to Pentium chips. In that way, it aims to keep ahead of its rivals. The company's 'Intel inside' campaign has already resulted in a public spat with Compaq, which does not wish to accelerate the change to Pentium-based personal computers while its warehouses are full of 486 models. The risk is that Intel will become so unpopular that customers desert it. But the evidence so far is that, much as they may want to, they do not have the option.</p>

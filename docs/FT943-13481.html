			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Taipei rises 2% to four-year high Technical trading limited share price fluctuations to a narrow range, and the Nikkei index closed marginally lower on light index-linked trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Index-linked selling by institutional investors and profit-taking by corporations countered buying by investment trusts, and the Nikkei 225 ended 52.51 off at 20,717.64. Without major moves on the currency and money markets, many investors remained inactive due to the lack of news. The Nikkei peaked at 20,816.46 in the morning session but fell to a day's low of 20,688.34 in the last half-hour before the close. Foreign investors were also seen placing small-lot sell orders. Volume was 213m shares, against 288m. Many investors have been bracing themselves for a further fall in the dollar this week, and are likely to stay on the sidelines as Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gives congressional testimony this week and the German Bundesbank policy-making council holds its scheduled meeting on Thursday. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 3.46 to 1,665.01, while the Nikkei 300 lost 0.74 at 302.29. Falls led rises by 584 to 359, with 229 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.65 to 1,348.46. Fanuc, the leading manufacturer of numerical control equipment, dropped Y300 to Y4,190. The issue failed to trade during the morning due to a lack of buyers following reports that the Japanese subsidiary of International Business Machines, of the US, was moving into the market. Profit-taking depressed high-technology shares. NEC dipped Y20 to Y1,220 and Toshiba Y5 to Y777. Textile makers, which had gained ground recently as beneficiaries of the strong yen, met profit-taking by domestic institutions. Teijin receded Y17 to Y557 and Unitika Y15 to Y375, but Toray Industries managed to recoup its decline, closing a net Y5 up at Y772. Tokyo Steel, the electric furnace steel maker, fell Y40 to Y2,470 after its announcement that it was closing down a plant in central Japan due to the water shortage caused by the recent drought in central and eastern Japan. Other steel companies were higher in spite of reports of similar moves. Nippon Steel firmed Y2 to Y344 and Kawasaki Steel Y5 to Y409. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 32.13 to 23,195.42 in volume of 17.4m shares. Roundup The Pacific Rim saw mixed trading, with the reappearance of foreign demand in some markets. TAIPEI finished at its highest level since June 1990 as intensified buying in the heavily weighted, and recently neglected, financial sector boosted overall sentiment. The weighted index advanced 125.96, or 2 per cent, to 6,533.46 in turnover that rose to a high for the year of TDollars 131.04bn amid the reappearance of strong foreign demand. The banking sector gained 3 per cent as China Trust moved ahead TDollars 5 to TDollars 82.5 on sound profits expectations. HONG KONG finished higher on foreign fund buying of selected blue chips but profit-taking left the Hang Seng index below the 9,200 benchmark. It was finally up 76.81 at 9,193.83 after a day's high of 9,228.50. HSBC showed strength, adding HKDollars 2.25 at HKDollars 89.75. SYDNEY saw a continuation of last week's gains and the All Ordinaries index closed 14.3 higher at a month's peak of 2,072.3. Volume in News Corp was a heavy 5.1m shares. The stock rose 10 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to a month's high of ADollars 8.80. Elsewhere among blue chips, BHP gained 4 cents at ADollars 18.64 and CRA traded in a 20-cent range before closing steady at ADollars 19.08. MANILA was supported by lower domestic interest rates and expectations of strong second-quarter corporate earnings. The composite index put on 45.91 at 2,650.81. PLDT led blue chips as the telephone stock jumped 3.4 per cent to 1,510 pesos. San Miguel 'B' climbed 4.1 per cent to 126 pesos. Benpres Corp led second-line issues as it leapt 8.1 per cent to 9.30 pesos. WELLINGTON advanced 1.1 per cent in improved turnover of NZDollars 41.4m, with forest sector stocks again singled out as buys. The NZSE-40 capital index gained 21.95 at 2,034.46. Brierley Investments, which on Friday said it expected to report a record profit for the 1993/94 year, firmed 1 cent to NZDollars 1.20 in higher than usual volume of 6.27m shares. SHANGHAI's A share index lost 3.8 per cent on news that the exchange would enforce regulations banning short selling in state bonds and repurchase agreements starting on Monday next week. The index retreated 16.12 to 400.38 in thin volume of 202.2m as investors fled the long-depressed A market, which has lost 75.60 per cent from its peak of 1,640.71 in February last year. The bond news also hit Shenzhen's A index, which fell 4.72, or 4.4 per cent, to 101.82. SEOUL extended early losses in very thin trade, sending the market to a lower close for the third consecutive session. Many institutional investors remained wary after the securities watchdog said it would monitor stock price manipulation, leaving trading volume sharply reduced. The composite index finished 4.93 down at 944.80. SINGAPORE closed flat, with the broader market softening on profit-taking in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index put on 0.83 at 2,199.15, with part of the dampening influence attributed to a Merrill Lynch report which said it did not expect a sustained rally in Malaysia on an announcement of a general election. KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower in sluggish trading as investors took advantage of last week's gains to sell shares. The composite index receded 7.06 to 1,005.05 in volume that slid to 90m shares from Friday's 221m.</p>

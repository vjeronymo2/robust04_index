			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Kohl carries EU debate on new members European Union leaders agreed to a road map for enlargement to the east and south at a weekend summit in Essen which confirmed Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany as Europe's leading power-broker. Mr Kohl, as summit host, overcame opposition over plans for EU membership for the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe with a commitment to work towards a free trade zone in the Mediterranean. The Essen accord offers the prospect of membership for a handful of central European countries, as well as Cyprus and Malta, around the turn of the century. But the leaders were unable to resolve long-running disputes over fishing rights and the tension between Greece and Turkey. Before expansion, leaders agreed that the union must streamline its institutions and decision-making at the inter-governmental conference in 1996 to review the Maastricht treaty - a process which could provoke opposition in sovereignty-conscious states such as the UK and France. Spain has offered to host a special summit in July when EU leaders will have a private brain-storming session on how to organise a union with as many as 27 members. Leaders declined to offer a firm timetable for the next round of enlargement. However, the summit marked a commitment for Austria, Finland and Sweden to join the union on January 1 1995. It also saw the appearance of leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Essen marked the end of an era with the imminent departure of President Francois Mitterrand of France, whose term of office ends early next year, and Mr Jacques Delors, who hands the European Commission presidency to Mr Jacques Santer of Luxembourg. German newspapers yesterday heralded Chancellor Kohl as 'Mister Europe' who succeeded in orchestrating summit compromises. On economic issues, he secured a consensus on the need to increase EU competitiveness and tighten budgetary discipline in preparation for economic and monetary union. Mr Kohl was unable to get agreement on two German priorities: EU-wide harmonisation of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions; and a final deal on the creation of Europol, the Union's fledgling police force, to deal with organised crime and drug smuggling. However, German officials said they got a firm commitment from France to drop its opposition to the force before the next EU summit in Cannes in June 1995. On the energy tax, finance ministers are to draw up new guidelines for each member to apply a common CO tax 'if it so desires'. Mr Kohl also failed to resolve Spanish claims for improved fishing rights. A separate row is brewing over Greece's opposition to the EU's commitment to launching a customs union with Turkey.

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Manville Plan Criticized: Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., which is both a  co-defendant and beneficiary in the massive Manville asbestos case, complained  that a proposed reorganization of the cash poor Manville trust is a "disaster."  At a hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., Owens attorney Roger  Podesta asked Judge Jack Weinstein to withhold approval of a key element of the  restructuring plan for the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust. A  cornerstone of the new plan -- submitted to Weinstein on Monday -- is the  proposal to set up a single class-action suit that combines about 130,000  federal and state asbestos cases, and to appoint a lawyer committee to  represent them.  </P></p>

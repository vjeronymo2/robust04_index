			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DANA HILLS DONE IN BY LATE GOAL  </P> <P> The Mission Viejo High School girls' soccer team found a way to solve Dana  Hills' stingy defense in a South Coast League game Tuesday at Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Kelly Hampton scored on a late breakaway to give the Diablos a 1-0 victory.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo, the fifth-ranked team in 4-A, is 13-3-2 overall, 3-2-1 in  league. Dana Hills, in second place in the South Coast League behind El Toro,  is 15-3-1, 4-2.  </P> <P> Dana Hills, the ninth-ranked team in 4-A, had only allowed 10 goals in 18 games  this season. Goalie Bri O'Dowd had recorded 12 shutouts.  </P> <P> But in the 76th minute, the Diablos broke through.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo sweeper Jennifer Ward lofted a pass from midfield over the  defense to Hampton, who broke free down the middle and beat O'Dowd from short  range. It was Hampton's second goal of the season.  </P> <P> "I looked up and saw I was one-on-one with the keeper," Hampton said. "I just  wanted to see how close I could get and still get it in the back of the net. I  couldn't have faced my teammates if I'd missed." DENNIS KAISER  </P></p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pilkington hit Shares in Pilkington, the world's leading glassmaker, were hit in late trading by a flurry of rumours concerning its US arm. The rumours surrounding Libbey-Owens-Ford, the 100-year-old Ohio glassmaker, ranged from insider trading to FBI involvement. After the UK market closed, Pilkington confirmed that the chief executive and two vice-presidents of Libbey-Owens had been suspended pending an internal inquiry. The company said there was no 'evidence of major financial loss', but that there were allegations that the men had 'failed to follow corporate procedure'. One analyst commented: 'The market will not be particularly happy until it knows what the reasons are behind these executives being removed. Until then, people will guess and guess the worst.' Pilkington, which owns 80 per cent of Libbey, saw its shares slide 5 to 128p.</p>

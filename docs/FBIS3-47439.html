			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  had lunch with three former presidents at Chongwadae  [presidential residence] on Monday, using the occasion to  explain the policy of his government and seek their support for  his efforts to strengthen the nation's competitiveness in the  era of globalization.    The president's luncheon guests were former Presidents Choe  Kyu- ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.    During the two-hour get-together, Kim explained details of  the reform policy that he put into effect in the first year of  his administration and told them that the country has to join  the ranks of advanced nations by boosting its competitive  strength this year, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said.    "His administration will continue to pursue changes and  reform to attain the goal of his national policy," the spokesman  said Kim told the former presidents. "In order to do so,  revitalization of the economy, political reconciliation and high  degree of morality on the part of the people is absolutely  necessary."    Kim asked for active support from the former presidents for  this goal, Chu said.    "I have given my all in the past 10 months," Chu quoted Kim  as telling the former presidents, pledging that he will remain  clean and work hard in the remaining four years.    The country recorded a trade surplus last year and, since  there are signs of economic recovery, it is all the more  important to maintain harmonious labor-management relations, Kim  told them.    Kim also briefed them that the government set an export goal  of 90 billion U.S. dollars for this year and in order to achieve  this goal, national unity and solidarity are needed now more  than any time before.    "The government has set aside 42 trillion won for investment  in the farm and fishing industry as part of measures to cope  with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations,"  Kim said.    In addition, the country will try to raise another 1.5  trillion won through a special tax to strengthen the nation's  agriculture and fisheries, Kim told them.    All three former presidents expressed their agreement with  the plans, Chu said.    The three also expressed their satisfaction to President Kim  for making an opportunity to get together, Chu said.    The former presidents said that they believe Kim's broad-  mindedness will contribute to the development of a new political  culture and national reconciliation, according to Chu.    Monday's presidential get-together was seen as significant  not only because of its symbolism but also because of perceived  efforts on the part of President Kim to unify the country and  reconcile the various factions, some of which could have hurt  the civilian government's reform policy and anti-corruption  campaign.    In addition, the luncheon attracted unusual public attention  because it was the first encounter between Chon and No since  they ran into each other at Kim's inauguration Feb. 25 last year.    There has been intense speculation on when, and whether, the  two former presidents will reconcile. Animosity between the  erstwhile friends and fellow Army generals developed after No  succeeded Chon as president in 1988.    Chon was said to be angry over what he apparently perceived  to be a failure by No to protect him when he had to go into  exile in a remote Buddhist temple amid rising public outcy  against misrule by his administration.    After the meeting Monday, the spokesman told reporters that  Kim did not refer to "the problem of reconciliation between  Presidents Chon and No."    "President Kim simply observed that it is undesirable for  the  public to talk about a good or bad relationship between two  former presidents," Chu said.    Chon told reporters after he returned home from the lunch  that Kim had suggested a reconciliation and he had replied that  "it was a good idea."    Pressed further whether he intends to reconcile with No,  Chon  asked: "Do men like us who have been presidents need a (special)  opportunity to reconcile?    "I believe we can reconcile naturally if we keep meeting at  occasions like today's.    "There was nothing awkward about (my) meeting with President  No," Chon said, discussing the atmosphere at Monday's meeting.  "We talked a lot about the North Korean nuclear problem."    Chon said he had asked Kim to pay close attention to  national  security problems, and Kim was well aware of the importance of  the security question.    No, upon arrival home from Chongwadae, did not talk to  reporters.    An aide, Yi Su-chong, told reporters that No personally was  very satisfied with Monday's get-together. Yi declined to go  into the question of reconciliation with Chon.</p>

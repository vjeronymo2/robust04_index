			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Regulator appointed at Lloyd's MR Brian Garraway, deputy chairman of BAT Industries, is to become the first chairman of a new regulatory board at Lloyd's of London, completing a round of senior appointments at the insurance market. As head of the new body, Mr Garraway will be responsible for monitoring regulatory practice. He will work closely with Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive and head of Lloyd's market board, and Mr David Rowland, who is expected to take over as chairman of the market at the end of this year. Mr Middleton was appointed last month. The market agreed to create the new regulatory and market boards in the summer, acting on a report by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, which recommended the separation of business development from regulation and a reduction in the size of the council, the market's governing body. Mr Garraway, 61, has been with BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, since 1953 and has been a director on its main board since 1979. He is an accountant and worked in the group's tobacco businesses in the UK and South America before overseeing BAT's diversification into insurance in the 1980s. He retires from BAT Industries at the end of this month, Lloyd's also announced an improvement in the so-called 'hardship' arrangements under which Names who are unable to meet their losses agree to reschedule their debts. Lloyd's Names, the people whose assets provide the market's capital, face losses of Pounds 2.06bn for 1989, Lloyd's latest reported year. The improvements, which will make life easier for Names suffering through losses, are to be paid for from a Pounds 50m fund of contributions from Lloyd's brokers and agents. In a further change, new arbitration arrangements are to be introduced. They are designed to reduce litigation between Names, their agents and the Lloyd's Corporation. The modification to Lloyd's hardship arrangements were announced by Dr Mary Archer, who chairs the hardship committee. The main change is to introduce wherever possible a fixed-term hardship arrangement limiting recoveries by Lloyd's from a Name's income to a three-year term. Describing the changes as 'substantial and attractive', Dr Archer said the new hardship arrangements were more comparable with bankruptcy. A total of 131 Names who have negotiated hardship arrangements with Lloyd's will be eligible to benefit. Dr Archer predicted that between 1,000 and 2,000 Names would require the arrangements.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948) and Jia Fenyong </F> (6328 1164 0516)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of  the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] held its third plenary meeting  at the Great Hall of the People this morning. Ten CPPCC members  took the floor to give their views on the country's major  policies.    Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  chaired  today's meeting.    Yang Rudai, Zhao Puchu, and An Zijie served as executive  chairmen at today's meeting. Wen Jiabao, alternate member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and member of the  Secretariat; State Councillor Peng Peiyun; and comrades in  charge of ministries and commissions under the State Council  took part in today's meeting.    CPPCC member Fang Rongxin was the first to take the floor.  On behalf of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party,  he called for stepping up efforts to carry out the population  work to keep up with the development of the socialist market  economy. He pointed out: To keep up with the development of  the situation, we must resolve the population issue, and reform  provides the fundamental solution. We must continue to uphold  the target responsibility system in managing the population;  strengthen grass-roots and basic construction in population  management; perfect the population management network of rural  townships and villages and urban neighborhood committees; and  adopt different methods to improve the quality of our population  to ensure long-term steady economic development.    Member Zhu Guangya spoke on behalf of the China Association  for Science and Technology, appealing to entire society to truly  respect science. He said: According to survey, the phenomena  of failure to respect science and talented personnel has become  a factor obstructing the healthy development of socialist market  economy and the building of spiritual civilization. This must  arouse close attention of entire society and leading departments  at all levels. He hoped that China's legal system would depend  on and respect science; provide legal guarantee for scientists  and technicians who publicize science, and popularize scientific  knowledge, and bring fake and shoddy products and false  advertisements into light so as to further develop the social  trend of "respecting knowledge and professionally trained  personnel."    On behalf of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary  Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, member Li Ganliu offered a  suggestion to Taiwan's Kuomintang: The best policy is to quit  fantasizing, face the reality, change attitude, and sincerely  accept the CPC's proposal, agree to conduct "three exchanges"  with China, and hold talks with the CPC as early as possible.  He said: As long as we reach a consensus on reunification of  the motherland, can we resolve any problems by negotiations. He  hoped that Taiwan's Kuomintang would give careful consideration  to this suggestion, thus making decisions conducive to the  nation, bringing about a bright future for Taiwan people, and  writing a new chapter for our history.    On behalf of the Central Committee of the China Democratic  League, member Jiang Jingbo spoke on strengthening democratic  supervision, and bringing into full play the role of democratic  parties in socialist democratic political construction. He  said: Democratic parties in China share the glorious history of  fighting side by side with the CPC. They also share the common  object of struggle under the new historical period. As a  result, a solid ideological and political foundation for the  CPC-led multiparty cooperation system has thus been established.  Cooperation implies supervision. We believed that the  democratic supervision role of democratic parties would be  brought into full play and China's socialist democratic  political construction would continue to develop through  perfecting the CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political  consultative system.    At today's plenary meeting, committee members, including Sun  Han, Li Yongchang, Jin Xin, Qu Shijing, He Shengtao, and Li  Zhensheng, spoke on strengthening cooperative economy in rural  areas, on quickening agricultural development, on conducting  publicity and education in Marxist view on nationality, on  developing social sciences, on putting an end to the  deterioration of our environment, and on popularizing  agrotechnology.    Chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee Ye Xuanping, Wu  Xueqian, Wang Zhaoguo, Hong Xuezhi, Qian Weichang, Hu Sheng,  Qian Zhengying, Ding Guangxun, Dong Yinchu, and Sun Fuling  attended the plenary meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The following scandalous statement came from Tbilisi  today:    [Correspondent] The transfer of Russian peacekeeping forces  to take up stations in the Abkhazian conflict zone began today.  Journalists were told this by the head of the Georgian  delegation at the Abkhazian-Georgian talks, Dzhaba Ioseliani.  He stressed the leadership of the Georgian Defense Ministry,  and in particular the first deputy Russian Defense Minister  [Colonel-General Georgiy] Kondratyev, guarantee the complete  safety of refugees returning to Abkhazia. He also noted that  Russian peace-keeping forces will be active observers of the  ongoing processes and will actively participate in them. They  are very resolute and will take the appropriate measures against  any forces which try to disrupt the agreement achieved.    [Announcer] The statement by Dzhaba Ioseliani on the  introduction of Russian troops to the conflict zone was  commented on by Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Russian  Federation Council's Defense Committee, at the request of our  radio station.    [Begin Shirshov recording] Unfortunately I did not hear Mr.  Shevardnadze's official statement and statements by other  officials of the soveriegn state of Georgia. Nevertheless I do  not understand, if this is actually true that the introduction  of troops between the sides in conflict, between Georgia and  Abkhazia, has begun today, then this violates the constitution  of the Russian Federation, no matter who made the decision, no  matter which top Russian officials.    I want to stress that Article 102 of the Constitution, Part  4, Point G, says that the agreement to the introduction of  Russian Armed Forces outside the Russian state can be given only  by the Federation Council.

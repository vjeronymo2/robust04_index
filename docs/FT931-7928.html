			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Observer: Calling in Bechtel man Life at the top of the construction industry is just as insecure as at the bottom judging from the abrupt departure of ex-French Kier chief Richard Allen as boss of one of the world's biggest civil engineering projects - building Hong Kong's Pounds 16bn airport. It is not the first time that 50-year-old Allen has been out of work. He parted company with Beazer in 1989, two years after it had taken over French Kier. However, his departure this time was as swift as it was unexpected. No one doubted his commitment to the airport. In two years he had built up Hong Kong's Provisional Airport Authority from nothing to an organisation employing 200 people. He was a single-minded and determined manager, but one who had more than a touch of the 'one-man band' syndrome for his board's liking. A sign that all was not well came when more than 20 of the world's leading consulting engineers refused to tender for certain aspects of the new airport's design. In the words of their association they said they found the risks they would have to accept if successful to be 'onerous' and the work 'so ill-defined and uncertain that it was impossible for the jobs to be priced with any degree of realism. It's up to Allen's replacement, Hank Townsend, a 60-year-old Bechtel man, to make the PAA more user-friendly. He says his door is open to anyone and his management style will be 'team based'. As for Allen, he left his job as he had occupied it: tight-lipped and declining all comment to the media.</p>

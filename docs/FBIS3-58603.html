They were said to be part of a 70-strong gang linked to the  Mafia in southern Italy and Colombia's Medellin Cartel.    Among those arrested was Sicilian Umberto Pitino, 49, who  was  detained in 1991 when authorities smashed the so-called pizza  connection in the United States. He escaped by helicopter from  Raleigh jail in North Carolina with the aid of a Colombian drug  producer.    Police said cocaine totalling 20 kilos (44 pounds) had been  smuggled from Colombia aboard a ship hidden in musical  instruments or navigational apparatus.</p>

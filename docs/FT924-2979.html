			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Granada to shed up to 250 TV jobs THE Granada group confirmed yesterday that it was shedding 200 to 250 jobs at Granada Television, the ITV company for north-west England. The announcement came a week after Granada announced a 129 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 130m for the year to the end of September. The company described the job losses as a 'major development plan' designed to ensure that the company remained the leading ITV producer/broadcaster in the new licence period which starts next month. Granada Television has a workforce of 1,300. It hopes that the job losses can be achieved by voluntary redundancies. Talks with unions have already begun.</p>

We killed five enemy soldiers on the spot and wounded  more than 10 others. We also destroyed a communal office  building, a police station, and 10 firearms, and we seized 13  assorted guns, including a B-40 rocket launcher and two M-72  weapons.    The two-headed government mustered and sent a battalion from  the Pursat provincial town to further invade the liberated  commune on 12 February. The people and NADK, however, sprung an  ambush at Prey Thom, killing three enemy soldiers and wounding  eight others and dispersing and forcing the others to retreat.  We also captured two invading soldiers and seized three AK  rifles, 16 knapsacks of rice, and some war materiel.    Following the attack and destruction by our people and NADK  of the train carrying war materiel in an area between Krang  Chhvea and Re Phlak [Kompong Chhnang Province], the Vietnamese  communist puppets and two-headed government on 16 February  marshalled and sent 230 soldiers from their remaining weary  forces to invade the area. Their invasion, however, was  completely destroyed by our people and NADK. We killed eight  enemy soldiers, wounded 15, and forced the others to beat a  hasty retreat. We destroyed 11 assorted arms and a a  significant quantity of war materiel and seized 12 guns,  including seven AK rifles, three B-40 rocket launchers, and two  60-mm mortars, as well as some ammunition.</p>

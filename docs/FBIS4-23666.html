			<p>BFN     [Text] The decision to withdraw from Liberia by the  Ghanaians and the Nigerians will now see Nigeria and Ghana  following the example of Senegal, which withdrew from Liberia in  the heat of the Liberian crisis, after Senegal violated the  Standing Operation Procedure, the SOP, in the peacekeeping  operation in Liberia.    There has been a whole month of international condemnation  of  the Nigerian atrocities and lack of neutrality in the Liberian  crisis coming from the human rights group Africa Watch in U.S.  State Department. The leadership of the NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia] has repeated that it is prepared to  resume the disarmament process unimpeded, provided the Cotonou  Accord, dealing with the aspect of government and that of the  status of the Nigerian ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force, are fully  addressed.</p>

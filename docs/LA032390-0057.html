			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH DECLARES ALABAMA FLOODING A DISASTER; ACT PAVES WAY FOR AID  </P> <P> President Bush has declared a disaster in the state of Alabama and ordered  federal recovery aid because of damage caused by severe storms and flooding.  </P> <P> Bush's order makes funding available to supplement the needs of affected  individuals and local governments in Coffee County.  </P> <P> The assistance will be coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  and can include temporary housing, grants, low-interest loans to cover  uninsured property losses and other programs to help residents and businesses  recover.  </P> <P> FEMA, meanwhile, is conducting damage surveys in other areas and additional  counties may be designated for assistance when the assessments are completed.  </P> <P> The storms and flooding struck the southeastern part of the state beginning  March 15.  </P> <P> Elba, Ala., in Coffee County, was inundated Saturday when a levee along the Pea  River burst after the region was pummeled with up to 16 inches of rain. Across  the South, the flooding forced hundreds to be evacuated and was blamed for at  least 11 deaths.  </P> <P> Rescuers on Thursday found two missing servicemen along the Pea, where the pair  had launched a canoe Wednesday to view flood damage. The search continued to  the northeast in Dale County for a third soldier missing for four days. All  three were based at Ft. Rucker, Ala., the U.S. Army's main flight training  base.  </P> <P> Rivers in Alabama continued to recede Thursday, but towns on the Florida  Panhandle and in southern Georgia prepared for the bulge of water from last  weekend's storms working its way downstream.  </P> <P> In Florida, flooding along several rivers across the Panhandle caused about  2,500 residents along the lower Choctawhatchee to flee.  </P> <P> In Georgia, forecasters predicted that the Ocmulgee River would crest at seven  feet above flood stage today in Hawkinsville.  </P></p>

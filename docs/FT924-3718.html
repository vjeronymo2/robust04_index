			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Truth of the Matter: An impossible act to follow - We lack anything today to match Beveridge's vision WRITING IN 1960, in his book The Constitution of Liberty, Friedrich von Hayek opined: 'Instead of the five giants which the welfare state of the Beveridge report was designed to combat, we are now raising new giants which may well prove even greater enemies of a decent way of life. 'Though we may have speeded up a little the conquest of want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness, we may in the future do worse, when the chief dangers will come from inflation, paralysing taxation, coercive labour unions, an ever-increasing dominance of government in education, and a social service bureaucracy with far-reaching arbitrary powers.' Today, Hayek's assessment of the inheritance of Beveridge seems ungenerous and doctrinaire. In an imperfect world, the Beveridge reforms achieved a decency in the quality of ordinary life in Britain that it is not unreasonable to be nostalgic about. The acceptance of the Beveridge report by all the major parties embedded in the post-war political settlement a national consensus on three policies that was to endure for a generation - the responsibility of government to maintain full employment, the institution of a national minimum from which the stigmas of the old Poor Law had been removed, and the provision of good medical care for all through a National Health Service. For a quarter of a century after its implementation by the Labour government in the late 1940s, the Beveridge report was accepted as the basis of a national settlement which largely succeeded in protecting ordinary people from the worst insecurities of life. This was no mean achievement and it is fair to say that, despite the neo-liberal proposals of the New Right and revisionism about welfare policy in the Labour Party, we lack today anything that matches the scope and sweep of Beveridge's vision. By comparison with our own times, 50 years on, the period of the Beveridge consensus may well seem a golden age, unscarred by the mass unemployment, pervasive squalor and rickety health services that are such prominent features of life in Britain in the 1990s. But too much has changed irrevocably in British society since the post-war years, and the seeds of destruction of the Beveridge consensus had already been planted long before the Thatcher governments of 1979 and after began to tear it up by the roots. By the mid-1970s, it had already become clear that post-war macro-economic policy had resulted in a stubborn stagflation in which full employment itself could not be sustained. Beveridge's expectation that the costs of health care would fall as the nation's health improved had been utterly confounded as new degenerative diseases replaced the old poverty-related scourges and the medical needs associated with old age proved to be inherently insatiable. The emergence of a culture of dependency and its embodiment in an alienated underclass had revealed the unacceptable face of welfarism in Britain. Changes in the pattern of family life, and in the position of women in society, had in any case made welfare policy on the Beveridge model anachronistic. It would be a mistake to suppose that Thatcherism embodied any systematic alternative to the Beveridge inheritance. At the level of theory, neo-liberal ideologues proposed a variety of hare-brained schemes, which were wisely ignored by successive Thatcher administrations. Such schemes presupposed the roll-back of the welfare state as it had evolved in Britain, not merely since Beveridge, but over the past century, and its wholesale replacement by measures such as the Friedmanite negative income tax, insurance-based medical care and voucher schemes in schooling and welfare. In political practice, Thatcherite welfare policy was piecemeal and unsystematic, consisting of a series of ad hoc cuts and the introduction of internal markets, particularly in the health service. While such a piecemeal approach is certainly preferable to the madcap schemes of neo-liberal ideology, it hardly does justice to the seriousness of the crisis that has overtaken the Beveridge inheritance. If Labour thinkers are increasingly revising the party's fundamentalist commitment to universality in welfare benefits, this is mainly from a realistic acceptance that decent universal benefits are simply not affordable for the forseeable future, rather than an expression of any alternative vision. At the same time, there is a growing sentiment in all political parties that the squalid and divided society that has followed the collapse of the Beveridge inheritance is ugly, graceless and potentially unstable. The task for all parties is that of squaring public discontent with an uncaring society in which the long-term unemployed eke out a wretched existence on the dole and the disabled and the chronically sick - the most vulnerable - are increasingly the victims of spending cuts with the brutal realities of political competition for scarce resources. Thls is a predicament that Hayek's pessimism about Beveridge's welfare anticipated but which nothing in the neo-liberal ideology he inspired helps us to resolve. If there is any model for the radical reform of the welfare state that is bound soon to come on our political agenda, it is not America, but rather New Zealand, which already has had to attempt to reconcile a commitment to a humane welfare state with falling living standards - the prospect that looms for Britain. The fact of the matter is that, with the Beveridge inheritance no longer a feasible option for us, we have yet to come up with a successor to it.

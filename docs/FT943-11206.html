			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: Tax exemptions during rail strike - Finance Now that the rail strike is disrupting three working days, many employees are having to make their way into work, regardless of convenience or cost. Most will have to pay more than their usual travel expenses, for taxis or for an overnight stay in a hotel. Will they face a higher tax bill if they then claim the expenses from their employer? Usually, where the cost of travel between work and home is met or reimbursed by an employer, the employee is taxable on the amount paid. The same is true for accommodation costs. However, accountant Touche Ross points out that since 1986, the Inland Revenue has operated a concession in cases where industrial action is involved. Reimbursed travel and 'reasonable' costs incurred in getting an employee to work during transport strikes, are tax-exempt. Neither employer nor employee has to report these payments to their tax office and employers who prefer to meet the cost directly can do so without fearing the tax liability.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Investors scheme set to appeal on court ruling An emergency board meeting of the Investors Compensation Scheme is expected to take place this week, amid concern that a Court of Appeal ruling last Friday could put the scheme's future at risk. The ICS is likely to decide soon to seek leave to appeal to the Lords against the terms of the judgment that it was wrong to use its discretion to limit the amount of compensation paid to investors in home income plans. What particularly concerns the ICS are the wider implications of the ruling, which requires the scheme to take all relevant factors into account for each case, in the same way that a court would. If the implications of the judgment stand, then the scheme might be vulnerable to challenge on all the awards it has made - about 6,700. An ability to exercise discretion in determining a formula for awarding compensation - for example, in deciding the dates from which claims would be payable - was written into the ICS rules. The scheme, which is funded by a levy on the financial services industry, was set up in 1988 to provide a safety net for investors who are entitled to redress but find that the firm responsible for their predicament has gone out of business. Last week's judgment could mean that the scheme has to pay a further Pounds 20m compensation on top of the Pounds 22.5m it has paid to almost 2,000 home income plan investors. The ICS believes that as well as the potential costs resulting from a review of other awards, higher administration costs would be incurred in moving to a more legalistic scheme as a result of the judgment. New funding arrangements for the scheme are due to come into effect from mid-July following a review by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. Financial services companies will no longer have to bail out companies in other sectors of the industry that are unable to meet their liabilities to investors.</p>

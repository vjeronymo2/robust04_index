			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): TUC estimates membership is down by only 5 per cent MEMBERSHIP of unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress fell by between 5 per cent and 5.5 per cent last year, according to a confidential survey carried out by Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary. The estimate, disclosed to members of the TUC general council yesterday, suggests that the recession has had a less serious impact on membership than was previously believed. Nonetheless the decline, and continued losses expected this year, was severe enough to persuade the general council to agree proposals for a 20 per cent cut in the TUC wage bill and a rationalisation of departments. A reduction of 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in 1991 would be similar to the fall of 1990 when membership fell from 8.65m to 8.19m. It would mean a further reduction of 400,000 members to about 7.8m. That compares with 12.12m in 1979. Two unions - the AEU engineers and the FTAT furniture workers' union - have recently reported a 10 per cent decline in membership. Some public service unions, however, including Nalgo, have in-creased membership. The general council was told that without remedial action the 5 per cent decline would lead to a loss of Pounds 250,000 this year and Pounds 1m next. Mr Willis won support for a 20 per cent cut in the wage bill, or Pounds 1m in the full year, with changes in top staff posts and a cut in the number of departments and regional offices. The TUC superannuation management committee has already agreed an early retirement package for people aged 50 and over. It also has plans for a Pounds 500,000 voluntary severance scheme that would provide one month's pay for each year of service.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament in Minsk at the end of a session on  Thursday has failed to adopt any resolution after looking into  findings by the interim anti-corruption commission.    The commission proposed that the Supreme Soviet should  dismiss a number of government officials on various charges,  among them -- Vice Premiers Stanislav Bril and Nikolay Kostikov  and National Bank President Stanislav Bogdankevich.    Head of the commission Aleksandr Lukashenko in an interview  with Interfax pledged his commitment to further investigations  with "the help and understanding of ordinary people and decent  members of the Interior Ministry, KGB and prosecutor general's  office who may want to cooperate with the commission."    Nor does he rule out the possibility of cooperating with the  media because it has a wide spectrum of information. Lukashenko  raised fears the next session to be held in mid-May could wind  up his commission.</p>

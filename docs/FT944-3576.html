			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Cavallo vows to fight budget battle: We will soon return to balance, Argentina's economy minister tells David Pilling Argentina will overcome its temporary fiscal difficulties to produce balanced budgets both this year and in 1995, said Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister. Mr Cavallo, in an interview, hinted that foreign banks and investors had overreacted to 'early warning signals' of a third-quarter deficit, provoked largely by 'inertial increases' in social security spending. Stocks and bonds have been depressed since Mr Cavallo announced in October that there would be a deficit, while some international bankers have questioned Argentina's commitment to continued fiscal discipline. 'Far from being frightened, bankers should be happy to see that the economy minister will go into battle with the national Congress - with the absolute backing of the president - precisely in order to avoid future deficits,' he said. 'We have already taken action in 1994 and are pushing for legislative changes with a budgetary impact in 1995 so that deficits do not recur.' Mr Cavallo last month banned all new state spending for the rest of the year, with the aim of saving Dollars 1.3bn, and introduced legislation to limit further increases in social security spending, which already makes up nearly half the federal budget. He is also pushing for broader powers to control Argentina's purse strings, entitling him to cut government jobs, merge state bodies and to sell off more state concerns without consulting Congress. Although congressmen have refused to discuss these proposals as part of the 1995 budget package, as Mr Cavallo had wanted, the measures will be re-introduced early next year and may even be forced through by presidential decree. Mr Cavallo admitted, however, that two years of big budget surpluses, helped by the privatisation of most state assets, were probably over. 'We are now resigned to having (merely) balanced budgets in both 1994 - which is about to end - and in 1995.' But, 'that is to say, there will be no deficit'. Argentina was 'one of the few countries of the world that has fiscal equilibrium'. On the question of high unemployment, another potential concern for foreign investors and domestic voters alike, Mr Cavallo said he would not 'dare to make predictions'. Many economists believe that the jobless rate, which may be as high as 13 per cent, could creep up further as companies intensify efforts to become more productive. Mr Cavallo said that reforms of Argentina's antiquated and inflexible labour laws were vital if structural unemployment were to be defeated. Although jobs were being created at an annual rate of 1.3 to 1.5 per cent, the number of job seekers - swelled largely by immigrants and women joining the labour force, according to Mr Cavallo - had risen at more than double that pace. The problem 'is clearly not lack of growth' given that the economy had expanded by 33 per cent since 1990. But, during this time, the job pool had only grown by 5.5 per cent because small and medium companies - which in normal circumstances rely more heavily on labour - 'have been discouraged from creating new jobs because of the complexity . . . and high costs associated with labour norms'. Legislation to make labour more 'flexible' would be passed in relation to companies with fewer than 50 workers and later extended to the whole labour market, he said. Reforms would seek to make hiring and firing easier, to reduce the role of collective bargaining and to amend legislation on compensation for accidents at work, which the government says is open to abuse. Reforms were part of a three-pronged approach that would also include an intensification of job retraining, especially for youth, and the launch of labour-intensive public works programmes. To fund these, the government would advance with cost-cutting state reforms at federal, provincial and municipal level, he said. 'You have to bear in mind that these reforms may themselves lead to job cuts. Therefore, it is probable that this strategy will achieve a change in the structure of employment in favour of more jobs in the productive sector,' he said. But Mr Cavallo said training and public works programmes could not of themselves tackle the root causes of unemployment. To achieve this, Congress would have to amend labour laws, he said. 'However much training and retraining we do, if labour reforms are not passed - at least for small and medium companies - then it will be difficult for employment to grow vigorously.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- On 27 June UNIAN learned preliminary data  about the voting in various oblasts for candidates in the  presidential election. This data was received from oblast  electoral commissions for the presidential election and from  oblast councils of people's deputies. UNIAN also received  preliminary data from the Central Electoral Commission for the  election of a president of Ukraine. In most cases the data does  not include several rayons in each oblast.    Leonid Kravchuk received more votes than the other  candidates  for president in the following oblasts: Vinnitsa, Volyn,  Zhitomir, Ivano-Frankovsk, Rovno, Kiev, Kirovograd, Lvov, Sumy,  Ternopol, Khmelnitskiy, Cherkassy, Chernovtsy, and  Transcarpathia Oblasts and the city of Kiev.    Leonid Kuchma received more votes than the other candidates  in the following oblasts: Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye,  Lugansk, Nikolayev, Odessa, Chernigov oblasts, the Republic of  Crimea, and the city of Sevastopol.    Information from Kharkov Oblast is being finalized. UNIAN  has learned from reliable sources that the picture there is  ambiguous; in some rayons Oleksandr Moroz is well in the lead,  but in some rayons either Leonid Kravchuk or Leonid Kuchma is  slightly in the lead. In the town of Izyum, Volodymyr Lanovyy  received 23 percent.    Information on Kherson and Poltava Oblasts is being  finalized.</p>

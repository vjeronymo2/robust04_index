			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 May, during an unusual news conference that  linked him with reporters in several parts of the world, U.S.  President Bill Clinton upheld his position of not varying on the  U.S. policy toward Cuba. In response to a question by a Cuban  television journalist, Clinton reiterated his support of the  Torricelli Law and stressed that he does not expect any change  in that policy for now.    President Clinton, who has been labeled as indecisive, at  another point in the news conference, acknowledged that the  United States is incapable of solving the problems of the world  and [words indistinct] only when U.S. vital interests are  endangered.    Regarding Haiti, Clinton warned that he has not dismissed  the  use of force and insisted that the DPRK must allow full  inspection of its nuclear program. However, he was less  aggressive regarding Bosnia when he affirmed that Washington's  goal continues to be a negotiated peace.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Athena suppliers seeking legal advice Creditors of Athena, the poster and card retailer forced into administrative receivership by its parent Pentos, were yesterday seeking legal advice about the company's action. Mr John Allan, a director of Bod Prods, a Sheffield-based supplier of novelty stationery, said he understood throughout he was dealing with Pentos and that he agreed to supply Athena only after a Pounds 45m rights issue came through for Pentos earlier this year. He said his company, which supplied children's stationery decorated with spiders and slugs, was owed Pounds 75,000. Mr Allan, who received an urgent fax from Athena on December 19 for further supplies worth Pounds 25,009, said last night he was told by receivers Grant Thornton that he would not get any of his money. He added that in 16 years in business he had never before had a bad debt of more than Pounds 5,000. Mr Chris Marler of Davy Marler, also suppliers of novelty stationery who said his company is owed Pounds 60,000, said last night he knew there was a degree of risk but thought that Pentos plc would stand behind Athena. Pentos, whose main company is Dillons the booksellers, said on Wednesday that the board had decided that it should not inject further funds into Athena's UK business because there was no prospect of its returning to profit in the foreseeable future. Earlier this week, Pentos had changed the name of the Athena subsidiary from Pentos Retailing Group to Athena Holdings. The directors of the latter then called in the receivers. Mr Bill McGrath, Pentos chief executive, said in an interview on Wednesday 'We couldn't give it (Athena) away.' Mr Marler said yesterday: 'To ring fence a bit of the business like this is morally reprehensible'. Both he and Mr Allan asked whether Athena should have been trading if the company was in such poor shape that it could not be 'given away'. Both suppliers made clear that their potential losses would not threaten the viability of their own businesses. Pentos declined to comment yesterday. Camden Graphics, the greeting card publisher, is believed to be owed Pounds 200,000 by Athena. The biggest creditors are the landlords of the Athena shops who are owed Pounds 3.5m and, at least on paper, Cartel, the management buy-in which took over the publishing, manufacturing and wholesaling businesses of Athena International in June for a maximum of Pounds 1.9m. Mr David Clipsham, who has in the past worked for both the Athena retail and publishing businesses and for WH Smith, said yesterday that Cartel was protected. The company had a five-year supply agreement with Pentos with a minimum supply guarantee based on previous performance for three years. Mr Clipsham declined to give a value for the agreement. Athena's turnover was Pounds 12m at the time of the management buy-in and the company accounts for about one third of Cartel's business. The original legal agreement with Pentos, Mr Clipsham added, also protected the company against any loss over goods supplied.</p>

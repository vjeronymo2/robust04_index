			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Campbell Soup increases bid for Arnotts CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday increased its takeover offer for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, from ADollars 8.80 to ADollars 8.50 a share, valuing the group at just under ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 874m). The increased offer followed a ruling by the New South Wales Supreme Court that a 1985 agreement between the companies means that Campbell cannot vote more than 14.9 per cent of its shareholding unless it acquires at least 85.1 per cent of Arnotts' stock. Arnotts had appealed against an earlier ruling by a lower court that the agreement would become invalid if Campbell acquired more than 40 per cent of Arnotts' shares. Campbell is thought unlikely to consider a further appeal to the federal High Court. Campbell, which owns 32.9 per cent of Arnotts, had hoped to acquire a further 17.2 per cent of the stock for ADollars 206m, giving it a majority shareholding of 50.1 per cent. Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, said the revised offer was 'final' and would not be improved. However, analysts said the offer might be insufficient to acquire a large enough holding to exercise control. Arnotts' shares closed 30 cents higher at a record ADollars 9.50 on the Australian Stock Exchange, matching the revised offer. The revised bid represents a multiple of 27 times 1991-92 net profits, 13.1 times earnings before interest and tax, and twice Arnotts' sales in the last full year. Campbell said the offer took into account a forecast increase in Arnotts' earnings in the first half of 1992-93. Campbell's earlier offer was rejected by most Australian financial institutions. Advisers to Arnotts have suggested that an offer of ADollars 12 would be required to win a recommendation from the board. An independent report commissioned by Arnotts valued the group at a minimum of ADollars 10.78 a share. Advisers to Campbell have said the valuation is too high. The shareholding agreement between the companies was drawn up when Campbell took a friendly shareholding in Arnotts to help fight off an unwelcome takeover bid by Mr Alan Bond, the former Australian entrepreneur.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Coopers probed on Maxwell COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, the accountancy firm, is to be scrutinised as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the Maxwell affair by the accountancy profession's highest disciplinary body. The Joint Disciplinary Scheme is to investigate the circumstances surrounding pensions transactions within the business empire of the late Robert Maxwell. The scheme rarely launches investigations and only holds them for serious issues that command a high level of public interest. Just two investigations are under way: into Barlow Clowes and Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The scheme is operated jointly by the chartered accountancy organisations for England, Wales and Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. It has the power to examine and discipline member firms and any individual members in either public practice or commercial work. A committee of inquiry is being selected for the Maxwell case and the formal announcement of an investigation is likely to be made within the next two months. In the meantime, the newly appointed 'executive counsel' will examine the background to the case and prepare evidence before submitting it to the committee. The Maxwell investigation has been triggered by a referral from the Securities and Investments Board last summer to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which has in turn passed it on to the scheme. It will examine pensions transactions relating to Bishopsgate Investment Management, London and Bishopsgate Investment Management and a further 10 or more companies in the group. More than Pounds 440m was stolen from the pensions funds. Details of the Maxwell inquiry emerged in the latest annual report from the scheme, which was circulated yesterday. The accounts for the year to December 31 1992 show expenditure of Pounds 1m, which is exactly offset by income, including Pounds 142,000 recoverable from fines and costs awarded. There have been 33 referrals to the committee, 31 completed investigations and 15 appeals since the scheme was founded in 1979.</p>

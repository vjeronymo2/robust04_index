As a result of the armed clash, which lasted approximately five  hours, two of the trespassers were killed and the remainder  returned to the adjacent bank of the river. Yesterday two armed  groups also tried to break through in several sections of the  Pyandzh frontier detachment from the territory of Afghanistan.  They were, however, halted by the fire of the Russian frontier  guards. There are no casualties among the Russian servicemen.    At the present time, it was stressed at the command  headquarters, the situation in the sector of the Pyandzh  frontier detachment is being kept under control by the joint  actions of the Russian frontier guards and the sub-units of  Tajikistan's National Security Committee.</p>

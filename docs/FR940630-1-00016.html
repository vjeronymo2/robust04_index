			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Enhanced I/M Performance Standard_40 CFR Part 51.351  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The enhanced I/M program must be designed and implemented to meet or exceed a minimum performance standard, which is expressed as emission levels in area-wide average grams per mile (gpm) for certain pollutants. The performance standard shall be established using local characteristics, such as vehicle mix and local fuel controls, and the following model I/M program parameters: network type, start date, test frequency, model year coverage, vehicle type coverage, exhaust emission test type, emission standards, emission control device, evaporative system function checks, stringency, waiver rate, compliance rate and evaluation date. The emission levels achieved by the state's program design shall be calculated using the most current version, at the time of submittal, of the EPA mobile source emission factor model. At the time of the Pennsylvania submittal the most current version was MOBILE5a. Areas shall meet the performance standard for the pollutants which cause them to be subject to enhanced I/M requirements. In the case of ozone nonattainment areas, the performance standard must be met for both NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and HC. The Pennsylvania submittal must meet the enhanced I/M performance standard for HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in all subject I/M areas in the Commonwealth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pennsylvania submittal includes the following program design parameters: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Network type_centralized, test-only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Start date_January 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Test frequency_biennial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model year/vehicle type coverage_all 1968 and newer light duty gasoline vehicles (LDGV), light duty gasoline trucks 1 &amp; 2 (LDGT1, LDGT2) up to 9,000 lbs gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exhaust emission test type_transient test for 1977 and newer model year vehicles, idle testing for 1968 to 1976 model year vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission standards_permanent transient test standards (1983 and newer vehicles): 0.8 gpm HC, 15 gpm CO, 2.0 gpm NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  from 1/1/97 through 12/31/01, 0.6 gpm HC, 15 gpm CO and 1.5 gpm NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  from 1/1/02 and after.

The modeling demonstration was performed correctly, used local characteristics and demonstrated that the program design will meet the minimum enhanced I/M performance standard, expressed in gpm, for HC, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , for each milestone and for the attainment deadline. The Philadelphia area was required to meet the basic I/M program requirements because of the areas' CO nonattainment classification. The modeling demonstration shows that the program meets the enhanced I/M performance standard and in so doing is exceeding the basic I/M program requirements. The modeling demonstration is approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Network Type and Program Evaluation_40 CFR Part 51.353  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enhanced I/M programs shall be operated in a centralized test-only format, unless the state can demonstrate that a decentralized program is equally effective in achieving the enhanced I/M performance standard. The enhanced program shall include an ongoing evaluation to quantify the emission reduction benefits of the program, and to determine if the program is meeting the requirements of the Act and the federal I/M regulation. The SIP shall include details on the program evaluation and shall include a schedule for submittal of biennial evaluation reports, data from a state monitored or administered mass emission test of at least 0.1% of the vehicles subject to inspection each year, description of the sampling methodology, the data collection and analysis system and the legal authority enabling the evaluation program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both Act 166 and the Commonwealth's I/M regulation provide for a centralized, test-only network. Pennsylvania's centralized, test-only network type is approvable. The submittal includes an ongoing program evaluation which meets the federal I/M regulations. However, Act 166 and the Commonwealth regulation prohibit the contractor from having any business interest in a vehicle repair facility in the Commonwealth but does not prohibit such interest in the entire continental United States. EPA interprets section 51.353 of the federal regulation as prohibiting this business interest without geographic limitation. EPA is aware that as a matter of fact the present contractor for Pennsylvania's enhanced I/M program does not have any vehicle repair facility business interests in any other state, and is in fact prohibited from such interests as per contracts with several other state enhanced I/M programs. Based on this knowledge, EPA is proposing to find that this requirement is met with the contingency that the present contractor or any future contractors for the Pennsylvania I/M program will not at any time in the future have any business interest in a vehicle repair facility anywhere in the continental United States. EPA proposes to approve the Pennsylvania SIP on this basis. EPA's proposed approval is contingent on implementation of the program consistent with this finding. Should the contractor for the Pennsylvania I/M program at any time acquire any prohibited repair business interest EPA will rescind its approval and disapprove the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Net income at Baer slips 24% to SFr54m Baer Holding, the Zurich-based private banking and asset management group, has reported a 24 per cent slide in first-half net income to SFr54.2m (Dollars 42m) after sharply reduced profits from trading. Baer said trading income tumbled 68 per cent to SFr36m 'owing to the unfavourable developments on the financial markets'. Foreign exchange and precious metals trading profits were off by a third to SFr40m, while trading on the bank's own portfolio resulted in a SFr4m loss compared with a profit of SFr55m in the extremely favourable conditions prevailing in the first half of 1993. Net interest income was flat at SFr60.5m while net commission income rose 28 per cent to SFr144.9m. At June 30, total assets stood at SFr7.46bn, 3 per cent lower than at the end of 1993, due to the weaker US dollar. Shareholders' equity, on the other hand, was up 3 per cent to SFr947.6m. Assets under management, excluding global custody business, stood at SFr43.6bn, down 3 per cent since the end of 1993.</p>

It was also resolved to  request the Belarusian Association of Servicemen to help  maintain order. According to BELAPAN, Strike Committee  representatives intend to request that the Armed Forces and  internal troops not interfere in the upcoming events. A meeting  with representatives of a number of political parties and trade  unions is also scheduled for 7 February, during which the  members of the Council of the Strike Commitees will detail their  protest action. Due to organizational reasons, BELAPAN has not  been informed of the list of enterprises that agreed to  participate in the political strike. However, one can assuredly  say that they include the largest enterprises of the country.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukuoka, June 5 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of  the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), renewed  his party's determination Sunday [5 June] to submit a  no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's  minority government.    Kono hinted at a news conference in Fukuoka the LDP would  take the step once the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget wins  parliamentary approval.    He expressed cautious optimism that another major opposition  party, the Social Democratic Party, would go along with the LDP  on the motion.    Kono said it is up to Prime Minister Hata to challenge the  no-confidence motion or elect to step down and call a snap  election.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Diplomatic posts face heavy cuts BIG CUTS in diplomatic activities will be needed over the next four years as a result of the biggest-ever budget reductions for the Foreign Office, which were announced yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. While the total reduction of Pounds 70m for the years 1993 to 1996 is lower by some Pounds 20m than was feared a week ago, it still means that far fewer resources than originally planned will be available for overseas posts, capital spending and diplomatic activity in general. The cuts will be unevenly distributed over the period, with the bulk of the reductions in projected expenditure, Pounds 30m, coming in 1995-96 after cuts of Pounds 12m in 1993-94 and Pounds 28m in 1994-95. Although the 1993-94 total expenditure figure of Pounds 1.22bn represents an increase of 2.4 per cent in real terms on the provisions for 1992-93, the Foreign Office stresses that this is more than offset by the cost of new posts in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe and the 'increased pace' of diplomatic activity. Officials said implementation of the Foreign Office's planned activities would be made 'just manageable' during the first year of the public expenditure survey by slowing down the capital expenditure programme and by making cuts in scholarships and military training. However, in 1994-95 and 1995-96, for which funds have been reduced in real terms by 3.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively, it would not be possible to carry out all the Foreign Office's activities, even at a reduced level. Officials declined to spell out which foreign posts and activities would be affected by the cuts, emphasising that this would be discussed internally over the next few months. 'Work on these decisions is genuinely not far advanced,' they claimed. Nevertheless, it is known that the eventual abolition and concentration of numerous foreign missions in Africa and Latin America are under consideration and that at least 25 overseas units might disappear. While important missions in Africa, such as those in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa will be spared, other posts in smaller centres will probably be sacrificed. Some consulates are expected to close in western Europe. The Foreign Office said that, while it would respect its commitment to open 8 diplomatic posts in countries including Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, the chances of opening any other new posts were extremely slim. It emphasised that the number of British diplomatic service posts now numbered 212, fewer than France's 260 and Germany's total of more than 220.</p>

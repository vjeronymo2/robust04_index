			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (16): From office to mosque - Religious affairs MR HAMDI MERT's office, complete with the standard portrait of Ataturk above his desk and the Turkish flag beside it, looks exactly like that of any other senior government official. With a departmental budget this year of TL 2.3 trillion (Pounds 200m) and 84,000 personnel, it is a substantial government department by Turkish standards. A glance outside the window, however, at the giant dome of the Kocatepe Mosque, complete with an inscription in Arabic letters, quickly reminds visitors that Mr Mert's office is not quite like any other department of state. He is deputy president of the Department of Religious Affairs, the state body which administers all Sunni Shi'ite religious activity in Turkey, but is also a spiritual body. About 69,000 of the department's staff are hodjas (clergymen) serving mosques. From time to time, Mr Mert himself puts aside his grey suit and tie and dons religious garb. He then leads prayers in the mosque (where the president and prime minister may be among the worshippers) and delivers sermons. Is this a contradictory situation in a state which claims to be secular? No, says Mr Mert. He believes that some sort of secularism, in the sense of a division of duties between spiritual and worldly affairs, arises naturally from the Islamic religion itself. His superior, the President of Religious Affairs (PRA) is a direct successor of the Seyhulislam, the traditional head of the Sunni Islamic clergy in the Ottoman Empire. Religious and political boundaries, as elsewhere in the Middle East, tend to overlap. As Mr Mert sees it, the duty of the PRA is to attend to the religious side of citizen's lives and to instil a sense of unity. 'We are all Muslims,' he says, 'no matter what particular rite of Islam we happen to observe.' He also believes in inter-faith dialogue: the PRA holds meetings with representatives of other religions, including Christianity, from time to time. 'Turkey is the only secular country in the Muslim world. We Turks are both Muslim and secular, but the west doesn't seem to accept this fact,' he says. Some Christian clergy serving the less than 1 per cent of Turkish citizens who are non-Muslims but include ancient and exotic linguistic groups such as the Chaldians and Syriacs alongside the better-known Greeks and Syriacs, challenge this view. 'How can you call a country secular where religious education is compulsory?' asks one Catholic priest, pointing out that during the 1980s, Islamic religious education in schools was made compulsory not just to secular Turks but also for non-Muslims. After discreet lobbying by the French, the obligation was suspended two years ago. Mr Mert says, however, that he believes that religious instruction is a moderating force. 'Religious fanatics tend to come from those who do not attend the religious vocational schools,' he says. There has been a steady expansion of religious education in Turkey over the last decade. About 350,000 students are now enrolled in religious secondary schools, alongside the western-style lycee system, and they are now allowed to enter universities though not the military cadet schools afterwards. Alarm at growing fundamentalism, however, is less strong in Turkey today than it was before the Gulf War. Turkey's western middle class is no longer as fearful as it once of being swamped in a tide of religious revivalism. 'Fundamentalism has peaked in this country,' says one Istanbul professor confidently. It is, nonetheless, still a powerful force. Religious groups collect funds to sponsor mosque-building and religious schools in the Turkish-speaking republics of the former Soviet Union. Proposals to revive the fetva, a formal Islamic comment on whether a course of action is correct or not from the religious point of view, were mooted recently and strongly condemned in the press. The High Islamic Council, a committee of senior clergy and theologians, has also been reactivated after more than a decade. Mr Mert denies Turkish press reports that the council is planning any kind of religious reformation, something that some Turkish nationalists have hankered after since Ataturk's days. 'Our religion is an unchanging system. We believe it is the final revealed religion, so reform is out of the question,' he says. He is more coy about a surprising initiative taken by the PRA in the last six months: the opening of a formal dialogue with representatives of non-Sunni Moslems in Turkey. About one in five of all Turks are Alevis, a version of Twelver Shi'ism. Alevis do not worship in mosques but in cemevis or community houses, where food and wine are passed around, and members of the congregation speak in turn, rather as in a Quaker meeting, and there is dancing. In addition, Alevis have an awkward relationship with the state. They are given no money to finance their mosques or clergy - and their children have to receive Sunni religious instruction in school. There are deeper tensions below the surface. Alevis strongly supported the secularising reforms introduced by Ataturk and they tend to vote for centre-left political parties against Turkey's right-wing majority. Some Sunnis regard Alevis as non-Moslem (though Mr Mert says he is not among them) and there were outbreaks of intercommunal fighting before the 1980 coup when Sunnis attacked Alevi immigrants in some towns. The attacks were promptly and effectively suppressed by the Turkish military, but they reawakened old communal memories going back to the day in the 16th century when the Sultan Selim the Grim slaughtered 40,000 Alevis in a single night, accusing them of support for the Ottoman empire's Iranian enemies. 'Some sort of recognition will have to be given to this country's largest religious minority before much longer,' says one Alevi intellectual in Ankara. Cultural associations - such as one to commemorate the work of Pir Sultan Abdal, a politically radical folk poet who was hanged by the Ottoman authorities - are now emerging, where only a few years ago plays and poems about Pir Sultan were officially banned. The dialogue with the state has exposed differences inside the Alevi Community between conservatives (who seem to favour the new dialogue) and radicals who suspect the PRA's motives. The ancient tensions may be disappearing, but they are doing so only slowly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou by an </F> unidentified correspondent at the official dinner for the  European Socialist Party leaders at the Imperial Palace Hotel in  Corfu--live]    [Text] [Papandreou] One of the issues will be the [European  Parliament] elections and each country's experience. But, as a  party--we are conferring as a party--the European Socialist  Party has internal problems, work to do, topics, and internal  issues. Therefore, this evening is mainly an internal affair.  Tomorrow we will talk about the real problems of Europe and our  positions. We must always consider our positions. Our goal is  development and support for the workers, and a Europe of the  people not a Europe of the bankers. Our classical position  remains. The issue is how much we are ready to do.    [Unidentified correspondent] One of the significant issues  of  the summit will be European Commission President Jacques Delors'  succession. The information that is available so far indicates  that there is no unanimity. Are you optimistic about the  outcome?    [Papandreou] I hope there will be. I am not sure, but I hope  so. Thank you very much.</p>

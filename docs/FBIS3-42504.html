Gromak under the "Pressing" rubric;  place and date not given: "Used Combat Ships Come Under the  Hammer" -- first paragraph is KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA  introduction; questions published in boldface]    [Text] The beginning of this year witnessed an auction of  obsolete military assets -- one medium-sized warship and three  smaller ones. I opened my conversation with Vice-Admiral Viktor  Kravchenko, first Deputy Commander of the Baltic Fleet, with a  question concerning this particular event.    [Kravchenko] In line with the decision of the Main  Directorate for Material Resources at the Defense Ministry, the  Baltic Fleet was allowed to hold a closed auction of outdated  equipment -- one medium-sized and three smaller warships. Four  firms participated in the auction. The initial bid increased by  one-and-a-half times by the end of the auction. The three small  ships were purchased by a St. Petersburg firm, which will break  them up for scrap. The medium-sized warship was also sold to  the St. Petersburg firm. After it is revamped in accordance  with the requirements of the register, the medium-sized ship  will acquire a second civilian life.    [Gromak] Viktor Andreyevich, how will the money that was  raised be distributed?    [Kravchenko] Sixty percent of the money will be transferred  to the Baltic Fleet Command's current account. This share will  go toward the construction of military housing, while the  remaining 40 percent -- to the Main Directorate for Material  Resources at the Defense Ministry.    [Gromak] Who was allowed to participate in the auction?    [Kravchenko] All those who wished to do so. We had only one  condition: To sell the ships on the domestic market alone.    [Gromak] Please tell us about the need to sell the fleet's  property in the Baltic states, which has been going on for  several years now. It is only now that we had the first event,  but only as an experiment....    [Kravchenko] We lost two years in selling all our obsolete  ships. If the fleet commander had had permission (and there is  no shortage of inspection bodies) to market all unnecessary and  outdated hardware at prevailing prices for the region, we would  have sold everything long ago. At the same time, we would not  have requested a nickel from either the government or the  Defense Ministry for the construction of housing for the troops  and the fleet withdrawn from the Baltic states. Our estimates  prove this. Until now, however, the Central Administration for  Material Resources has held this issue in its fist, and the  fleet has been permitted very little. Only some insignificant  deals....    [Gromak] As far as I know, the Main Directorate has its  representatives in the Baltic states who engage in the sale of  fleet property....    [Kravchenko] Yes, it does. However, the situation in the  Baltic states is paradoxical. Riga, Liepaja, Paldiski, Tallinn  -- the Baltic Fleet will stay there for only four more months.  A special representative for the sale of movable property was  appointed by decree of the Russian Defense Minister last year.  He arrived in August very eager to work. He promised to sell  all the outdated ships in three-months time. Thus far, he has  been selling them without success. Several contracts for the  sale of certain vessels were concluded last year, but none of  the ships were sold. The reason is that the prices determined by  the Main Directorate for Material Resources were too high for  this region. Now the Lieutenant-Colonel has concluded a deal for  the sale of two used surface ships. I do not know, however,  whether it will be accomplished. The representative is also  negotiating the sale of all obsolete vessels in the Baltic  states with a U.S. firm. Time flies, however. The fleet  command has prepared a letter to Colonel-General Toporov, deputy  Defense Minister, with its proposals and a request to make this  process more dynamic....</p>

Fars Province farmers, who  have sold to the government a surplus of 815,000 tons of wheat,  have achieved first place in the production of this strategic  crop for the sixth consecutive year.    According to an ABRAR correspondent from Shiraz, the  director-general of the Fars Rural Cooperative, Malekzadeh, on  the occasion of the ending of the season of buying wheat in the  province, told journalists: For the purpose of carrying out the  plan of mechanized farming of wheat during the current  agricultural year, 740 mechanized service units of this  organization, with 400 tractors, 36 tillers, 16 combined units,  and 1,174 tankers with a capacity of 2 million liters of oil are  ready to offer their services to the farmers who are members of  the rural cooperative companies in Fars Province. He added that  during the last agricultural year, 445 tons of figs, 600 tons of  rice, and 67 tons of beans, which were produced by farmers in  the area, were sold in several parts of the province. For a  further protection of this industrious class, plans for  producing and marketing the crops -- such as shipping and  exporting, creating substitute industries and establishing a  system of information distribution on farming and production --  are anticipated to be carried out.</p>

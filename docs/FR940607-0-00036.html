			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Combustion of municipal solid waste, particularly through waste-to-energy facilities, can be an important component of a local government's waste management practices. As of 1990, approximately 196 million tons of municipal solid waste were generated annually in the U.S., 16 percent of which (32 million tons) was combusted. The states with the greatest municipal waste combustion capacity are Florida, New York and Massachusetts. There are approximately 150 municipal waste combustors in the U.S., 80 percent of which are waste-to-energy facilities. The remaining 20 percent incinerate waste without recovering energy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 25 percent (by weight) of the waste that is combusted remains as ash, amounting to around eight million tons of municipal waste combustor ash generated annually. Generally, these combustion facilities generate two basic types of ash_bottom ash and air pollution control residuals, commonly referred to as ``fly ash.'' Bottom ash collects at the bottom of the combustion unit and comprises approximately 75&hyph;80% of the total ash. Fly ash collects in the air pollution control devices that ``clean'' the gases produced during the combustion of the waste and comprises around 20&hyph;25% of the total. Based on several analytical studies, fly ash generally contains the highest concentrations of inorganic chemical constituents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Studies also show that ash (usually fly ash) has sometimes exhibited EPA's Toxicity Characteristic (``TC''). Typically, ash that ``fails'' the TC leaches lead or cadmium above levels of concern. Because a number of factors can influence whether ash passes or fails the TC (e.g., the nature of the incoming waste stream, the type of combustion unit, the nature of the air pollution control device and the ash sampling location), EPA cannot predict an overall failure rate for ash from municipal waste combustors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Extension of Permit Deadline Due to Substantial Confusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Permit Requirements and Deadline Extensions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RCRA requires any person treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste to obtain a permit or a pre-permit authorization called ``interim status.'' Section 3005; 40 CFR 270.1(b). To qualify for interim status a facility must meet criteria set out in RCRA section 3005(e), which include filing a permit application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When EPA promulgates RCRA rules subjecting a new group of facilities to hazardous waste permitting requirements, the permit regulations provide 6 months for the filing of part A of the permit application. 40 CFR 270.10 (e). EPA routinely publishes in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the specific permit deadline for persons regulated by the new rules. See 270.10 (e), note. Section 270.10(e)(2) provides that EPA can extend the date for permit applications by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice if it finds that there has been ``substantial confusion'' as to whether the owner or operator was required to file a permit application and the confusion was due to ambiguities in EPA's regulations. For the reasons explained below, EPA today is exercising its discretion to extend the submission dates for part A permit applications for facilities treating, storing and disposing of ash from waste-to-energy facilities that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory History of Waste-to-Energy Ash <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1980, EPA promulgated a rule exempting household wastes from all RCRA requirements for hazardous wastes. 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1). EPA interpreted this exemption to extend to residuals from the treatment of household wastes, including ash from the combustion of household wastes. The exemption, however, did not address ash from the combustion of household wastes combined with nonhazardous commercial and industrial wastes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1984 Congress added to RCRA a new Section 3001(i), entitled ``Clarification of Household Waste Exemption.'' This provision addressed waste-to-energy facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous commercial and industrial wastes to produce energy. In July 1985, EPA promulgated a rule that codified this provision. In the preamble accompanying this rule, EPA announced that it interpreted the statute and the rule to exempt the facilities_but not their ash_from Subtitle C, 50 FR 28702, 28725&hyph;26 (July 15, 1985). EPA did not publish any statement informing owners of facilities managing ash of any deadline for obtaining RCRA permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

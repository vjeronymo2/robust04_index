The meeting, which began here yesterday, was  originally scheduled to close tomorrow following six plenary  meetings, but the session's conclusion was unexpectedly moved  forward.    During the closure announcement, information concerning an  agreement entitled "Framework of Policies and Priorities for  Unified Cooperation for Development" was released, which was  signed by the 34 countries attending the session. There was no  official explanation on why the agenda was changed, which  reliable sources attributed only to a "time adjustment."</p>

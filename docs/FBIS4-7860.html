			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "em," "krzem:" "Shouts About Subcommission; </F> Political and Apolitical Foreign Ministry"]    [Text] Coalition deputy ministers whom the Foreign  Ministry [MSZ] chief wants to allow into the ministry will not  be part of the foreign service corps. As part of a reform he  outlined to Sejm deputies yesterday, [Foreign Minister] Andrzej  Olechowski intends to separate the ministry's political  leadership from the corps.    The role of deputy ministers, who, along with the MSZ chief,  will constitute its political top, is supposed to be about  participation in the shaping of the minister's policies, about  representing MON [Ministry of National Defense] abroad, and also  vis-a-vis domestic political forces. Any measures by the deputy  ministers undertaken inside the MSZ must be coordinated with the  minister and a secretary general.  <H5>  Strong Secretary </H5>   The secretary general would be in charge of the civil  service  (in the MSZ, it is to be called the "foreign service corps.")    The secretary would be someone apolitical, whose nomination  would be agreed upon by the prime minister and the president, so  as to prevent frequent changes at the post.    The secretary general would be the boss of director  generals,  who would be in charge of individual departments. Both  levels--that is, of the secretary general and of director  generals--are part of a group of supreme government officials  appointed personally by the prime minister.    The outlined arrangement is supposed to alleviate some  burden from the minister in terms of the day-to-day  administration of the ministry, and it is also supposed to  create opportunities for the minister to participate to a  greater extent in proceedings by the entire government and to  conduct his own policies.  <H5>  Corps of Officials </H5>   A new statute on the MSZ is supposed to define clear  principles on how to join the foreign service corps, on  promotions, and on the exchange of people between the center and  its foreign posts. The minister is supposed to introduce a new  set of internal rules that will define with precision the links  between six official grades.    Vacancies in posts abroad would be announced six months in  advance, and everyone could apply to be appointed after his  direct supervisor agreed. Nominations to work abroad would be  subject to opinions by a personnel committee (consisting of  department directors).    Details of the reforms within the MSZ are not being revealed  for now because they could change after a debate within the  government.  <H5>  Dispute Over Subcommission </H5>   As we found out unofficially from a participant in a session  by the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission yesterday, Sejm deputies  who are members of the commission enthusiastically received the  draft of reforms within the MSZ. So they were even more  surprised when Andrzej Micewski demanded an extension of the  mandate of a subcommission for personnel issues within the MSZ.  Olechowski has disliked the subcommission's doings from the  beginning.    Professor Bronislaw Geremek (chief of the Foreign Affairs  Commission) refused to submit Micewski's motion to a vote  because the motion was not on the commission's agenda. A  heated dispute erupted over that issue between Geremek and the  subcommission's members, which later was also joined by Minister  Olechowski, who spoke very strongly against any further activity  by the subcommission.    Let us recall that the subcomission was established in  January at the initiative of Tadeusz Samborski of the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL]. It included as its members some Sejm  deputies for the ruling coalition and also one Sejm deputy for  the Union of Labor [UP]. The Democratic Union [UD] and the  Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] refused to  participate in the commission, while the Non-Party Bloc in  Support of Reforms has withdrawn from it.    Olechowski denied the statement by Sejm deputies that the  subcommission's cooperation with him is good: "I do not  have a feeling of conducting a dialogue with the Sejm deputies.  I expected the subcommission to tell me what specific human  harm has been done."    The subcommission's members were trying to argue that they  no  longer have any intention of interfering with personnel  policies, but just to settle a few dozen "cases concerning real  people" involving former MSZ employees. In the end, Prof.  Geremek ordered that a vote be conducted. Eleven Sejm deputies  (Democratic Left Alliance, PSL, and one Sejm deputy for UP) were  in favor of extending the subcommission's mandate, whereas 12  Sejm deputies were against (UD, KPN, and UP, while one Sejm  deputy for UP abstained).    After the debate, the coalition members remained in the  room,  shouting that the votes were not counted properly. They  announced that they would put the results of the vote in  question.</p>

According to the first report, three individuals provoked  Carabineros agents guarding the area and escaped when the agents  tried to arrest them.

The individuals were finally captured and taken to the central  hospital for the treatment of possible injuries. Police did not  reveal the identity of the individuals in question, but we  reiterate, their arrest was as the result of a provocation  against personnel on guard near the U.S. Embassy.

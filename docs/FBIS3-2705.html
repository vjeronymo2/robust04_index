During the year, 150 km of express highways were built and  more than 1,690 km of ordinary highways upgraded.    Individual counties and townships, using their own  initiative  to pool money, built 3,346 km of roads within their own  territories and asphalted 2,650 km of concrete roads.    By the end of last year the total length of highways in  Guangdong had reached 67,490 km, an increase of 11,600 km over  1992. As a result, the province has 37.8 km of highways per sq  km, ranking among the top in the country in this regard.    In addition, last year the province built 22 new bus  stations  and 49 new berths which are able to handle 7.47 million more  tons of goods each year.    This year the province plans to pour 12 billion yuan (about  1.38 billion U.S. dollars) into further upgrading its key  highway and shipping facilities.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hampson warns after demand disappoints Hampson Industries, the diversified industrial company, yesterday issued a profits warning after experiencing 'disappointing' demand in the furniture and aerospace sectors. The West Bromwich-based company, which released its statement soon after trading ended yesterday, warned that profits would be unlikely to reach market forecasts of about Pounds 6.5m for the year. 'If you ask people in the furniture or carpets industry, you will find that retailers are having a rough time, and the same is true in aerospace,' said Mr Ray Way, chairman. 'It is a market thing. We are happy about our strategy and we are regarding this as temporary.' The company stated that its first-half results were likely to be similar to last year, when it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.48m on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 43.5m. Profits are forecast to increase in the second half, but will still fail to meet the market's expectations. Last year the company achieved a 75 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.23m, which included a Pounds 937,000 goodwill write-off following the closure of the construction division. Performances improved across its four main activities: furniture, precision engineering concentrated on aircraft refurbishment, cleaning and aluminium refining. The company has brought forward the timing of its interim results to the end of November, moving its full year to the end of June.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: FAIRFAX;  </P> <P> FATE OF SITE UNCERTAIN  </P> <P> The president of the company that hopes to develop the site of the May Co.  store at Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard said the project may end up  being an office complex instead of a shopping mall.  </P> <P> Steven P. Albert, president of Forest City Properties Corp., told residents at  a community meeting last Thursday that it is too early in the planning process  to know what will emerge.  </P> <P> Forest City also plans to expand the nearby Park Labrea residential complex by  more than 2,000 units.  </P> <P> It is now home to about 10,000 tenants, hundreds of whom crowded a recreation  room at Park Labrea to find out about Forest City's plans.  </P> <P> Many of them said they were concerned that development of the May Co. site in  addition to plans for a large-scale shopping center at the Farmers Market  nearby would worsen traffic and parking problems in the area.  </P> <P> City Councilman John Ferarro, who represents the area, has yet to express an  opinion on the two projects, both of which will require city approval to go  ahead.  </P></p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Savoy man turns down Forte job offer AN ATTEMPT by the Forte hotel group to recruit Mr Willi Bauer, former general manager of the Savoy, to run its luxury establishments has failed. Forte said yesterday that Mr Bauer, chief executive of Wentworth golf and country club group, had decided not to take the job for personal reasons. Mr Bauer would have run Forte's Exclusive hotel portfolio, which includes the Hyde Park and Grosvenor House in London, the George V in Paris, the Ritz in Madrid and the Bristol in Warsaw. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, has said he would like to merge the hotels with those run by the Savoy group. Forte acquired the majority of Savoy shares following a bitter takeover battle in the 1980s, but has a minority of voting shares. During the bid, Mr Forte strongly criticised Mr Bauer's management skills. Savoy and Forte agreed a five-year truce which ends in November next year. Mr Bauer said last night of the proposed Forte position: 'It was and is the most exciting job in the industry. But it would have meant an awful lot of travelling and responsibilities worldwide. A job like that takes 100 per cent commitment and I wouldn't want to travel 60 to 70 per cent of the time.'</p>

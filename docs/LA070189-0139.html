			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FLAWS IN U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PUSHING COUPLES INTO DIVORCE  </P> <P> When a Methodist minister divorced his wife of 32 years in a Nebraska courtroom  last month, it was not because of the usual string of irreconcilable  differences.  </P> <P> Rather, the Rev. Lincoln B. Justice, 60, and his paralyzed wife, Rose Marie,  56, of Lincoln, dissolved their marriage to circumvent rules in the nation's  health-care system, which, the couple says, forces its citizens into poverty  before it will provide basic health care.  </P> <P> Now, as a divorced woman, Rose Marie Justice will be able to stay in her home  and deplete her savings until she qualifies for Medicaid and the full-time  nursing help she needs since a 1979 auto accident left her a paraplegic.  </P> <P> If she had stayed married, new provisions added to the expanded Medicare  program, designed to prevent spousal impoverishment, would not have helped her.  </P> <P> These changes, introduced by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) allow the healthy  spouse to keep half the couple's assets if the other is admitted to a  professionally staffed nursing home. But if the ailing spouse chooses to remain  at home, the benefits only cover part-time nursing for 38 consecutive days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wrenching Decision  </P> <P> The Justices made the wrenching decision after the minister, in order to pay  for full-time care, took a new assignment requiring him to live 30 miles away,  in the Weeping Water parsonage. That home is not wheelchair accessible.  </P> <P> "And since we've already decimated our lifetime savings to make our home in  Lincoln barrier-free and hired a homemaker," said Rose Marie Justice, "it just  made no sense for me to leave it."  </P> <P> In an emotional dissolution ceremony in his church in Lincoln, the minister  vowed to "remarry my wife should the nation's laws ever change to allow us to  live" in something other than poverty.  </P> <P> His wife added: "We're not senior citizens yet, so we don't qualify for  Medicare. And I'm certainly not ready for the nursing home yet."  </P> <P> The couple's attorney, Virginia Johnson, said their case is far from unique.  She said recent amendments to the catastrophic-health-care bill do nothing to  make life simpler and more solvent "for the overwhelming percentage of the  nation's elderly or near elderly who need help at home, but aren't nursing-home  candidates."  </P> <P> She also lamented a health-care system that encourages people to figure out  ways to hide their assets from the government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Must Pay Full Costs  </P> <P> Johnson was referring to the requirement that those who did not transfer their  home or assets to a spouse, sibling or child at least two years before they  were institutionalized must pay full costs for care as a private patient for up  to 30 months.  </P> <P> "The catastrophic-care bill is not aimed to help the total numbers of people  we're dealing with. In fact, I think it makes financial survival easier for  perhaps only 5% of the ailing old."  </P> <P> While not sharing this bleak assessment, Mikulski's staff agrees that the new  provisions to prevent spousal impoverishment are only an important first step  that will make life easier for hundreds of thousands of elderly.  </P> <P> Constance P. Carden, attorney with Legal Services for the Elderly in New York,  concurs. She also makes the point that if all assets and income are in the  ailing husband's name, women are forced to sue their spouses in the nursing  home for support -- and not every state recognizes this court-ordered remedy.  </P> <P> "Instead, lots of couples made the wrenching decision to divorce so they could  separate income from assets held by an ailing, confined spouse," said Carden.  "The Mikulski provision will be a godsend to many of our poorest clients. At  least it will stop these court petitions.  </P> <P> "Prior to the changes, a person had to have less than $5,000 to qualify for  Medicaid. No more was allowed in savings or assets, including the cash value of  any insurance policy they held," Carden said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Split Combined Assets  </P> <P> Under the Mikulski provision, beginning Oct. 1, the community-based spouse is  guaranteed anywhere from $786 a month to a $1,200. Couples can split their  combined assets up to a maximum of $60,000. They are guaranteed a minimum of  $12,000 in assets, or half of a combined estate of $24,000.  </P> <P> However, in states such as Nebraska, where nursing homes are already  overwhelmed with non-paying Medicaid patients, the banks are threatening to put  liens against houses held by community-based spouses and to call the liens in  should the state health system go bankrupt.  </P> <P> Attorney Johnson predicts that scenario will become commonplace "once the  baby-boom generation starts pounding at the nursing-home doors."  </P> <P> According to Alfred Chiplin, staff attorney with the National Senior Citizens  Law Center in Washington, while the Mikulski amendment lays a foundation for  individual estates to decide how they are going to do property separations,  "they do nothing to help millions like the Justices who are ill but want to  stay at home."  </P></p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Property: The next crusade - The quest for greater liquidity If property is going to be taken seriously as an institutional asset class, it will have to become more user-friendly. Fund managers would be more ready to forgive its relatively poor performance over the past decade if property was not so expensive and time-consuming to trade. The biggest problem is liquidity: the costs and complexities of dealing in commercial property look out of place judged against the standards of other asset markets. Although industry guidelines on transaction fees were dropped some years ago, institutional dealing costs of 2.75 per cent for buyers and 2 per cent for sellers barely changed. While comparisons are difficult, dealing costs in bond and equity markets are a fraction of this amount. If property is - like other assets - entering a period of low investment returns, the problem will become still more acute. The 1 per cent agency fee paid by buyers survived recession intact, despite the proliferation of small independent companies. Agencies have remained reluctant to reduce their transaction fees even though charges for property management, research and other professional services have been cut. Some believe that a different charging policy could enhance liquidity in the property market without reducing the profitability of companies. 'Fund managers need to wean agencies away from expecting windfall gains from transactions, although that means appropriate fees have to be paid for other services,' said Mr John Whalley, chairman of the Investment Property Forum, a group set up to promote investment in property. The growth in research and forecasting services offered by agencies is certainly an advance. But unless transaction fees are reduced funds will not be prepared to act on such advice. The legal process of buying and selling property is another area of concern. 'The market has not changed its way of dealing with property for generations and it's about time a long hard look was taken,' said Mr David Bramson, head of property services at solicitors Nabarro Nathanson. Relatively simple transactions can be completed within a few days. Mr Bramson estimated that a deal involving just one title and one lease might take 7-10 hours of lawyers' time to complete. But bigger, more complex transactions of the type undertaken by institutional investors take much longer. One problem is that the governing legal principle - caveat emptor - puts the responsibility for checking details squarely on the shoulders of the buyer. There is certainly a view that fund managers are, as a result, too cautious. 'Investors should narrow the scope of their due diligence,' said Mr David Hunter, head of property investment at insurer Scottish Amicable. 'Lawyers only do what we ask them to do.' A system of warranties - which, in effect, transferred responsibility for gremlins back to the seller - would help speed the process. There is no legal barrier to this way of trading. The problem is persuading sellers to accept the lingering liability implied by a warranty. Cautious investors could be the biggest culprits. Warranties might also encourage the development of an electronic bulletin board, where big investors could post details of properties they are willing to sell. In theory, a deal identified on the board could be completed in a matter of hours. Again, the snag could lie with the culture of the market rather than legal or technical barriers. A successful bulletin board would rely on a degree of transparency and openness which many property investors find alien. Even if the market is unwilling to accept lower transaction costs and a streamlined legal process, there could be financial solutions to illiquidity. One option is turning buildings into tradeable securities - a process known as unitisation - but this is a holy grail for many property bankers. The menagerie of proposed securities at the end of the 1980s included Pincs (property income certificates), Spots (single property ownership trusts) and Sapcos (single asset property companies). While the techniques varied, the idea was the same: to increase liquidity by breaking lumpy assets down into smaller parts. Some of these instruments made it to public markets. Billingsgate City Securities, whose sole asset was the Billingsgate office complex in the City of London, was floated in Luxembourg in 1986. The London Stock Exchange also agreed to list Pincs, an idea devised by the securities arm of NatWest Bank and Richard Ellis, the surveyors. Other than the inevitable tax hurdles, the biggest problem to this type of instrument is price. If investors are only willing to pay a discount to the asset value, the owner would probably rather sell in the open market. But why should investors pay more than net asset value for a small share of a building over which they have no control? Besides, single-building unitisation would not guarantee liquidity unless investors were willing to trade and market-makers could be found. A small, unwanted building would be no more liquid than before it was unitised. Big unitised portfolios should, in theory, enjoy greater liquidity. But property unit trusts have suffered liquidity problems of their own caused by sudden outflows of funds. Closed-end investment trusts, with all their assets in physical property, might provide a better solution - if only the rules allowed. Barclays' Property Index Certificates (Pics), launched earlier this year, side-stepped the most common problems of unitisation by offering investors a return linked to an index rather than an individual building or underlying port-folio. If more issuers can be found to add to the outstanding Pounds 150m stock of Pics, so much the better. Similar instruments based on sectors of the market or even geographic areas would also be possible if only indices were developed and issuers could be found. Yet such instruments offer something quite different from the ideal of liquid, physical property. Having come so close to the grail at the end of the 1980s, it could be time to start the next crusade.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. Government has finally allowed to support  the UN Mission in Rwanda. The U.S. Government has set aside $35  million to finance the UN Mission in Rwanda. Bill Clinton's  government has also pledged to send tanks and transport planes  for African troops to be sent in Rwanda as UN troops. U.S.  Government has stated that they still maintain that UN Mission  in Rwanda should be humanitarian. They still insist that UN  soldiers should go to the border rather than go to the city  center. However, this (?delayed) reaction from the UN Security  Council, and the United States for that matter, is rather too  late.    Earlier this week, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary  general, told the international community that it is responsible  for what is happening in Rwanda, that he had called upon 40  countries to contribute to the UN 5,500 troops -- but only four  countries have responded. So far, the countries which have  agreed to send troops to Rwanda include Ghana -- which is to add  to their 200 troops now in Rwanda to form a battalion of 800 --  Senegal, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: OMLX sets launch date for Mid 250 contract OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange, will launch its FT-SE Mid 250 futures and options on February 4, ahead of rival contracts planned by the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe). The exchange has also appointed 10 marketmakers and four designated brokers. They are required to make prices continuously in the contracts, but there is no obligation to quote prices at a pre-determined bid/offer spread. The FT-SE Mid 250, which consists of medium-sized UK stocks, has substantially outperformed the more widely followed FT-SE 100 index in the past 12 months. Liffe says it is still preparing the ground for its own FT-SE 250 contracts. The specifications for the OMLX contracts will be similar to those for Liffe's existing FT-SE 100 contracts, except that the value of each index point will be Pounds 10 rather than Pounds 25. This means that with the FT-SE 250 index at 4,000 points, the nominal value of the futures contract would be Pounds 40,000. OMLX announced last week that, as well as standard contracts, it would launch 'flex' or flexible contracts which can be tailored to individual requirements. The exchange fees will be the same as for the FT-SE 100 contracts.</p>

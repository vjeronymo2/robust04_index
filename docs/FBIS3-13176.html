			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alan George] </F>   [Text] Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn is said to be planning a  new military strike against Kurdish territories in the north of  the country and to have deployed armored units at various points  on the contact line with the Kurdish region in the past few  days. This was reported by the Iraqi National Congress (INC),  an umbrella organization of various opposition groups, in London  on Friday [4 March].    Such a military strike would be a direct challenge to the  West, which has undertaken to protect the Kurdish region. The  area is being monitored by U.S., British, and French aircraft.    According to INC's information, in talks with senior  military  officials in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on 23 February,  Saddam announced the invasion of the Kurdish territory for early  March. In a televised speech in January, the head of state said  that he was intending to spend the Islamic (Id al-Fitr) feast in  Kurdistan. The feast falls on 11 March.    The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the  troop movements in Iraq. A spokesman said in London: "It would  be extremely unwise of Saddam to take such action."</p>

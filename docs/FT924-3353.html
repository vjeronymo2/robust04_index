			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (3): Volatility demands ingenuity - A guide to some of the new products IT HAS been a difficult year in the financial markets. Sudden foreign exchange and interest rate movements have taken investment managers and banks by surprise. Last year's easy trading profits have evaporated in volatile market conditions, with difficulties often exacerbated by high short-term interest rates. Companies, already struggling to cope with the recession, have also had to deal with shifting revenues and costs due to currency devaluations. Derivative specialists have reacted by designing products structured to protect against - or take advantage of - market conditions. A series of new products - or variations on old ones - designed to help fund managers and companies cope with uncertainty and volatility have enjoyed a vogue. Volatility has been most extreme in the foreign exchange market. As a result of volatility, the cost of currency options, which companies typically used to hedge their foreign exchange exposure, has rocketed. Banks found that they had been writing (or selling) currency options too cheaply, because the exchange rate mechanism had held down volatility, which helps determine the price of options. Following the recent turmoil in currency markets, a number of banks which had been writing options have found themselves out of pocket, and are now putting their prices up. As a result, some companies are eschewing options in favour of dynamic hedging. In dynamic hedging, instead of buying options in the market, exposure is hedged dynamically by buying and selling forward contracts in the market in order to replicate options. This method creates substantial savings for companies, according to Mike Shilling, assistant director at Record Treasury Management. Meanwhile, some banks are touting Safes - synthetic agreements for forward foreign exchange - which are essentially forward contracts that do not require an exchange of principal. As a result, banks need to devote less capital and are less exposed to the risk that their counterparty will default. There are two types of Safe: the exchange rate agreement, or ERA, which protects the purchaser against a change in the forward foreign exchange spread; and the forward exchange agreement (FXA), which gives protection against a change in the spot rate as well as the forward spread. On the interest rate side, the most successful product this year has been the differential, or 'diff', swap, also known as the 'quanto' swap, which allows a borrower or an investor to separate currency and interest rate exposure, by paying interest rates based on one currency while taking the currency risk of another. For example, a company with Deutsche Mark liabilities, paying, say, 8 per cent interest would prefer to be paying dollar rates of 3 1/2 per cent, but may not want to be exposed to the dollar. Under a differential swap agreement, the company agrees to receive D-Mark Libor in D-Marks, and to pay a margin over dollar Libor in D-Marks. The structure takes advantage of different-shaped yield curves to create immediate cost savings for the borrower, and allows an investor to receive higher interest rates without changing currency exposure. Such an agreement typically runs from three to five years, so the risk for either borrower or investor is that the shape of one or both yield curves will change more quickly than expected, turning expected benefits into losses. 'A major change this year has been the introduction of interest rate swaps into fixed-income portfolios,' said one fixed-income specialist. This had been encouraged by the availability of a liquid swaps market at times when liquidity in cash markets had evaporated. There are other bets on the yield curve, such as the Libor-in-arrears swap, which has enjoyed a new vogue this year. The borrower essentially takes a bet that implied forward rates are wrong, by having Libor set, say, six-months in arrears. Meanwhile, specialists continue to expand the range of applications for derivative techniques. The commodity swaps market - which allows companies to reduce their exposure to price changes in oil or metals - has grown swiftly in the last couple of years. From Dollars 3bn in 1988, according to estimates, the size of the market had reached Dollars 10bn before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and is now believed to total Dollars 40bn, mostly in oil-related transactions. Mr Malcolm Basing, of Swiss Bank Corporation, who heads the International Swap Dealers Association, believes that commodity swaps will be a big growth area next year. 'We have the computing power and the people, and the risk is certainly there,' he said. Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade will launch the first contracts based on insurance risk on December 11. The futures and options on catastrophe insurance are designed for hedging underwriting risk associated with unexpected disasters. The contracts 'will be the first in a new complex for a vital industry in need of efficient risk-management tools,' said Mr William O'Connor, CBOT chairman. Other potential insurance contracts include health, homeowners and reinsurance risk. There is also talk of reviving property futures. A property futures contract on the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) was closed last year, following the discovery of trading irregularities designed to inflate volume in the failing contract. The London International Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is considering launching both property and insurance futures. Still on the drawing board is another new breed of derivatives. A number of institutions are developing credit risk derivatives, which would allow fund managers, banks or companies to synthetically reduce their credit risk. For example, a fund manager holding double-A rated bonds could buy a credit-risk option which would compensate him if the securities were downgraded to single-A. Potentially, the concept could also be extended to tackle the problem of counterparty risk in the swaps market, but the development of credit risk products is still at an early stage. Some problems, such as analysing the pricing of credit, may not yet have been solved. 'With all these new products, the concepts are there,' said one specialist. 'But it is extremely difficult to find efficient reference points for concepts like credit risk or insurance.'</p>

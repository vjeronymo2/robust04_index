			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 18 (CNS) -- The entire ranks of  civil servants, including the disciplined services in Hong Kong,  are entitled to the through train up to the period after 1997,  while senior officers at secretary level will be subject to  nomination by the then special administrative region (SAR)  government and to submission to the central authorities for  appointment, the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong branch of the  New China News Agency (NCNA) Mr. Zhang Junsheng said here today.  He added that their duties performed during the rule of the  British-Hong Kong government would not be retrospective nor  investigated.    Mr. Zhang made these remarks at a seminar attended by  district affairs advisers of the New Territory section. In  response to attitudes held by general civil servants at present,  Mr Zhang said that the future SAR government would not look into  the past responsibilities they had had after 1997 and that if  civil servants were by that time willing to retain their  position, they could do so. He added they would not be found to  be at fault for their former words and deeds. As for those  criticized by the Chinese side, this was purely because their  worlds and deeds were in violation of the Sino-British joint  Declaration.    Another deputy director of the Hong Kong branch of the NCNA,  Mr. Zheng Guoxiong, attending the same function pointed out that  under the circumstances where the British side had destroyed the  foundation for cooperation, the Chinese side had to rely on Hong  Kong compatriots, including the district affairs advisers to  make joint efforts to realize a peaceful and steady transition.    He added that the district affairs advisers were persons of  influence in various districts and in different professions.  Mr. Zheng said that they could help the Hong Kong branch of the  NCNA to hear and collect opinions and views on a wider scope in  a bid to ensure peace and stability during the transition.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Regional Visa chief resigns MR JACQUES KOSCIUSKO, managing director of Visa International's Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, has resigned after less than two years in the job, writes David Barchard. The region is Visa's largest after the US and one of the main growth markets for the international plastic card and travellers cheque payment system. Mr Kosciusko's decision took UK Visa member banks by surprise yesterday. Barclaycard, the largest Visa issuer outside the US, said that it was sorry to see him go so soon. A statement from Visa International's London offices yesterday said that Mr Kosciusko, who joined Visa in February 1990, was returning to France for strong personal reasons. His successor is Mr Jean-Jacques Desbons, 57, executive vice-president for consumer products at Visa International.</p>

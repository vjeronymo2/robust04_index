			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> PROFESSOR TO RESUME CLASS AFTER INQUIRY  </P> <P> A UC Irvine social sciences professor is scheduled to resume teaching the same  class that sparked a university inquiry into an exercise in which students  invested in Swiss francs and gold futures.  </P> <P> Alain Lewis, the instructor of a course called "Games as Models of Social  Phenomena," was relieved of teaching the class for the rest of the current  quarter after complaints were filed with campus officials.  </P> <P> He is to start teaching it again next quarter, a campus official said.  </P> <P> Some students and parents complained that Lewis stood to benefit from the  investments. "As far as I know he's coming back unless the inquiry finds out  something different," said Colleen Bentley-Adler, a university spokeswoman.  </P> <P> She said the inquiry was being conducted by William Schonfeld, dean of the  school of social sciences, and Ron Wilson, the university's ombudsman.  </P> <P> Students said they had been asked to invest between $25 and $100. Bentley-Adler  said more than $1,400 had been invested and that students would receive their  money back.  </P> <P> "If there are any profits, they will go to to the students," she added.  </P> <P> She said that Lewis is continuing to teach graduate courses.

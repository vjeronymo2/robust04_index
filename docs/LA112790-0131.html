			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> MARKET RALLIES IN LATE TRADING; DOW GAINS 5.94  </P> <P> Renewed Middle East jitters sent stocks cascading lower in morning trading  Monday, but a bounce in the bond market and a late halt to an oil-price rally  helped shares end mixed.  </P> <P> Investors were rattled by news that Washington is seeking an authorization of  force from the United Nations if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index tumbled as much as 31 points, but then rallied  to close up 5.94 at 2,533.17. Gainers narrowly led decliners 789 to 714 on the  New York Stock Exchange. But over-the-counter stocks finished mostly lower, and  transportation stocks were big losers as oil gained.  </P> <P> Big Board volume was a still-thin 131.54 million shares, though up from  Friday's 63.35 million.  </P> <P> "The volume would have you believe that no one is getting panicky," said  Jeffrey Kaminski, trader at Mabon Nugent. "Once again, the market has been very  myopic responding to the Mideast."  </P> <P> Oil prices, which peaked at $34.25 a barrel earlier in the day, settled at  $32.95, up $1.05.  </P> <P> The U.N. decision on Iraq will likely be a key influence for the near term.  "Institutions were extremely quiet and will probably remain so until we get  more feedback on the U.N. resolution," said Ron Doran, director of  institutional trading at C. L. King. The White House said it hoped that the  U.N. Security Council would vote by Saturday on the proposed deadline.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * MCA slipped 1/4 to 65 1/8 after it agreed to be acquired by Matsushita for  $66 a share. The deal does not include MCA's New York area television station.  Arbitragers said the offer was below expectations. Matsushita's NYSE-traded  shares rose 2 1/4 to 128 3/4. Most other movie-company stocks gained slightly  on the news, but Paramount fell 1 5/8 to 38 3/8.  </P> <P> * Oil-related issues were mostly higher. Arco rose 2 1/8 to 127 1/8, British  Petroleum gained 1 1/8 to 79 5/8, Texaco rose 1 to 58 1/8 and Unocal added 1/2  to 27 7/8.  </P> <P> * Financial stocks in particular were strong, including Well Fargo, up 2 1/4 to  54 1/4; Security Pacific, up 1 1/8 to 22 3/8; HomeFed, up 5/8 to 5 5/8; Golden  West, up 1 3/8 to 23 1/2, and Citicorp, up 3/4 to 13 1/8.  </P> <P> * Mentor gained 3/4 to 12 after the Santa Barbara-based medical devices firm  said it may buy back up to 1 million of its 10.7 million shares. Among other  Southland issues, medical-care provider PacifiCare Health added 3/8 to 15 1/4,  following Friday's 1 3/8 gain. The firm on Monday reported quarterly income of  49 cents a share, up 36% from 36 cents a year ago.  </P> <P> * Browning-Ferris fell 7/8 to 21 1/2 after a meeting with analysts yielded  little encouragement about the environmental service company's near-term  results. Prudential-Bache and Morgan Stanley cut their 1991 profit estimates.  Waste Management fell in sympathy, losing 1 1/4 to 32 1/8.  </P> <P> In foreign trading, German shares tumbled 2.7% as fears of a war in the Persian  Gulf dampened the more positive mood of the past two weeks. The DAX index  dropped 40.20 points to 1,443.16.  </P> <P> Shares finished lower in London, as an early romp higher ran out of steam on a  wave of profit taking. The Financial Times 100-share index lost 18.6 points to  2,151.9.  </P> <P> Tokyo stocks closed higher, largely for technical reasons. The key 225-share  Nikkei average closed up 362.58 points, or 1.6%, at 23,762.86.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Gain in Seesaw Session  </P> <P> Bond prices rose moderately in slow trading on, sharply reversing course from  an early decline amid signs of easing inflation.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000  in face amount. Its yield eased to 8.43% from 8.44% late Friday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 7.563%, up from 7.50% late Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Climbs on Fears About Mideast  </P> <P> The dollar advanced moderately against most major currencies, boosted by the  growing concerns about the Middle East.  </P> <P> Analysts said the foreign exchange markets were "Middle East driven," with  traders focused on the Bush Administration's attempts to win support for a  proposed U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing military force to drive  Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Investors tend to view the dollar as a safe haven during times of political  uncertainty overseas.  </P> <P> The dollar closed at 1.487 marks in New York, up from 1.486 on Friday. The U.S.  currency rose as far as 1.494 marks in New York but then fell back, leaving  traders skeptical about the dollar's chances for holding on to its gains.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the yen suffered as war speculation raised questions about the  Japanese economy. The dollar jumped to 129.05 yen in New York from late  Friday's 127.10.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Grain Futures Off as Sale Hopes Fade  </P> <P> Grain and soybean futures prices fell broadly on the Chicago Board of Trade  amid fading hopes for new sales of U.S. crops to U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> In Chicago, wheat futures settled 4 to 6 cents lower, with the contract for  delivery in December at $2.435 a bushel; corn was 1.75 to 3.75 cents lower,  with December at $2.1875 a bushel; soybeans were 2.75 to 5.50 cents lower, with  January at $5.765 a bushel.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, gold and silver advanced on the New York Commodity Exchange. Gold  for November delivery added $2.40 to $386.10 an ounce; silver rose 2.3 cents to  $4.15.  </P> <P> Market Roundup, D8  </P></p>

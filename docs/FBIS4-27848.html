			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dangerous Military Move" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The United States and  the South Korean puppet clique reportedly announced on June 1  that they would stage Ulchi Focus Lens with far larger forces  than last year for two weeks from August 22 this year.    The announcement came at a time when the wicked forces are  kicking up a hysterical clamour for pressure and "sanctions"  against the DPRK following the "presidential statement" of the  U.N. Security Council a few days ago, which contained an  unreasonable argument against the DPRK. This is an open  challenge to the DPRK and a very ill-boding military move to  drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.  This arouses our due vigilance.    The U.S. hardline conservatives including Defense Secretary  William Perry have openly called for "policy of physical  strength." The traitor Kim Yong-sam "inspected" the combat  preparedness of puppet Army units, inciting a war fever. The  Rimpac joint military maneuvers simulating a military attack on  the DPRK are being staged. These facts show that the military  move of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique to  carry into practice new operation plan 5027 for a war against  the North is entering into a very grave stage.    The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must  refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful of the grave  consequences that may arise from their adventurous military  action.</p>

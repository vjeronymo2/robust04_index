			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHATSWORTH MAN GETS 8 YEARS IN FATAL SHOOTING  </P> <P> A27-year old Chatsworth man was sentenced to eight years in prison Thursday for  fatally shooting a man during an argument.  </P> <P> Zeferino Rosales Leon pleaded guilty in April to first-degree manslaughter in  the death of Ignacio Gomez, 26. Leon originally was charged with murder, but  that charge was dismissed when he agreed to plead to the lesser crime.  </P> <P> Gomez died of medical complications from the bullet wound on May 18, 1988 --  more than six weeks after the shooting took place.  </P> <P> During the sentencing, Public Defender Jerry M. Schultz pleaded with San  Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith Taylor not to give Leon the maximum  13-year sentence, arguing that Gomez's death was caused as much by medical  negligence as by Leon's actions.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Gomez was released from Northridge Hospital  Medical Center less than a week after the shooting. A month later, he returned  to the hospital, complaining of discomfort and was referred to the Los Angeles  County-USC Medical Center, where he died.  </P></p>

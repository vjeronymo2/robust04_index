			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENATORS' MAILINGS COST $52 MILLION  </P> <P> Mass-mailings by 100 senators during 1987-88 cost taxpayers more than $52.7  million, the congressional watchdog Common Cause reported today.  </P> <P> The 27 senators seeking reelection last year spent $20.1 million of the total,  an average of 48 cents per household. The per-household figures compared to an  average of 31 cents for the 67 senators who were not campaigning for  reelection, and 15 cents for six senators who retired in 1988.  </P> <P> "Franked mass-mailings are used for campaign purposes by members of Congress  and provide incumbents with an unfair and discriminatory advantage over their  challengers," Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said. "The use of the  frank for mass-mailings should be eliminated or sharply curtailed."  </P></p>

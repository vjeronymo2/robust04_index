			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of the </F> Presidential Chancellery, by Janusz B. Grochowski; place and  date not given: "I Believe That There Will Be an Agreement"]    [Text] [Grochowski] Is the latest dispute between the  president and parliament merely about the Constitution?    [Falandysz] It is difficult to say for sure, because every  political dispute has consequences that go beyond its initial  subject. But this dispute concerns the method of drafting the  Constitution. I think the president is right to say that one  should give it exceptional legislative treatment.    [Grochowski] The slogan "Take matters into your own hands"  is very controversial. It could be interpreted as an attempt to  deprive parliament of the legitimacy that was accorded to it by  fully free and democratic elections.    [Falandysz] Nobody has ever questioned this legitimacy. It  was not the president who began to amend the law on preparing  and adopting a new Constitution to make it necessary for the  Constitution to be approved by the population in a general  referendum. What happened was that certain people suddenly  began to think about an initial constitutional referendum. We  think that this is a bad idea. Needless to say, the president  did not object to this idea, but he did suggest a different  solution whereby any organized group of citizens may submit its  own draft Constitution to the National Assembly Constitutional  Commission.    The idea of dissolving parliament should parliament's own  draft Constitution be rejected in a referendum has nothing to do  with undermining parliament's legitimacy, either. Parliament  itself has decided on direct democracy, and all we wanted to do  was expand this democracy. However, it turns out that the  deputies cannot even be bothered to consider the president's's  draft Constitution.    [Grochowski] Various explanations are being given for the  present situation. The most frequent explanation is that the  president has already started his election campaign.    [Falandysz] This conflict would never have come about if the  Sejm had displayed at least a tiny bit of courtesy and conveyed  the draft Constitutions to the Commission. How can one suspect  the president of starting his election campaign if it is not his  fault that the dispute started in the first place?    [Grochowski] There is talk of another "war at the top"  designed to break up the present government coalition.    [Falandysz] In politics, one ought to avoid mistakes, and  once a mistake has been made, one ought to admit it. The Sejm  cannot reject an initiative from the head of state without any  more ado. It can criticize such an initiative, as it has already  done, but it should also accord it proper treatment and let  standing committees hold discussions on it. Yet in the  meantime, the doors of parliament have been slammed in the  president's face.    But there is no war at the top. After all, President Walesa  is not under parliament's authority.    [Grochowski] Then why is the Belvedere mainly attacking the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], even though a part of the Polish  Peasant Party and Union of Labor also voted against the  president's draft Constitution?    [Falandysz] Prominent SLD politicians have also defended  parliament's decision to throw out Walesa's draft Constitution.  The Peasant Party kept silent. All this can be taken to mean  that the SLD is at war with the president.    [Grochowski] The president has the right to withdraw any  legislative initiative of his, including his draft Constitution.  Anyone who submits a legislative initiative has a similar right.  But I am not sure if the president's representative can cease  taking part in the work of the Constitutional Commission.    [Falandysz] One can apply various interpretations, including  one whereby without a presidential representative, the  Constitutional Commission cannot perform its work. One might  also say that the president has a duty to send a representative  to this Commission. But nowhere is it written who this  representative should be, and the law certainly does not say it  has to be me. However, former prime ministers Suchocka and  Mazowiecki are correct in saying that the Constitution can only  be formed with the president's participation, and everything  must be done to make him participate.    [Grochowski] Do you see any solution to this problem?    [Falandysz] Yes. I think one should seek a compromise. One  such compromise is the inclusion of a group of people from  outside parliament in the work of the Constitutional Commission.  One could go even further. The Sejm could restrict itself to  current affairs and let the new Constitution be prepared by a  separate constitutional body consisting of representatives of  all parties. Each party would be represented therein in a  proportion that corresponds to the votes that it received in the  parliamentary elections.    There are various possible solutions, and one has to pick  the  best one. After all, the Constitution is supposed to be  apolitical, and must be addressed to the whole population,  including those who lost the elections. And yet the  parliamentary majority is inclined to adhere stubbornly to its  convictions, an attitude that could isolate the authors of the  new Constitution. In such a case, a referendum would turn even  a perfectly worded Constitution into a political text that  serves the interests of the present parliamentary majority.    [Grochowski] Is anyone in Poland seriously concerned about  the new Constitution? All the proposals that have been  presented are merely delaying work on it.    [Falandysz] Unlike the SLD and Union of Labor, the president  has never insisted that work on the new Constitution be speeded  up so that it can be adopted as quickly as possible. We cannot  have a sloppy Constitution. Those postcommunist countries that  rushed to produce e new Constitution are now regretting their  haste.    In the army, various scenarios have to be tried out on  exercise grounds before they are put into practice. In  politics, such a training ground is the Small Constitution.  However, instead of trying ideas out, our politicians are  attempting to impose on the population whatever they think fit.  And yet the Constitution cannot be merely the outcome of  decisions by politicians. It must be the end result of a  political process.    [Grochowski] You mean, it must be the culmination of a  certain stage of political change?    [Falandysz] Yes, otherwise it is very difficult to define  Poland's future.    [Grochowski] We know there is an urgent need to define  powers concerning Poland's defense. The president wants to form  a National Security Council. Will the present conflict not  block this idea?    [Falandysz] Presidential ideas about national defense have  always been in danger of being rejected by a parliamentary  majority. One can understand parliament's reluctance to increase  the president's powers, but as the president is constitutionally  responsible for Polish security, his powers in this sphere have  to be wider. This topic will be very difficult to discuss, but  I still think that an agreement on it will be reached. I think  the views of the military community should determine the outcome  of this debate, because for understandable reasons, the army is  subject to different rules.    [Grochowski] The president has said he sees no possibility  of cooperating with a parliament that is dominated by the left  wing. Does this inability to cooperate with parliament only  concern constitutional issues?    [Falandysz] The president has made it clear that he sees no  possibility of discussing his constitutional initiative with  parliament. But he has also said that he will cooperate with  the Sejm speaker on every other issue. That should dissolve all  the speculation.</p>

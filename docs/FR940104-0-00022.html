			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While not mandating organizational separation, Standard G ensures against affiliate preference and the discriminatory dissemination of information by requiring a pipeline to provide, to the maximum extent practicable, for the independent functioning of ``operating personnel'' of the pipeline and its marketing affiliate. The contemporaneous disclosure mandate of Standard F requires that to the extent a pipeline provides to a marketing affiliate any information related to transportation of natural gas, it must provide that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers, affiliated and nonaffiliated, on its system. Standard G's requirement that operating employees are to function independently to the maximum extent practicable will help ensure that the opportunity to share such information is minimized. If, for example, a pipeline and its marketing affiliate could evade the contemporaneous disclosure requirement simply by using the same person to arrange transportation on the pipeline and market gas for the affiliate, the rule would be substantially undermined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the rulemaking proceeding, however, the Commission has held that complete divestment, divorcement, or organizational separation of pipelines and their marketing affiliates is not necessary to prevent the abuses at which the marketing affiliates rule is aimed. The independent functioning requirement does not require a pipeline to separate all of its employees from those of a marketing affiliate, but rather only operating employees. This determination is consistent with the Commission's finding that complete organizational separation is unnecessary and may even be harmful where divestment chills essential day-to-day communications between the pipeline and its affiliate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission stated in Order No. 497&hyph;A that the phrase ```operating employees' can include officers, directors and managers as well as non-management employees.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, without further clarification of that phrase, pipelines may not be able to identify properly every ``operating employee,'' especially those shared with their affiliate. Since different pipelines are faced with different practical circumstances, a person's status as an ``operating employee'' will, in many situations, depend not on his or her occupation or title, but on his or her actual function within the company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order No. 497&hyph;A at 31,598.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To provide further guidance, the Commission interprets ``operating employee'' to mean an individual who has day-to-day duties and responsibilities for planning, directing, organizing, or carrying out gas-related operations, including gas transportation, gas sales or gas marketing activities. Examples of operating employees include any member of the board of directors, officers, managers, supervisors, regulatory and technical personnel with duties involving day-to-day gas purchasing, marketing, sales, transportation, operations, dispatching, storage, or related activities. Such operating employees may be expected to receive and use information concerning such functions for the benefit of the specific entity for which they work directly. Under normal circumstances, employees, including highly-placed operatives such as members of the board of directors or officers of the corporations, who do not have such duties would not be likely to receive or use transportation-related information subject to Standard F. To the extent a non-operating person obtains such information and provides it to the marketing affiliate, the pipeline would be required to disclose the information contemporaneously pursuant to Standard F.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees with no direct operational responsibilities and whose duties are only supportive in nature need not be considered operating employees. Examples of non-operating employees include support personnel not engaged in the day-to-day marketing, sales, transportation or other gas-related operations of the affiliated companies, clerical and secretarial staff, general office building maintenance personnel, and payroll and general accounting staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Extension of Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Commission will only extend the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1993, until June 30, 1994, because contemporaneously with this order the Commission is issuing a NOPR in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000 which, among other things, substantially revises Order No. 497's reporting requirements. The Commission believes that extending the sunset provision to June 30, 1994, will allow the Commission enough time to issue a final rule setting forth the new reporting requirements and will also prevent any gaps in the reporting requirements which would occur if the Commission simply let the sunset provision lapse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Information Collection Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations require approval of certain information collection requirements imposed by agency rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The subject order does not establish any new information collection requirements and does not reduce the reporting requirements under FERC&hyph;592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, as revised by Commission Order Nos. 497&hyph;D and 636 (OMB Control No. 1902&hyph;0157). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR 1320.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

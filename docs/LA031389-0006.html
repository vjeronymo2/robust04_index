Reached by telephone from Beijing, the sources said  there was no overt evidence of anti-Chinese unrest in Lhasa as security forces  maintained an iron grip on the city during its fifth day under martial law.  Residents and foreign travelers have placed the number of arrests since the  imposition of martial law at more than 1,000. The decree was imposed after  three days of rioting by Tibetans.  </P></p>

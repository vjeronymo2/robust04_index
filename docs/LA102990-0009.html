			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETE? OR DIANNE?;  </P> <P> A RANGE OF VOICES ARGUES THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A CHOICE;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN: WORKING PEOPLE'S REAL ALLY  </P> <P> Growing up in all-white Westchester in postwar Los Angeles, I thought that  people who worked hard could make a good life for themselves and a better life  for their kids. Now I know that this dream never came true for lots of people,  especially minorities, women and low-income whites, no matter how hard they  worked.  </P> <P> Today, white and minority Californians alike need a wake-up call to vote their  self-interest, because the dream is vanishing for just about everybody.  </P> <P> Real income for working Californians has eroded steadily since 1980. Families  must send two wage-earners into the daily fray to survive. Forced overtime and  long commutes on crowded freeways have made a mockery of the eight-hour  workday. Millions of Californians go without basic health care. Increasingly,  employers are hiring temporary workers to avoid paying benefits.  </P> <P> Who can working Californians turn to in such times? The Republican Party will  do what it has always done in this century: protect the wealthy and their class  privileges. Democrats, while sometimes needing a boot to get started, are the  only party that fights for fairness in our economy.  </P> <P> Dianne Feinstein and the Democrats, not Pete Wilson and the Republicans,  believe that the state minimum wage should be periodically adjusted for  inflation. And they will defend the eight-hour workday against the drive by  corporate Republican interests to pass a 12-hour overtime law.  </P> <P> Feinstein and the Democrats, not Wilson and the Republicans, will try to give  all working Californians access to affordable health care -- and they'll see to  it that employers who provide health care won't have to subsidize those who  refuse to do so.  </P> <P> My union was formed in 1900 to clean up the garment sweatshops and to win  decent pay and the eight-hour day. Today we must continue this fight against a  powerful retrograde movement led by the Republican Party. That is why we  support Dianne Feinstein and oppose Pete Wilson.  </P></p>

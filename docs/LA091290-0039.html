			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> VIVID SOUTH AMERICAN IMAGES  </P> <P> More than 100 films and videos representing 25 Pacific Rim cultures are being  screened through Sunday. Highlights of programs today and Thursday are reviewed  here:  </P> <P> Thursday  </P> <P> Ugetsu  </P> <P> Japan  </P> <P>  Airs Thursday on KCET-TV Channel 28 at 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  There are images in Kenji Mizoguchi's 1953 "Ugetsu," one of the most famous  and celebrated of all Japanese films, that linger in the memory for a lifetime  -- most notably, that of a man and a woman enjoying a picnic in a meadow.  </P> <P> The woman, however, is a beautiful, aristocratic ghost (Machiko Kyo) while the  man is but a humble potter (Masayuki Mori), whose loyal wife is played by  Kinuyo Tanaka. Interwoven in this struggle is Mizoguchi's characteristic  concern for the battle between creativity and destruction. As usual in a  Mizoguchi film, women are the true central figures, and Mizoguchi is as  masterful a director of actresses as was George Cukor.KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Burmese troops fired on a demonstration by about 500 people in a Rangoon  suburb, killing one protester, Rangoon Radio reported. It was the first  reported fatal shooting by security forces in the nation's capital since the  army took power in a bloody crackdown last September. Burma's main opposition  leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, was detained after a scuffle broke out while she was  laying wreaths to honor 1,000 demonstrators killed a year ago by the military,  official sources said. Aung San Suu Kyi, 44-year-old daughter of assassinated  independence hero Aung San, and 15 followers rounded up with her were released  after an interrogation, the sources said.  </P></p>

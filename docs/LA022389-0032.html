			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ASSAILANT KILLED BY POLICE OFFICER IS IDENTIFIED  </P> <P> A man fatally shot by a San Diego police officer who said the man charged at  him with a board was identified by authorities Wednesday.  </P> <P> A coroner's spokesman said that Wayde Rex Pratt, 29, of the 2800 block of  Judith Avenue in San Diego, died of a gunshot wound to his chest.  </P> <P> Officer James E. Kremer was on patrol near Main Street and Saturn Boulevard on  Tuesday when Pratt, who was on foot, blocked Kremer's path as Kremer drove  toward him, a police spokesman said. Pratt, who was unemployed, walked toward  the patrol car, and, when Kremer got out, began to yell, "You're not a police  officer!" the spokesman said.  </P> <P> After Kremer backed up and called for cover with his walkie-talkie, Pratt  picked up a 2-by-6-inch board about 3 feet long and rushed toward the officer  while holding the board above his head, police said. Kremer then drew his  9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol and shot the man in the chest, killing him  instantly.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Bill Robinson said the shooting is being investigated and  Kremer is on administrative duty as a matter of routine.  </P> <P> Officer Mark Heacox, who Tuesday shot a man he believed was trying to run him  over in a City Heights parking lot, also has been taken off field duty pending  an investigation.  </P> <P> Ronald Bowman, 26, was in serious but stable condition at Mercy Hospital on  Wednesday after surgery to remove a bullet from his neck.  </P> <P> According to police, the shooting occurred Tuesday afternoon after Heacox  approached a car, which he had confirmed was stolen, in a parking lot at  Modesto and Juniper streets.  </P> <P> The driver of the car backed out of its parking space and gunned the engine as  Heacox approached, police said. The officer fired two shots at the car, then  dived out of the way.  </P> <P> Police said the suspect drove out of the parking lot but pulled over soon  afterward because he was bleeding heavily.  </P></p>

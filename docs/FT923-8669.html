			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Detention camps distract the world: While Serbs try to save face, the sieges go on and Bosnia's Moslems are still suffering SINCE television pictures of Serb-controlled detention camps flashed across the world last week, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, has been engaged in an apparent face-saving exercise. He has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to inspect the camps and suggested they be placed under international supervision. Western diplomats said at the weekend that all camps - Croat, Serb, and Moslem - should be opened and put under international control. But this could play into the hands of the Bosnian Serb leaders. If they are set free, the thousands of people held in the camps will become the problem of the international community. 'They will become refugees. Their homes have been destroyed. They have nothing left to go home to. They will have to seek refuge in some other European country. That is exactly what Mr Karadzic and his friends want,' a diplomat in Belgrade said yesterday. Moreover, in focusing on the camps, Serb leaders in Bosnia hope to deflect western governments' attention from what is taking place elsewhere. The Bosnian capital of Sarajevo is entering its fifth month of siege by Serb irregulars. In north-west Bosnia, the same forces are besieging Bihac, where Moslems make up 67 per cent of the population of 70,800. The town could be another Sarajevo, said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at the weekend. In the east of the republic, Serb irregulars have kept the town of Gorazde under constant bombardment for four months. They continue to prevent food and medicine from reaching the 37,000 inhabitants, 70 per cent of them Moslem. Yesterday they threatened a final assault to capture the town. Also in eastern Bosnia, Tuzla, whose Moslem population makes up 47 per cent of the 131,000 inhabitants, has been repeatedly attacked by Serb irregulars over the past three months. 'What we must not lose sight of is the land-grab being undertaken by Serbia in the east, and in the north-west of Bosnia, and by Croatia in the west of the republic, in Hercegovina,' according to a US diplomat in Belgrade yesterday. 'However terrible the camps are, we must not forget that Bosnia is being divided by Croatia and Serbia, and that the Moslems are the victims of this aggression. Serbia will stop bombarding these towns once they have got what they want.' For this reason, the Bosnian leadership - which is not exclusively Moslem - continues to call for international military intervention to prevent further destruction of the republic and deportation of the Moslem community. Moslems make up 43 per cent of the 4.3m population of Bosnia, where Serbs, who account for 31 per cent, now control 70 per cent of the territory. Bosnians believe even military force to back up the international humanitarian aid effort will not stop the deportations, or the wholesale destruction of their towns and cities. 'Take the siege of Sarajevo. The Serbs want to draw a green line through our city,' said Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister. 'They want to create ethnically pure cantons throughout Bosnia. What will the Moslems be left with? What will become of the kind of centuries-old co-existence of Serbs, Croats and Moslems in Sarajevo?' A senior UN official in Belgrade said: 'The war has radicalised the Moslems. They feel betrayed by the slow, indecisive, and late response by western governments. 'Why should they believe in a ceasefire when they see it only consolidates the gains made by the Serbs - and the Croats?' Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is to address an emergency meeting of MEPs in Brussels today about the crisis in Bosnia, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. The deputies are expected to voice concerns about the plight of refugees from Bosnia and the detention camps in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Paul Grossrieder, deputy director of the International Committee of the Red Cross, will tell the meeting about the detention camps, following last week's graphic descriptions of the suffering of Moslem captives. The meeting will also be attended by representatives of the UN High Commission for Refugees. Mr Egon Klepsch, president of the European Parliament, has called together up to 130 members of a number of parliamentary committees - including those on foreign affairs and security, and on civil liberties  - to discuss the crisis. The parliament is expected to issue at least a declaration on the refugee problem, but it is likely to have only symbolic value, as the principal EC policy decisions on the crisis are in the hands of the member states, under the British presidency.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Daewoo plans European car distribution network South Korea's Daewoo group yesterday said it would establish next year an independent distribution network to market its cars in eight western European countries. Daewoo Motor, South Korea's third-largest car producer, was prevented from selling its cars directly in Europe under its joint venture contract with General Motors of the US. But under the terms of the agreement ending the partnership in 1992, Daewoo was granted the right to market its cars in Europe in 1995 and in the US in 1996. Daewoo produced the Opel Kadett under licence for GM. The car sales subsidiaries, to be managed by the group's trading company Daewoo Corporation, will be in the UK, Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Daewoo will be the first South Korean car manufacturer to establish an independent sales network in Europe.</p>

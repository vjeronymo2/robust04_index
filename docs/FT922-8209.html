			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Banesto bids for Sanson stake CORPORACION Banesto, the industrial arm of the Banesto banking group, announced a Pta12.1bn (Dollars 119m) offer for the 40 per cent of Sanson, a large Catalan cement producer, that it does not already control, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. The Banesto bid follows hard on the heels of two others: Ciments Francais, through its Spanish affiliate Financiera y Minera, is bidding for the rest of Cementos Rezola, in the Basque country, which it does not control and Portland Navarra is bidding for 10 per cent of the Cantabrian producer, Cementos Alfa, in order to control it. With its Pta10,000 a share bid for the rest of Sanson offering a premium of 31.6 per cent on the stock when trading was suspended in Madrid yesterday, the bid seems certain to succeed, analysts said.</p>

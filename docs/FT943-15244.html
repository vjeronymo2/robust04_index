			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Sweden win as Romania pay heavy penalty Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli clinched a place for his team in the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in 36 years by saving two penalties in the sudden-death shoot-out after a see-saw game that left the sides tied 2-2 after extra time. Brolin gave Sweden the lead after a well-worked free-kick in the 79th minute, but Raducioiu kept Romania in the tournament with an 89th minute equaliser against the run of play, then scored a second goal during the first period of extra time. Kennet Andersson put the Swedes back on terms by making the score 2-2 in the 115th minute. The penalty shoot-out moved into sudden death after five kicks for each side failed to break the tie. Each team missed one shot to leave them level at 4-4. Dumitrescu for Romania and Larsson for Sweden scored the next two before Ravelli turned his 115th national team appearance - which tied a Swedish record - into a triumph. He dived for a one-handed save on a hesitant kick by Romanian defender Belodedici to set up a clash with Brazil - a rematch of a first-round game that ended 1-1. As the Swedish players leapt for joy at the end of the shoot-out, Romania's players sat motionless in the centre circle, reliving the heartbreak of four years ago when they were knocked out of the World Cup on penalties by Ireland in Genoa.</p>

The leader of the Conservative Party [PK],  Aleksander Hall, has also protested against the method of  dismissal of Marek Markiewicz. He feels that the activities of  the president are, regardless of his intentions, such as to  bring disturbance into the public life of the country and to  favor destabilization.    The press spokesman of the Constitutional Tribunal, Adam  Jankiewicz, has reported that the tribnunal may consider an  application on the matter of the determination of a ruling on  the decision of President Lech Walesa on the recall of the  chairman of KRRiT over a period of at least two weeks from its  being received by the tribunal.</p>

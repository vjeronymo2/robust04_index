			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THE OIL CONNECTIONS'  </P> <P> Your editorial ("The Oil Connections," April 15) which called for the  cancellation of federal plans to promote offshore oil drilling off the coast of  Northern California was eloquent and timely, yet ironically deficient in its  failure to focus on the threat to the coast of Southern California.  </P> <P> Lease Sale 95 is a federal plan to lease 5 million acres extending from San  Diego to San Luis Obispo. Southern Californians need to take a hard look at the  costs and benefits of offshore oil drilling.  </P> <P> The adverse environmental impacts of offshore oil development are substantial.  On average, each drilling platform generates 75,000 to 100,000 tons of toxic  waste which are dumped over the side into the ocean.  </P> <P> In one day, a single exploratory drill ship releases the smog-generating  equivalent of 7,000 cars driving 50 miles.  </P> <P> The editorial was on the mark by noting that the ability to contain and clean  up spills must be a key consideration in whether to proceed with offshore oil  drilling. According to the Department of the Interior, the probability of a  large spill in California as a result of offshore oil drilling is 99%. Based on  a Coast Guard analysis and our experience in Alaska, we know that on average,  only 5% to 15% of a spill can be cleaned up.  </P> <P> The President's OCS task force will be holding public meetings in the San  Diego/Los Angeles area the week of May 22, to hear citizens views on Lease Sale  95. This is an opportunity for Southern California residents to say "no more  Alaskas," and call for responsible development if there is to be any  development at all.  </P> <P> The American Oceans Conservation Committee is the political arm of the American  Oceans Campaign. The AOCC is a broad-based coalition of elected officials and  citizens opposed to Lease Sale 95, and committed to working with Congress for  development of a national energy policy that minimizes the conflict with the  environment. We have developed educational brochures on offshore oil drilling.  </P> <P> We urge elected officials, business people and other citizens to take a hard  look at the future, and evaluate whether we can actually afford offshore oil  drilling.  </P> <P> We hope that The Times will play a continuing role in the discussion of the  pros and cons of Lease Sale 95.  </P> <P> LESLIE GAINER  </P> <P> Associate Director  </P> <P> AOCC  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Rivals clash over Bristol's airspace: How BAe's plan to develop its Filton airfield has met with opposition IT HAS all the ingredients of a classic dogfight, with thousands of workers and residents caught in the crossfire. To the north of Bristol, British Aerospace intends to develop its Filton airfield, once the proving ground for Concorde, as a commercial airport. To the south, determined to defend its identity, is the existing Bristol airport, owned by Labour-controlled Bristol City Council. Filton, once an RAF station, has several advantages. Its runway is longer and it is close to the city centre, the M4 and M5 and the Severn Bridge. Bristol's existing airport at Lulsgate, where traffic is increasing rapidly, is reached down a winding country road. BAe and its supporters are scornful of local opposition to its ambitious plans for Filton. 'It is only the old lady and her dog against it,' says Mr Malcolm Ginsberg of Air Bristol, which wants to start scheduled flights from Filton in direct competition to Lulsgate. The issues at stake are not simply those of rivalry. BAe has obtained a commercial licence for Filton from the Civil Aviation Authority and believes it does not need planning permission for a change of use from the present mixture of business operations. 'We have this licence and we are simply enacting it,' Mr Ian Woodward, a BAe official, says. 'We are not seeking to be devious nor to upset our neighbours.' BAe's stance has caused the district council, Northavon, to reach for a lawyer. It has caused Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general and a local MP, to express concern and antagonised another local Conservative MP, Mr Michael Stern. The presence of a new town on the eastern side of the airfield makes the dispute more controversial. Four thousand houses have been built there creating the new town of Bradley Stoke, which is scheduled to double in size by 2000. Bradley Stoke advertises itself as 'a new community environment'. Presumably this does not mean it could be under the approach path of a regional airport. There are powerful groups in both camps. BAe has the backing of its unions in making best use of its airfield to protect the future of Filton, where the work includes Airbus. It has the tacit support of Rolls-Royce at its neighbouring Patchway plant. In recent years thousands of jobs have been lost at the two sites. Only this month Rolls-Royce announced that a further 1,400 jobs would go at Patchway. BAe says the airfield costs Pounds 1m a year to run and, with work at Filton declining, the plant's future could be jeopardised unless more use is made of it. Under its plans, commercial flights would be limited to freight and scheduled services with its 'whisper' jet, the BAe 146. Air Bristol, a fledgling airline which is about to apply for an operator's licence, wants to lease BAe 146 jets and start scheduled services by late spring. Meanwhile Mr Les Wilson, managing director of Bristol airport, says the city cannot afford two airports. 'There is no city in Europe which is not a capital which has two airports.' Lulsgate's viability is being threatened just when it is embarking on a Pounds 50m 10-year development programme for which it is seeking private finance that could entail some form of privatisation. Northavon council says it has been 'inundated' with letters protesting about the Filton plan. Its legal advice over whether fresh planning consent is required is that the position is not clear cut. It is to meet BAe this week. BAe gained its commercial licence as long ago as 1988 but nobody outside the aviation industry seems to have noticed. In awarding a licence, the CAA states it is only concerned with safety and not with the environment. Sir John Cope, MP for Northavon, says local people fear that Filton might start with modest proposals but become a full regional airport in five or 10 years. Mr Stern hopes Northavon will decide that fresh planning consent is required. He is prepared to challenge that in the courts if it does not. He says BAe has gone back on assurances that it had no plans for commercial use. More opposition comes from Mr Tom Hood, marketing manager of Bradley Stoke Consortium, a roll call of builders from Beazer to Wimpey which hold large parcels of as yet undeveloped land. 'I believe it is morally wrong. If you want to bring in an extra 350,000 passengers a year to an airport then you should get planning permission.' In contrast Mr Ginsberg says a successful regional airport would even put value on the houses near the airport. He dismisses the environmental protests. 'The BAe 146 doesn't make any noise,' he says. 'There is a groundswell of local opinion which is very firmly in favour of Filton.' He argues that the airports could be complementary, with Filton having the scheduled services and Lulsgate the charter flights. The furore over Filton comes as traffic at Lulsgate is running at 1m passengers a year. The airport's priority is a new Pounds 14m terminal but its construction is delayed - ironically by planning requirements. The local district council, Woodspring, has set conditions which the airport is resisting. There will be a public inquiry in May. If BAe does succeed in its plans, the new Lulsgate terminal may be redundant.</p>

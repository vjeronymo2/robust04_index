			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg bid war starts The merchant bank sector was set alight with news that SG Warburg and big US investment bank Morgan Stanley were in merger talks. Speculation had been smouldering for some time, although it had focused on US rival JP Morgan. Yesterday it flared up, prompting a Stock Exchange announcement that share prices shown on dealing screens were merely indicative. An hour of intense upside pressure saw Warburg shares up 146p at their best and forced the UK merchant bank to announce that it was in talks. 'Warburg has just bought itself into play and this one's going through the roof,' said one dealer. 'It could go to Pounds 12 or Pounds 15.' Many saw it as the opening of an auction that could include banks such as Dresdner, of Germany. Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'It is a once in a decade event when a leading financial institution in the UK puts its hands up and effectively says it would be better off as part of a larger group.' The house would not comment on its valuations but rivals said it was talking of an ultimate figure as high as Pounds 16. James Capel believes a US bank such as JP Morgan might enter the fray, perhaps because it merely wants to see the exit price bid higher but also because it has previously expressed an interest. Warburg shares closed 119 up at 791p on turnover of 10m, the second most active volume recorded in the stock. Morgan Stanley was trading Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 57 7/8 in New York as London closed. UBS, however, takes a more downbeat view. It believes that any merger will run into big regulatory problems and a rival bidder is unlikely.</p>

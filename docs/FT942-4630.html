			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Luxembourg Voting Sunday. The Luxembourg coalition government, composed of the Christian Socialist and Socialist parties, is firmly in favour of economic and monetary union. Luxembourg is also a firm backer of political union. The government parties are keen to ensure that the rights of small states are safeguarded in the 1996 Maastricht review conference. The opposition Liberals, formerly firmly in favour of European union, are now more sceptical. LIKELY RESULT: The government parties are expected to maintain their supremacy, keeping five of six seats.</p>

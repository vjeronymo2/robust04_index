			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTER HAWLEY STILL STRUGGLES;  </P> <P> RETAILING: A LOSS IS LIKELY THIS YEAR FOR THE DEBT-STRAPPED OWNER OF THE  BROADWAY-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STORES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPRESS OPTIMISM  ABOUT A TURNAROUND.  </P> <P> For Carter Hawley Hale Stores, these were supposed to be good times.  </P> <P> Three years ago, in spurning a hostile takeover, the Los Angeles retailer spoke  of a coming turnaround in the department store business, including its own  Broadway-Southern California stores and four other chains.  </P> <P> Profit, it said, would climb steadily. In a 566-page document prepared as part  of a reorganization plan, Carter Hawley told shareholders that profit would  reach $85 million in fiscal 1990, which ended Saturday. Instead, there's likely  to be a loss of at least $2 million. Saddled with debt, the company made only  $17.7 million in 1988 and $13.5 million in 1989.  </P> <P> "It's almost like a bad joke," said Edward A. Weller, a highly regarded analyst  with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley's many critics say the company, after years of comforting itself  with an upbeat assessment of its own prospects, now faces serious problems.  They contend that the company -- one of the nation's biggest department store  empires with 114 outlets -- continues to suffer from aging stores that are  badly run down and merchandising programs that fall flat. In contrast to  prosperous, trend-setting retailers such as customer service-minded Nordstrom  and discount-minded Wal-Mart Stores, Carter Hawley offers "nothing that really  distinguishes it from the crowd," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist for the  retail consulting firm Management Horizons in Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> Many analysts maintain that Carter Hawley is so weighed down by debt that it  eventually will be forced to sell out to another firm or, at the very least,  divest one or more of its divisions.  </P> <P> But the company remains optimistic. "We have been successful in setting the  right direction," said Philip M. Hawley, the company's chief executive since  1977 and its chairman since 1983. "I think we have put some very important  strategic objectives in place. We've defined the mission of the company  clearly."  </P> <P> He said there is "no question" that profit will recover over the next few  years, even if the economy stumbles.  </P> <P> Hawley predicts that customer traffic in the stores will grow briskly as the  company's store remodeling program gains momentum. "We get a very major profit,  and sales pop, when we modernize stores," he said.  </P> <P> Further, he says, the shifting of sales clerks to a commission-based pay system  in the late 1980s will yield further gains. At the same time, Hawley says,  expenses will be curbed by a continuing consolidation of back-office and  administrative operations.  </P> <P> Hawley says the company also will benefit from new top management installed  over the past two years at every Carter Hawley division other than its flagship  Broadway-Southern California chain. The management changes came at  Phoenix-based Broadway-Southwest, Emporium in the Bay Area, Sacramento's  Weinstocks chain and Richmond-based Thalhimers.  </P> <P> "It's a 180-degree change from what had been going on," Hawley said.  </P> <P> Hawley points to the Broadway store in Montclair as an example of what he  expects to happen throughout the company. Two of the store's floors were  renovated in 1986, and it also is one of the locations where Carter Hawley is  making an extra effort to improve customer service through its "model store"  program. The result: Sales have risen 51.6% over the past four years, versus  12.5% for the company overall.  </P> <P> Carter Hawley followers also are looking for a spurt in revenue when the  company reopens its earthquake-ravaged Emporium store in Oakland on Friday,  opens a new Broadway location in Santa Barbara on Aug. 17 and replaces an old  Thalhimers in Winston-Salem, N.C., in October. Analysts are hopeful that the  rampant price-cutting competition among department stores the past year will  ease, boosting profit margins.  </P> <P> But many others who follow the company say recent developments are not enough  to perk up Carter Hawley, given its history of weak profits. Hawley "is still  the same optimist he was 25 years ago. He's not a realist," said Robert F.  McCullough, chairman of McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello. The San Francisco  investment firm is Carter Hawley's No. 2 shareholder, with nearly 8% of its  stock.  </P> <P> According to figures from the Value Line Investment Survey, Carter Hawley's  profitability has lagged the retailing industry average every year since 1975.  The charges from the 1987 restructuring wiped out the company's slim net  profits the past five years.  </P> <P> The company still faces big obstacles. Burdened with heavy junk bond debts  since reorganizing, it needs plenty of income just to make its interest  payments, let alone pay for remodelings. Yet the retailing industry is in the  midst of a competitive blood bath that has prompted one debt-heavy store after  another to seek refuge in bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the economy isn't cooperating. Analysts are worrying about the  prospect of a national recession. Closer to home, Southern California is being  hit by massive aerospace layoffs.  </P> <P> No one is predicting that Carter Hawley will join the roster of retailers in  bankruptcy. Many analysts believe that operating earnings generally are  improving or at least stabilizing, and they say the company is bolstered by  extensive real estate holdings that can be sold or mortgaged for cash.  </P> <P> Also, no big principal payments are due on Carter Hawley's $350 million in junk  bond debt until 1996. That gives management time to maneuver if -- as expected  -- suppliers and their lenders stay calm and stick with the company.  </P> <P> Still, debt clouds the company's future. McCullough says he has invested in  Carter Hawley on the expectation that the company eventually will be bought,  broken up or run by new management.  </P> <P> For many of Carter Hawley's 37,000 employees, the company's uncertain future is  particularly troubling, even beyond the issue of whether their jobs could be  jeopardized someday. Employees own 46% of Carter Hawley's stock through a  company 401(k) savings plan, a fund through which workers buy company stock,  typically to supplement their company pension. Yet the stock closed at $5.25  Friday, near its all-time low and down from $14 a year ago.  </P> <P> For outside investors who have held Carter Hawley stock since 1986, there is  the frustration of knowing that their holdings probably would be worth 70% more  today if the company had accepted a $1.93-billion takeover offer from the  Limited and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. four years ago.  </P> <P> Shareholder activists have charged that Carter Hawley executives ignored the  interests of investors and acted primarily to save their own jobs when they  rejected the Limited-DeBartolo bid. "It was an outrageous example of management  efforts to entrench itself," said James E. Heard, managing director of the  Analysis Group.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there is no assurance that the raiders would have fared  better with Carter Hawley. DeBartolo, for his part, also happened to be a  partner with developer Robert Campeau in a disastrous foray into the department  store business.  </P> <P> To fend off raiders, Carter Hawley reorganized in 1987 by recapitalizing and  spinning off its specialty chains -- the Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and  Contempo Casuals stores. They had accounted for nearly one-third of Carter  Hawley's sales and half its profit.  </P> <P> Hawley, one of the company's namesakes (the company changed its name from  Broadway-Hale Stores to Carter Hawley Hale in 1974), dismisses the shareholder  activists' charges. He notes that shareholders overwhelmingly approved the  restructuring that headed off the takeover attempt.  </P> <P> Further, Hawley says, shareholders had plenty of time between the announcement  of the overhaul in December, 1986, and its execution in September, 1987, to  sell their stock at $60 or more in the open market. Company officials say that  indicates that the restructuring plan was at least as good as the  Limited-DeBartolo offer, and they believe Carter Hawley is better off being  owned largely by its employees.  </P> <P> Some analysts today ridicule the financial projections made for the  reorganization in 1987. But the company's supporters say the Bay Area  earthquake and the difficulties in the department store business are partly to  blame. "That was outside of management's control," said Robert W. Gordon, a  vice president with Bank of America, the company's principal lender.  </P> <P> Hawley concedes that he was over-optimistic. He says that one of the main  problems was that he didn't anticipate how long it would take to arrange  financing for what he views as the crucial store remodeling effort.  </P> <P> But Hawley proudly defends his approach to financing the company. By taking its  time, he says, the company has been able to raise funds at relatively  attractive interest rates.  </P> <P> Lately, it has raised more and more of its cash by mortgaging its real estate.  Just last week, the company raised $30 million in a mortgage deal, and Hawley  says real estate remains a solid source of financing despite the general  softness in California property values.  </P> <P> He also notes that other debt-heavy retailers that relied more on junk bond  financing have gotten into serious trouble, particularly the Campeau Corp.  department store divisions, which filed for bankruptcy court protection in  January.  </P> <P> "We don't have room to indulge in paying that kind of price for money," said  Hawley. "Has that made operating the last three years more difficult? You bet  it has."  </P> <P> Operating the business may be even tougher than executives acknowledge. Analyst  Barre W. Littel of First Boston, who just published a report on Carter Hawley,  maintains that the financial measure that the company cites as the most  accurate indicator of its performance doesn't tell the full story. The  financial yardstick in question is earnings before interest and taxes, known in  the financial community as EBIT.  </P> <P> Investors and analysts typically are more interested in a company's actual  profit. But Carter Hawley and other companies argue that EBIT reflects how well  they would do if they were not burdened with heavy debts and thus signals what  can be expected of them once their debts are retired.  </P> <P> In Carter Hawley's case, EBIT climbed from $66.9 million in 1984 to $172.8  million in 1989 and is up slightly for the first nine months of this fiscal  year, despite the Bay Area quake. Littel points out that part of the EBIT  increase over the past two years has come from expansion of the company's  credit card business. The trouble, Littel says, is that EBIT reflects the extra  credit card revenue, but not the extra costs.  </P> <P> If you add in the costs, Littel says, Carter Hawley's performance appears to  have been flat last year and down this year. Carter Hawley rejects Littel's  conclusions, saying that he miscalculated the costs of its credit card program.  </P> <P> All the same, Hawley acknowledges that Carter Hawley's EBIT remains well below  par for the industry. Moreover, Carter Hawley also lags in other measures of  performance watched by analysts.  </P> <P> For instance, the sales per square foot at its Broadway-Southern California  stores -- the region's biggest department store chain, with 43 outlets -- are  lower than those at Nordstrom, Bullock's and Robinson's and barely exceed those  at May Co. California.  </P> <P> Said Kurt Barnard, publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report: "Carter  Hawley has some very real problems on its hands, problems in terms of  marketing, merchandising and customer appeal. Above all, I think Carter Hawley  is in a quandary as to who its target customer is, and how to reach that  customer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW CARTER HAWLEY'S OUTSIDE INVESTORS FARED  </P> <P> Most outside investors would be better off today if Carter Hawley Hale Stores  had accepted the takeover offers made for the company in 1984 and 1986. The  following shows how outside shareholders would have fared with either takeover  offer versus how they actually fared.  </P> <P> Outside shareholders are considered to be investors other than employees and  General Cinema Corp., which was Carter Hawley's largest shareholder before  Carter Hawley restructured in 1987. Under the restructuring, investors received  one share of the Neiman Marcus Group and $17 in cash for each share of Carter  Hawley they owned. They also kept their Carter Hawley stock.  </P> <P> What investors would have today if Carter Hawley accepted the $35-a-share offer  in 1984: $62.00 per share.  </P> <P> What investors would have today if Carter Hawley accepted the $60-a-share offer  in 1986: $83.85 per share.  </P> <P> What investors who bought Carter Hawley stock in 1984 actually have today --  $47.94 per share.  </P> <P> All figures assume that proceeds and dividends under each scenario were  reinvested at a 10% annual rate of return, a return that is lower than the  performance of the overall stock market during the period.  </P> <P> Source: United Shareholders Assn.  </P> <P> 401(k) BENEFITS DISPUTED: Not everyone thinks employees are getting a good deal  from Carter Hawley's savings program.

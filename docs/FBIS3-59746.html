			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  A. Overview </H5>   Backed by technological innovation that continues to evolve  rapidly, the society and economy of Japan are starting to  undergo major developments in urbanization,  informationalization, globalization, and the advance into a more  aged society as the 21st century nears. To maintain housing and  social capital in such a setting, the government must cope with  the changes in social trends, the needs and perceptions of the  citizens, as well as the changes surrounding construction  affairs.    Given such a situation, on 13 May 1992 the Minister for  Construction submitted to the Construction Technology  Development Council a report entitled "The Vision of  Construction Technology Development with Prospects for the 21st  Century." That report clarified the future directions of  construction technology development and listed priority research  topics, promotion policies, and the roles of industry,  government, and universities.  <H5>  1. Basic Policies on Construction Technology R&amp;D </H5>   As indicated in the Basic Public Investment Plan, the years  remaining in this century are an important time for forming good  social capital and stock. In the maintenance of housing and  social capital from now on, we must tackle improvements in  productivity and operational safety, and, with consideration  always given to future increases in the costs of maintaining and  renovating buildings, the maintenance of housing and social  capital must be harmonious with the environment, including the  global environment.    As the directions in which to proceed with the maintenance  of  housing and social capital, it is important 1) that the  facilities are easy-to-use, beautiful, and strong, 2) that  consideration is given to the environment, and 3) and that  construction is carried out efficiently and safely.    The report sets forth the following as the concrete R&amp;D  objectives and the priority R&amp;D themes to correspond with  those  directions in the maintenance of housing and social capital. 1)  Automated and man-power-saving technology at construction sites  to cope with a smaller labor force; 2) Maintenance-free  technology to cope with the inevitable increases in the costs of  maintaining and renovating facilities; 3) Energy-conservation  technology for coping with global environmental problems.    The following shows the concrete development goals for those  themes.    (1) Automation and Man-Power-Saving Technology    The goal is to develop technology that will achieve an  overall two-thirds saving in manpower by automation and  conservation of manpower in all aspects of construction.    (2) Maintenance-Free Technology    The goals are to make new and renovated facilities  maintenance-free and to develop technology that will keep  maintenance and management costs at their current levels. By  extending the number of years that new and renovated facilities  will last, the aim is to develop technology for reducing by  two-thirds the renovation investments needed with the current  number of years that facilities can be used.    (3) Energy-Saving Technology    The goal is to develop technology for reducing by up to  two-thirds the overall energy consumption per unit production in  order to keep the amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions at their  current level, as based on the October 1990 Cabinet decision.  <H5>  2. R&amp;D Promotion Measures </H5>   The MOC will set up project teams consisting of people from  the ministry, regional construction groups, laboratories, etc.;  clearly set forth the development objectives; and effectivate  prioritized R&amp;D. Then, to develop and distribute the  technology,  the MOC will use a system of general technology development  projects, joint research involving the government and the  private sector, a construction technology evaluation system, and  technology inspection and demonstration for construction  technology developed by the private sector.    The following diagram illustrates the process, from  implementing the technology development to the application and  distribution of the technology.     <H5>  B. Overview of the R&amp;D </H5>   The budget for construction technology R&amp;D, as shown in  the  following table, amounts to &yen;6.386 billion, which is 1.3  times that of the previous year. New general technology projects  that will begin in FY93 are "the development of technology for  creating beautiful scenery" and "the development of technology  for evaluating fire-prevention and fire-resistant performance."

Development of Technology for the Maintenance of  Easy-To-Use, Beautiful, Durable, and Easy-To-Maintain Housing  and Social Capital </H3>   (1) Development of Technology for Functional Improvements in  Maintenance and Renovation of Housing and Social Capital  (general technology development project, FY91-95)    Important issues from now on are appropriately maintaining,  managing, and preserving the functions of the housing and social  capital that has been developed thus far, and making  improvements by modifying those functions that are not in tune  with the times.    This effort involves 1) developing ways to use infrared  beams, ultrasound waves, etc., to quickly and non-destructively  survey and diagnose public works structures; 2) developing  machinery that works underwater for surveying and repairing  underwater structures; 3) technology for strengthening and  improving the durability of concrete floor plates for elevated  roadways, etc.; and 4) developing a housing and social capital  management system that uses computers to diagnose and evaluate  deterioration.    (2) Development of Technology for Creating Beautiful Scenery  (New) (general technology development project, FY93-97)    The maintenance of high-quality housing and social capital  that is in harmony with the environment and beautiful scenery  that brings out the most of a region's uniqueness are desired.  That entails the needs to develop technology for maintaining  scenic areas in which public works structures and buildings  become one with the surrounding environment, and to form  attractive public spaces.    This effort involves the design, construction, and  development of high-quality materials for improving scenery,  with awareness of that which mars the scenery. Furthermore, this  effort will involve R&amp;D and the establishment of methods with  respect to planning, design, and construction for creating  scenic areas with consideration given to ecosystems. And, in  order to more accurately and easily assess various designs, the  MOC will develop a support system that uses computer graphics.  <H3>  2. Developing Technology for Environmentally Harmonious  Housing and Social Capital Maintenance </H3>   (1) Development of Resource-, Energy-Conserving Construction  Technology (general technology development project, FY91-FY95)  Tackling global environmental problems has also become an  important issue in the field of construction. In that,  construction technology development is important in finding  solutions to the problems of excess energy consumption and  CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions due to the use of fossil fuels, which  lead to global warming.    In this effort the MOC will try to determine the amounts of  energy consumption and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions in the field of  construction, and study the choices of construction methods that  will contribute toward reducing energy consumption and the load  on the environment. In addition, the MOC will develop methods to  determine for individual land-use districts the amounts of  energy consumed and the amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emitted as a  result of social and economic activities, and will use that as  data for future land-use decisions.    (2) Development of Technology for Re-Using and Suppressing  the Generation of Construction Byproducts (general technology  development project, FY92-FY96)    Considering the scarcity of final disposal sites, developing  technology for re-using and suppressing the generation of  construction byproducts (leftover soil, construction waste  materials) is an urgent issue. This effort involves the  development of new technology for on-site re-use of construction  wastes, and technology for processing and recycling sidewalk  blocks and other such wastes into construction materials.  Furthermore, the MOC will develop efficient processing machinery  for recycling concrete aggregate from waste concrete, and  technology for recycling the powders generated as by-products of  that processing.    In addition, in joint government-private research, the MOC  will carry out the development of basic technology for creating  green spaces, and will evaluate the following two themes: the  development of efficient direct cleaning systems in rivers and  other such public waterways, and the development of  high-noise-reduction soundproofing.  <H3>  3. Development of Technology for Maintaining Housing and  Social Capital Efficiently and Safely </H3>   (1) Development of New Construction Technology (general  technology development project, FY90-FY94)    Continually dealing with the problems of more older  construction workers and a shortage of skilled laborers,  construction businesses must findways to promote more  efficiency, raise the level of quality and safety, and improve  the work environment. This effort involves the development of  automated construction technology for mechanizing jobs in  dangerous environments to eliminate the need for humans to do  that work. The MOC will also develop pre-fab technology based on  the factory production of reinforced concrete structures, and  will maintain standards compatible with new technologies for  automating and rationalizing construction work so that the new  technologies quickly become more widespread.    In addition, the MOC will engage in the following technology  development for the purposes of more safety in construction  work, and to prevent large objects from crashing down on workers  and workers from coming in contact with construction machinery,  which cause more than half of all accidents: 1) temporary  scaffolding in units so that assembly and disassembly high above  the ground are not necessary; 2) various kinds of sensors and  control technology for preventing workers from coming in contact  with construction machinery; 3) database construction based on  the gathering and analysis of data on accident causes and  countermeasures.    Furthermore, in joint research with the private sector, the  MOC will be involved in the following four themes:        -  the development of an automatic map-information  recognition system,    -  the development of new ground probing  technology,    -  the development of a construction information  system based on IC cards, and    -  the development of  high-performance, functional concrete (new).       The MOC will also evaluate the development of construction  methods for rationalizing the construction of pillars and beams  in reinforced concrete structures.  <H5>  4. Technology Development Involving Basic Topics </H5>   The MOC's technology development efforts involving disaster  prevention, new materials, and other themes outside of the  priority R&amp;D topics are:        -  the development of technology for preventing  earthquake disasters in large cities (general technology  development project, FY92-FY96),    -  the development of systems  for preventing landslide disasters (FY92- FY96),    -  the  development of technology for evaluating fire-prevention and  fire-resistant performance (new, FY93-FY97),    -  the development  of an exterior tile and stone setting system that uses organic  adhesives (joint government-private research, FY93-FY95), and    -  the development of suction prevention sheets for river dikes  (construction technology evaluation system).   <H5>    C. Technology Development Incentives </H5>   To promote technology development in the private sector,  especially, the developed technologies should be put into use.  To that end the MOC is working to provide incentives for  private-sector technology development by utilizing the new  technologies through efforts such as technology application  pilot projects and the test field system.  <H5>  1. Technology Application Pilot Projects </H5>   Since FY87 the MOC has been implementing technology  application pilot projects, which apply newly developed  technologies at construction sites. During FY92 the MOC  formulated technology application themes based on government  needs, the objective of which was to give further impetus to the  private sector's technology development strength, and then  broadly invited the private sector's proposals along the lines  of those themes. During FY93 the MOC plans to implement as  "specific technology application pilot projects" those of the  proposed new private-sector technologies that it investigated  and certified.  <H5>  2. Test Field System </H5>   Targeting the technologies for which future government needs  will be high and for which there is a need to raise the degree  of perfection through on-site verification, the MOC will provide  test fields in actual construction sites, and in FY93 will  institute the "Test Field System." Through that system the MOC  will construct actual-scale structures and conduct various types  of tests.  <H5>  3. Improving the Bidding and Contracting System </H5>   In order to facilitate the private sector's technology  development and actively use those results, "a bidding system  that emphasizes technological strength," "a bidding system that  makes full use of private-sector technology development," and "a  bidding system that includes the contents of technology  proposals in the decision-making process" were proposed in the  Central Construction Industry Council's November 1992 report  entitled "The Basic Model of a Bidding and Contracting System,"  which was in response to the (first) report "How the  Construction Industry Should Be To Cope With New Social and  Economic Factors."  <H5>  4. Tax System Facilitating Technology Development </H5>   In order to actively facilitate technology development in  the  private sector, the period of applicability of a special tax  deduction system for cases where test research expenses  increased and other such cases was extended two years (until 31  March 1995). New tax deduction systems for test research  expenses disbursed for joint research with national laboratories  and for recycling-related test research will also be established  to support technology development in the private sector.  <H5>  D. Conclusion </H5>   Based on the future vision for construction technology  development that has prospects for the 21st century, the MOC  will actively promote government-private joint technology  development, centering on that which is aimed at the development  objectives relating to the highest-priority research themes.</p>

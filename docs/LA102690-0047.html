			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: THEATRICAL TRICKERY IN 'DELICACIES'  </P> <P> "Delicacies" is a restaurant that's high tech in more ways than one, as is  Laura Shamas' play of the same name at Carpet Co. Stage. The maitre d' knows  his customers, and the individualized menus reflect the personalities of the  three married women who are wining and dining their dream men while their  hubbies are tending to business.  </P> <P> The tables are turned a few weeks later when the wives bring their spouses to  Delicacies. The maitre d' knows exactly how to gauge the evening, and the  length of the fuses of the diners.  </P> <P> It's a fascinating piece of theatrical trickery, particularly as the same three  actors play the boyfriends and the husbands. If only the couples themselves  were as fascinating. They're a dull lot, even under Bruce Whitney's able  direction, which matches the ambience of the cafe.  </P> <P> Some of the performances enliven the couples. Kat Sawyer-Young is excellent as  a sculptor with a roaming eye for a painter, only to find her real passion in  the jealousy of her husband. David Mingrino and understudy Loren Lester give  interesting color to the two sides of their characters, and Alice Vaughn and  Lily Mariye shade the other two wives as much as the script allows them. Kelley  Hinman misses as the painter, but recovers nicely as his opposite number, while  Jeff Witzeman's maitre d' oozes wisdom and savoir-faire.  </P> <P>  At 5262 W. Pico Blvd.; Fridays through Mondays, 8 p.m.; ends Nov. 26. $13.50;  (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> T.H. McCULLOH  </P></p>

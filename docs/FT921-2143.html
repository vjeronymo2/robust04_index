			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Mentor Insurance creditors set to receive first pay-out CREDITORS of Mentor Insurance, the collapsed Bermuda-based reinsurance company, will receive a first dividend of 25 cents in the dollar, the joint liquidators announced yesterday. Nearly 800 creditors will receive payments after the end of this month, followed by a second dividend in two or three years' time, said Mr Nigel Hamilton and Mr Charles Kempe of Ernst &amp; Young, the joint liquidators. The news came after approval of the arrangement by the creditors' committee meeting in Bermuda. The first payment had been thought likely to be smaller and come much later. Mentor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ocean Drilling and Exploration Company of New Orleans, which was set up as a captive insurance company to its parent company, collapsed in 1985 with undiscounted gross liabilities of Dollars 790m when it lost heavily on attempts to insure other companies. It was wound up by the Bermuda government. The settlement was eased by a Dollars 40m out-of-court cash payment and withdrawal of Dollars 90m in claims by banks, announced last month following legal action brought by the company against its parent and KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditors.</p>

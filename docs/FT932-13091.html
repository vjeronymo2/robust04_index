			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Sport: Grass masters protect their turf - Cricket I WOULD not do it for any other newspaper. A long journey into Yorkshire, a cold, hard afternoon's labours, then a long journey home late at night. It was worth it; the grass roots are fascinating. The Sports Turf Research Institute, in Bingley, west of Leeds is a charity, founded by the Golfing Union in 1929. By the 1950s it was researching into all types of sports turf, with all their ailments, at the service of golf, bowls, cricket, football, hockey, rugby and racing. Cricket is overshadowed by golf at the Institute but that, they assured me, is cricket's fault. There was a turf revolution in golf about four years ago, following a lot of trouble about bad surfaces. Golf's administrators consulted the Institute's experts. Today golf is overflowing with committees in charge of the construction and maintenance of golf courses. 'That's what we were founded for,' the institute's director, Dr Peter Hayes, said with satisfaction. Cricket has yet to have its turf revolution. It keeps its turf to itself, away from the Institute's relentless enthusiasm for research. 'Senior groundsmen have a kind of aura attached to them which cannot be penetrated,' said Dr Hayes wearily. 'All cricketing authorities are difficult to advise. They are well meaning amateurs. They don't understand the importance of research.' When I talked to Tim Lamb, secretary of the Test and County Cricket Board's pitches committee, he gave a weary sigh of his own. 'The STRI is all science. They are boffins who don't understand the practical side of making good pitches under match conditions. Pitches are different when you play on them.' The amateurs and the boffins talk to each other at times, but remain at odds in the vast underworld of the cricket pitch. It is a world which only hits the headlines when people want a scapegoat for poor English performances, but it is always taut with pressures and politics. It is populated by players, groundsmen, executives, researchers and, unofficially, the local expert who has sat in the same seat for 40 years, watching every game and comparing every wicked wicket with the real old fliers and skidders of his youth. Such an old faithful preferred the good old days when there was not all this fuss about wickets. He has a point. Back in the great days of Hambledon, Richard Nyren described the ideal pitch simply as a 22-yard stretch of the cricket ground, not to be altered 'by rolling, watering, covering, mowing or beating' during a match. Subtleties of texture did not come into it when the turf was to be 'if possible fed down by sheep.' In time, the culture of first class cricket turf grew more sophisticated, leaving the ovine mower in history. Cricket magazine attributed batsman Richard Humphrey's suicide in 1906 to the grim old pitches that had undermined his early batting, before 'the later years, when pitches were vastly improved'. Today the improvement of pitches is verging on an obsession. It is Graham Gooch's favourite topic of conversation; he is always happy to talk about the need for better wickets, without which he sees no future for English cricket. Both the TCCB and the STRI are reluctant to give a precise definition of a perfect pitch because requirements vary from place to place, indeed within each pitch. 'We don't want a minefield, of course,' laughed Lamb. 'Not a snooker table, of course,' said Hayes. Both were happier talking about what they did not want. Both cited Headingley as a problem pitch. 'It's been dug up and re-laid as many times as I've had a cooked breakfast in the last year,' said Hayes, 'to no effect.' In 1986 a wicket for a Yorkshire v Surry match was condemned by a TCCB inspector. A deep shaft was dug, revealing what Lamb described as 'something like a Neapolitan ice-cream' - layers of compressed organic matter and old topsoils, put there by successive groundsmen. This meant that newly sown grass could only put down weak roots, through a layer of accumulated organic fibre or 'thatch'. Solutions? The TCCB is trusting to the skills of Headingley's groundsman, Keith Boyce, who dug up and re-laid the pitch at the end of last season. Lamb pointed out that it was the TCCB which got rid of the lush, green wickets groundsmen were preparing in the late 1980s to suit seam bowlers. It has everything in hand. This year's emphasis is on dry pitches to encourage spin bowlers. But it takes time. 'It's taken them 20 years to go round in a circle,' was how they put it at Bingley. 'There are always fashions in the soils groundsmen lay. This year everyone is using two parts Ongar loam to one part Surrey loam because that was successful for Harry Brind at the Oval. But there's no scientific understanding of what makes a good wicket.' We stood on a huge patchwork of trial turf areas. No-one could doubt the STRI's commitment. As others said before me, only time will tell what works best. It is a pity the assorted approaches cannot combine their work more easily to find an answer.</p>

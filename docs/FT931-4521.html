			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: UK hits at Japan on liquor taxes THE UK has complained to Japan over the latter's failure to comply with a Gatt ruling made in 1987 on its liquor taxation system which discriminates against imports. Mr Richard Needham, minister of state for trade, yesterday expressed his concern in a meeting with Mr Ichiro Aisawa, parliamentary vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Mr Needham was adding the UK's voice to growing EC criticism of Japan over the discriminatory taxation system which still remains despite the Gatt panel ruling. Criticism that it has failed to comply with Gatt recommendations comes at a sensitive time for Japan, which is moving towards a more Gatt-oriented trade policy. The Japanese government, under growing pressure over trade from the US and EC, has said it was more likely to refer to Gatt in trying to resolve thorny issues, especially where US retaliation was likely. In 1989 the Japanese government made some changes to its liquor taxation system by, for example, removing the difference in taxes between local and imported liquor. But the EC has become impatient after waiting five years for Japan to remove the last tax areas placing imports at a disadvantage. A substantial differential still exists between Japanese shochu, a potato-based liquor, and whisky and brandy. The taxation differential between one class of whisky and a certain class of shochu, for example, is nine times. The EC is also concerned about a move in Japan to introduce another tax category for low strength whisky: mizuwari, or whisky diluted with mineral water. The EC formally requested Japan to comply fully with its obligations under Gatt at the last EC-Japan ministerial meeting in Brussels in January. Japan does not believe it has failed to implement the Gatt recommendation.</p>

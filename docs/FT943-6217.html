			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Impact of interest rate changes 'weaker' The ability of US policymakers to influence economic growth through changes in short-term interest rates has probably been weakened by the growth of the mortgage-backed bonds market, according to a study released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The study, by three Fed economists, says that traders and investors in this Dollars 1,350bn (Pounds 870bn) market helped transmit increases in short-term rates, engineered by the Fed, into higher long-term bond yields. Past rate-rises by the Fed have led to only small increases in long-term rates, since they reduce the risk of inflation, one of the biggest factors affecting the bond markets, according to the three. The study appears to confirm anecdotal reports from bond traders in recent months that a back-wash from the mortgage-backed bonds market helped to drive down the price (and hence increase the yield) of US government bonds this spring. As US interest rates rise, pushing up the cost of new home mortgages, homeowners have less incentive to pay off their old mortgages early. As a result, the lives of the pools of home mortgages that support mortgage-backed bonds is extended, stretching the duration of the bonds. To counter this, traders and investors sell long-dated Treasuries, or government bonds, to reduce the duration of their bond portfolios, in turn driving down the price of Treasuries. As evidence of this effect, the Fed economists point to a sharp decline in the difference between 10-year and 30-year bond yields, from 60 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) in February to 20 basis points in early May. This reflects the use of ten-year bonds to hedge changes in the mortgage-backed market, they say. The evidence of recent months suggests that 'the transmission of monetary policy from short-term interest rates to the real economy, via long-term interest rates, has probably changed,' the report concludes.

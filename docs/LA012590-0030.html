			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2ND ZONING HEARING SCHEDULED  </P> <P> The Manhattan Beach City Council will hold a second public hearing on a  comprehensive zoning code revision Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in council chambers.  </P> <P> The initial hearing this week drew a sparse crowd, prompting Mayor Connie  Sieber to say: "I'm shocked that there's not more community involvement."  </P> <P> Some residents, however, blamed the city for not widely advertising the  hearing.  </P> <P> The code revision, an 18-month project that has involved the Planning  Commission, the council and a planning consultant, is designed to make zoning  regulations conform to policies of the general plan adopted in February, 1988.  </P> <P> The major issue at Tuesday's hearing was the proposed reduction in the floor  area ratio in the city's "tree section" south of Rosecrans Avenue. Some  residents there have complained that trees are being removed to make way for  oversized homes.  </P></p>

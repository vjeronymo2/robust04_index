			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL BACKS SPRINKLERS IN NEW BUILDINGS;  </P> <P> BURBANK COUNCIL ASKED TO ENACT RULES FOR APARTMENTS, HOMES  </P> <P> A city advisory board has recommended that the Burbank City Council require  sprinkler systems in all new apartment buildings and single-family homes, and  toughen requirements for sprinklers in new commercial developments.  </P> <P> Thursday's 3-2 decision by the Burbank Building and Fire Code Appeals Board  came as a pleasant surprise to city fire officials, who had asked only that  sprinklers be required in new apartment buildings of more than five units and  in single-family homes that are difficult for firefighters to reach.  </P> <P> But board members said the importance of protecting lives caused them to go  beyond that request and require sprinkler systems in all new construction of  multi- and single-family residences.  </P> <P> The fire code now calls for sprinklers in all apartment buildings of more than  15 units or more than three stories.  </P> <P> "I felt strongly about the issues of safety, fire and loss of life," board  member Philip Saleen said Friday. "If it saves one human life, how do you put a  cost on that?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> $4,000 Added Cost  </P> <P> Saleen said the added construction cost to a 2,500-square-foot, single-family  home would be about $4,000.  </P> <P> The board also approved the Fire Department's request for sprinklers in all new  commercial developments of more than 1,500 square feet, far below the existing  10,000-square-foot threshold. Existing commercial sites that expand to 5,000  square feet or more would have to install sprinkler systems, but retrofitting  would not otherwise be required.  </P> <P> Board member Gary Canfield said he voted against the proposal because he  believes that the decision was made too quickly and that small businesses would  bear the brunt of additional costs.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a very quick decision on the part of the chairman without  proper study," he said. "I don't know if it's up to local government to mandate  residents to have sprinklers in their homes."  </P> <P> Fire officials said the cost of installing sprinklers in a new home would range  from 90 cents to $2 per square foot, depending on the size of the home and  whether it was part of a tract development or custom-built. Installation costs  for apartment buildings would be about $2 per square foot, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Afford Additional Costs'  </P> <P> "Apartment buildings are always built by speculators, and they can afford the  additional costs," board chairman Sidney Giddens said. He also said the  advantage of sprinklers is that they go off immediately, helping to prevent  fires from spreading out of control.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert Bowne expressed surprise that the board went beyond the  recommendations of the fire chief, and said he would have to study the issue  before taking a position.  </P> <P> "Certainly it would add to the cost of anything affected," he said. "And there  may be a legitimate reason for that; it may be appropriate. We need to look at  what other cities are doing in this area."  </P> <P> The City Council will consider the recommendation in about a month, officials  said.  </P> <P> The cities of Agoura Hills and San Clemente require sprinklers in all  residential construction, and the Glendale City Council is considering a  similar proposal.  </P></p>

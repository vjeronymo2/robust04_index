			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Allied London leaps to Pounds 5.75m Allied London Properties, the property investment company, yesterday reported doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.75m in the six months to December, against Pounds 2.89m last time. Sir Geoffrey Leigh, the chairman, said the upswing in the property market 'accelerated in the last quarter of 1993, with an improvement in yields, and there are also some indications of renewed tenant interest in expanding their requirements'. This bullish view has been reflected in the Pounds 41m invested by Allied London since the start of the current fiscal year. Net rental income at the interim stage was Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9m), and the company reported a Pounds 957,000 profit from the sale of an investment property, and a further Pounds 695,000 from short-term investments. Interest payments were stable at Pounds 5.4m. Allied London has utilised cash balances, which stood at Pounds 16m in June, to acquire Pelham Homes from the Rosehaugh receiver. The transaction was completed in December for Pounds 3m, and Pelham carried a further Pounds 14m of debt. Pelham owns a substantial land bank in south east England, and Allied London plans to add value through improved planning consents, and then trade the sites, against the background of rapidly increasing land prices for the housing mar-ket. Allied London's gearing is currently around 100 per cent, but this is based against June 30 property valuations. The company said it was actively seeking further investment opportunities. Allied London will pay an interim dividend of 1.18p (1.075p). Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to 4.1p (2.5p).</p>

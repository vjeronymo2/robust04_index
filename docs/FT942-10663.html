			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Clinton fails to still Haiti fears President Bill Clinton's weekend change of policy on Haiti has brought some immediate respite from domestic criticism, but fresh comments yesterday by a senior White House adviser on the number of refugees who might be admitted to the US threatened to reignite controversy. Mr Sandy Berger, deputy national security adviser, said only 5 per cent of about 1,300 Haitians recently intercepted at sea have qualified for political asylum. 'That is not a very high number,' he added, in an apparent attempt to calm fears in Florida of a new influx of refugees. But this was immediately disputed by Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida, and Democratic Senator Bob Graham, who predicted a new wave of 5,000-10,000 potential immigrants each month in the immediate future. Florida has already sued the federal government to recover some of the costs of sustaining the wave of immigrants, mostly from Haiti and Cuba. The new Clinton policy, outlined on Sunday, has two main elements: First, the temporary appointment of former Congressman Bill Gray, a respected black politician, as special envoy to Haiti, succeeding Mr Lawrence Pezzullo, who had been criticised for being too soft on the military junta. Mr Gray, it is hoped, will blunt some attacks from the congressional black caucus that US policy towards Haiti has been quasi-racist. Second, the US is to provide asylum processing facilities on its ships and, it is hoped, in third countries in the Caribbean, rather than sending all boat people back to Haiti for hearings on the island. The new procedures, involving larger naval vessels, will not be in place for some weeks, however. Also, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, confirmed in Mexico yesterday that the US was actively exploring the establishment of a joint hemispheric peace-keeping force, to be sent to help maintain order after the military junta had left Haiti. Several prominent critics of US policy, including the exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Mr Randall Robinson, a Washington-based activist, described the new moves as 'steps in the right direction'. Last week, the UN security council, at US request, imposed tougher economic sanctions on Haiti. Over the weekend, Mr Robinson ended a 27-day hunger strike over the forcible US return of boat people. But, in interviews yesterday, he remained sceptical that on-board asylum hearings could meet 'internationally recognised standards' for refugee processing. He continued to favour a 'constructive' military intervention under UN or Organisation of American States auspices but, he said, 'it shouldn't be a force whose sole purpose is to knock down the Haitian military'. Meanwhile, Haiti's military leaders have dismissed the UN plan to tighten economic sanctions. Having survived previous sanctions, army leaders are confident they will survive the new UN measures, and are encouraged by what they see as waning support for Father Aristide, diplomats in Port-au-Prince said yesterday. The UN will impose tougher sanctions on Haiti on May 21 unless the military hands over power to Fr Aristide by then. The army leaders, who have refused to honour earlier agreements for his return, feel the US and other countries advocating tougher sanctions will lose heart if the new measures do not work, and will end their support for the exiled president. The military rulers' apparent confidence in riding out sanctions is also based on the uncertain situation at Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, which has been a loophole in earlier efforts to impose an economic blockade. Despite repeated public commitments to increase military patrols at the border to curb smuggling, mainly of fuel, President Joaqun Balaguer of the Dominican Republic is against tougher sanctions.</p>

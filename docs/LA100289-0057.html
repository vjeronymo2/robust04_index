			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOLL-FREE LINE SEEKS TO CURB ANIMAL ABUSE  </P> <P> As Sgt. Cori Whetstone approaches the yard of knee-high dry weeds, downed  clotheslines and discarded, dusty furniture, her hunch proves correct: Amid the  debris, lying between an old sofa and a junked television console, is a  malnourished dog.  </P> <P> She crouches near the skinny Siberian husky.  </P> <P> "Come here, boy," she says sweetly.  </P> <P> "Oh, that's a good boy," she adds while the dog slowly manages to stand, its  tail wagging at Whetstone, a complete stranger but a friend who has come to  rescue the animal from reported neglect.  </P> <P> Because of a new toll-free number -- (800) 540-SPCA -- eyewitnesses now can  more quickly report animal cruelty, and dogs, cats, horses and even exotic  animals that are abused, beaten, abandoned and worse, are getting much-needed  help.  </P> <P> Since the tip line, sponsored by the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of  Cruelty to Animals, began operating in late August, more than 300 calls have  been received from Los Angeles County animal lovers.  </P> <P> As an investigator with the society, it is Whetstone's job -- shared with five  others -- to ensure that the animals are rescued, nursed back to life and  adopted by caring owners.  </P> <P> The LA/SPCA crews also work with law enforcement agencies to investigate occult  activities involving animals used in rituals; pet shop abuses, and in arresting  operators of dog fighting and cockfighting rings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full Police Powers  </P> <P> Whetstone, a senior investigator and licensed animal health technician (the  equivalent of a registered nurse for animal care), has full police powers in  animal cases. She and her fellow investigators are graduates of both the State  Humane and Reserve Police Officers' academies.  </P> <P> For three years, answering distress calls, Whetstone has traveled across the  county -- sometimes logging as many as 200 miles a day in a high-tech van  equipped with two-way radios, cages, a cellular phone and an emergency  earthquake kit.  </P> <P> She says she never ceases to be amazed at the cruelty she sees -- from  emaciated horses to a dog chained around a post and left for dead -- that  animals are forced to endure at the hands of their alleged best friends: human  beings.  </P> <P> "I don't know what makes a person react so cruelly to an animal that is  basically helpless, an animal who has come to depend on his owner for food and  shelter," she says. "It is us, mankind, who has domesticated these animals and  us who are mistreating them."  </P> <P> The hot line was started to avert such abuses, Whetstone says, adding, "We want  to bring public awareness to the community about the horrendous acts of  violence against animals and let the people know that we are here to assist, to  rescue these creatures and give them better homes."  </P> <P> But more often than not, Whetstone and other investigators are met with  contempt and threats when investigating cases.  </P> <P> " 'What's a dog catcher doing with a gun?' is the usual response we get," she  says. But what the public doesn't realize is that animal cruelty is a  misdemeanor, punishable with a maximum $1,000 fine and up to a year in jail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sentenced to Jail  </P> <P> Recently, she says, a Los Angeles man was sentenced to 60 days in jail and  fined $500 for poisoning a neighbor's dog because it knocked over his trash  can. She took the poisoning complaint on the hot line from a relative of the  man.  </P> <P> "It was quite sad," Whetstone says. "The man poisoned some chicken and placed  it on top of the trash. The dog barely made it into the kitchen and died in its  owner's arms."  </P> <P> Whetstone said the society could have offered the man advice on how to speak to  the dog's owner to solve the problem before he took his drastic step.  "Poisoning is a cold act," she said. "And now the whole neighborhood knows what  happened and it's not the best situation for the man's family."  </P></p>

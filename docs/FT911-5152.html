			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Asda Prop declines to Pounds 1.4m LOWER HOUSE prices, high interest rates and a lack of new trading opportunities in 1990 depressed pre-tax profits at Asda Property Holdings - they fell from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 1.4m in the year to December 31. Mr Manny Davidson, chairman, said that in his 40 years in the property business, he had not witnessed a more severe downturn than that which happened in 1990. Consequently he said he was pleased with the 39 per cent growth in net rental income to Pounds 10.2m and the 'resilient' sales from the residential portfolio totalling some Pounds 14.5m. Trading profits were only down to Pounds 15.21m (Pounds 16.62m) while an exceptional charge debited Pounds 812,000, for rationalisation and write-downs, and interest took Pounds 13.81m (Pounds 11.37m). Earnings per share worked out at 2p (5.2p) and the final dividend is lifted to a proposed 1.25 (1.15p) for a total of 1.85p (1.75p). The fully diluted net asset value at the year-end was 144p (197p).</p>

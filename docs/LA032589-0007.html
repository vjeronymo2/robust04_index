			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION  </P> <P> In response to your article "Soldier in a 'Holy War' on Abortion" (Part I,  March 17), Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry is incorrect in his initial  assumption. The anti-abortion movement is not about dead fetuses as he would  like people to believe.  </P> <P> The whole anti-abortion movement actually is about families with more children  than they can reasonably take care of. It's about irresponsible and incompetent  parenting and parents who make excuses for their incompetence and the child's  behavior. It's about an extreme lack of discipline in the home. It's about  children who are not cared for or wanted from birth and who have to raise  themselves or join gangs in order to feel as if they're part of a family; it's  about a generation of children who are drug addicts in order to relieve the  pain of having no love in their lives. It's about our inner-city schools being  unable to educate due to the fact that they're essentially "battle zones." It's  about excessive overcrowding due to irresponsible social and religious  attitudes and actions. It's about not allowing free access to information on  birth control.  </P> <P> The emotions that the anti-abortion backers whip up are only a smoke screen for  the fact that they desire nothing less than to control the minds, lives and  wallets of multitudes of people.  </P> <P> Strong emotions cloud the mind and obliterate the thinking. Remove the  emotional content that these people use in their rhetoric and you find nothing  but manipulation, hostility, and a desire for control.  </P> <P> ALEX HOLUB  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

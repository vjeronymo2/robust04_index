			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTERS AGAIN DEMONSTRATE AT RED ARMY SHOW  </P> <P> Armenian demonstrators marched outside the Shrine Auditorium again on Saturday,  the third straight day of protest at a four-day engagement of the Soviet Red  Army Chorus and dance ensemble.  </P> <P> About 80 demonstrators chanted and carried signs protesting the killing of  Armenians by soldiers in the Soviet Union. But police kept protesters at bay,  limiting their marching to the south side of the auditorium, along Jefferson  Boulevard.  </P> <P> The number of protesters has dwindled since Thursday, when about 1,000  demonstrated, some chaining themselves to the auditorium's front doors,  delaying the opening performance by more than two hours.  </P> <P> Attendance has steadily increased since the first night when only about 800  waited for police to clear the entrance to the auditorium. About 2,400 attended  the third performance on Saturday. Auditorium manager Brian Fenske said it did  not appear that the demonstration had affected attendance.  </P> <P> Protesters carried posters decrying the "Soviet dictatorship" and chanted "Red  Army go home."  </P></p>

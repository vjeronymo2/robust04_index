			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Gardiner re-elected leader of 92 Group Sir George Gardiner, the Conservative MP who was rebuffed when he attempted to advise the prime minister, was re-elected yesterday as chairman of the 92 Group of rightwing MPs. Sir George, MP for Reigate, suffered a blow to his credibility as a leader of rightwing opinion when Mr Major ended a consultation meeting after just two minutes. Mainstream Conservative MPs saw the brevity of the meeting as evidence of Mr Major's unwillingness to be dictated to by Sir George, who was pressing for more rightwing cabinet ministers. Sir George, a leading Maastricht rebel, also suffered a defeat when he was removed from the executive of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs after a campaign by government loyalists. However, rightwing MPs said Sir George had 'comfortably' beaten off a challenge to his leadership of the 92 Group from Sir Anthony Durant, MP for Reading West, who is regarded as more committed to Mr Major's leadership. Sir George said he would call a meeting of the group, which has more than 100 supporters, to sharpen its approach. 'We've always been a loyalist group and that will continue. Our efforts will continue to be devoted to helping the government to regain its popularity,' he said. Mr Major was said to be 'relaxed' about the election result. However, government whips had hoped that election of Sir Anthony would reduce friction with the 92 Group.</p>

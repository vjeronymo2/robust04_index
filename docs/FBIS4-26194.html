			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Adding iodized oil to  an arterial infusion of chemicals is effective in treating  late-stage gastric carcinoma (cancer of the stomach), according  to physicians at the Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to the  Shanghai Medical Sciences University.    The morbidity rate of stomach cancer is among the highest of  all types of cancer. Advanced-stage stomach tumors cannot be  removed surgically, and chemotherapy is the only way to ease  pain.    Since the early 1980s hospitals all over the world have  administered infusions of chemicals through arteries. But under  such treatment only about 25 percent of the victims can live one  year.    Iodized oil is a kind of embolism agent. When it is infused  into the stomach artery it can selectively deposit itself into  and around the small blood vessels of the tumor, and cut the  blood supply to it. Thus, it kills or inhibits the expansion of  cancer cells. However, it will not reduce the growth of healthy  cells.    According to Wang Xiaolin, one of the staff physicians at  the  hospital, the chemicals carried by the iodized oil can stay on  permanently to kill tumor cells, and hopefully cure the cancer.    Experts have appraised the therapy as a safe, simple and  effective one.</p>

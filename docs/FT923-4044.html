			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Nordic Markets in Turmoil: Finland's coalition at risk THE financial crisis in Finland puts its fragile centre-right coalition government at risk. Mr Esko Aho, Finland's prime minister, said there was no question of anybody resigning over the central bank's decision to float the markka. But his cabinet faces painful decisions on how to cut government spending further to convince sceptical international money markets that it can control the budget deficit, which may reach FM160bn (Pounds 21bn) in this fiscal year. Yesterday ministers were saying that Finland needed a wage freeze, tax increases on export industries to finance aid to the ailing banking sector and cuts in social benefits. Last week's budget proposals for 1993 called for a 10 per cent cut in some social benefits but this was not enough to satisfy the markets. The problem is whether voters will go along with further erosion of living standards. A poor showing by Mr Aho's Centre party and its Conservative allies in next month's local elections could lead to a new coalition, possibly including the social democrats.</p>

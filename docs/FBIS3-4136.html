			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Chinese authorities have hinted that Bao Tong, a  political reformer who once served as an aide to ousted  Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, could be eligible for  release from jail on medical grounds, according to John Kamm, a  human rights campaigner based in Hong Kong. Mr Kamm, who met  senior officials from the judiciary and other departments this  week, said the authorities now acknowledged that Bao, who has  served nearly five years of a seven-year sentence, was ill,  though they insist his life is not threatened.    Formerly, officials did not admit that Bao, 60, was sick,  despite reports that his health had suffered after his arrest on  May 28, 1989. By conceding that Bao is ill, the authorities are  opening the possibility of an early release from jail on medical  grounds.    The officials said Bao was being given special nourishment  and medical treatment, but there was no suggestion that Bao's  condition was stabilising under the care of the prison doctor.  The authorities made their remarks in the context of a  discussion on the possibility of prisoners being released on  medical parole. When asked point-blank whether Bao would be  released, the officials refused to answer directly.    "What I'm hoping is that if we can highlight the fact they  acknowledge he's sick, we can perhaps increase the pressure for  some sort of parole," Mr Kamm said. "They're telling us they're  considering releasing people, and that Bao Tong is ill. They  say he's getting special treatment. They are not saying that he  has stabilised. If anyone is qualified for parole, he is  qualified," he said.    Bao's son Bao Pu, who has been studying in the United  States,  said he saw his father for the first time in more than four  years on February 17, and again visited him in the Qincheng  prison about two weeks ago. "I was shocked," said Mr Bao. "His  face was puffy and swollen." He said his father was wearing a  padded blue jacket that had not been washed in years.    Bao, convicted of "leaking state secrets" and of  counter-revolutionary activity in early 1989, is being kept in  solitary confinement. Though his cell faces south, there is no  window. His cell provides him with enough room to practise  taijiquan [traditional Chinese shadow boxing]. He is allowed to  shower once a week and is also permitted to watch television at  certain hours.    Since entering Qincheng, Bao has had 17 polyps removed in  six  separate operations. The authorities say the polyps have so far  been benign. His white blood cell count is well below normal  and he has thyroid tumours and suffers from salivary gland  atrophy. "He was fine, in spirit, and still as sharp as I  remember," Mr Bao said of his father. He added that on his  second visit, his father appeared to be a bit better, though his  face was still swollen.</p>

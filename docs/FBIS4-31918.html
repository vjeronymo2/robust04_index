			<p>BFN     [Text] A number of parliamentary factions have addressed a  letter to Romanian President Ion Iliescu, which we will present  entirely:    In the interest of the prestige of the presidential  institution and the good functioning of state authorities, the  signatory parliamentary factions in the Senate and Chamber of  Parliament invite you to present before parliament, before the  end of the current session, your position regarding the  accusations against you in connection with the violation of the  principle of independence of the judges and of the authority of  judges' rulings. We consider that a debate on that issue in  Romania's Parliament is absolutely necessary.    The letter is signed by the parliamentary faction of the  Civic Alliance Party and the National Liberal Party-Democratic  Convention -- Nicolae Manolescu for the Senate faction; the  Democratic Party faction -- Adrian Severin for the Chamber of  Deputies, Oliviu Popescu for the Senate faction; the Liberal  Party-1993 faction -- Dinu Patriciu for the Chamber of Deputies  faction, Dumitru Caluianu for the Senate faction; the National  Christian-Democratic Peasant Party and the Romanian Ecologist  Party faction -- Gabriel Tepelea and Otto Weber for the Chamber  of Deputies faction, Valentin Gabrielescu for the Senate  faction; the Romanian Social-Democratic Party faction -- Sergiu  Cunescu for the Chamber of Deputies faction; and the Democratic  Union of Hungarians in Romania faction -- Iuliu Vida for the  Chamber of Deputies section, Karoly Szabo for the Senate faction.</p>

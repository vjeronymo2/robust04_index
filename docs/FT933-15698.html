			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Maxwell assets return 'unlikely' MAXWELL pension funds are unlikely to receive full restitution of the assets stolen by Robert Maxwell, MPs were told yesterday by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board. He told the Commons social security committee that full restitution for Maxwell pensioners was a worthy goal, but one that would be very difficult to achieve. 'We don't know whether total restitution is needed for pensioners to enjoy the benefits to which they are entitled,' said Mr Large. He added that SIB - the organisation which oversees regulatory bodies for the financial services industry - was doing everything it could to maximise restitution. Asked whether he thought - with only Pounds 100m of the Pounds 440m stolen from the fund still untraced or in disputed ownership - the time had come for financial institutions to get together to reach a settlement, Mr Large said he thought that would be 'extremely difficult'. Reporting to MPs on the structure of self-regulatory organisations, Mr Large said there was a strong case for having three bodies - with the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), watchdog for the fund management industry, retaining its independence. He said SIB would publish the criteria it intended to use in exercising its power to ban individuals from the financial services industry under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act 'within the next month or so'. It was a draconian power that needed to be used fairly but firmly. A review of Imro's admission procedures had been undertaken, with monitoring arrangements scrutinised. Resources allocated to monitoring had been increased, with the number of staff raised from about 35 to 50.</p>

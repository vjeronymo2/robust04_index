			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Outstanding year tests major global investors - Adrian Fitzgerald's analysis of a prosperous 1993 Sober, and more serious-minded investors will no doubt spend New Year's day contemplating investment efficiency. Most equity markets had an outstanding 1993, in spite of the recessionary forces still at work. Indeed, many markets closed the year at, or close to, all-time highs. But there are still lessons to be learned. Managers of very large global funds will not have found the going easy. The two largest equity markets, the US and Japan, were among the poorest performers in 1993, providing local currency returns of 10 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to see how market trends reflected changes in recovery prospects. Growth in the US economy, for example, is likely to be reported in line with expectations prevalent at the start of the year, hence the steady but dull stock market performance. By contrast, expectations for the Japanese economy were continuously downgraded as the year progressed. Not surprisingly, the stock market fell apart completely in the second half of the year. The disappointing outcome in Japan was at least compensated for by the strength of the yen. Returns to most overseas investors in Japan were enhanced by upwards of 10 per cent. This was no help to Japanese investors, who suffered the reverse effect. Not only did they earn a relatively miserable return from their own market, but their returns from overseas investments were diluted by the relative weakness of other currencies. Given the performances of the two major markets, it will be the least constrained and most adventurous fund managers who will top the performance tables for last year. The FT-A World Index excluding both the US and Japan gave a return of 38 per cent in dollar terms; two markets, Hong Kong and Malaysia, more than doubled. So, what else is there to contemplate about 1993? On the whole, it was just wonderful. And, anyway, what's all this mumbo-jumbo about investment efficiency? Well, first and foremost, we have to adjust to a low inflation/low interest rate environment. Investors in the UK, in particular, have to acclimatise themselves to an environment not experienced since the 1960s. And as 1993 performance figures will highlight, bond returns can be just as good as equity returns in such an environment. It is time for UK investors to consider whether their very aggressive exposure to equities provides the most efficient trade-off between risk and reward. Investors who dismiss this notion on the grounds that the bull run in bonds is now over should think carefully. Current equity market ratings worldwide can only be justified if inflation and interest rates stay low. US investors, who taught us all we know and love about modern diversification techniques, must be kicking themselves for not putting theory into practice. The typical US pension fund holds only around 6 per cent in foreign assets. It will not require much contemplation, in the light of last year's relative performances, to realise that this has to be an inefficient asset mix. The evidence suggests, however, that this problem is starting to be addressed. Almost Dollars 50bn poured out of the US into overseas equity markets in the first nine months of 1993, most of it into Europe. The good news for European-based stockbrokers is that there is much, much more to come] And while investors are contemplating efficiency, they should not forget about cash. Last year's bull market was fuelled to a large extent by a flight out of low-interest, but risk-free, cash deposits into supposedly higher-yielding equities. So far it has worked. But retail and institutional investors alike must remain alert to the risks they run. Not that 1994 threatens to be a bleak year. Recovery in the US and the UK will continue; the rest of Europe is at least stabilising; even Japan should start to show some recovery in the second half. The key to equity market performances will be the trend in interest rates and, especially, the support provided by bond markets. Here again, there seem to be no great dangers lurking. What investors have to bear in mind, however, is that, by definition, the outlook is always rosy at the top of bull markets. The solution is to weigh up the risks and potential rewards against investment needs and to invest accordingly. Nevertheless, as a European-based stockbroker, it would be irresponsible of me not to point out to US investors that a hedged investment in selected European markets, notably the UK, France and Spain, is likely to be rewarding in 1994.

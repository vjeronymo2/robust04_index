			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT ASKED TO PREVENT INCORPORATION DELAY  </P> <P> Malibu cityhood advocates asked a state appeals court Wednesday to prevent Los  Angeles County from further delaying the incorporation of the seaside  community, but the three-judge panel did not give them any encouragement.  </P> <P> The judges were not expected to rule on the matter for several days.  </P> <P> However, their comments clearly favored the county as having the right to delay  incorporation until March.  </P> <P> "It was not encouraging," said Walt Keller, a member of Malibu's future City  Council.  </P> <P> The matter is of crucial importance to the county, which wants to start work on  a controversial $43-million sewer system in Malibu before a new city government  has the chance to block it. Voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood last month,  and all five of the future council members have said they will oppose the  sewer.  </P> <P> Regardless of what the three-judge panel decides, the matter will almost  certainly be appealed to the California Supreme Court.  </P></p>

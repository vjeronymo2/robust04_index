This statement was made by RDP Group  Director General Jan Vlcek at yesterday's news conference in  Prague. He added that the "consortium rejects any suggestions  that it would act at variance with the state's interests."    According to Director Vlcek, the RDP Group has not asked for  permission to export modernized tanks or for a license to export  equipment to Iran for repairing tanks; the company was merely  "mapping out the market." The modernized tank, if it is  exported, will not, according to him, be oriented toward regions  engaged in conflict. The consortium will always consult the  Foreign and Trade and Industry Ministries on the export of all  military materials.    The fact that representatives from these ministries and the  Defense Ministry have free access to each board meeting also  contributes to the "transparency" of the company's commercial  and manufacturing activity. The consortium has already  concluded agreements abroad for certain orders, while others are  being negotiated. Vlcek refused to specify them, however, in  view of commercial confidentiality. The three-year stoppage has  not benefited Czech arms exports on foreign markets, and many  orders were canceled; nevertheless, the customers have remained  aware of their quality.    The main objective of the RDP Group, however, is not exports  but coordinating production activity, conducting research and  development, securing new projects, financing them, and, last  but not least, holding a dialogue with the Czech Army.    In this connection, the consortium's representatives  criticized the Army's inadequate approach to its rearmament  program, whose implementation has constantly been postponed.  The RDP Group is trying to make sure that as many Czech  enterprises as possible are involved in this state order. "We  will produce whatever Czech industry can produce in the Czech  Republic. Whatever it cannot produce will be guaranteed by  linking up to a foreign partner," said Vlcek. If transferring  production to the Czech Republic is unsuitable, the RDP Group  will endeavor to agree upon countershipments at the same cost.    A number of projects, the criteria for which are price, high  standards, and quality, have been prepared for the Czech Army.  Modernizing the existing hardware will be one of the most  comprehensive projects; new types of wheeled vehicles (including  a licensed product from Avia Letnany, which is already being  tested by the Interior Ministry) are also being prepared. Other  projects involve hand weapons, including antitank missiles, the  development of new ammunition, including intelligent ammunition,  and communications systems. The projects should be put forward  in the very near future. Cooperation with the Army, however, is  not proceeding as the producers, who need to sell as much as  possible in the shortest time possible, had hoped.    The Topfin banking hous, which is, in fact, a consortium of  banks involving, for example, the Investicni banka and the  Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, is prepared to provide finance  for the projects. The company also has links to banks in Paris  and Washington and is organizing representation in Moscow.</p>

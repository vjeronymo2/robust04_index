			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F> by Anna Vargova; place and date not given: "Instead of Oil and  Gas, They Offer Dollars--But With Some Delay"]    [Text] [Vargova] You have just returned from Russia,  where you discussed the repayment of their debt toward the  Slovak Republic. In what kind of goods, apart from special  equipment [euphemism for arms], oil, and gas, are we interested?    [Schmognerova] The Russian side actually does not even want  to discuss the repayment of the debt with oil and gas  deliveries. It wants to repay the greatest possible part in  dollars and, thereby, actually defer payments. The other  possibility is repayment in kind. This applies to some products  for the defense department, but also other products, a list of  which we will prepare and send to the Russian Government. Part  of the debt could also be covered by deliveries for the  completion of the Mochovce nuclear power station.    [Vargova] The third possibility is to swap debt for equity  [kapitalizacia dluhu]. Has a decision been made about companies  Slovak capital might have a stake in?    [Schmognerova] The next phase of privatization will start in  Russia on 1 July. This time, it will be privatization through  auctions, tenders, and sale on the capital market. What  complicates our position is the steadily declining offer of  enterprises and the absence of legislation on the Russian side  that would make it possible for us to enter Russian companies.  Here, too, we will send them a list of companies, in which the  Slovaks would be interested. We have agreed on one pilot  company where this method will be tested.    [Vargova] Russia has not yet resolved the financing of the  Yamal gas pipeline across our territory. I assume that this  issue was also raised during your talks....    [Schmognerova] We asked Deputy Prime Minister Y. Yarov if  the Russian Government could speed up the decision on whether  the gas pipeline will lead across the Slovak Republic as well.  As soon as this decision is made, we can start talks on ways of  financing the project. I suppose the Russian Government will be  interested in taking part in financing the project. We will  seek foreign investors.    [Vargova] Is there a chance of arriving at specific  agreements by the end of September?    [Schmognerova] Definitely. The signing of an agreement on  the prevention of double taxation and of an intergovernmental  treaty on cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy will be  the first steps. The two countries' experts will work on  preparing an agreement on the defrayal of Russia's debts toward  the Slovak Republic.</p>

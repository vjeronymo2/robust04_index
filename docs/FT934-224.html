			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / IoD urges union reform Unions should lose their legal protection and turn themselves into voluntary bodies servicing the legal rights of individual workers, the Institute of Directors said yesterday. The IoD, which is preparing its evidence to the Commons employment committee on the future of unions, believes ending all legal immunities would conclude the strategy begun by the government 13 years ago. The institute will tell the government that action is needed to ensure that industrial relations remain good during the recovery and that there is no return to excessive wage demands by public-sector unions. The IoD's main aim is to convince the government that it should legislate further over unions. It points out that additional legislation will be needed by 1996 to insert European Union directives into UK labour law. The IoD's proposals include: The introduction of a comprehensive system of legal rights for individuals governing contracts of employment. The IoD believes unions will be obsolete as collective bargainers and it sees no reason why workers organised in groups should have special privileges. The removal of any right to strike and the abolition of legal immunities for workers in essential services. It favours the introduction of a statutory duty for such workers to maintain services with compensation paid if the legal obligation is not fulfilled. This would cover workers in the health service, gas, water, electricity, telephone operating, ambulance and fire services. The end of centralised pay bargaining in the public sector with the abolition of the remaining public-sector pay review bodies and further use of performance-related individual pay. Restriction of picketing to only six strikers at an entrance to their workplace, and the introduction of a statutory picketing code to replace the present voluntary system. It proposes that all mass picketing be made unlawful. The removal of the legal obligation on companies to give unions information for collective bargaining purposes. Measures to encourage companies to introduce employee share ownership and profit-related pay schemes.</p>

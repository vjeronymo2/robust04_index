			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Derivative portfolios held by UK banks up sharply in year FOREIGN exchange and interest-rate related derivatives operations of UK clearing banks grew rapidly last year, with total portfolios growing more than 50 per cent, according to banks' annual reports. The derivative markets also provided the only significant growth in UK banks' credit exposures: those banks to disclose details recorded a jump of nearly Pounds 4bn in their risk-weighted assets as a result of their off-balance sheet derivatives operations. By comparison, three of the four main clearing banks - Barclays, Lloyds and Midland - saw a decline in risk-weighted assets recorded on their balance sheets as they continued to reel from heavy provisions from their UK lending. Barclays showed the sharpest decline, from Pounds 86.3bn to Pounds 84.9bn. The growth in derivatives portfolios stemmed both from doing more business with institutional and corporate customers and from using derivatives more for internal position-taking, said Mr Barry Hamilton, head of risk management in Barclays' treasury division. Interest rate swaps, for instance, are a less capital-intensive way of hedging or increasing interest rate exposure than the traditional money markets, he said. The nominal amounts involved in the contracts, though not indicating true exposures, give the clearest indication of growth in the banks' derivatives businesses. These show a jump both in exchange-rate and interest-rate related instruments, though the UK commercial banks remain behind their US counterparts. The risk-weighted amounts, calculated according to Bank for International Settlements guidelines, reflect the mark-to-market value of derivatives portfolios. Their faster growth rate suggests the banks were not running balanced portfolios last year, but have benefited from falling interest rates or from foreign exchange movements.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          UK BANKS' OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        1992                      1991                  Nominal      Risk-weighted   Nominal   Risk-weighted                   amount             amount    amount          amount  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exchange-rate related  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Pounds             Pounds    Pounds          Pounds Barclays         219.9bn              2.5bn   148.9bn           1.0bn NatWest          169.9                2.1     112.1             1.3 Lloyds           141.9                1.4      94.9             1.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Interest-rate related  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   Pounds             Pounds    Pounds          Pounds Barclays         248.7bn              1.8bn   152.1bn           1.3bn NatWest          182.7                0.7     120.0             0.4 Lloyds           165.9                0.4      94.5             0.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

"There is no external threat to Azerbaijan at the moment, a  threat comes from inside the CIS, from Armenia", the ambassador  stressed. According to him, under the present circumstances  Azerbaijan's borders with Turkey and Iran should be regarded  first of all as its external borders, and only then as external  borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    Last September, Azerbaijan became a full-fledged member of  the Commonwealth and joined the Collective Security Treaty.  However, no mutually acceptable schemes for ensuring the safety  of Azerbaijan's boders with Turkey and Iran have been worked out  so far. These borders are virtually transparent at present.</p>

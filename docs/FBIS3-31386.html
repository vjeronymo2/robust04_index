It is impossible to speak about NATO countries as of  potential partners and allies and in a situation when they have  to take a complicated decision to distance itself from them,  Zieleniec told the Czech Television station NOVA.    He said not only air strikes were concerned but an ultimatum  that should lead to separation of the warring sides. "Sarajevo  is a town experiencing awful sufferings, the town which is being  strangled. I believe this action could lead to Sarajevo being  relieved and that is why I support it," Zieleniec said.    On February 10, the NATO Council approved a communique  giving  a ten-day ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs and Muslims to withdraw  their heavy weapons and put them under UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Force] control, otherwise they would be subject to  air strikes.</p>

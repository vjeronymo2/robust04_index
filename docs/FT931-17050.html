			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Reforms urged for pensions - A look at calls for a single pension regulator THE Consumers Association this week added its voice to the calls for the creation of a single regulator for pensions and a compensation fund for occupational schemes. The financial services industry has been putting forward its views on pensions over the last few weeks, in submissions to the Pension Law Review Committee, under the chairmanship of Professor Roy Goode. The Goode committee was established in the wake of a report from the Commons select committee on social security, which recommended changes to the trust law which has been the basis of pension fund operation since the 1920s. Debate has centred around the issue of compensation. The National Association of Pension Funds originally proposed a compulsory scheme which would refund a shortfall no matter how it had occurred. This was fiercely attacked by the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, the UK's second biggest, which threatened to resign from the NAPF over the issue. The association made a partial climbdown in its final submission to the Goode committee, and recommended that schemes should cover fraud, theft and negligence only. This view is backed by the CA which said that: 'A sensible plan for compensating beneficiaries who lose out because of regulatory failure must be established.' 'This would cover losses as a result of fraud,' says the CA, 'and as a result of professional negligence where, for whatever reason, the members cannot claim compensation from the professional concerned.' The CA added that such a scheme should be funded through insurance, so that poorly-administered schemes were not subsidised by well-run schemes. However, if the insurance industry was not prepared to meet the risk, the CA backed a compulsory levy on occupational schemes. The electricity supply pension fund wanted any compensation scheme to be funded by a combination of professional indemnity insurance, the Investors Compensation Scheme (run under the Financial Services Act) and the government. The liability of occupational pension schemes would be strictly limited. Over the question of regulation, the CA joins other organisations, such as the Prudential and the Confederation of British Industry, in favouring a single authority. 'A single statutory regulator, reporting direct to a single government department, should be established to take responsibility for ensuring investor protection and fair play in the occupational pensions sector.' In addition, the CA called for pension rights to be protected in an employee's contract of employment trustees to be qualified, with one being given the responsibility of ensuring the scheme's assets are safe. professional advisers to have a repsonsibility to report suspicions of fraud or maladministration. members to be sent an annual statement of benefits and summary of accounts. The Goode committee has received over 1,000 submissions in response to a list of 81 questions it sent out in September. The committee is scheduled to produce its report in the summer of 1993. Meanwhile, the CA gave the government the dubious honour of its Captive Consumer Award for its handling of the late Robert Maxwell's frauds. 'Official failure to regulate strongly and effectively culminated in Maxwell pensioners being captive consumers' said Derek Prentice, CA assistant director. 'They are prisoners of a pensions scandal for the rest of their lives.'</p>

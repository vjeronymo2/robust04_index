			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): September jobs report sparks heavy selling Wall Street A MIXED September employment report sparked heavy selling on US stockmarkets yesterday as investors' hopes for another interest rate cut receded in the wake of the data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 53.76 at 3,200.61, at its lows for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended sharply lower, down 5.82 at 410.47, while the Amex composite finished down 3.57 at 371.24 and the Nasdaq composite down 6.69 at 571.64. Turnover on the New York SE was 189m shares. Although the keenly awaited September employment report was not as bad as most analysts had been expecting - non-farm payrolls fell 57,000, and not 120,000 as forecast, and the national jobless rate dropped unexpectedly from 7.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent - the market still did not like what it saw. The details of the figures were not promising, with the average work week and average hourly earnings both lower last month. Overall, the data provided little reason to hope for much of a recovery over the rest of the year. Only an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve could have lifted the market's gloom, but yesterday's figures were deemed insufficiently distressing to prompt such a move by the monetary authorities. Among individual stocks banks fell on disappointment at the lack of an interest rate cut. BankAmerica slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 7/8 , Citicorp dropped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 3/4 , Chemical gave up Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 32, Banc One eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 , and Chase Manhattan fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22. K mart fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 1/4 after the giant retailer announced it would issue convertible preferred stock to finance the acquisition of Borders, a private book superstore chain. Details on the value of the deal were not available. Profits warnings sent several shares tumbling. JWP plunged Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 3 7/8 in turnover of 2.2m shares after the company said it expected to report a third quarter loss of 50 cents a share, compared with a profit of 39 cents a share a year ago. Another company warning of a third quarter loss was Porta Systems, which tumbled Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 11 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange. Canada TORONTO'S composite index dropped 43.97 points, or 1.34%, to end at 3,231.07, 154 down on the week, the lowest level since January 1991. The gold sector, up slightly, was the only sub-group able to post a gain. Soaring interest rates meant three-month Canada treasury bills yielded 7.95% yesterday compared with 5.60% last Friday.</p>

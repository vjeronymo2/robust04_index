			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTORS IN 6 EMBASSY SUITE HOTELS SUE ON FRAUD CHARGES  </P> <P> About 1,400 people who invested $98 million in limited partnerships to build  six Embassy Suites hotels in California filed suit Thursday, contending that  they were victims of a massive fraud scheme.  </P> <P> Four named plaintiffs filed the suit in U.S. District Court on behalf of  themselves and the other investors across the country who participated in a  plan to build hotels in El Segundo, Downey, Santa Ana, Oxnard and Napa and  Burlingame in Northern California.  </P> <P> The lawsuit contends that the scheme was masterminded by Robert E. Woolley of  Irving, Tex., who it said served as general partner of each of the six hotel  limited partnerships. The lawsuit said Woolley and several associates lured  about 1,400 investors into the project by distributing memoranda that omitted  "crucial" facts.  </P> <P> Also named as defendants are Woolley's son, Robert E. Woolley Jr., and his  construction firm, Rewcon Inc. of Irving, Tex.; Charles M. Sweeney of San  Mateo, Calif., and Landmark Suites of America Inc., all general partners of the  Napa limited partnership, and Joseph J. Amoroso of Westlake Village, a general  partner in the Oxnard development.  </P> <P> None of the defendants could be reached for comment. The suit accuses them of  racketeering, fraud, unjust enrichment and violation of U.S. securities laws  and California business codes.  </P> <P> The suit said the defendants falsely represented themselves as experts in hotel  development, construction and management. Private placement memoranda  circulated by the defendants "projected great success" in each of the six  developments and promised significant returns on investments, the suit said.  </P> <P> But actual cash distributions to investors -- promised to be about $59 million  for all six hotels -- fell far short, the suit said. Three of the projects  generated no return and the three others provided returns of between 3% and 7%  of what was promised, the suit said.  </P></p>

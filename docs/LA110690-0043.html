			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: PERCEPTRONICS EARNINGS FOR 3RD QUARTER DOWN 73%  </P> <P> Perceptronics Inc. in Woodland Hills said its third-quarter earnings plunged  73% from a year earlier on a 36% decline in revenue.  </P> <P> The company, which makes computer-based simulators and other equipment for the  military, said net income in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 fell to $104,099  from $378,110 a year earlier.  </P> <P> Its revenue dropped to $4.73 million from $7.4 million.  </P> <P> Perceptronics attributed much of the declines to the winding down of its  contract on SIMNET, a project that enables tank gunnery simulators to fight  each other over a computer network.  </P> <P> In the first nine months of this year, Perceptronics' profit fell 48% to  $253,638 from $491,706 a year earlier, and its nine-month revenue was down 23%  to $10.9 million from $14.1 million.  </P></p>

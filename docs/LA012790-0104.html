			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SYMPHONY REVIEW;  </P> <P> GUEST LEADER AKIYAMA BRINGS EVOCATIVE GIFT TO SAN DIEGO AUDIENCE  </P> <P> Following traditional Japanese etiquette, San Diego Symphony guest conductor  Kazuyoshi Akiyama brought a special gift for his hosts. In Thursday evening's  Symphony Hall concert he conducted the first local performance of Toru  Takemitsu's "Star-Isle." The mildly astringent Impressionism of his fellow  countryman's evocative tone poem suited the orchestra's strengths admirably,  calling forth burnished sonic implosions from the brasses and warm, muted tones  from the strings. This brief musical essay by Japan's premiere composer was a  welcome present indeed.  </P> <P> Akiyama stimulated the players in most of the right ways, leading the orchestra  in one of its more energetic, persuasive programs of the current season. The  48-year-old maestro -- he is music director of the Tokyo Symphony and New  York's Syracuse Symphony -- presided over a vibrant, yet thoroughly detailed  performance of the Samuel Barber Piano Concerto and offered an urgent,  extroverted interpretation of Debussy's "La Mer."  </P> <P> The success of Barber's concerto was ensured by piano soloist John Browning,  who premiered the work about 27 years ago under the composer's watchful eye.  From his brilliant, authoritative octaves that opened the concerto, Browning  sculpted a taut, muscular reading that left no doubt of his complete identity  with the music. He was strong but not flashy, creating a wide spectrum of  colors that made the piano sound almost orchestral. He was meticulous but not  fussy, an equally apt description of Akiyama's approach to the dense, colorful  orchestral accompaniment. Seldom has the orchestra seemed so completely engaged  in its half of a concerto performance.  </P> <P> Barber had both the good sense and the misfortune never to have been  sufficiently avant-garde for the musical trendsetters of his day. But now that  his music is again in vogue, and we hear it with more perspective, it is  instructive to compare Barber with the current crop of born-again  neo-Romantics. How many of them display even half of Barber's compositional  craft or can shape a theme as haunting as his Piano Concerto's lavishly lyrical  slow movement?  </P> <P> If Akiyama made every moment of "La Mer" exciting and urgent, it must be noted  that Debussy's sea is usually less turbulent under the baton of most  conductors. It would be instructive to hear Akiyama conduct Bartok or early  Stravinsky.  </P> <P> Rossini's tediously sectional overture to "Semiramide" opened the concert,  although Akiyama paced it judiciously. It seemed little more than a formality,  curiously unrelated to the rest of the program. Tonight at 8 in Symphony Hall  this concert will be repeated; on Sunday at 8 p.m. it will be played in Bowers  Auditorium at Fallbrook's Potter Junior High School.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule finalizes revisions or deletions to the language in the order's rules and regulations to reflect amendatory changes to the order completed in 1992. This rule makes the order's rules and regulations consistent with current order language. These changes were unanimously recommended by the Cranberry Marketing Committee (Committee) at its March 1, 1994, meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule was issued on July 11, 1994, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 36021, July 15, 1994], with an effective date of July 15, 1994. That rule amended &sect;&sect;929.107, 929.108, 929.110, 929.148, 929.150, and 929.153 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended August 15, 1994. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, the cranberry marketing order was amended [57 FR 38748, August 27, 1992] to change, among other provisions, the volume control features of the order. Prior to the amendment, the order authorized a base quantity program in which each producer received a base quantity calculated by the Committee from a representative period in the order. Base quantity was annually distributed to existing producers and new producers based on a formula in the order. The 1992 order amendments authorized a volume control program to be based on the sales history of each producer. The Committee now calculates a sales history for each producer based on the average of sales for a specified period for each producer or, in the case of a new producer, sales history is based on a State's average yield per acre. Other order amendments were made to reflect current industry practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first change revises section 929.107 which currently provides the basis for determining established cranberry acreage. The section is revised by deleting various terms, dates, and section references. The term ``established'' cranberry acreage and the reference to section 929.16 are no longer applicable since they were removed by the 1992 amendment. The reference to growing cranberries during a specified period of time (i.e., 1965&hyph;66 through 1967&hyph;68) and other similar date references are removed since producers are no longer required to produce during this period to have a commercial crop of cranberries. Other modifications are made in the section for clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second change deletes section 929.108 which provides for procedures to substantiate a firm and substantial commitment for use in determining base quantities. This section is no longer applicable since the order amendments authorize a sales history to be computed for every producer. New or existing producers no longer have to show a firm and substantial commitment to receive base quantity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third change revises section 929.110 which provides for transfers or sales of cranberry acreage during the representative period. This section is revised by deleting the term ``representative period.'' This term is no longer applicable since all reference to a representative period for computing base quantities was removed by the 1992 amendment. Producers must inform the Committee at any time when transfers or sales of acreage are made. Also, the term ``base quantity'' is deleted and replaced with the term ``sales history.'' Other minor changes are made to the section to make it consistent with the order amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth change deletes section 929.148 which provides factors to be considered when assigning or adjusting base quantities for producers. This section is no longer applicable since the order amendment authorizes the computation of a sales history for each producer. These factors are not used when calculating sales history.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth change revises section 929.150(a) which provides for the transfer or assignment of base quantities. This section is revised by deleting the term ``base quantity'' and replacing it with the term ``sales history.'' The term base quantity is no longer applicable since the order amendment authorizes a sales history to be calculated for each producer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last change deletes section 929.153 which provides for the establishment and distribution of a base quantity reserve. This section is no longer applicable since the 1992 order amendment provides for a volume control program to be based on sales histories of producers. A producer's sales history is updated annually based on the highest four out of six years' sales. Therefore, a base quantity reserve is not necessary for updating producers' sales histories or for allowing entry of new growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0103.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 36021, July 15, 1994] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 929  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cranberries, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 929 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 929_CRANBERRIES GROWN IN STATES OF MASSACHUSETTS, RHODE ISLAND, CONNECTICUT, NEW JERSEY, WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, OREGON, WASHINGTON, AND LONG ISLAND IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR Part 929 which was published at 59 FR 36021 on July 15, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Eric M.

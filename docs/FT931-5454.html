			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Aker ahead sharply on gain from disposal AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday unveiled a sharp rise in 1992 pre-tax profits to NKr382m (Dollars 54m) from NKr92m in 1991, lifted by a NKr680m gain from the disposal of its stake in Valenciana de Cementos Portland of Spain. The board proposed to leave the dividend unchanged at NKr2.60 a share. Aker's A shares shot up 12 per cent to close at NKr37.50. Mr Tom Ruud, chief executive, forecast an improvement in 1993 by the group's two main divisions, helped by greater efficiency and cost reductions. Group turnover rose by NKr3.7bn to NKr17.3bn, but operating profit was more than halved to NKr72m from NKr152m. Net profit last year more than doubled to NKr390m from NKr170m, with earnings per share climbing to NKr8 from NKr3.50. Aker's cement and building materials division saw turnover unchanged at NKr5.84bn, in spite of difficult domestic and international markets. Its operating profit rose to NKr351m last year from NKr322m, helped by consolidation and cost-cutting measures. Reduced financial expenses following the sale of Valenciana also contributed to the advance. The division last year bounced back to a pre-tax profit of NKr18m from a loss of NKr79m a year earlier. The oil and gas technology division improved turnover in 1992 by NKr3.33bn to NKr10.58bn. It saw operating losses widen to NKr248m in 1992 from NKr156m in 1991 due to a NKr419m loss incurred by Norwegian Contractors, an Aker unit.</p>

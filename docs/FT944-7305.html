			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / CBI price survey adds to rate rise pressure The proportion of manufacturers planning to increase prices rose again this month, according to the latest Confederation of British Industry monthly trends survey, renewing fears of inflationary pressures. Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, has in the past paid particular attention to the CBI prices findings, and today's result will fuel speculation that the governor will press for an early rise in base rates when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on December 7. However, the CBI survey did find that manufacturers are enjoying buoyant export orders and increases in output. The CBI also warned, in its latest economic forecast, that too aggressive tax cuts before the next general election might, if combined with a fall in sterling, threaten the government's inflation target. The government's aim is to keep underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) within the lower half of the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target band. However, the CBI's model says the target will be missed if Pounds 4bn of tax cuts in 1996 is combined with a 5 per cent decline in sterling. Without tax cuts, the CBI forecasts the target will be met, on the assumption that base rates rise by 1 3/4 percentage points - to 7.5 per cent  -by 1996. The first rise - of half a percentage point - is likely to occur in the first quarter of next year. Ms Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economist, said the organisation 'would support interest rate rises of around this size', because it believed the government should meet its inflation target. The CBI forecasts that economic growth, which was likely to be around 3.9 per cent (allowing for the recently revised third-quarter data) this year, would fall to 2.8 per cent next year and in 1996. The recovery will be rebalanced away from consumption and towards exports and investment. Today's monthly survey found that 30 per cent of manufacturers planned to increase prices over the next four months, while only 8 per cent planned to reduce them. This positive balance of 22 percentage points was up from 20 points in October and 15 points in September, and was the highest figure since January 1991. However, Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate economic director, said that manufacturers had frequently not been able to raise prices in line with expectations. In addition, price expectations might be particularly high at the moment because of the forthcoming January list increases. The CBI survey also found that export orders were at the strongest level since March 1988, and that total orders were at their highest since March 1989. The balance of those reporting an increase in export orders was 10 percentage points, compared with a negative balance of 2 points in October. The balance of those reporting higher output increased to 21 percentage points in November, from 19 points, having fallen in each of the past two months.</p>

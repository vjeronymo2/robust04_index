			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEACH TRASH  </P> <P> Recently, volunteers gave up their valuable time to clean up all the trash on  the local beaches. My point is, why should they do it?  </P> <P> The real culprits are the slobs who leave their trash behind, without even so  much as a second glance at the mess. I cannot understand why there isn't a  stiff fine, or even a jail sentence for these people. They should be made to  take all their own rubbish away, and if a trash container isn't handy, take it  home and dispose of it on trash day.  </P> <P> The beaches should be policed regularly, and if these people are guilty, ticket  them, just like illegal parking or not using a seat belt.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH C. MOSS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Accountability of regulators is lacking in privatisation strategy Sir, Tony Jackson is correct to assert that 'privatisation has its natural limits', but a little late to worry that 'even such matters as the modernisation of the UK's telephone network could become issues of public policy' ('The pendulum swings', November 10). One cannot really compare privatisation in eastern Europe, where typically some 90 per cent of the economy is state owned, with Britain where public ownership is now confined to certain fundamental services. I would assert that the Post Office for one is a public service where privatisation has no part to play and any disposal here would be 'a sale too far'. The problem with privatising public utilities, such as British Telecom with its universal service obligation, is that the regulator rather than parliament finishes up determining crucial issues of public policy. Oftel's prohibition on BT carrying broadcasting services on its telecommunications network is a constraint on the company providing the kind of national optical fibre broadband network that would stimulate economic growth and expand the range of services available to customers. The regulation of the regulators is the 'black hole' of the government's privatisation strategy. As the National Communications Union unsuccessfully proposed to this year's Trades Union Congress, the regulatory agencies must become more accountable to parliament and the public.

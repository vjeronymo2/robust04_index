			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Go-ahead for power station THAMES POWER has signed final contracts to build a Pounds 661m 1,000MW gas-fired power station in Barking, East London. The announcement yesterday came shortly after Mobil had said it would cancel its plans for a 300MW station on Canvey Island, Essex. Completion of the Barking project follows months of controversy which began when both Thames Power and Mobil last March contested a decision by British Gas to increase the price of gas to power stations by 35 per cent. The disputes were settled in September when British Gas offered both projects special deals, provoking charges of preferential treatment. The Thames Power project, due to start generating electricity next year, is one of only a few independent power station projects announced since the privatisation of the electricity industry which is likely to start up before 1995.

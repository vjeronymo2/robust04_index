			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Dock work reform 'is step back' ABOLITION of the National Dock Labour Scheme has in some respects taken the industry back to an operational and employment structure similar to that of the 1950s and 1960s, according to an analysis by Cardiff Business School, Michael Smith writes. It finds this has happened through a proliferation of small 'labour-only' stevedoring companies in a more competitive environment. 'There has been reappearance of practices that during the 1960s were perceived to be detrimental to industrial peace', it says. The Dock Labour Scheme, which was set up in 1967 to end the use of casual labour, was abolished in 1989. It reserved certain types of work for registered dock workers who were in effect guaranteed jobs for life. According to the report, 34 per cent of former scheme ports now employ temporary workers. Disputes over redundancies and working practices abound, the report says. 'Deregulation and more intense competition in the industry have therefore generated greater instability and in many respects made it more difficult for management to cultivate employee loyalty and commitment, other than through the fear of losing traffic and consequently jobs.'

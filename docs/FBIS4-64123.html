			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 26, BNS -- The Liberal and Moderate  factions in the Estonian parliament disagree with each other  over Prime Minister Mart Laar's nominations for the posts of the  justice and defense ministers.    Liberals say there is no need to appoint new members to the  Cabinet before the upcoming general meeting of the senior party  in the ruling coalition, the Pro Patria.    "A status quo should be retained in the government until the  Pro Patria general meeting, and the vacancies should be filled  with acting ministers," said Eero Tohver, adviser to the faction  of the Liberals.    The Moderates, however, insist that the opinion of Pro  Patria  as a coalition partner should be trusted.    "We are not going to bring any dissenting opinion with  respect to the nomination of new ministers," Moderate faction  chairman Toivo Jullinen said.    Prime Minister Mart Laar Tuesday [24 May] proposed to the  council of the governing coalition the nominations of Urmas  Arumae as the new justice minister and Raul Opik as the defense  minister.    Arumae, 37, has graduated from Tartu University, faculty of  law. He wrote his Master's thesis in international business  administration with San Francisco University in 1992. Arumae  set up his own law firm, Concordia, after resigning as vice  president of Silves Enterprises Ltd. Arumae is the president of  the Estonian Lawyers Union. He was failed as Pro Patria's  candidate for the Tallinn mayor's office in last year's local  elections.    Raul Opik, currently officer at the Estonian Central Staff,  graduated from Tartu University as biologist. Has worked as a  teacher and gone in for amateur flying. Opik participated in  the 1993 World Championship of Glider Flying. He completed a  training course in Sweden for staff officers of the UN  peacekeeping forces last year and took part in UN operations in  Croatia.    President Lennart Meri formally dismissed former Defense  Minister Indrek Kannik and Justice Minister Kaido Kama Monday.</p>

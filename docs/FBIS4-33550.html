			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion": Commentary by Orlando Contreras; from the </F> "Doing Radio" program]    [Text] Information from abroad suggests that the obstinate  U.S. practice of gambling on and fueling Cuba's collapse loses  support every day because of its foundation and illegal nature  and that the longer it takes its supporters to reconsider this  position, the greater will be their failure.    Cuba will soon hold a new round of talks with British  businessmen, sponsored by THE ECONOMIST. One British analyst  says that this, among other things, indicates that London gives  little importance to Washington's claims of an alleged Cuban  collapse.    There is more: Cuban Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal  confirmed during a brief visit to several European and northern  countries the success of foreign contract oil exploration  enterprises that work in Cuba at their own risk. Several  European sources report that two new agreements have been signed  in London.    Qatar, a small, independent, Persian Gulf country that  produces a great deal of oil, not only has established  diplomatic relations with Cuba but also has decided to send  businessmen to Cuba and to work on mutually beneficial projects  with our country.    The 24th OAS General Assembly has just got underway in  Belem,  Brazil. Brazilian President Itamar Franco expressed support for  the OAS reconsidering its 30-year-old resolution separating Cuba  from that inter-American organization. Outgoing OAS President  Joao Baena Soares has also expressed support for this.    An important group of Colombian legislators, most of whom  are  from the Liberal Party, the current governing party, will send a  message to the fourth Ibero-American summit, beginning one week  from today in Cartagena de Indias, demanding the end of the U.S.  blockade against Cuba. In addition, a group of U.S.  businessmen, intellectuals, and politicians, together with  sectors of the Cuban emigre community, will demonstrate against  the blockade in Washington on 9 June.    Other reports state that Russia and Venezuela are  considering  the possibility of resuming the supply of oil to Cuba through a  formula that would save transportation from Russian ports.    Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will arrive in  Cuba on an official visit on 13 June. Mexico has always  maintained relations with our country, relations that remain in  optimum conditions.    These are the facts, not rhetoric, that demonstrate that  Washington's isolation regarding its anti-Cuban policy increases  every day.</p>

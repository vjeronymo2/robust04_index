			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a meeting yesterday with French Defense Minister  Francois Leotard, Faysal al-Husayni and other Palestinian  figures in the territories conveyed their annoyance over the  security agreements signed between France and Israel.    The Palestinians said this is not the right time to sign  cooperation agreements with Israel on security and military  issues. According to them, such agreements, coming in the  aftermath of the Hebron massacre, encourage Israel to perpetuate  its policy vis-a-vis the Palestinians.    In a news conference with French journalists, Leotard said  such an issue did not come up in his meeting with the  Palestinians.    Referring to French assistance, the Palestinians stressed  the  need for political over any other kind of aid. They asked  France to try to bring about a change in the Israeli position  with regard to the settlers and the settlements so that a small  number of settlements may be removed already at this stage.    Replying to the Palestinians' request that France support  the  notion of international protection in the territories, Leotard  said that if Israel and the Palestinians reached an agreement to  this effect, France would agree to participate in such a force.    At the news conference, Leotard said that France would agree  to an international presence but not to an international force.    The French minister expressed willingness to help train  personnel for the Palestinian police force.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 25 Feb (EFE) --  "Subcommander Marcos," leader of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) today reiterated that Mexican President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari should resign. The rebel leader added  that although the government's resignation will not be decided  at the dialogue he is holding with Peace Commissioner Manuel  Camacho Solis in San Cristobal de las Casas, "we still have to  state our position at the national level, whether individually  or at the bargaining table."    The Zapatist leader said: "The federal government, the  federal executive branch, and its cabinet should resign, because  how can this government guarantee that the people's will, as  expressed at the polls, be respected when the government has  already defined its position from the outset in favor of one of  the candidates?"    President Salinas' resignation and other points concerning  democracy are among the political demands made by the EZLN since  its 1 January insurrection in the southeastern Mexican state of  Chiapas.    Noting that "no one can be both judge and jury," Marcos said  there should be a transition government whose members should not  belong to any political party, or a government formed out of an  agreement among the various political parties, which will then  be able to organize the 21 August presidential elections.    Marcos said the regional conflict will not be resolved  "unless there is a radical, fundamental change -- a deep-rooted  change that will support a solution. [no closing quotation marks  as received]    Marcos added that southern Mexico (Chiapas, Tabasco,  Yucatan,  Campeche, and Quintana Roo) is the most exploited region in  Mexico -- an area "where more resources are extracted and less  benefits are received, a situation that will only worsen under  NAFTA." Marcos said NAFTA "will designate the southeastern  region as a banana republic, but instead of a banana-growing  region, it will be an oil and electricity region." He added,  "The country will be divided, and poverty in the southeast will  increase to even more unimaginable and inhuman levels, worse  than those seen in Somalia."    With regard to the progress made at the Chiapas peace talks  now under way at the San Cristobal Cathedral, Marcos reiterated  that the Indian groups have been very clear in stating that the  resolution of problems must be at a national level.    "The toughest and most difficult part" of the negotiations  is  still pending, Marcos stressed. He attributed the spectacular  progress and coverage of 50 percent of the agenda to the fact  that the talks began by dealing with the least divisive issues  "to send a signal to the country that peace, perhaps, is  possible."</p>

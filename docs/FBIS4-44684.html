			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Green Light for New EUTELSAT </F> Satellite"]    [Text] Paris--EUTELSAT [European Telecommunications  Satellite Organization] has just been given the green light to  conclude its negotiations with France's Matra Marconi Space  group for construction of its third television satellite, which  is to be placed at 13 East, according to an announcement on  30 March by the European Telecommunications Satellite  Organization.    The communique points out, however, that if the final  negotiations with Matra Marconi Space fail, negotiations may be  resumed with the French state-owned Aerospatiale [National  Industrial Aerospace Company], which was also a candidate.    The new satellite, initially named Hot Bird Plus, will be  delivered 27 months after the contract is signed and will be  launched in the summer of 1996. It will join EUTELSAT II F1 in  orbit as well as the next Hot Bird, which is scheduled for  launching this year. Its expected lifetime is 12 years, EUTELSAT  adds.    Television programming services will be able to choose  between two coverage zones, one in Europe from west to east--in  which case the programs will be accessible with small  antennas--and the other from Russia to the Canary Islands and  the Gulf countries. This new satellite will operate on both the  FSS (11.45-11.7 GHz) and the BSS (11.7-12.5 GHz) frequency band  with linear polarization. Its position at 13 East is  favorable for direct television, cable, and community antenna  reception.    Four EUTELSAT II and three EUTELSAT I satellites are  currently active. They carry broadcasting channels for  television, radio, telephony, and communications with businesses  and moving vehicles.    The EUTELSAT organization was officially established in 1985  and consists of the public and private telecommunications  services of 42 countries.</p>

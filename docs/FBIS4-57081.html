			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Elena Gil] </F>   [Text] Pretoria, 10 May (PL) -- Today in this capital,  Cuban President Fidel Castro said, after attending the  swearing-in ceremony of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela,  that South Africa has been called upon to exert a strong  influence throughout the region.    In this afternoon's meeting with the team of reporters who  accompanied him to the Mandela ceremonies, the Cuban president  described the South African president's election as an enormous  victory for the people of South Africa and for the world's  progressive forces.    It is a rebirth and proof that great victories can be  achieved in the wake of international disasters which have  occurred in the unipolar world in which we now live, Fidel  Castro said.    Asked by PRENSA LATINA about possibilities for cooperation  with the new South African Government, Cuba's top leader said:  "There are few countries that have the fraternal links that we  share with South Africa."    The country has, on the one hand, great development and  standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous  social needs in the areas of public health, employment,  education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to  appreciate in our talks with members of the South African  cabinet, Castro said.    Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples.    Regarding his first visit to this country, which a few years  ago was Cuba's battlefield enemy, Castro said: "We were treated  very respectfully by all sectors of society, not only from the  ANC [African National Congress], but also from the Indian,  white, and mestizo sectors, taking into account that this is a  multiracial country in which millions of people feel the need to  cooperate with one another."    There are two South Africas, the Cuban president said. At  various occasions in South African history, there were times of  violent clashes, but now there is a new South Africa in which  there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.    Castro believes the ANC government has a very difficult task  ahead of it, because "even though it is a relatively developed  country, there is a huge population that has lived for a long  time under apartheid, and it has the needs and yearnings of a  majority which has been discriminated against."    When referring to his first visit to this southern African  nation, Fidel Castro said, "with few countries do we have such  heart-felt and fraternal ties as those we have cultivated over  so many years with South Africa and the ANC. [no closing  quotation marks as received]    Every time one speaks to a South African, one first notices  the great spiritual possibilities that exist, Castro said.    In discussing diplomatic relations, Castro said, "We should  consider them when it is right for them, at an opportune  moment." Cuba will be very honored to develop its relations  with South Africa, he said.    I see evolving events in this country as something  marvelous,  and my greatest wish is that this country achieves peace and  harmony, something we all must contribute to enable the efforts  and sacrifices made by this a country to serve as a model for  the entire world, the Cuban leader underscored.    Regarding today's swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed  by more than 5,000 South Africans at the Union Building  amphitheater, Castro said: "The coming together of all South  Africans and all ethnic groups was beautiful. We hope that the  process continues to progress in this direction."    Today in South Africa, we helped bury apartheid and assisted  in the birth of liberty, Fidel Castro said.    This is the first time that a high-ranking official Cuban  delegation has stepped onto South African soil.    Both countries faced each other on the battlefield between  1976-91, when Cuban troops went to assist Angola at their  request, to safeguard its independence and territory, which had  been threatened by military forces backed by the racist Pretoria  regime.</p>

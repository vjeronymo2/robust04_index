Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In September 1993, Chemical Waste Transportation Institute (CWTI) applied for a determination that the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) preempts certain requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC). These requirements, in Title 6 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR), apply to the transfer and storage of hazardous wastes incidental to transportation (hereinafter ``transfer and storage requirements''). The text of CWTI's application was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 15, 1993, and interested parties were invited to submit comments. 58 FR 53614.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA has previously extended the period for public comments in this matter. One extension was in response to the requests of four States for additional time to submit comments, including the statement by NYDEC that it was preparing revisions to its regulations that would eliminate many of the specific requirements challenged by CWTI. 58 FR 65226 (Dec. 13, 1993). A second extension allowed additional time for NYDEC to publish proposed revisions to its transfer and storage requirements (which NYDEC then provided to all parties that had previously submitted comments on CWTI's application), for NYDEC to submit further comments that considered these proposed revisions, and for other parties to address these proposed revisions and NYDEC's further comments. 59 FR 4312 (Jan. 31, 1994). The rebuttal comment period, as extended, closed April 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA's Acting Administrator recently received a written request from the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials (ASTSWMO) for a meeting to discuss the effect of RSPA's preemption ``activities upon States' ability to appropriately regulate transporters of hazardous waste under [the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act] RCRA.'' ASTSWMO indicated that it would like to discuss, among other issues, the ``commingling and mixing of hazardous waste by transporters while in transit,'' and the ``off loading and storage of hazardous waste at non-RCRA regulated sites.'' These issues are involved in the NYDEC transfer and storage requirements challenged in CWTI's application. RSPA views this request broadly as a desire by ASTSWMO to make additional comments beyond its January 13, 1994 letter already submitted on CWTI's application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASTSWMO's letter and RSPA's response, denying ASTSWMO's request for a meeting, have been placed in the public docket. In view of the concerns expressed in ASTSWMO's letter and possible developments in connection with NYDEC's proposed revisions to its transfer and storage requirements, RSPA considers it appropriate to reopen the comment period on CWTI's application to allow:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

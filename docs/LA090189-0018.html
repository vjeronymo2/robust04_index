			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SANTIAGO HOMERS IN 5-1 WIN  </P> <P> Dennis Rasmussen pitched six no-hit innings, and Benito Santiago hit a  three-run home run Thursday as the San Diego Padres downed Philadelphia, 5-1,  in San Diego.  </P> <P> The victory, San Diego's seventh in eight games, pulled them within 6 1/2 games  of division-leading San Francisco, which was idle, in the National League West.  </P> <P> To Rasmussen, the possible no-hitter and shutout were secondary.  </P> <P> "We're just trying to play it one game at a time and win as many games as we  can," Rasmussen said. "We've got a feeling in here that we didn't have earlier  in the season. Nobody cares who gets the job done, as long as we win the game."  </P> <P> Rasmussen (8-9) retired the first 16 batters he faced before Dickie Thon drew a  one-out walk in the sixth. The left-hander, who won for the fourth time in his  last five decisions, lost his no-hitter in the seventh when Tommy Herr followed  a leadoff walk to Len Dykstra with a single.  </P> <P> Ex-Padre John Kruk followed with a single that scored Dykstra. Mark Grant  replaced Rasmussen, retired the side and went the final three innings for his  second save, allowing three hits.  </P> <P> Rasmussen would have been the first San Diego pitcher to pitch a no-hitter  since the Padres joined the National League in 1969.  </P> <P> The Padres scored in the second inning off Don Carman (4-15) on a double by  Jack Clark and an RBI single by Chris James. Santiago followed one-out singles  by James and Garry Templeton in the sixth with his ninth homer of the season, a  drive over the left-field fence.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Chicago 1 -- George Bell drove in three runs, two on a home run that  extended his hitting streak to a club-record 22 games, as the Blue Jays moved  into a tie with first-place Baltimore after a three-game sweep of the White Sox  at Toronto.  </P> <P> Dave Stieb (14-8) allowed four hits in six innings, struck out two and walked  two. Jim Acker followed with two hitless innings, and Tom Henke pitched the  ninth to finish the combined six-hitter.  </P> <P> Steve Rosenberg (4-10) gave up five runs and nine hits in his second complete  game of the season.  </P> <P> Toronto came back from a one-run deficit with three runs in the bottom of the  first inning. Mookie Wilson opened with an infield single and scored on Manny  Lee's triple. Lee scored on Bell's ground-out to first base. Kelly Gruber  doubled with two out, took third on Rosenberg's wild pitch and scored on Tony  Fernandez' single.  </P> <P> Cleveland 11, Baltimore 0 -- Joe Carter hit two home runs, and John Farrell  pitched a five-hitter at Cleveland, dropping the Orioles into a first-place tie  with Toronto.  </P> <P> Farrell (8-13) got his sixth complete game, striking out five and walking two  in his second career shutout.  </P> <P> Carter led off the fourth inning with his 27th homer, the first of five  straight Cleveland hits off rookie Dave Johnson (4-3). Pete O'Brien and Brook  Jacoby singled to put runners at first and third, and Cory Snyder and Brad  Komminsk followed with RBI singles that finished Johnson.  </P> <P> In the fifth inning, Carter hit a two-run homer off Dave Schmidt, giving Carter  20 games in his career with two or more home runs.  </P> <P> Kansas City 3, Detroit 0 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched eight innings, allowed five  hits, struck out seven and walked none at Kansas City, winning his eighth game  in a row, as the Royals moved within 2 1/2 games of Oakland in the American  League West.  </P> <P> Saberhagen (17-5) has won 14 of his last 15 decisions. Jeff Montgomery worked  the ninth for his 15th save.  </P> <P> Kansas City scored an unearned run in the first after Kevin Seitzer doubled  leading off. With one out, Bo Jackson hit a grounder under the glove of Detroit  first baseman Dave Bergman, and Seitzer scored on the error. Seitzer led the  offense with three of Kansas City's six hits. Minnesota 8, Texas 6 -- Chip  Hale's first major league run batted in broke a 3-3 tie and helped the Twins  win at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Hale, called up last Saturday when Gary Gaetti was placed on the disabled list,  hit a sacrifice fly to score Brian Harper with the go-ahead run in the bottom  of the fifth. He added an RBI single in the seventh.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 6, Seattle 1 -- Mark Knudson combined with two relievers on a  five-hitter, and Billy Spiers drove in three runs at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Knudson (5-4) walked one, struck out two and allowed four hits and an unearned  run in 7 1/3 innings.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Immigration officials refused to free from a Minnesota prison a Dutch visitor  who says he has AIDS, saying that allowing him to attend a forum on the disease  might endanger the health of others. "Parole is an extreme item that would be  used only in extreme circumstances," said Tom Schiltgen, district director of  the Immigration and Naturalization Service, explaining his rejection of the  request from Hans Paul Verhoef. However, Schiltgen said a decision is likely  today on Verhoef's request for a waiver from U.S. immigration laws denying  entry to persons with a dangerous contagious disease.  </P></p>

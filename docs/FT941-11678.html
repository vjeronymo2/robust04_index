			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): More than just a pint and a packet of crisps - Britain's brewers are having to work harder to maintain the pub's popularity The public house is still Britain's most popular social venue. A third of adults visit a pub at least once a week. It is the first choice as a place to meet friends, according to a recent Mori poll. But brewers and independent pub operators are having to work harder to maintain the pub's appeal and its place in the leisure industry during the 1990s. The closure of an estimated 3,000 pubs since 1989 - and predictions that 10 per cent of the remaining 65,000 will go out of business by the end of the decade - testify to the pressures. The number of young people, the pub's traditional big spending customers, is declining. Drinking habits are changing under the impact of healthier lifestyles, drink-driving laws and shifting employment patterns. There is more competition for leisure spending from restaurants and wine bars, fast-food outlets and clubs. Home entertainment has grown with the proliferation of television and videos. 'It is no longer enough just to open the pub doors,' says John McKeown, retail services director at Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks group. 'You have to offer much more than a drink to bring the customers inside.' Exactly what can be done to satisfy the more demanding, value-conscious consumers of the 1990s and improve the return on assets is an issue on which pub operators are now concentrating their retail skills. Allied, which earns an estimated 16 per cent of its profits from a directly-managed estate of 2,500 pubs, believes it has found several equally successful answers. In an attempt to understand the demands of its varied customers, Allied classified its pubs in the mid-1980s according to the community they served, the dominant age and social class of customers, and their drinking habits. Combined with the introduction of electronic point-of-sale systems, this exercise enabled Allied to cater much more effectively to customer demands in each market sector and to anticipate changing attitudes and values. McKeown has no doubt about what is needed to maintain the pub's place as a social centre. 'You have got to make a visit to the pub an occasion, provide an enjoyable experience that will persuade customers to stay for a few hours, and provide the reassurance of consistent quality that will bring them back regularly,' he says. Allied hopes to achieve these aims with three concepts, each designed to meet the need of a different niche market. Two in particular are transforming some of Allied's pubs most threatened with closure. Under the first concept, the company is converting into Firkin outlets local pubs which had little to offer their neighbourhood but convenience. Allied extended the brand - originally developed by David Bruce, now a director of Grosvenor Inns, the pub operator - after buying 14 of the pubs from Stakis, the hotels and casinos group. Firkin pubs appeal to young drinkers. They feature uncluttered floor space, at least one large table that a dozen people can sit around, young staff - and most of them have a micro-brewery in the cellar producing 10-12 barrels a week of rich brews with names like Dog Bolter. By the end of this year Allied will have 23 Firkins, and 53 by the end of next year. Pubs that have already been converted - at an average cost of Pounds 150,000 - have achieved up to a fivefold increase in turnover. McKeown says: 'There is a limit to the development. If there were hundreds of them, they would fail. One is enough in most university towns.' Plans for Allied's second youth-appeal pub brand, Mr Q's, are more ambitious. Pubs that have become stranded by population shifts, often on the edge of 1930s housing estates, are being fitted with four or five pool tables, a wall of screens for MTV and video juke boxes. The number has been doubled in the past year to 161, and by next year there will be 220 of them. 'Even if they did not sell more beer - and they do - they would still be very successful,' McKeown claims. Firkin and Mr Q's aim to buck the demographic and economic trends; but in the third part of its pubs strategy, Allied is trying to consolidate its position in the mainstream eating-out market for older couples and families. Good value meals have become a much more important part of the pub's offering during the recession. Allied now seeks to fill a niche between the big pub-restaurant and the bar snacks trade with its Big Steak houses. 'A lot of people still feel uncomfortable in restaurants,' says McKeown. 'They don't like the ritual of ordering, and the waiters hovering around.' So Big Steak incorporates a dining area in the pub and links its service to the bar. 'It costs about Pounds 260,000 for a Big Steak conversion, 'but the investment so far is showing very good returns, with food profits 35 per cent ahead,' he says. The number of outlets has been increased from 170 to 232 in the past year. Allied intends to manage its pub brands on the same lines as its retail franchises, Dunkin Donuts and Baskin-Robbins. 'We shall set and maintain the brand standards centrally,' says McKeown.</p>

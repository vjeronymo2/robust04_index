			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Foreign Exchange Deposits Up"] </F>   [Text] Individual foreign exchange savings in the Bank of  China (BOC) have surpassed $10 billion.    Although specific figures are not available, an official  with  the bank said BOC depositors usually account for about 65 per  cent of the country's total individual foreign exchange savings.    The official said bigger foreign exchange savings give the  bank more capital for supporting domestic and foreign-funded  ventures.    The official said the bank's individual savings have been  accelerating since the beginning of last year.    In the past 16 months, deposits have risen by $4 billion, an  average of $250 million a month.    The official attributed the high growth to the country's  opening to the outside world, which has given Chinese more  access to foreign exchange.    Domestic institutions and firms have assigned more people to  work in overseas affiliates, and more labourers have been sent  abroad on engineering projects.    Meanwhile, more Chinese residents have gone abroad to study  or tour the official said.    The foreign exchange they bring back is the major source of  the Bank of China's individual savings.    The official noted that more foreigners and residents of  Hong  Kong, Macao and Taiwan have entered the Chinese mainland. Part  of their foreign exchange usually flows to relatives and friends  in the mainland.    Furthermore, Chinese self-employed businessmen usually put  their money in banks in the name of individuals instead of firms.    All these have created wider sources of foreign exchange. At  the same time, though, limits remain on how foreign exchange can  be spent, thus ensuring healthy bank deposits.    Although the China Investment Bank has permission to sell  $50  million worth of foreign-currency bonds to individual Chinese,  these bonds have not yet been issued.    With few alternatives for spending their foreign currency,  many Chinese prefer to put the money in banks even though the  interest rate is relatively low compared with renminbi deposits.    Although the bank has raised the interest rate for foreign  exchange accounts three times this year, the rate for one-year  fixed-term savings in U.S. dollars is still only 4.3125 per  cent, compared with 10.98 per cent for renminbi.    The official said the devaluation of the renminbi has also  induced Chinese to put their foreign exchange in banks to  protect its value.    The Bank of China started its individual foreign exchange  savings in 1984. Its more than 8,000 outlets accept savings in  six currencies: U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, British pound,  Deutsche mark, Japanese yen and French franc.</p>

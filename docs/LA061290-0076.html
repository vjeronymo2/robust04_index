			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ...AND HALF A WORLD AWAY, A JAPANESE TOWN HAILS AN ADOPTED SON'S VICTORY  </P> <P> News of Alberto Fujimori's victory in Peru's presidential election brought  people into the streets to celebrate half a world away in Kawachi, the small  Japanese town where his father was born. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also  welcomed the news.  </P> <P> But a Japanese government spokesman ruled out any special economic aid for the  hugely indebted South American country just because its new leader is of  Japanese descent.  </P> <P> "Our government does not take special measures on the grounds that a Japanese  descendant has won (an election)," Nobuo Ishihara told reporters.  </P> <P> There was no such reserve in Kawachi, in the Kumamoto region of southern Japan.  </P> <P> "Hundreds of townspeople gathered at the town hall early in the morning to  celebrate Mr. Fujimori's victory," said Shunji Shimazu, mayor of the town that  Fujimori's father, Naoichi, a tailor, left in 1934 to seek his fortune in  faraway Peru.  </P> <P> "They broke open a sake barrel and toasted the new president to cries of  'Banzai!' The whole township is now obsessed by the news of Fujimori," the  mayor said.  </P> <P> Shimazu said he immediately sent Fujimori a congratulatory message and put up  banners at the town hall reading, "Congratulations, President Alberto  Fujimori."  </P> <P> A Peruvian flag and Japan's rising sun flew together outside, he added. A  street is to be renamed Fujimori Avenue.  </P></p>

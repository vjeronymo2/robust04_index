			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Bond pleads not guilty to Perth dishonesty charge MR Alan Bond, the bankrupt former Australian entrepreneur, yesterday pleaded not guilty in a Western Australian court to a charge of dishonestly inducing a businessman to take part in a ADollars 370m (Pounds 158m) corporate rescue. The charges relate to a 1987 attempt by the Western Australian state government and business community to rescue the Perth-based Rothwells merchant bank, run by Mr Laurie Connell. Mr Bond, former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, is alleged to have persuaded Mr Brian Coppin, a Perth businessman, to subscribe for shares in Rothwells without disclosing that Bond Corp would earn an ADollars 16m fee for helping to arrange the rescue. Mr Coppin said he was approached by Mr Bond to subscribe ADollars 20m to the Rothwells rescue, subsequently reduced to ADollars 8m. He said his commitment was finalised at 7am on Monday October 26 1987. But he was not told of Bond Corp's fee until November 14. Mr Connell said he had resisted requests for fees totalling ADollars 30m from Mr Bond and another businessman who helped arrange the rescue. He later agreed a personal liability for ADollars 16m to Bond Corp. The Rothwells crisis followed the worldwide stock market collapse in October 1987, when the bank's deposits came under pressure. Bond Corp helped put together a refinancing deal in which Mr Connell contributed ADollars 70m in subordinated debt, backed by a ADollars 150m share issue and a state government indemnity for ADollars 150m against a loan facility provided by National Australia Bank. Rothwells collapsed in November 1988, and is the focus of a royal commission inquiry into relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western Australia. The trial, which is expected to last all week, follows a declaration of bankruptcy against Mr Bond last month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Joining Lu Ping this week will be two rising stars  of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office: administration  director Xu Ze and economic director Zhang Liangdong.    Relatively young in years--Mr Xu is 38 and Mr Zhang is  40--both are potential successors to Mr Lu. Unlike their chief,  however, both have previously done their best to keep a low  profile. They seldom respond to questions from reporters at  public functions and are therefore rarely sought for comment.  However, January's high-level reshuffle at the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, which elevated both to their present  posts, has thrown them into the spotlight. Mr Xu is now in  charge of political affairs, which covers such crucial issues as  the fate of the Legislative Council after 1997 and the future of  the civil service, while Mr Zhang's economic remit includes  responsibility for the Chek Lap Kok project.    Their appointments were out of character for the Chinese  bureaucracy, which normally appoints elderly cadres to such key  posts. They are also highly unusual in that, unlike most  mainland officials handling Hong Kong affairs, both are from  Guangdong province and speak fluent Cantonese. Mr Xu, who is  said to be highly regarded by Mr Lu, made his mark during last  year's Sino- British negotiations on political reform. Although  he did not take part in the 17 rounds of unsuccessful talks, he  is believed to have played a key role in formulating the Chinese  team's counter-proposals on Hong Kong's 1994-95 polls. At the  time Mr Xu was deputy director of the Hong Kong affairs office's  First Department, later renamed the Administration Department.  In this position, he met a wide range of delegations from the  territory, and accompanied Mr Lu to meetings with them whenever  political affairs were on the agenda.    The two rising stars were also classmates: they were part of  the second batch of students to begin tertiary studies following  the re-opening of mainland universities at the end of the  Cultural Revolution. Admitted to the Chinese Language  Department of Zhongshan University in Guangzhou in 1978, they  joined the newly-formed Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  immediately after their graduation in 1982. Mr Zhang also did a  stint as First Secretary at the Hong Kong office of the Chinese  Joint Liaison Group team. He returned to Beijing in 1990 and  later studied in Britain.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Renovated fish market reopens ASSOCIATED British Ports will today officially open England's largest fresh fish auction market after a Pounds 300,000 investment programme to bring it up to new European Community standards, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The government has met about 20 per cent of the cost. The market - a 60,000 sq ft group of covered sheds - handles 50,000 tonnes of fish a year. The development has given Hull an edge over Grimsby, traditionally one of Britain's pre-eminent fishing ports, which lies across the Humber on the south bank of the estuary. Grimsby, which - like Hull - is owned by ABP, is having to spend more than Pounds 8m to rebuild its fish auction sheds to meet the new standards.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bogdan Markiewicz and DIK: "Walesa: Strikes </F> Threaten the Country's Security"]    [Excerpts] After the 4 May session of the government  on the defense system of the country, President Lech Walesa, who  took part in it, said that strikes, particularly in the  strategic branches of the economy, negatively affect the  country's security.    According to the president, this should be regulated by law,  through negotiations with the trade unions, that "not everyone  strikes and not everyone must pay for strikes." Thus Lech  Walesa, the symbol of the Polish strikes, has become their  opponent today.    Everything seems to suggest, then, that increasingly more  politicians in Poland come to the conclusion that staging a  strike is not the best method of changing subsequent  governments. Many stress that strikes fulfilled their role in  1988 because they were a weapon in the fight for changes in the  political system. Today they are an obstacle in the economy  which is striving to overcome the crisis. According to the  president, the current strikes threaten the country's security.    When asked by TRYBUNA whether the president's statement  might  mean that the President's Office is conducting work on a draft  law which would limit the right to strike, especially in areas  that are strategic for the country, Minister Andrzej Drzycimski  stated that Lech Walesa directed the question to the unionists  and to the government, and that he is waiting for a response.    As we found out unofficially in the Office of the Council of  Ministers, so far no work has been conducted on a draft law  restricting the right of the employees of the strategic sector  to stage a strike.    Asked for a comment on the president's statement, Marian  Krzaklewski, chairman of the Independent Self-Governing Trade  Union "Solidarity" ["S"], said that Lech Walesa would define his  attitude toward strike actions by signing or not signing the new  popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. On the previous  day the "S" leader stated that it would be one of the last  chances for the president. [passage omitted]    Wit Majewski, deputy chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions  Agreement, commenting on the president's statement, said that it  is not known what the president was thinking when he mentioned  strategic branches. "Well, it is obvious that every branch  influences the stability, security, and defense system of the  country. I understand that the president means chiefly the  power industry, transport, and the defense industry. One can  start negotiations on limiting the right to stage strikes in  these branches --- however, only if we were able to guarantee  wages and good work in these sectors."    In Poland there are certain limitations in the rights to  strike. They comprise the Office of State Protection, police,  the Armed Forces of the Polish Army, Prison Services, and the  Border Troops. The law on the settlement of collective  bargaining also includes a provision saying that it is  inadmissible to stop work as a result of strike actions in  workplaces with machines and installations where such a stoppage  threatens lives or the health of people, or where the country's  security is jeopardized.

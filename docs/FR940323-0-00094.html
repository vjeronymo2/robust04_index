The plant is protected by the New Mexico Endangered Plant Species Act. Any person wishing to collect a species listed under this Act for the purposes of scientific investigation, documenting a new population, or transplanting must first obtain a permit from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. The Forest Service has included the Holy Ghost ipomopsis on its Sensitive Plant Species List. The species is considered in Forest Service environmental assessments and planning. The Endangered Species Act would provide additional protection for this species through section 7 (interagency cooperation) requirements and through section 9, which prohibits malicious damage, destruction, or removal and reduction to possession of plants occurring on lands under Federal jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Low numbers and limited distribution make this species vulnerable to extinction from natural and manmade threats. Reduction in plant numbers could reduce the reproductive capabilities and genetic potential of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list Holy Ghost ipomopsis as endangered without critical habitat. This status is appropriate because of the species' limited distribution, low population numbers, proximity of human development, and intensity of human use of the area. Potential threats include road maintenance, habitat alteration, pesticide application, and fire suppression. Critical habitat is not being designated for the reasons discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for this species. Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.12(a)(1), a designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations exist_(1) the species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' Holy Ghost ipomopsis is threatened by taking, an activity that is difficult to prevent and only regulated by the Act with respect to plants in cases of (1) removal and reduction to possession of listed plants from lands under Federal jurisdiction, or their malicious damage or destruction on such lands; and (2) removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation of any state law or regulation, including state criminal trespass law. Such provisions are difficult to enforce, and publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would make Holy Ghost ipomopsis more vulnerable and increase enforcement problems. All involved parties and principal landowners have been notified of the location and importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and through section 7 consultation. Therefore, it would not now be prudent to determine critical habitat for Holy Ghost ipomopsis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Pastusiak, who is heading the permanent delegation of the  Polish Sejm to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, in an interview  with a PAP journalist, assessed the American proposal  "relatively positive," although, in his opinion, it does not  fully meet Poland's aspirations to NATO membership.    Pastusiak said that the "partnership" will be a "litmus  test"  of intentions of the countries aspiring to membership in the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As part of this  "partnership" each of the countries will present its proposals  for NATO membership. In this way the status of cooperation of  various states with NATO will be diversified and it will be  revealed which of them are really interested in such  cooperation, he emphasized.    According to Pastusiak, persistent "knocking on NATO's door"  may cause irritation in the West, and in Poland it may lead to  society's disappointment with the West and NATO.</p>

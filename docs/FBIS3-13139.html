			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman--A group of Palestinians, believed to be  mainly returnees from Kuwait who have set up a self-styled  "Palestinian government -- provisional leadership council," has  sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton disowning the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and calling on  Washington to shift its stand away from the PLO in the quest for  a Middle East peace settlement.    Palestinian observers and diplomats dismissed the group as  insignificant. Some said they never heard of such a group and  others said it did not represent any large number of  Palestinians and did not enjoy grass-roots support.    The group, if indeed it has any membership that warrants  such  a description, appears to be one that first surfaced in Jordan  in late 1990, mainly represented by one man who used to describe  himself as a Palestinian journalist who was forced out of Kuwait  following the Iraqi invasion of the emirate.    The man, who gave varying names to different people, claimed  that he represented "the sons of Palestine who enjoy grass-roots  support in the occupied territories, particularly the West Bank."    "We will show our real strength when the time is right, and  we will take over the leadership of the Palestinian people  everywhere," the man has reportedly told news organisations  before disappearing from view for some time.    According to some Palestinian sources, the man has  supporters  among a few of the Palestinian returnees from Kuwait who  resented the PLO's sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf crisis.  The PLO stand, they argued, had led to their ouster from the  emirate.    A copy of a letter from the group, addressed to "United  States of America, Washington, White House, his kind attention  his excellency the president of the United States Mr. Bill  Clinton" (sic), was made available to the JORDAN TIMES Tuesday  [8 March].    The typed message was on a letterhead bearing the name  "Palestinian government -- provisional leadership council," and  had an official-looking rubber stamp.    A recorded voice answered calls to a telephone number given  in the letterhead.    No comment was immediately available from the U.S. Embassy  here, whether it had received a copy of the letter or how it was  treating the purported group.    The undated letter said the PLO "doesn't represent the  Palestinians under the occupation and immigrants all over the  world," and that the Tunis-based organisation "represets only  those who are employees and having orders and salaries from  (Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat."    "We as Palestinians are very grateful to your adminstration,  which collected financial aid to the occupied territories," said  the letter, written in poor English, in an apparent reference to  Washington's role in securing international pledges worth more  than $2.2 billion to support the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO accord.    The rambling letter, parts of which did not make much sense,  said economic development of the occupied territories was not  possible if it was "run by military mentality people," and  suggested that an international conference be held in Jordan to  elect "a temporary Palestinian administration to run the  occupied territories" with help from Jordan. The proposed  administration should tackle the various aspects of the  situation of the occupied territories, including economics,  health, agriculture, education, public relations, industry and  investment, it said.    According to the group, participants in the proposed  administration should include Palestine, Jordan and unspecified  "other areas" and "some persons" from the PLO in their capacity  as independents.    A pre-qualification set by the group for anyone to take part  in the proposed administration is "good behaviour" and a  "behaviour certificate" from the country of residence.    It called for the establishment of a "Jordanian-Palestinian  national bank for development" with 50 percent of the equity for  Jordan and Palestine and the rest for countries which have  pledged aid.    The capital for the bank could come from the pledged funds  and the institution will be run by a committee under the  "supervision of your administration," the letter told President  Clinton.    It also called for the establishment of a society "for old  fighters" to be trained in civil administration and development  and to "let them (old fighters) live a pure life by cleaning the  military mentality that they (have) lived..."    It argued that "any Palestinian state couldn't act without a  link with Jordan" and expressed "hope that matters (will) turn  back to (pre)-1967 June (as) a result of a survey (presumably a  referendum)."    "Let the Jordanians and Palestinians give any name to the  new  unity," it said. "This unity will (preempt) establishing  different administrations... the nature of partnership between  (the) West and East Bank(s) of (the) Jordan River could be not  separated...    "Jordan has given opportunities for immigrants to take their  chances to grow up educationally and financially," said the four  page letter. "People are fair will consider how much Jordan  (spent) on such... matters..." [sentence as published]    "If such a link takes place," said the letter, "the  replacement of Jordan (as) Palestine will be completely"  preempted.</p>

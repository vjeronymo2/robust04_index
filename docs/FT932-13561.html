			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (12): Cairenes reluctant to move - Emma Tucker visits a city more successful economically than socially ORIENTAL Weavers, the Egyptian carpets company, is having a good year. At recent international trade fairs, Omar Sharif accompanied sales representatives to promote a new range of carpets named after the Arabian film-star; in Egypt, 7-minute long advertisements run regularly on television. The company's success is reflected in its palatial factory in 10th of Ramadan, a satellite industrial town 55 kilometres outside Cairo. From the walls of the show room, a carpet of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president, peers down on the Sharif range - Lara, Russian Shawl, Lawrence and Arabian Nights, among others. Most of these and the other carpets manufactured by Oriental Weavers are destined for overseas. The company is one of the most successful industries in the relatively new city called 10th of Ramadan - in memory of the war with Israel. It was established in the 1970s to encourage investment and help depopulate Cairo. Since then, more than 500 companies have come to the city, including furniture makers, heavy industry and pharmaceuticals companies. Other ventures are under way. Many have been successful; the total output of the city is now more than EPounds 3,000m (Dollars 900m) a year, with one-third of the total production exported. Most of the city's businesses are privately owned, mainly by Egyptians, although joint ventures with foreign companies account for about a third. Overseas investors have brought in more than EPounds 1,000m (Dollars 300m) with much of the capital flowing from Saudi Arabia. The US, Syria, and Kuwait have also invested. The general verdict on 10th of Ramadan, some 20 years on, is that while it has succeeded in attracting industry and creating jobs, it has not worked so well as a social experiment. The air is cleaner, the roads wide and the apartments modern. Most of the city's employees are offered either free, or highly subsidised accommodation by their companies. But Cairenes have been reluctant to relocate, apparently preferring life in the ramshackle streets of the capital. Estimates of the number of people living in 10th of Ramadan are hard to come by, but the number quoted most often is 100,000. The city's capacity, however, is for up to 400,000 and lines of newly built apartments and villas stand empty. Most of the companies operating there have to bus part of their workforce from Cairo and the Delta. Attracting labour is easy, because average wages are significantly higher than those in state-run industries. At Oriental Weavers, the average wage for production line workers, including incentives, is EPounds 500. The Egyptian International Pharmaceutical Industries (Eipico), which employs 1,400 at its factory in 10th of Ramadan, has an average starting pay for workers of about EPounds 250. Incentives for companies to come to 10th of Ramadan include a 10 year tax holiday - which can be extended if enterprises undertake further investment  -cheap land, cheap labour and, after teething problems, relatively easy access to essential infrastructure such as telephone lines. The drawbacks remain the same as those for most companies operating in Egypt. Import tariffs in particular continue to reduce competition. Mr Haisam Mohamed Jameel, a representative of the Gromex furniture company, whose initial EPounds 2m investment in 1980 has grown to EPounds 10m, says the reduction of tariffs would help him compete more successfully in the international market. 'Importing raw materials such as wood, which we don't have, is a real problem because the import tariffs are very high,' he says. But he benefits from the heavy protection the furniture industry enjoys. The problem of attracting residents remains. Mr Mohamed Khairy Taha, financial director of Eipico, which has been operating in 10th of Ramadan since 1985, says the reluctance of workers to move to the city reflects Egyptian conservatism. 'Egyptians do not shift easily. They don't like to leave their families.' None the less he is confident that in another 10 years the city will be self-generating. 'Ten years ago you would have been afraid to move here. Now there are schools, supermarkets and sports facilities.' Aid agencies give other reasons for the failure of 10th of Ramadan to attract higher numbers. Transport between the city and Cairo is patchy, making it difficult for families to stay in contact. The city authorities were slow to develop social infrastructure such as schools and parks. Furthermore, unlike in Cairo, there are few opportunities for younger members of families to hustle for business during the day. But A new park is about to open near the middle of the town and a sports centre is under construction. Each area of the city has a mosque and there is a church to serve resident coptic Christians. And Mr Mohamed Farid Khamis, chairman of the Oriental Weavers Group, is building a sumptuous-looking villa on the outskirts of town.</p>

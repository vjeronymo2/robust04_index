			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ARCADIA;  </P> <P> FIRM SUES AGENCY AND WINS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge last week ordered the Arcadia Redevelopment  Agency to pay Rentype Inc. $32,500 plus three years' interest for lost profits  resulting from the agency's precondemnation actions.  </P> <P> The East Huntington Drive office supply firm filed for a building permit to  remodel its offices in 1984.  </P> <P> Rentype President Roger Mabry said the agency refused to permit the remodeling  unless the company agreed to a list of conditions, one of them being that the  business would cease to operate within five years.  </P> <P> The agency also wanted the firm to agree not to ask for more than $50,000 in  reimbursement for any improvements if the agency decided to acquire the  property, Mabry said. The remodeling would have cost from $100,000 to $150,000.  </P> <P> Rentype, which has since moved to Azusa, rejected the conditions and never got  the permit.  </P> <P> The agency acquired the business by eminent domain in 1987. The land is now a  parking lot near the new Automobile Club of Southern California headquarters.  </P></p>

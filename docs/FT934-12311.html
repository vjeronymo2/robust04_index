			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Roxboro to float with Pounds 80.5m tag SHARES IN Roxboro, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic components which is coming to market through a placing and offer for sale, were priced at 230p yesterday, valuing the group at Pounds 80.5m. The issue, which is fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, involves 21.7m ordinary shares of which 14.1m (65 per cent) are expected to be placed with institutions; the balance of 7.61m will be offered to the public. The group will raise about Pounds 11.9m net of expenses from the issue. The proceeds will be used to repay debt and fund expansion. Roxboro has forecast sharply higher trading and pre-tax profits for the current year. Trading profits after central costs, but before exceptional costs of Pounds 500,000, are forecast to more than double to Pounds 6.5m in the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 3.1m last year and Pounds 1.8m in 1991. Earnings are expected to total 11.6p this year (or 13.3p before exceptional items). The notional dividend for the current year is forecast at 1.9p. Dealings are expected to begin on November 9. COMMENT Since the management buy-out from Cambridge Electronic Industries Roxboro has been restructured and refocused away from low-margin commodity components. The restructuring is now complete and the benefits should begin to show through next year. Profits will also benefit from the elimination of interest costs and the growth in sales of new products. Based on current year forecasts the shares are priced at a multiple of 17.3 - a substantial discount to others in the sector. This is a solid stock in a growth market at a reasonable price.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin and Premier Li Peng have sent a telegram of condolence on  the death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon today.    The full text of the telegram reads:    We are shocked to learn that Mr. Nixon has died. We wish to  express our profound condolences. Mr. Nixon was a statesman  with strategic foresight and political courage, and he opened a  new era in Sino-U.S. relations together with late Chinese  Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai.    Since he left office Mr. Nixon continued to be concerned  with  Sino-U.S. ties and made an important contribution to the  upholding and development of the relations.    The Sino-U.S. relations will surely be further promoted and  developed by the joint efforts of the two countries.    We wish to express our sincere sympathy for Mr. Nixon's  family.</p>

"The commonality of the geographic location and economic  problems necessitate the consolidation of efforts in the  interests of the entire territory. The most pressing task is to  revivify the timber, mining and fur industries and to combat the  plunder of natural riches and their illicit export," Konyukhov  said.    According to Konyukhov, the new organisation will form an  economic mini-community within this component part of the  Russian Federation. It pursues no political aims.    Work is under way on the charter and programme of the  economic union which are expected to be approved by the second  joint session of the heads of administrations. The organisation  will be funded from the budget of the territory and its  component parts.</p>

Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt (47), Willy Brandt's  widow, told BILD: "In the second half of March 1992, Valentin  Falin, the former Soviet ambassador to Bonn, visited Brandt in  Bonn."    During this meeting, Falin told Willy Brandt that Wienand  was  a KGB spy, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt stated. The Federal  Intelligence Service was then informed.    Wienand emphatically rejected all accusations yesterday.    In the meantime, official Bonn has been alarmed by the  suspicions of espionage that also affect former SPD Bundestag  group chairman Wehner, who died in 1990.    Waigel, the head of the Christian Democratic Union, called  on  the SPD in Munich "to clarify the matter." SPD leader Scharping  did not see much new in the accusations against Wehner.    BILD asked former SPD leader Vogel: "Did Brandt tell you  anything about Wienand's activities as an agent?"    Vogel replied: "For reasons of principle, I do not want to  disclose details of talks that were held when Willy Brandt knew  he would die soon. I consider this respect for human dignity.  Thus, no conclusions can be drawn in any direction."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 11 Jun (EFE) -- On 10 June, Ecuadoran  President Sixto Duran-Ballen called for a referendum -- he did  not specify a date -- that will result in a plebiscite on 2  January 1995 to convene a constituent assembly to reform the  Constitution.    "Our greatest goal is to carry out a genuine reform of the  social, political, economic, and moral systems," Duran-Ballen  stated in a national radio and television broadcast. He  revealed a seven-point questionnaire for the referendum,  including the prospect of convening a constituent assembly on 2  January 1995.    The proposed structural reform process seeks "to end the  current institutional plan, which only promotes useless  confrontations, absurd skirmishes, obstacles among the functions  of the state, discredit, the degradation of justice, and, even  worse, a total disregard of the fundamental mission of the  state: to look after the welfare of its citizens," he added.    The other questions refer to the possibility -- now banned  --  of electing citizens who are not members of political parties.  Other questions focused on retaining or removing the prevailing  capacity of the deputies to manage public funds and approving  the state budget and the reelection -- also banned -- for any  popularly elected position, including those of president, vice  president, and deputies.    The sixth question focuses on the issue of whether deputies  must be elected during the first or the second presidential  elections every four years. Currently, deputies are elected in  the first round, which makes Congress very heterogeneous. The  last question asks for a referendum regarding the current  prohibition on acquiring a second nationality without losing  Ecuadoran citizenship.    Last April, Duran-Ballen convened the referendum with a  similar questionnaire for 1 May 1994. However, his request was  "illegally" denied by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], he  underscored today. TSE members then argued that holding a  referendum on constitutional reforms was possible only if the  deputies previously had directly denied the topics being voted  on.</p>

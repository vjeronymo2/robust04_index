			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Dupond to Head Paris Ballet: Rudolf Nureyev's stormy six-year stint at the  Paris Opera Ballet ended Thursday when rising French star Patrick Dupond, 30,  was named to succeed him as the troupe's new dance director.  </P> <P> But a bitter dispute over the copyright and control of the ballets that  Soviet-born Nureyev choreographed for the opera house is only just beginning,  Pierre Berge, chairman of the Paris Opera, said. Nureyev was eased out as head  of the Paris ballet last year, but he stayed on as chief choreographer while  Berge searched for a successor. French Culture Minister Jack Lang said that  Dupond's three-year contract stipulated at least 20 dance performances each  season. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

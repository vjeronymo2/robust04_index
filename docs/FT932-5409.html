			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sharp increase at Outokumpu OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced profits before extraordinary items of FM83m (Dollars 15.4m) for the first four months of 1993, compared with just FM3m a year earlier and heavy losses in the succeeding eight months. Sales were ahead by 25 per cent at FM5.5bn (FM4.4bn), while operating income rose to FM477m from FM288m. A big factor in the recovery was the steep depreciation late last year of the Finnish markka. About half of Outokumpu's output is invoiced in markkas  -including all production from the profitable stainless steel division, which saw sales increase by almost a third, to FM1.26bn. The base metals, copper products and technology divisions were reported to be profitable at the operating level and all showed an increase in sales. However, although it forecast maintained profitability throughout this year, after two successive years of losses, Outokumpu said growth in metals demand and prices remained low. Outokumpu also said poor market conditions had forced it to postpone the planned sale of its US chemicals subsidiary, OM Group. The sale, by a public offering in the US, was planned to raise up to Dollars 170m. However, the group, 57.5 per cent owned by the Finnish government, is going ahead with its proposed FM527m rights issue.</p>

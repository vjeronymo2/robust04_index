			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Armando Perez; from the "News Patrol" newscast] </F>   [Text] At San Carlos University [USAC], 130 medical school  professors are being held hostage in the M-4 Building. Certain  students reported that five professors managed to escape after  breaking a window. The medical students said that the conflict  worsened when professors claimed they had been kidnapped. The  students denied this. One thousand students are inside the M-4  Building of the USAC Medical School. They cannot leave because  the building's two metal doors are locked with several padlocks.    The negotiations continue but there as yet is no solution to  the student conflict that broke out on 1 March, three weeks  after the professors of the USAC Medical School first stopped  teaching any classes, the affected students said. This was a  report for our listeners. Back to the studios.    [Announcer] Thank you very much, Armando Perez. We have a  question for you. The Roda family wants to know whether you and  Lucia Dubon could look into the status of Dr. Judith Garcia de  Roda. I repeat her name, Dr. Judith Garcia de Roda, who is among  the professors who is being held. Her family in Zone Seven is  worried. Do you know anything about the professors who are  currently being held? Go ahead, Armando.    [Perez] There was an assembly on 1 March of Medical School  students and professors, however, given that no solution was  reached, the students occupied the Medical School's M-4  building. So far no one has been allowed inside this building  because it is locked. Students and professors are negotiating  in an attempt to solve the conflict that started on 1 March.    The students reported that five professors managed to escape  from the building after breaking a window and about 130  professors are still inside. Negotiations continue and the  situation is rather calm. It is expected, however, that there  could be a solution to the conflict at a given time, as I said  before, because the professors have not taught classes for more  than three weeks, and the students decided to adopt this  measure, because USAC authorities failed to react to this  situation.</p>

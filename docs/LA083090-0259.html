			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SWITZER ACCUSES IRISH OF NCAA VIOLATION  </P> <P> Tony Brooks received an "improper inducement" from Notre Dame representatives  while the Irish were attempting to enroll the running back, former Oklahoma  Coach Barry Switzer says.  </P> <P> In his newly released book, "Bootlegger's Boy," Switzer says the unidentified  Notre Dame representatives gave Brooks a job paying $13.50 an hour immediately  after he signed a letter of intent with the Irish in 1987.  </P> <P> Brooks and Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz deny the allegations.  </P> <P> "It was obviously an inducement," Switzer told the Chicago Tribune in today's  editions. "Schools can talk about summer jobs (after a player's freshman year),  but nobody at Oklahoma was making that kind of money. They violated NCAA  legislation."  </P> <P> Several scandals, including NCAA rules violations within his program, forced  Switzer to resign before the 1989 season. Switzer contests most of the NCAA  charges in his book.  </P> <P> Brooks, who was recruited by Oklahoma, said he chose Notre Dame for academic  reasons. "Nobody connected with Notre Dame made any illegal offers to me," he  said. "It's absurd."  </P> <P> Switzer said he believes Holtz and his coaching staff knew nothing about the  arrangement. Under NCAA rules, though, a school can be held responsible for the  actions of alumni and boosters.  </P> <P> "If the allegations were true, it would come as a shock," Holtz said.  "Otherwise, I have nothing to say."  </P> <P> Switzer says Brooks asked at the time whether Oklahoma could match the promises  offered by Notre Dame.  </P> <P> "The kid had his hand out. He was asking for certain things," Switzer said. "He  said he needed to work right away."  </P></p>

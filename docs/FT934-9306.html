			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / People: Sears changes its finance director Stephen Park, finance director of retailing group Sears and Liam Strong's first big appointment after he became chief executive in 1991, has resigned with effect from the beginning of next month. He will be replaced by David Defty (right), deputy finance director at Grand Metropolitan. A company source says Park, who was headhunted in June last year from Hanson where he was Lord Hanson's personal assistant, had been having discussions with Strong in recent months. 'He and Liam agreed that it just wasn't coming together in the way they had hoped. They decided it was better for them to part company.' Park, who had been finance director of Hanson's Allders division and later responsible for strategic planning, acquisitions and divestments, is said to have 'two or three other irons in the fire'. He will receive an undisclosed severance package. Defty, 48, has what Sears calls a 'solid record in financial management of well-regarded companies'. He began his career at Philips Electrical, and joined Colgate-Palmolive in 1968 where he held several senior positions including director, corporate finance, New York. After leaving in 1984 he worked as finance director at Guinness and Woolworths, and joined Grand Metropolitan in 1988 as finance director of the IDV drinks division. He became deputy group finance director of GrandMet in March last year. Sears, which found Defty through an executive search, said his experience in the US and in several 'customer-orientated' businesses fitted him well for his new post. Sears does not expect Defty's appointment to lead to any changes in accounting policy; it has worked hard in the past few years to make its accounts more transparent. Sears is also beefing up its board through the promotion of two new directors, Ian Thomson, 47, managing director of Sears footwear business British Shoe Corporation, and Rod Taylor, 40, director of group human resources. The board has seen its numbers depleted by a series of management changes in the past two years. Taylor's association with Strong goes back to Strong's days as director of marketing and operations at British Airways, when Taylor was his human resources general manager. Thomson joined Sears in September last year from South African retailing group Edgars Stores.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Ukraine signs up to treaty on nuclear non-proliferation Ukraine said last night it had won extensive guarantees from the US, Russia and Britain in return for renouncing any aspiration to be a nuclear power. The published text of an agreement between the four countries suggested the pledges won by Kiev were little different from the standard promises made by nuclear countries to non-nuclear states under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Ukraine formally joined yesterday. Western diplomats declined to comment on whether any private or informal undertakings had been given in addition to the published text. The accession of Ukraine to the NPT is a diplomatic breakthrough which clears the way for the Start-1 treaty, providing for the elimination of 9,000 US and former Soviet nuclear warheads, to enter into force. The break-up of the Soviet Union left Ukraine with the world's third largest nuclear arsenal on its soil, and only last month did the Ukrainian parliament formally renounce the aspiration to wrest control of these weapons from Russia. Ukraine's adherence to the NPT was sealed during a European security conference in Budapest by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and the leaders of the US, Russia and Britain, which were the original architects of the treaty. President Kuchma thanked his three co-signatories for their understanding of the 'unique situation' of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine and their 'readiness to give security' to his country. Under the published text of yesterday's deal, the US, Russia and Britain pledged to respect Ukraine's borders, to refrain from using or threatening force against Ukraine, and to seek help from the UN Security Council if Ukraine is threatened with nuclear aggression. In an unusual declaration, reflecting Ukraine's nervousness of Russian commercial power, the three co-signatories pledged to refrain from infringing Kiev's sovereignty through economic coercion. Russian foreign policy experts have called openly for the use of their country's superior financial muscle to take over as much as possible of the Ukrainian economy. At the signing ceremony, President Bill Clinton hailed the 'arrival of a new and safer era' in world affairs. 'Ukraine has taken a bold move away from the nuclear precipice,' he said. 'The country's leaders have done a great service to their own people and the world.'</p>

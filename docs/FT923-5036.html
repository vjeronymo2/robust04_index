			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Technology: Couriers take the IT route That company report you need so urgently for this afternoon's meeting is winging its way from the New York office. It's in the hands of an international courier company and you expected it an hour ago. International couriers have realised that customers can no longer be wooed by claims that 'no mountain is too high' - as DHL's UK advertising campaign says. 'Couriers now have to offer the reliability customers may not be getting from their national postal services, as well as speed,' says John Mullen, chief executive officer of TNT Worldwide Express. To provide high-quality service, couriers have adopted package tracing systems. One of the most advanced has been developed by Federal Express, which supplies its drivers with hand-held computers called Dads (digitally assisted despatch systems) to deliver between 2m-3m items every day in the US. FedEx drivers are told where their next pick-up will be and the easiest way to get there via the Dads display. The advantage of this system is that collections can be made on an ad hoc basis throughout the day. The driver scans the computer barcode label on each package and enters the details of the final destination into a hand-held computer. The information is transferred to the mainframe computer in FedEx's Memphis headquarters via a satellite link and is then accessible to FedEx bases throughout the world. DHL, with the largest global network of all, employs a similar system which assists in the delivery of more than 60m consignments annually. DHL has now upgraded the service to give customers the option of linking into the network from their own offices. DHL's package, called EasyShip, will give high-volume users the option of having a Compaq PC, two printers, an electronic weighing scale, a barcode scanner and a modem installed on their premises. Drivers at United Parcel Service are also supplied with a hand-held PC, known as Diad (delivery information acquisition device), which not only transfers collection and delivery information into an international mainframe, but also stores the recipient's signature as proof of delivery.</p>

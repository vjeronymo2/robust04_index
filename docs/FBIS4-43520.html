			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Francoise Varenne report: "Chirac: `A Military </F> Intervention Is Needed in Rwanda'"]    [Text] New York -- Taking advantage of his brief visit to  New York, where he attended, as a jury member, the announcement  of the winners of the Japanese Imperial Prize (the Japanese  equivalent of the Nobel Prize for artistic disciplines), Jacques  Chirac visited UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    During a meeting which lasted 45 minutes, the former prime  minister informed his interlocutor of the "anxiety and horror"  he feels at the Rwandan tragedy which is "a veritable genocide."    "It is absolutely vital to react," he said, holding the view  that "the Western nations, in close liaison with the African  nations, under UN influence, ought to intervene now," and he  said he is convinced that France would participate in this  action.    Jacques Chirac suggested to Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the  18,000 blue helmets currently in Somalia should be sent to  Rwanda. "At all events, a military intervention is necessary,"  he said, adding that he had the impression that his interlocutor  "was definitely of the same view."  <H5>  Drugs: Taking Action Where They Are Produced </H5>   In addition, just as he had lengthy discussions on the drugs  problems with President Clinton during his visit to Paris last  week, Jacques Chirac argued for a "right of intervention at the  initiative of the United Nations and under UN control" which  would have the aim of destroying crops in the producer  countries. "These initiatives should be taken in agreement with  the countries concerned, who are seeing a growing consumption of  drugs inside their own borders, while making provision for  compensating the farmers," the Rally for the Republic president  explained.    "Aside from prevention and repression," he explained,  "action  should be taken at the site of production," adding that this  production, and especially that of hard drugs, is increasing in  a dramatic way, "with the consequences with which we are  familiar for individuals, and especially for young people, and  also for the spread of AIDS. We also know the effect on wars,  because it is the money from drugs which enables the purchase of  weapons which are ever cheaper and which are then used to fight  all kinds of ethnic confrontations. Finally, it is drugs which  finance terrorism. If nothing is done, we will witness the  destabilization of the whole world."    Jacques Chirac, who, in agreement with Bill Clinton, has  decided to set up a working group to study the means of  eradicating the scourge, intends to continue his awareness  campaign. "This naturally depends on a mobilization of the  United Nations without which," he said, "nothing can be done on  this scale, and in close liaison with the Americans, who consume  almost half of the world production."</p>

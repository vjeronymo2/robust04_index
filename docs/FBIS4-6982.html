			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi said Tuesday [26 April] he is ready  to ask other coalition partners to disband a new 130-legislator  parliamentary bloc if that could convince the Social Democratic  Party (SDP) to reverse its decision to quit the ruling coalition.    "If the (presence of the) new parliamentary group hampers  the  maintenance of the coalition framework, we are ready to disband  it," Ouchi said in a TV program. Ouchi on Monday proposed the  creation of the new parliamentary bloc called Kaishin  (Innovation) to support newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata.    After five parties and groups formed the bloc without the  SDP, which was kept in the dark over the move, the SDP, the  largest force in the coalition, decided to withdraw from the  coalition. The SDP's decision plunged Japan's political world  into confusion, with the possibility that Hata will be forced to  form a minority government.    "We will not place any conditions before accepting a  possible  return of the SDP into the coalition fold," Ouchi said.</p>

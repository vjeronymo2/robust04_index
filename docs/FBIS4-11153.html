			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Havana, 23 Apr (AFP) -- A meeting between the  Cuban Government and 215 moderate Cuban opposition  representatives living abroad -- mostly in the United States --  will conclude tomorrow in Havana with modest results.    The government organized the "The Nation and the Emigrants  Conference" and limited its goals to the following: To begin  changing ideas in order to reach an eventual normalization of  relations between Cuba and Cubans living abroad.    Cubans who call for the armed overthrow of Castro and who  support the U.S. trade, economic, and financial embargo against  Cuba that has been in effect since 1962 were excluded from the  meeting.    Participants include prominent Cuban emigrants who in some  cases have expressed subtle sympathy for the Castro Government,  and others who in the past have raised weapons against the  regime but now call for a peaceful dialogue.    This afternoon participants agreed that the conference will  yield modest results, which they consider the initial gambit in  a long game.    As of this afternoon, President Fidel Castro had not  attended  the conference, which opened on 22 April with a speech by  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. [passage omitted]    Carlos Lage, secretary of the Council of Ministers and  member  of the Communist Party Politburo, will address the conference on  Sunday, the last day of the meeting.    According to the agenda, a "comment period" is scheduled  following each speech, but according to several participants,  the time set aside for dialogue has thus far been, with few  exceptions, rather sedate.

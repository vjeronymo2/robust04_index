			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Viktorov, Vladimir Yakhontov, and </F> Svetlana Voronkova under the rubric "Draft Tax Reform  Discussed": "Authorities May Change Budget Policy"]    [Text]    [begin box]    The main proposals for reform of the tax-budget system  in Russia contained in the report "Basic Directions for the  Formation of the Economic Policy" are:    --Transformation of rent payments into a decisive item of  budget revenues. Collection of natural rent through the transfer  of deposits for leasing for an indefinite period of time with  the establishment of the lease payment in dollars, depending on  the world price of the extracted product. The active use of rent  for the utilization of land, especially in cities and suburban  zones;    --Reduction of the number of taxes, fees, and payments  through their unification or abolition. The establishment of  standard normatives for the distribution of tax revenues amongst  budgets at various levels. The establishment of automatic  procedures (built into the bank settlement mechanism) for  collecting taxes to replace declarative ones;    --Replacement of progressive income tax systems with  proportional ones with the simultaneous introduction of tax on  the property of legal entities and individuals, a 50-percent tax  for exporting capital, and taxes on operations involving real  estate and securities (3 percent of the value of the  transaction);    --Replacement of income and profit tax with a consumption  tax  to be paid by legal entities. The establishment of a standard  rate of value added tax in the amount of 10 percent. [end box]    A radical change in the tax-budget strategy of the Russian  authorities is becoming increasingly probable. Having discovered  the ineffectiveness of the utilization of the existing tax  system to resolve the budget crisis, leaders of both federal and  local governments do not rule out the possibility, in a certain  stage, of resorting to a reduction of traditional taxes and  making rent payments the main source of budget revenues. This is  shown by the attention paid by specialists of the Government of  Russia and also the Governments of Moscow and St. Petersburg to  proposals contained in the report received yesterday from  experts of the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute,  "Basic Directions for the Formation of the Economic Policy." The  thrust of the report is to rely on rent payments for  replenishing the state budget. It is significant that among the  authors of the report is the chairman of one of the key  parliamentary committees, the Committee of the State Duma on  Economic Policy--Sergey Glazyev. The prospects of legislative  support for these ideas make it crucial to analyze the  possibilities of such an adjustment to the economic policy.  <H3>  Russian Authorities in Search of Budget Revenues: Reliance  on Rent Payments </H3>   The attempts on the part of Russian authorities and academic  circles to find some nontraditional sources for radically  increasing budget revenues are quite natural. Surmounting the  crisis of state finances is officially considered to be almost  the main objective of the economic reforms in Russia. It is  especially significant that this is insisted upon by  international financial circles, which proceed from the idea  that without improvement in its financial system Russia will  hardly be able to surmount the economic crisis and resolve the  problem of its foreign indebtedness. It is significant that at  the present time in the Russian economic policy methods of  achieving financial stability through reducing budget  expenditures are losing popularity--since the reduction of  budget aid to key branches in the social sphere, as has become  obvious, leads to an extremely significant increase in  sociopolitical tension.    Therefore main attention is drawn to an idea that has gained  popularity recently, which is that it is possible to resolve the  problem of increasing budget revenues rapidly and radically by  relying not only and not so much on traditional taxes (value  added tax, income tax, profit tax) as on rent payments for the  use of state mineral deposits and agricultural land. In  particular, this is the idea contained in the recently published  report prepared by the Central Economics and Mathematics  Institute entitled "Basic Directions for the Formation of  Economic Policy." It is noteworthy that one of the authors of  this report is the chairman of the parliamentary committee on  economic policy, Sergey Glazyev. Thus it cannot be ruled out  that in the foreseeable future such an idea will be the official  "contribution" from parliament to the adjustment of the federal  economic policy. Moreover, sympathies for this method of  replenishing the budget are not concealed by influential figures  in local organs of power either--especially in the Moscow and  St. Petersburg Governments. For example, the December directive  from the mayor of Moscow contains an instruction to the  Department of Economics to prepare a proposal for increasing  land tax and reducing other taxes. The obvious merits of this  idea contribute a great deal to its popularity. Since the  government up to this point essentially retains ownership of  natural resources, it would be natural to make maximum use of  them for replenishing state finances. In essence, this is being  done already to a certain degree--for example, existing excise  taxes on the extraction of oil, in spite of their name, are  nothing other than differential rent.    To be sure, such a path to surmounting the financial crisis  has one essential shortcoming--it is clearly based on  preservation of the state monopoly on natural resources,  particularly the land. And many Western experts, insisting on  budget stabilization as a necessary component of market reforms,  reject the idea of a state monopoly on natural resources.  Particularly the prominent Harvard professor Jeffrey Sachs, who  recently left the post of adviser to the Russian parliament,  asserted that land rent cannot be the main source for  replenishing the budget, and he considers privatization of the  land to be the most important and urgent problem. But recently  it has been increasingly popular in Western financial and  industrial circles to think that rejection of the state monopoly  on natural resources in Russia is not mandatory--in particular,  many Western investors are completely prepared to limit  themselves to obtaining land and mineral deposits under a  long-term lease. Thus it is quite probable that the idea of  budget stabilization and financing of the development of  Russia's economy through rent payments will not evoke  fundamental objections in the West. The more so since initially  such an idea appeared precisely in Western economic theory.  <H3>  World Theory and Practice of the Utilization of Rent  Payments in State Finances </H3>   The diversity of rent theories does not change its essence.  When speaking of rent one is usually referring to the added  profit that is received by the owners of an especially  productive resource as compared to their competitors, who have  resources with less productivity (the added profit is received  simply because certain producers have considerably lower  production outlays than their competitors and sell their goods  in a competitive economy at the same prices). The most typical  source of rent in productions involving natural resources is  from agriculture or the extraction industry. This is natural  since natural resources essentially cannot be created by man and  so they are limited--therefore the difference, for example, in  the fertility of the soil or the productivity of deposits is  relatively constant.    The fact that the owner of particularly fertile land  receives  a certain profit whose source is "nature" has quite naturally  attracted the attention of economists almost since the origin of  economic theory. It was quite tempting to declare the  appropriation of such a gift of nature by one person to be  unfair to a certain degree. Therefore when searching for sources  of state financing, it was extremely popular among economists to  demand that rent be paid into state revenues--with a  simultaneous reduction of taxes, which in any country have  caused dissatisfaction among entrepreneurs and the population.  Theories based on such a change in budget policy are fairly  diverse. Some suggest abolishing all taxes and leaving only a  high tax on the land (Henry George), while others suggest  introducing differentiated tax separately for buildings and  separately for the plot of land, leaving the basic tax burden on  the land (Nicholas Tiedeman, Stephen B. Cord), while still  others (Fred Harrison, Francis Smith) want to change the entire  structure of the tax policy by increasing the tax on land and  reducing other taxes (income tax, profit tax, value added tax).    The initiator of the idea of financing the budget through  rent alone with complete abolition of all other taxes was the  American economist Henry George, who back at the end of the last  century stated: "To abolish taxes which, by acting and  counteracting, now slow up every wheel of exchange and oppress  all kinds of industry, would mean to shift an immense load from  this mighty source...if somebody is building a ship we force him  to pay for this audacity as if he had done harm to the state; if  a factory is built we impose on it an annual tax which would be  more than enough for a decent income...." Such a theory has  adherents at the present time as well. According to calculations  of the London Association of Scientific Research in the Area of  Economic and Social Sciences, in the majority of developed  countries land rent makes up about 40 percent of the national  income, and the rents would be quite enough for the governments  to cover state expenditures. But not all economists are so  radical. Nicholas Tiedeman and Stephen B. Cord limit themselves  to this tax policy on the scale of individual cities. But they  make analogous proposals--to leave only tax on land for  financing local budgets. It is suggested that the amount of this  tax be determined by regularly offering the right to use  sections of it at auctions.    Concretizing the use of rent payments for financing the  budget, a number of researchers, particularly Stephen B. Cord,  suggest rejecting the existing system whereby taxes on land and  real estate are the same and sharply increasing the tax on land,  while reducing property tax on buildings (which, in his opinion,  will provide an impetus for new construction). This theory was  applied, in particular, in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, United  States) where, beginning in 1979, the tax rate for land was  almost doubled but the amount of the tax on buildings remained  the same. The tax rate for land was 9.75 percent, and  buildings--2.45 percent. (Since that time they have changed  periodically, and today they are 15.15 percent for land and 2.7  percent for buildings.) As a result, during 1980-1984 the volume  of new construction in Pittsburgh increased 5.9-fold as compared  to the period of 1974-78 (according to figures from the Bureau  of Construction Inspections). And in the United States as a  whole the volume of new construction has increased only 1.6-fold  during that time.    But, in spite of the fact that in theory reorienting the  state budget completely to rent payments produces appreciable  advantages, large-scale practical introduction of such a plan  would naturally be extremely difficult. A special role here is  played by the active resistance of the landowner lobbies, which  are traditionally quite strong in practically all industrial  countries.  <H5>  Prospects for Reorientation of Budget Policy to Rent Payments </H5>   On the whole one can say that the concept of augmenting  state  finances through the use of rents and real estate taxes  completely corresponds to the interests of the Russian  authorities. At both the federal and the local levels the  authorities are interested in demonstrating a desire to reduce  taxes on profit and income "in order to stimulate national  industry and entrepreneurial activity." It is essential that the  authorities will be able to count on more stable revenues from  rent, lease payments, and real estate tax than from other taxes,  the more so since profit and incomes, as practice shows, are  easier to conceal from taxation than are land and real estate.  Moreover, as the report from the Central Economics and  Mathematics Institute shows, the authorities might consider it  preferable to calculate rent payments--particularly when leasing  mineral deposits--directly in hard currency. This too could  stabilize budget revenues under conditions of inflation.  According to the report, the most reasonable method is  considered to be leasing mineral deposits for an indefinite  period with the collection of the lease payment in dollars. The  amount of the payment should be established depending on the  world price of the product extracted. According to calculations  of the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute, for rents  for products of the petroleum and gas complex alone, when  calculated in world prices, the budget would receive about $30  billion annually.    In order not to evoke a counteraction from the "petroleum  and  gas lobby," the authorities might very well try to use another  formula that was proposed in the report--sharply reduce all  taxes on leasing enterprises and guarantee that in any case the  enterprises will be left with enough profit to cover the needs  for the development of the complex itself. Of course, mass  support from local authorities for such an idea will depend  largely on how the rent payments are divided between the local  and federal budgets. Incidentally, the interest of local  authorities in radically changing the tax policy certainly does  not mean that this can be done quickly from a purely technical  viewpoint.  <H5>  Tax Reform in Russia: The Opinion of Tax Organs </H5>   As one might expect, specialists of tax organs, who are  traditionally cautious about innovations, are fairly skeptical  about the reform. In their words, to conduct a tax reform in  Russia in the near future with a shift of the main burden from  income taxes to land payments is not very likely. The main  argument against changing the structural foundations of the tax  system is the technical impossibility of correct calculation of  both the real value of the land and the effectiveness of  conducting such a reform from the standpoint of budget revenues.    The impossibility of calculating the value of the land, in  the opinion of tax organ specialists, is conditioned by the fact  that there is no liquid land market in Russia today. Therefore  there is no possibility of determining the price of "similar"  plots put up for auction. The institution of real estate  appraisers as such (and especially land appraisers) is only in  its initial stage of development. All this will also lead to a  situation where it will be practically impossible to calculate  the effectiveness of the land tax, since there is no basis for  calculation.    Even if approximate calculations are done and they show that  shifting the tax burden to large land holders is attractive for  the budget, this certainly does not mean that everything will  turn out that way in reality. The reason is that, as practice  shows, replacing typical laws with less familiar ones without  the preliminary practice of "breaking them in" leads to a  reduction of revenues into the state budget. The taxpayers (and  fiscal echelons as well) are simply not in a condition to  correctly calculate the sums due to the budget. Moreover, the  normative documents that introduce the new taxes might contain  (or might not contain) a considerable number of "loopholes"  which allow the leakage of a considerable amount of money on  which the budget could count. Such a situation developed, for  example, when the former turnover tax was replaced by the value  added tax. A means of evading taxation by using false fines,  which seems obvious today, was closed off only two years after  the introduction of the law on value added tax. It is probable  that this is why one of the highly placed workers in the  Ministry of Finance, commenting at the request of the KOMMERSANT  editors, on the proposals for the tax reform, worded his opinion  fairly emotionally: "Under today's conditions only an enemy  could suggest such a thing!"    And so the only thing that can be expected from the  increasing popularity of the theory of land payments as the  basis of public well-being is the conducting of experiments in  cities that are most susceptible to new trends: Moscow, St.  Petersburg, and Nizhnyy Novgorod. They will most likely consist  in considerably raising the rates of the existing land tax,  which will require additional decisions at the level of federal  authorities since a limit on raising these rates has now been  established. And there is no guarantee that this will occur  along with any significant reduction of taxes on profit and  income.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> DECKHAND LEAVES THE BOAT BEHIND WHEN HE TURNS ANGLER  </P> <P> What does a sportfishing boat deckhand do on his day off? He goes fishing, of  course, but not from a boat.  </P> <P> When Scott Hart of Torrance heads out to fish, he takes a water ski jacket,  fins, a freshwater rod and reel, some jigs and a few feathers attached to his  belt.  </P> <P> Recently, Hart got some unexpected action after he entered the surf at Cabrillo  Beach. Using 10-pound test line with a two-ounce sinker and a feather, he  hooked a small herring and started to paddle back to shore.  </P> <P> About 100 yards out, he had a heavy strike. He set his hook and most all the  line peeled from the small reel.  </P> <P> With a fish in tow, Hart headed for the beach, hand-lining his catch, which  turned out to be a halibut just under the legal 22-inch limit. He released it  unharmed.  </P> <P> Hart tries to get out into the water early in the morning, but heavy swells,  jet skiers and windsurfers can be hazards to a ski jacket fisherman.  </P> <P> Hart has tried tube float fishing before, but prefers the ski jacket method.  The biggest drawback, he said, is there is only the jacket to hold his bait and  gear.  </P> <P> King Harbor Marlin Club members have been scoring some good catches that count  toward individual points for yearly awards.  </P> <P> Bob Stephens and Jack Terry caught a 10-pound bonito off Catalina Island. The  two Torrance fishermen also caught barracuda and calico bass.  </P> <P> Club member Carl Hanni, fishing from the Striker, reeled in an eight-pound  barracuda.  </P> <P> Member Ray Hawkins, who spent last week surf fishing at Jal Ama Beach in  Central California, landed a starry flounder in five feet of water.  </P> <P> Starry flounders are natives of Alaska and the Sea of Japan. Their average  length is three feet and they can weigh up to 20 pounds.  </P> <P> The Third Annual Catalina Mako Shark Tournament is open to all private boats.  Cash prizes will be determined by the number of entries. The tournament begins  tomorrow and ends Sunday.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Greg Redding of West Los Angeles, fishing off Catalina  Island aboard the Top Gun, hooked a yellowtail that ran into bull kelp. After a  25-minute battle, Redding came away with the whopper of the week, a 44-pounder.  </P> <P> Susan Coates of Long Beach, fishing at Rocky Point aboard the Southern Cal, won  the jackpot with a 41-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Mike Hile of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Outerlimits off Catalina Island,  caught a 31-pound white sea bass.  </P> <P> Walter Tawi of Torrance caught a 30-pound white sea bass aboard the Aztec.  </P> <P> Fran Eskita of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Victory, caught a 26-pound  yellowtail at Rocky Point.  </P> <P> Bill Garcia of Long Beach caught an 18-pound yellowtail, and Betty Cohen of  Harbor City reeled in a 16-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: Barracuda and sand bass dominate the local fishing. White sea  bass and yellowtail action off Catalina Island rated excellent.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Del Mar returned with 110 calico bass, 54  sand bass, six bonito and a halibut on a half-day trip.  </P> <P> The Spitfire fished the bay and caught 230 sand bass and 22 barracuda.  </P> <P> Anglers on the Betty O sacked 175 rock cod and a lingcod.  </P> <P> The Sumo fished in the Venice area and returned with 120 rock fish and a  barracuda.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray on a sand bass trip to Rocky Point  returned with 170 fish.  </P> <P> L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Sportking fished Catalina Island with success,  returning with 170 barracuda and a yellowtail.  </P> <P> The Top Gun fished Catalina Island and anglers came away with 32 yellowtail, 21  white sea bass, and 20 barracuda.  </P> <P> The Outerlimits worked Catalina for 156 calico bass, 33 yellowtail, and 20  white sea bass and a black sea bass.  </P> <P> The Shogun Catalina Trip netted 145 barracuda, eight white sea bass, and four  yellowtail.  </P> <P> The Annie B Barge weekend total: 610 mackerel, 322 kingfish, 422 jacksmelt,  nine halibut and four sand bass.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The First String fished Catalina Island and anglers  took 165 barracuda, nine yellowtail and seven halibut.  </P> <P> The Monte Carlo fished the rigs on a half-day trip and returned with 57  barracuda, 41 sand bass and 23 calico bass.  </P> <P> At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Victory fished Rocky Point and took in 276  barracuda, 53 calico bass and a white sea bass.  </P> <P> The Southern Cal on a half-day trip to Horseshoe Kelp returned with 133  barracuda, 82 sand bass and a white sea bass.  </P> <P> The Aztec trip to Catalina Island resulted in a catch of 120 barracuda, 56  calico bass and two yellowtail.  </P> <P> The Toronado worked Catalina for 107 barracuda, 44 calico bass, a yellowtail,  and a white sea bass.  </P></p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Teachers 'will need more support' THE chairman of the National Curriculum Council warned last night that some teachers will need to be coached to teach standard English in their classrooms. Mr David Pascall said English was the most important of the 10 national curriculum subjects. The new proposals were not just for the children's benefit, but the aim was to improve standards for teachers too, he said. Proper pronunciation, for example, was defined in the rules produced yesterday. The council said that reform of the English curriculum was essential if standards of written and spoken English were to be improved. Mr Pascall said: 'Some teachers will need more support because they will find things within this new order which would be outside their competence. 'We are redressing the balance and we have to do it sensibly.' Mr Pascall also said that the producers of children's television programmes would have to take their part in improving standards of English. 'I am appalled by the standard of children's television programmes. Producers should accept their responsibilities by trying to improve standards mainly for young children,' Mr Pascall said. 'Producers need to take seriously the content of programmes in order to complement what we are trying to do.'</p>

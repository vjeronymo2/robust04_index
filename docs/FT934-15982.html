			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: TJ Hughes lower after poor summer TJ HUGHES, the USM-quoted multiple discount store group, reported a 19 per cent fall in profits before tax in its unseasonal first half to July 31. The decline - from Pounds 143,000 to Pounds 116,000 - came on turnover ahead 9 per cent to Pounds 19.5m. Mr Gurth Hoyer Millar, chairman, said that like-for-like sales growth was 2.3 per cent, reflecting poor weather in May, June and July. Nevertheless, gross margins were maintained despite 'aggressive pricing by many national retailers,' he added. Earnings per share emerged at 0.39p (0.16p) reflecting the redemption of the preference capital in May 1992. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p.</p>

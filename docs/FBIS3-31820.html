			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Krum Asparukhov: "National Security Is Even </F> More Important Than Parliament"]    [Text] For the first time in Bulgarian history, the  parliament, at a meeting behind closed doors, heard a detailed  account of the state of the Bulgarian Army submitted by Army  General Lyuben Petrov, chief of Army General Staff. With facts,  figures, and sound arguments he explained to the deputies that  the 11.6-billion-leva army budget could only cover the Armed  Forces' needs for the next few months, until summer, unless  personnel is cut by half, namely to 40,000 men.    The military budget is the price our people have to pay to  defend the country. It is determined according to the extent to  which the country's security is threatened. This is the basic  criterion. It is followed by resources for the tasks the  military units are expected to accomplish in order to cope with  the threat, and last but not least, by the forces in charge of  the aforementioned tasks. The military budget consists of four  components: Current expenditures for the maintenance of the  army; the supply of armaments and technical equipment; the  building of defense facilities and facilities for the troops;  and finally, theoretical research and developments in the  military sphere. The experience of the last few years shows  that most resources are spent on soldiers' everyday needs and  for routine tasks of military service. The proposed budget  excludes all possibilities of purchasing new technical equipment  and armaments. Some 200 of the 230 existing barracks are in  urgent need of major repairs. The condition of military  equipment is absolutely desolate. Not even one officer has  submitted a paper for an academic title in the last four years.    In 1989 the military budget represented 4.06 percent of GDP,  while in 1990 it dropped to 3.2 percent; in 1991 -- to 3  percent; in 1992 -- to 2.8 percent, and in 1993 -- 2.6 percent.  In 1994 the percentage is expected even to drop to 2.4 percent.  The downward trend is determined both by the country's serious  economic crisis and by the inability to adapt the budget to the  acute shortage of funds. In these circumstances the social  problems in the army are likely to get worse, and morale is  likely to fall because of the hopeless revenue policy, which in  the long run will further delay the army reform.    Turkey's 1994 military budget amounts to $8.601 billion in  addition to the $2 billion in military aid from the United  States.    Greece's current military budget amounts to $28 billion,  which represents 8 percent of the national budget, in addition  to $1 billion in military aid from the United States and 340  million marks from Germany. The Romanian military budget  amounts to $560 million, which represents 8 percent of the  country's budget. States in the same desolate financial  situation as Bulgaria still manage to find resources for their  army because they consider it a vital institution. It is not a  problem of one or another political force, of the government, or  of a certain ministry. The problem affects our national  security, without which the transition to democracy would be a  mere exercise in rhetorics.    At the plenary session of the National Assembly General  Petrov reportedly said that the General Staff cannot bear  responsibility for the proposed military budget. He called for  an additional 11 billion leva. Only a few National Assembly  deputies, in their statements, supported the demands of the army  leadership. Hence, it would be quite normal for parliament to  assume responsibility for the state of our national security, in  the event the requested resources for the army are voted down,  because national security is even more important than parliament.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A role for trade unions BRITISH EMPLOYEES are getting a raw deal from their trade unions. They deserve efficient and relevant services in the workplace, but they also need an authoritative voice on work issues which transcend the individual contract of employment: subjects like safety at work, pensions, training, the trade-off between pay and jobs, hire and fire rules, and more. The union leaders gathered in Blackpool today for the start of the 124th Trades Union Congress are, with few exceptions, not providing it. TUC unions now represent only about one-third of the workforce but they are still easily the largest pressure group for employees. Judged by the standard of many other pressure groups, they have not delivered. It is not all their own fault. Some are locked into declining industries, most are weakened by unemployment or radical changes in the public services. But they have compounded their current weakness by failing to concentrate their limited human and financial resources on the issues they are best in a position to understand and which most affect their members as employees. No longer the bogeymen of a strike-prone society, the union bosses have simply become irrelevant. Their hopes of salvation in the form of EC social policies have also been frustrated. Some, though not all, of the shortcomings can be blamed on poor leadership. For example, the TUC still has several committees monitoring national political developments which take up far too much of the time of senior union leaders. The effect of opted-out schools on teachers is a legitimate concern of the teaching unions, but the TUC does not also need an education committee to produce position papers on the subject. After the Labour party's fourth election defeat, it is also more urgent than ever that the unions escape from the constraints required by the shadow cabinet and discover a distinctive voice that speaks for union members, rather than seeking to anticipate the nuances of Labour's policy review process. The idea of working more closely with the Confederation of British Industry is in tune with this broader approach. When it come to the efficiency of basic services, there are signs that unions are moving in the right direction. For instance, MSF, the general technical union, recently said it would apply to join the British Standards Institution's corporate quality assurance scheme; others may follow. It is not yet clear whether this healthy trend will be strengthened by the other big development in the union world - itself, oddly, not the subject of debate at this week's conference - the shift towards a smaller number of ever larger unions. These actual or proposed mergers may offer economies of scale, but they could also turn into distant conglomerates, with little of the functional expertise that members want and out of touch when it comes to gauging union members' true interest in important national debates. Even worse, the 'super unions' could end up by distracting the unions with more internal politics as they try to weld very different organisations into one. British trade unionism cannot afford another big mistake.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN PURSUIT OF THE CITY'S 'MIGRATING' SALES TAXES  </P> <P> Joan Filbey, a Long Beach native and passionate devotee of the city, loves to  live here. But she prefers not to shop here.  </P> <P> When she is in the mood for some serious buying she goes to the malls in nearby  Lakewood or Cerritos, as do a great many of her neighbors in prosperous east  Long Beach. As Long Beach Chamber of Commerce Vice President Matthew Faulkner  wryly noted: "Long Beach virtually supports the Lakewood Mall."  </P> <P> Such local shopping habits are a painful reality for Long Beach officials who  for years have watched residents spend their dollars somewhere else, thus  depriving the city of the sales tax. The city's sales tax income, one of the  mainstays of any municipal budget, has long trailed behind the average for  other communities in Los Angeles County, leaving less money to support basic  city services.  </P> <P> The weak flow of sales tax dollars has become even more conspicuous as the  city's oil income has slumped and federal funds have evaporated. They have all  contributed to tight-fisted budgets and calls for new local taxes to shore up  recreation and police services.  </P> <P> "We just haven't kept pace," said Councilman Les Robbins, who represents east  Long Beach and admits that even though he tries to spend his money in the city,  he too wanders over the city line to neighboring malls.  </P> <P> If Long Beach were able to catch up with other cities in Los Angeles County it  would have another $11 million a year to spend. "We could solve, as an example,  a significant amount of our law enforcement (shortage) if we just had the  average" sales tax income, Robbins said.  </P> <P> In the last fiscal year, Long Beach's sales tax income equaled about 12% of the  city's general fund revenue, which pays for such basic city services as the  Police and Fire departments. The state average was nearly 19% in 1987. And in  Cerritos, which has a highly successful regional mall and an auto mall, a third  of the general fund revenue comes from sales tax.  </P> <P> Catching up is not a simple or quick task for Long Beach, however. The reasons  for the city's relatively feeble sales tax income -- an estimated $29 million  for this fiscal year -- are tied to the very nature of Long Beach. The city was  largely developed by the time regional malls emerged on the shopping scene, so  the malls went elsewhere, and Long Beach's affluent shoppers followed.  </P> <P> What is more, when marketing experts look at Long Beach, they don't find what  they want. "A retailer wants to see a 360-degree circle filled with income,"  observed Susan Shick, the city's community development director. In Long  Beach's downtown circle, they find the ocean, industrial areas and gritty,  low-income neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Some neighboring cities also tend to be low income.  </P> <P> "We're kind of fighting a losing battle to start with because we have such a  poor market area," city Planning Director Robert Paternoster said.  </P> <P> Despite such discouraging marketing scenarios, Long Beach officials are forging  ahead in eager pursuit of the sales tax dollar.  </P> <P> Following the recommendations of a task force study undertaken two years ago,  they are establishing an auto mall near the San Diego Freeway. They hope that  the redevelopment push for new housing and office buildings downtown will bring  more affluent buyers to invigorate the sluggish downtown shopping scene.  </P> <P> They also see potential for revival of the Los Altos Center in east Long Beach  and the Marina Pacifica Mall on Pacific Coast Highway near Westminster Avenue.  Bank of America, which foreclosed on the bankrupt mall last spring, is trying  to sell the half-leased Marina Pacifica to a developer who will remodel it and  correct the many design mistakes that have contributed to its failure. And an  Orange County developer, B.C.E. Development Inc., has bought portions of the  Los Altos shopping center with plans to expand and enclose it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Magic Word  </P> <P> But when local officials talk about pepping up the city's sales tax base, there  is one word that brings stars to their eyes: Disney. If the Disney Development  Corp.'s talk of building a major waterfront theme park becomes a reality, Long  Beach budget writers will start beaming.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, where we're looking, I think, is to Disney," Robbins said. "If  Disney does come to Long Beach, we will have solved our revenue problems. . . .  We're talking megabucks."  </P> <P> Disney has been seriously studying the possibility of constructing a $1  billion, marine-oriented theme park at the Queen Mary site, which it obtained  in the purchase of the Wrather Corp. A giant hotel would be built across  Queensway Bay that would serve as a base for the theme park and Long Beach  Convention and Entertainment Center as well. Disney officials say the complex  would bring thousands of tourists and employees to the city every day.  </P> <P> The lids to such treasure chests will not be open for years, or even decades,  however. If dealers at the planned auto mall do no more than an average  business, Shick said, it will take 25 years for the Redevelopment Agency to pay  off the bonds sold to finance the mall. Only after that will the sales tax  income from the auto dealers start flowing into the general fund.  </P> <P> While Long Beach suffers from its own set of sales tax problems, cities all  over the state have experienced a slowdown in the growth of their sales tax  income, according to Jim Harrington, assistant director for policy development  at the League of California Cities, a municipal lobbying group.  </P> <P> The league just completed a study of municipal finances since Proposition 13,  which severely limited property tax increases. The organization found that  sales tax revenue on a per capita basis has been flat over the past decade,  lagging behind population growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Discretionary Income  </P> <P> "The sales tax dollar doesn't go as far as it used to," Harrington said,  explaining that increases in housing and other costs have eaten into the  discretionary income of the middle class, leaving it less money to spend on  items that are subject to the 6.5% sales tax. Five percent goes to the state,  1% goes to the city in which the sale was made, and the rest goes to the county  for transportation funding.  </P> <P> The lack of sales tax growth, combined with cuts in federal and state grants  and property tax limits, have combined to erode municipal incomes around  California. When inflation is taken into account, typical city revenue on a per  capita basis has fallen more than 15%, the league study found.  </P> <P> As a result, cities are having to cut back on services or impose new taxes to  support local services.  </P> <P> In Long Beach, officials have discussed, but not acted on, asking voters to  approve property tax increases that would be specifically earmarked for  expanding recreation and police programs.  </P> <P> When it comes to services, Councilman Tom Clark said, "We've had to pretty much  stay at the same level."  </P> <P> And the shoppers of Long Beach likely will stay in their same patterns, at  least for the near future. As for Filbey, the housewife on Karen Avenue in east  Long Beach, she finds downtown Long Beach somewhat scary and thinks it is more  convenient to shop elsewhere. "I love Long Beach with a passion," she said,  "but when I go shopping, I'm ashamed to say it's in Lakewood and Cerritos."  </P> <P> </P> <P> '78-'88 TAX INCOME  </P> <P> Chart compares 1978 and 1988 percentages of sales- and use-tax revenues in the  tax income of Long Beach's general fund.  </P> <P> 1978: 33%  </P> <P> 1988: 21%  </P> <P> Source: City of Long Beach  </P></p>

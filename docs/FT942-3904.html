			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Sale of BBC transmitters considered The government is exploring ways of trying to introduce private money and expertise into the management of BBC transmitters. Ministers hope to decide on the future of the BBC transmitters in the next few weeks, but it is clear that the status quo - a wholly-owned BBC transmitter system - is no longer an option. Full privatisation is also unlikely, although it has not been formally ruled out. The search for a preferred option on transmitters is the issue that has delayed publication of the white paper on the future of the BBC. A possible compromise revolves around a number of options ranging from trying to bring in large outside commercial shareholders, or private investment, to a form of management buy-out. In both cases the BBC would retain a large - possibly even a majority - stake. Outright privatisation was all but rejected months ago because of the practical difficulties involved. In most cases the BBC and NTL, the privatised arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority transmitter and engineering division, share sites and maintenance. The BBC showed that privatisation could cost the organisation as much as Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m a year more than the present system. The issue has recently been revived mainly, it appears, because of the political need to be seen to be changing the structure of the BBC. In the white paper, which may not emerge until next month, the intention is to set out a preferred option on the future of transmitters. The government is apparently trying to balance the need to retain the advantages of co-operation provided by the existing system with creating some competition for NTL in new business development. There is the danger that the issue will be linked with the introduction of digital television in the UK on existing terrestrial transmitters - a pet scheme of the Department of Trade and Industry. The BBC believes that the introduction of digital television, which could provide many extra channels, would cost hundreds of millions of pounds. The BBC has been surprised by the sudden change in the government's attitude to transmitters and is still working through its position on the issue. It hopes that the government will simply set out a range of options on the future of its transmitters in the white paper, particularly if the complex issue of digital television is linked with it in any way.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Privatisation chief takes on nomenklatura: Suspicion and corruption lie in the path of an ambitious sell-off MR Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation chief, faces the awesome task of cutting his way through layers of inept and corrupt bureaucracy to involve a disillusioned and suspicious population in the world's most ambitious sell-off. 'If people have no faith in the process, there can be no privatisation,' he said yesterday. The main danger was a popular belief that privatisation was just another means 'for bureaucrats to get bribes'. Today, President Boris Yeltsin's government is due to present Russia's regional governors with instructions on how to implement its privatisation programme. The target for 1992 is to sell the trade and services sector, agriculture, transport, construction and small-scale light industry. One of the ten documents to be approved at a cabinet meeting today sets out how property will be valued: nominal book-value will be the starting price for competitive bidding. Based on his previous experience as economic reform chief in St Petersburg, Mr Chubais has dropped as 'impractical' the alternative of evaluating assets on the basis of estimated future profits. The main weapon for combatting what Mr Chubais calls the 'high' level of corruption in the state bureaucracy is to ensure that nothing can be sold outside a transparent auction or tender system. Mr Chubais, one of the bright young reformers swept into office last October, said: 'My task is to produce rules which will not give local and federal bureaucrats the right to determine who gets what. 'That's why I am against any exemptions or benefits for this or that industry or enterprise.' In practice, this means, for example, that Moscow city government's plans to sell off property to staff at fixed prices - which has attracted applications from 8,500 shops and restaurants - will have to be reversed. As spelled out in the privatisation programme, employees get only 25 per cent of the business free of charge; the rest has to be sold at a competitive price. The main target of uniform selling procedures is to stop so-called 'nomenklatura privatisation' - attempts by state managers both in government ministries and at enterprises - to acquire or continue controlling property for themselves. In Moscow, for example, city officials' fondness for kickbacks and reluctance to lose power appears to be one of the main reasons why there has been little privatisation so far. 'That was the situation until last week,' explained one city official who asked not to be named. 'The situation changed completely because Yeltsin banged his fist on the table and complained that although we had price liberalisation, we had no privatisation of shops. Now city leaders are moving because they realise their political survival is at stake.' Mr Andrei Vasiliev, spokesman for Moscow's State Property Agency, said that Taxipark No. 1's 1,000 taxis will become the first business to be sold in a closed auction to 2,000 taxi drivers. He is less optimistic about the specific target of privatising most of the city's shops, restaurants and small enterprises over the next year, citing continuing wrangles between different city departments. Along with the public discontent, Mr Chubais is also aware of a lack of enthusiasm among potential foreign investors, though those foreigners who are interested will only be able to take part in special investment tenders because their hard currency buying power would give them a big advantage over Russians.</p>

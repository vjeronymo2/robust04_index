In the hour-long meeting, President Clinton confirmed that  the United States is paying great attention to the region.  Security in Central Europe, he said, is important for both  Washington and NATO.    The Hungarian delegation welcomed the Partnership for Peace  plan and reaffirmed their country's preparedness to take an  active part in it.    President Clinton said that security is not simply a  military  issue, but also a political and an economic one. The United  States considers it important to promote economic development in  Hungary and the region, the president added.    The leaders discussed the Yugoslav crisis as well. The  Hungarian foreign affairs spokesman stated: "I consider it  important that the Hungarian delegation was able to directly  inform the U.S. administration on how a neighbouring country  sees the efforts made so far to settle the crisis in Yugoslavia,  and what it considers to be desirable steps."    The spokesman said President Clinton expressed his  appreciation of the stability of Hungarian democracy.  Washington considered the new prime minister's smooth and rapid  election as a sign of this stability, Herman said.</p>

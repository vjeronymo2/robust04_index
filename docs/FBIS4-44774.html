			<p>CSO     [Text] Diamond films will control a market of  billions by the year 2000 in abrasion protection, electronics  and optics. The prerequisite: a way must be found to produce  homogeneous films covering a large area more quickly and  cheaply.    The first diamond synthesis using ordinary graphite was  accomplished by brute force. In the 1950s, researchers from the  giant American company General Electric used temperatures of  2,000 C and 50,000 atmospheres of pressure to produce  artificial diamonds. This process predominated for a long time.  In 1990, 350 billion carats or 70 tons of diamonds, valued at a  billion dollars, were produced using this method.    But there are more elegant ways to do it. As early as the  end  of the 70's, a team around Prof. Dimitri Fedosseyev at Moscow  University had done pioneering work on low-pressure diamond  synthesis. "The technological arrogance of the West prevented us  from taking the Russian work seriously," admits Ralph-Juergen  Peters, coordinator of the BMFT program for diamond synthesis.    Only the Japanese paid any attention to the pioneering feat.  They rapidly modified the process and protected it with a wall  of 500 patents.    In CVD (chemical vapor deposition) technology, carbonaceous  gas is exposed to high temperatures at low pressures in the  presence of hydrogen and deposited as a thick layer of  polycrystalline diamond on suitable substrates.    For a few years nothing happened to disturb this process. It  was not until the 1980's that the international professional  world recognized the true potential of this technology and its  possible applications. Intensive efforts at further development  began.    Numerous suppliers in Japan and the U.S. are working on the  development of processes and marketable products. Companies and  governments all over the world have invested several hundreds of  millions of dollars. One catalyst is the hope of being able to  replace silicon as material substrate with diamond film, at  least in part. But at the moment the bulk of the products  manufactured with the CVD process are offered in the classical  diamond areas: machine cutting and optics.    The diamond conglomerate De Beers has been on the bandwagon  since the mid-80's. After fundamental experiments in  Johannesburg, "several million pounds sterling" were invested in  England, according to Dr. James Campbell, chief of the  industrial diamond department. The pilot CVD plant on the Isle  of Man was transformed into a production plant. But "because of  the stiff competitive situation," Campbell is unwilling to  reveal any details about the costs, capacity or processes of the  reactors, which have been in use since last June.    In the Fraunhofen Institute for Film and Surface  Technologies, IST, Dr. Matthias Fryda and Dr. Claus-Peter Klages  succeeded in developing a process, which has already been  patented. In this process the hydrogenating gasification of coal  makes it possible to produce diamond films both economically and  ecologically. Traditional plants have up to 100 liters of  processing gas flowing through them per minute. The gas  generally consists primarily of hydrogen, with a small  percentage of hydrocarbons, of which again only a part  contributes to diamond growth. The residual hydrocarbons and all  the hydrogen are blown into the open air.    In the process developed in Hamburg "in contrast, the waste  gas is reprocessed in a closed circuit with the help of hot  activated charcoal," according to Dr. Lothar Schaefer of the  IST. "No gas is used up or released into the environment during  film production." The process (in outline) provides for the  breakup of the hydrocarbons which hinder diamond deposit, and it  supplies the necessary methane concentrations for film  production. A special property of the process is that under  given pressure and temperature conditions a definite  hydrogen-carbon gas mix is always produced in the carbon  reactor, even when other oxygenated or inert gases are added  which encourage diamond separation.    The process is still rather exotic: the German scientists  achieved their best results to date with a coal produced from  coconut shells. It makes gas streams of up to 25 liters per  minute and kilogram possible. Japanese researchers initially  chose their national drink, sake, as the starting point for  their diamonds.   <FIG ID=JPRS-EST-010-02A>      Figure </FIG>  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;</p>

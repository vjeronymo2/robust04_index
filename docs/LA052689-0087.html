			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO WILL SUE PIPELINE COMPANY, ANGERED OFFICIALS SAY  </P> <P> City officials, ruefully telling of reassurances by state and pipeline company  inspectors that the pipeline involved in Thursday's fatal gasoline explosion  was safe, announced plans to sue the pipeline company for damage sustained in  the disaster.  </P> <P> "We were told the pipeline had been looked at after the (May 12) train  derailment, inspected, and it was safe," Mayor Evlyn Wilcox said. "Apparently,  though, there was some weakness."  </P> <P> The mayor said she was "upset, concerned and distraught" at the loss of life  and property in the explosion, and City Atty. James Penman said the city will  sue the Calnev Pipeline Co.  </P> <P> "Obviously, in this case, the experts were wrong," Penman said. "Calnev has got  a lot of explaining to do."  </P> <P> While the mayor and city attorney were making their bitter statements at the  scene of the explosion, however, other officials at City Hall were refusing to  make records available that could shed light on what role the city and other  agencies played in allowing the railroad track and pipeline right-of-way so  close to a housing tract.  </P> <P> "We have some potential litigation here, so we can only say at this point that  from our point of view everything was handled according to state laws on tract  subdivisions, railroad lines and pipelines," city spokesman Gregory Garcia  said. "What we did was correct, but we cannot divulge the records at this  time."  </P> <P> Other officials in the city's Planning Department, however, said the tract was  approved before the railroad line was constructed, and that the homes in the  230-lot subdivision were constructed after the rail line was built but several  years before the pipeline went in.  </P> <P> John Montgomery, principal planner for the city, released a brief file noting  that the subdivision was approved by San Bernardino County authorities on March  17, 1955. It was not until Oct. 1, 1957, that the area was annexed to the city  of San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Montgomery said the railroad had been constructed in 1966 and the homes in  1970. A Calnev official said the pipeline was constructed in the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> A deputy city administrator, Jim Richardson, said that just last week the city  attorney, Penman, had negotiated an agreement with Southern Pacific under which  the railroad company rather than the city was to assume liability for damage  resulting from the train derailment.  </P> <P> The records that were requested and withheld Thursday pertained to any city  hearings or other deliberations that may have transpired over permits for the  pipeline. The general manager of the pipeline company's local office, Jed  Robinson, said that while the U.S. Department of Transportation had the overall  responsibility for approving the pipeline and the office of the state fire  marshal for inspecting it, he believed that local permits had also been  required to actually construct it.  </P> <P> Although city officials aimed their criticism at the pipeline company, it is  the state fire marshal's office that was responsible for assuring that the  pipeline was safe after the May 12 train derailment.  </P> <P> It was this agency's West Covina office that conducted spot inspections in the  days after the train derailment and found no impairment of the pipeline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questions Raised  </P> <P> Thursday afternoon, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, a  federal agency, said the board will investigate what had happened with  particular attention to the following questions:  </P> <P> * Why didn't testing of the pipeline after the derailment reveal any damage?  </P> <P> * What kind of testing was done by the fire marshal's office?  </P> <P> * What may have happened to the pipeline after the testing?  </P> <P> * How did a pipeline cutoff valve that is supposed to detect changes in  pressure and shut down a leaking line function in this case?  </P> <P> Officials on various levels said that while the Transportation Department has  overall authority over the pipeline, a confusing array of state and local  agencies also had roles in the permit and design process for it.  </P> <P> Tom Lael, an associate safety engineer in the fire marshal's office in  Sacramento, said the state agency had entered into an agreement in 1985 with  the U.S. Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for inspecting  the Calnev pipeline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Responsible Department  </P> <P> But Lael said that while the fire marshal makes reports on what it finds, it is  the Transportation Department that is responsible for any follow-through.  </P> <P> He said many different state and local agencies have a role in the process  whereby pipeline companies are given permits to build their lines. There are so  many agencies that, in most cases, the agencies agree among themselves which  one is to have the coordinating role in the permit process, he said.  </P> <P> The fire marshal's office comes in after the permits to look at design factors,  he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / World Trade News: Cuba barters its sugar ITALGRANI, the Italian cereals and foods group based in Naples, has signed a L100bn (Pounds 42m) agreement with Cuba to supply semi-finished food products in return for sugar, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The deal is a further sign of the current revival in countertrade for countries with problems obtaining hard currencies or in economic difficulties. The Cuban economy has faced a growing crisis following the gradual withdrawal of aid and supplies from the former Soviet Union. It has also suffered from the fall in price of some raw-material exports, notably sugar. Italgrani will supply cereals, vegetable oils and pasta products, worth about L100bn, in return for Cuban sugar of a similar value. Italgrani's deal, double the size of a similar one between July and November last year, will take effect in the second half of this year.</p>

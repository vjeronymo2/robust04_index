			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate worries again sap early confidence - Market Report Interest rate worries continued to cast their spell over the UK stock market yesterday as investors speculated over the progress of the monthly policy meeting between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. A firm opening by share prices melted away and, although UK government bonds resisted easier trends in other global bond markets, the FT-SE 100-share Index slipped into negative territory at the close, and was not helped by an early fall of 8.75 on the Dow Industrial Average. Nervousness over UK base rates increased after the Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest home mortgage lender, admitted to significantly reduced confidence in housing industry prospects, and warned of the likely effects of any rise in rates. Reported comments from a Bundesbank council member that rates could still fall in Germany appeared to land on deaf ears. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,203.9, a net 1.5 down, after a slow but steady reversal of an early improvement of nearly 14 points which reflected an initial recovery in German bonds from the falls of the previous day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index lost 3.3 at 3,779.1. Trading volume increased to 635.2m shares through the Seaq electronic network, more than 10 per cent up from Tuesday's figure, when retail, or customer, business stayed high at a worth of Pounds 1.39bn. While many strategists doubted suggestions that the UK authorities might decide on a pre-emptive rise in base rates, it was generally agreed that the possibility would at least find an airing at yesterday's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England Governor. There was little buying strength behind the initial advance by equities and trading volume appeared to increase as the market turned back. The relatively high level of retail activity this week indicates that the big investment institutions are trading in equities, albeit cautiously, and appear to be unloading some stock. However, fund managers seem to have been reshaping portfolios rather than selling shares, and many analysts expect a further move forward by the stock market. While corporate profits statements remained favourable, and were, in the case of RTZ, accompanied by a higher dividend payout, the market overall was no longer responsive. A sharp rise in RTZ, which is regarded as a good guide to global economic activity, had little effect elsewhere. Strategists commented that the UK stock market, which has been driven for some months by rising company dividends and earnings, appears now to be turning its attention back to the interest rate front. Market indices benefited from strength in oil shares - where recent recommendations from London brokerage houses outweighed any effects of the settlement of the Nigerian strike - and also in bank stocks. But an attempted recovery by some retail stocks failed as investors again reacted to the implications of the threat to domestic consumer spending of an upward move in UK interest rates. Several store shares lost early gains and the sector turned easier in the wake of the comments from the chairman of the Halifax. There was no immediate response from the stock market to the lifting of the Malaysian ban on UK trade, although several leading UK firms will hope to be allowed to tender for work on Malaysia's new international airport, a project from which they were originally excluded. The FT-SE 100-share Index Steering Committee announced yesterday that Schroders and 3i Group will join the Footsie index on September 19, and that NFC and Coats Viyella will leave.</p>

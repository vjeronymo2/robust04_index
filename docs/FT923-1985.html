			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Relief deal for French farmers THE European Commission was last night due to announce a relief package for hard-pressed small French farmers, who all opinion polls say will vote massively against the Maastricht treaty in tomorrow's referendum. The measures follow Commission pledges to review anomalies left unresolved when the Common Agricultural Policy was radically reformed in May. But the timing reflects a plea for help from Mr Louis Mermaz, French agriculture minister, who wrote to Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, 10 days ago seeking eight changes to the CAP reform package. Mr Delors was due to make the announcement in France last night, according to senior Commission officials. Small dairy farmers who keep 'suckler' cows for beef production, most of them in central France, should get additional premium payments worth about Pounds 100m, the officials said. The proposal, though approved by Brussels, still has to be endorsed by EC farm ministers, who meet in Brussels on Monday. In southern France, producers of durum wheat (used largely for pasta) are expected to have restored to them the 25 per cent premium over ordinary wheat, abolished under the CAP reform except in a restricted list of 'sensitive areas'. The cost of this is unclear, as the Commission has not finalised the proposal. Although only a fraction of the more than 1m small farmers in central and southern France will benefit, officials say a sweetener may temper their hostility towards the EC. Although Maastricht has nothing to do with the CAP reform, French government opinion polls from as far back as mid-June revealed a bedrock of 70 per cent opposition to the treaty among farmers.</p>

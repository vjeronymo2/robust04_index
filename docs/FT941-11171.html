			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market upset by rise in US interest rates - Market report A generally uncomfortable session in the London stock market turned into a general retreat just before the close of business as the US Federal Reserve confirmed the market's fears by signalling a tightening of its monetary policy. The Fed's move, increasing its Fed Funds rate by  1/4 of one per cent, although by no means unexpected, proved the final straw for a UK equity struggling to maintain its balance. Down 8.1 points as the futures market closed at 4.10pm, the FT-SE 100 continued to lose ground and was trading around 10 points off as the Fed news hit the markets. At the official close the FT-SE 100 was 16.1 lower at 3,475.4. Such was the volume of business being put through the market after the news, with most of it on the sell side, that dealers said the 100 index would almost certainly have been another 10 points off shortly after 4.30pm. Late trading in the future, dealers said, would have produced a fall of around 39 points on the FT-SE 100. The instant reaction of market strategists to the US move tended to favour the shift in policy. At Charterhouse Tilney, Mr Richard Jeffrey said the rise in US rates was 'not unexpected, it happened because the US economy is moving in the right direction. It's a sign of confidence.' He saw the UK equity market 'pausing for breath,' and said it would give hard pressed marketmakers a chance to get some much needed stock on their books; 'but I wouldn't chase the market much higher from here,' he continued. Mr Robert Buckland at NatWest Securities said the interest rate rise was 'earlier than we had expected,' but that it would 'enhance the credibility of the Fed and keep the long end of the US bond market happy but containing inflationary pressures; we're happy with our stance on the UK equity market.' Another positive view was adopted by Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull who spoke of 'a pre-emptive strike' and said the Fed stance would be good for bonds and therefore good for equity markets.' The opposite view was forthcoming from Kleinwort Benson's Mr Edmund Warner, who bleakly described the rate rise as 'posing the greatest threat to global markets since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait; it is just the first of a series of rate rises in the US this year and will choke off the flow of funds. We remain very nervous of the UK equity market.' The equity market began the session on relatively good form, the FT-SE 100 opening modestly higher in relatively quiet trading. The storm clouds began to gather in mid-session, however, and prices fell away for the rest of the day. Second-line stocks came under big selling pressure late in the day. 'There is big selling and we could be in for an awkward week,' said one marketmaker. The Mid 250 index, which has consistently outpaced the 100 index since the year end, ended the day 6.4 off at 4,146.4, but remained 80.8 higher on the week. The FT-SE 100 showed a 28 rise over the same period. Turnover in equities tailed off yesterday, totalling 785.1m shares as the market fell back. The value of customer business on Thursday reached a hefty Pounds 2.43bn. There were, however, some outstanding stock performers. The two far eastern influenced banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered maintained their exceptional performances, while British Aerospace raced ahead on rumours of a counter-bid for Rover.</p>

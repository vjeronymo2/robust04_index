			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Kanamycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily for treatment of drug-resistant TB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Latent TB infection: Infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  usually detected by a positive PPD skin-test result, in a person who has no symptoms of active TB and who is not infectious. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mantoux test: A method of skin testing that is performed by injecting 0.1 mL of PPD-tuberculin containing 5 tuberculin units into the dermis (i.e., the second layer of skin) of the forearm with a needle and syringe. This test is the most reliable and standardized technique for tuberculin testing (see Tuberculin skin test and Purified protein derivative [PPD]-tuberculin test). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): Active TB caused by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  organisms that are resistant to more than one anti-TB drug; in practice, often refers to organisms that are resistant to both INH and rifampin with or without resistance to other drugs (see Drug resistance, acquired and Drug resistance, primary).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  complex: A group of closely related mycobacterial species that can cause active TB (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis, M. bovis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. africanum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); most TB in the United States is caused by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Negative pressure: The relative air pressure difference between two areas in a healthcare facility. A room that is at negative pressure has a lower pressure than adjacent areas, which keeps air from flowing out of the room and into adjacent rooms or areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nosocomial: An occurrence, usually an infection, that is acquired in a hospital or as a result of medical care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Para-aminosalicylic acid: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used for treating drug-resistant TB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pathogenesis: The pathologic, physiologic, or biochemical process by which a disease develops. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pathogenicity: The quality of producing or the ability to produce pathologic changes or disease. Some nontuberculous mycobacteria are pathogenic (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mycobacterium kansasii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and others are not (.e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mycobacterium phlei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Portable room-air HEPA recirculation units: Free-standing portable devices that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating air through a HEPA filter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Positive PPD reaction: A reaction to the purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin test that suggests the person tested is infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The person interpreting the skin-test reaction determines whether it is positive on the basis of the size of the induration and the medical history and risk factors of the person being tested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preventive therapy: Treatment of latent TB infection used to prevent the progression of latent infection to clinically active disease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin: A purified tuberculin preparation that was developed in the 1930s and that was derived from old tuberculin. The standard Mantoux test uses 0.1 mL of PPD standardized to 5 tuberculin units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test: A method used to evaluate the likelihood that a person is infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A small dose of tuberculin (PPD) is injected just beneath the surface of the skin, and the area is examined 48&hyph;72 hours after the injection. A reaction is measured according to the size of the induration. The classification of a reaction as positive or negative depends on the patient's medical history and various risk factors (see Mantoux test). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test conversion: A change in PPD test results from negative to positive. A conversion within a 2-year period is usually interpreted as new  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  infection, which carries an increased risk for progression to active disease. A booster reaction may be misinterpreted as a new infection (see Booster phenomenon and Two-step testing). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pyrazinamide: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug used in treatment regimens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Radiography: A method of viewing the respiratory system by using radiation to transmit an image of the respiratory system to film. A chest radiograph is taken to view the respiratory system of a person who is being evaluated for pulmonary TB. Abnormalities (e.g., lesions or cavities in the lungs and enlarged lymph nodes) may indicate the presence of TB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Radiometric method: A method for culturing a specimen that allows for rapid detection of bacterial growth by measuring production of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by viable organisms; also a method of rapidly performing susceptibility testing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recirculation: Ventilation in which all or most of the air that is exhausted from an area is returned to the same area or other areas of the facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regimen: Any particular TB treatment plan that specifies which drugs are used, in what doses, according to what schedule, and for how long. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Registry: A record-keeping method for collecting clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data concerning TB patients so that the data can be organized and made available for epidemiologic study. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resistance: The ability of some strains of bacteria, including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to grow and multiply in the presence of certain drugs that ordinarily kill them; such strains are referred to as drug-resistant strains. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rifampin: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug that, when used concomitantly with INH and pyrazinamide, provides the basis for short-course therapy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Room-air HEPA recirculation systems and units: Devices (either fixed or portable) that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating air through a HEPA filter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second-line drugs: Anti-TB drugs used when the first-line drugs cannot be use (e.g., for drug-resistant TB or because of adverse reactions to the first-line drugs). Examples are cycloserine, ethionamide, and capreomycin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

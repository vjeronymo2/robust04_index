			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Smith's backers confident on union reform: Labour leader seeks to reassure TUC congress SUPPORTERS OF Mr John Smith's campaign to reform the Labour party's links with the trade unions insisted last night that he could still win the vote at the party conference in three weeks time. They also believe that Mr Smith's address to the TUC congress tomorrow, which will stress the vital importance of strong trade unions, will quash the notion that he is anti-union. The Smith camp has been boosted by the probability that Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, will shift in its favour, and the possibility that Nupe, the public service union, will do the same. The Usdaw executive meets next week and Mr Garfield Davies, the general secretary, said he was confident that it would vote for the introduction of one-member-one-vote for the selection of party candidates - the key issue in dispute. Even with the support of Usdaw and Nupe, however, the vote will be very close and could result in defeat for Mr Smith. That, warned Mr Davies, would be a 'very serious blow' for his leadership. Mr Bill Jordan, head of the AEEU craft union, the main union backing reform, also said that 'the public would reasonably assume that if the unions can dictate to Mr Smith as leader of the opposition' then they could also do so if he was prime minister. In spite of attempts by union leaders to prevent discussion of the Labour-union links issue, it is set to dominate the TUC congress and the approach to the Labour conference at the end of the month. There is no sign that the two key unions opposing Mr Smith's version of reform - the GMB and TGWU general unions - will shift. But one GMB official did suggest that if unions were to pay for their own members to join the party that might retain the federal principle of union affiliation that the general unions want to preserve. Mr Smith's backers will be trying to persuade union leaders that they can disregard any conference votes against the reform package because they came prior to the recent proposal of cut-price party membership for union members. That proposal, taken up by the Smith camp, came originally from Mr John Prescott, one of Labour's senior MPs most popular with union leaders. Some supporters of Mr Smith speculate that he could turn a defeat on the issue to his advantage by being seen to take a strong stand on an issue of principle. He would then keep fighting on the issue and get his way next year. One union official, who strongly supports the reforms, said yesterday that a year of conflict between unions and the Labour leader 'would do no harm and might even do some good' for Mr Smith's standing in the country. Yesterday Labour's ruling national executive committee said that individual party membership had risen from 1991's post-war low. The number of members at the end of last year stood at almost 280,000 - an increase of about 18,000 from the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATRIOTS CAN'T KICK IN 24-10 LOSS TO MIAMI  </P> <P> Things have never been easy against the New England Patriots for Dan Marino,  until Sunday.  </P> <P> Marino threw three touchdown passes in the first half and the Miami Dolphins  capitalized on botched punt plays on the Patriots' first two possessions for a  24-10 victory.  </P> <P> "We got field position early and kept moving the ball well," Marino said. "When  we got ahead, they had to throw on nearly every down."  </P> <P> The Dolphins (1-1) ended a 10-game losing streak against AFC East rivals and a  seven-game string of setbacks against the Patriots (1-1), who last lost to  Miami on Dec. 16, 1985.  </P> <P> Marino is 4-8 against the Patriots in his career.  </P> <P> New England mistakes gave Miami the ball inside New England's 30-yard line  twice, leading to 10 early points and a 24-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "The first half was a thing of beauty," Miami Coach Don Shula said.  </P> <P> Patriot quarterback Tony Eason was sacked seven times, the most by the Dolphins  since Sept. 14, 1986. Miami extended its NFL record to 14 straight games  without allowing a sack.  </P> <P> New England tried to surprise Miami with a fake punt from its own 20 after the  Dolphins stopped the Patriots on their first series. However, punter Jeff  Feagles overthrew Sammy Martin.  </P> <P> Marino capitalized with a 16-yard scoring pass, the first of his two touchdown  passes to utilityman Jim Jensen, giving the Dolphins a 14-0 lead.  </P> <P> Incredibly, the Patriots botched another punt minutes later. A poor snap to  Feagles led to another incomplete pass by the punter and gave Miami the ball at  the Patriot 29. This time, the Dolphins settled for a 31-yard field goal by  Pete Stoyanovich, making the score 17-0 with 4:04 left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Mark Clayton, who began practicing with the Dolphins Tuesday after missing  training camp and the first game of the regular season because he held out in a  contract dispute, caught a 15-yard touchdown pass from Marino on the first  series of the game.  </P> <P> "We played together for six years," Clayton said. "(Marino) knows what I think  and I know what he thinks."  </P> <P> Miami's final score of the first half came on a nine-play, 65-yard drive capped  by Marino's 10-yard touchdown pass to Jensen 7:45 before halftime.  </P> <P> New England scored on Greg Davis' 28-yard field goal in the third quarter and  Eason's 10-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes on the  last play of the game.  </P> <P> Marino completed 17 of 28 passes for 226 yards but had three interceptions to  go with his three touchdowns.  </P> <P> The three touchdown passes gave Marino 200 for his career in only 89 games,  establishing an NFL record for reaching that plateau in the fewest games.  Johnny Unitas of the Baltimore Colts set the record of 200 in his first 121  games.  </P> <P> "He's tough," Patriot cornerback Raymond Clayborn said of Marino. "That's how  he set the record. He can throw it over anyone when he's hot."  </P> <P> Forced to throw most of the second half, Eason completed 25 of 49 passes for  341 yards and one interception.  </P> <P> Stanley Morgan caught six of those passes for 88 yards, giving him 10,028  career receiving yards and making him the seventh NFL player to reach 10,000  receiving yards.  </P></p>

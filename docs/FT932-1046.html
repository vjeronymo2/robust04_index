			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Management: Time to get serious - Rank Xerox's ambitious re-engineering programme Three months ago Bernard Fournier, the French-born managing director of Rank Xerox, sent out a terse announcement from his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was proof that the copier company had finally become serious about 'process re-engineering' after years of merely flirting with it. In order to become 'the most productive company in our industry in the world', Fournier declared, 'we need dramatic improvements in performance which will be achieved through re-engineering of our business processes'. His announcement came hard on the heels of a string of other decisions which mentioned business processes and re-engineering in passing. They included a drastic reshaping of the Marlow headquarters - involving the loss of 200 jobs and the reassignment of 1,200 - and a reorganisation of European marketing, sales and service. In his announcement just before Easter, Fournier did not enumerate the productivity targets but they have since become known. They involve a cut of about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) in Rank Xerox's annual overheads. That will be achieved by, among other things, removing the costly traditional freedom of each European offshoot to develop and operate its own processes and systems as it likes. Instead, seven uniform 'basic processes' are being designed to span all functional departments across Europe. Several are already well advanced. They will cover almost all the company's activities - from 'time to market' (product development) through 'market to collection' (customer order, installation and payment) to 'product maintenance' (service). To make the design and operation of the new processes effective, Fournier said that each of them would in future be 'sponsored' by one of his top managers from all over Europe, and that a bevy of senior executives immediately beneath them would be the 'owners' (ie managers) of each process. Coming from a company known for its propensity for managerial innovation, such moves might seem unpractical theorising. They are far from that. Fournier is renowned - even notorious - for being practical and down-to-earth. He expects the changes to pay off handsomely on the bottom line. But he knows they will be far from easy and expects 'a fight' as the new 'process owners' start to operate across the company's traditional structure. That structure is still heavily functional. But, as Fournier made clear, he and his top colleagues in the senior management committee will not only constitute a 'business process board' to spark new re-engineering programmes, they will also act as a separate committee to monitor progress of the new strategy - in other words, to drive it. This determination is a far cry from 1990, when an attempt to spark a re-engineering revolution in Rank Xerox withered on the vine because of resistance from the established hierarchy, both in Europe and within the US parent, Xerox. 'Now we're re-engineering not just a few processes, but the whole company,' says John Drinkwater, Rank Xerox's director of business processes and information management. That puts Rank Xerox 'streets ahead' of its parent, he claims. In the US a much more technology-based re-engineering project was brought to a halt in 1992 because of its cost. Even two years ago, Drinkwater says, a proposal along the lines now approved in Europe 'wouldn't have got airtime with senior management. Now it does because of the savings it can offer - our existing ways of doing things aren't affordable anymore'. That became patently evident last year, when two events occurred. First, one of the company's 'quality improvement teams' concluded that there was a yawning gap between the current return on assets and what needed to be achieved if Rank Xerox were to be able to call itself 'the most productive company in our industry'. Then, as 1992 progressed, the extent of the immediate financial pressures became obvious. In the year to October, pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent by one calculation and almost 19 per cent by another, thanks in part to a rise in administration costs of nearly 10 per cent. It is no coincidence that October was also when Fournier and his senior colleagues told two teams to do a study of virtually the whole of Rank Xerox. Rather than apply crude percentage cuts across the board, they were asked to calculate the value added by every activity, and - if it survived examination - place it within whichever of the seven new 'basic processes' was most appropriate. One pan-European team examined the role and size of the international headquarters and all its support functions. The team concluded that all but 135 of the 1,500 full-time jobs there should be reassigned to the company's business divisions or sales subsidiaries, or its 'technology and business support group'. By cutting back on subcontracted work, only 200 jobs have gone. A second team has adopted a similar process-based approach to the streamlining and redesign of Rank Xerox's field operations across Europe. Its recommendations will be put to Paul Allaire, the chairman and chief executive of Xerox, at the end of June, and consequent actions made public in the autumn. Financial pressures have certainly provided a vital spark for the process revolution at Rank Xerox, but not the only one. Another is Allaire's campaign to turn the whole Xerox group into a much faster-moving, more market-connected and 'team-oriented' organisation. The introduction of cross-departmental business processes as a 'horizontal' overlay across the company's hitherto functional (or 'vertical' ) structure should help it towards those objectives. Rank Xerox is also implementing a variety of behaviour and culture change initiatives, including a new-style leadership programme for the top 90 executives, and workshops for self-managed work teams. Thanks to Fournier, a key policy document from Xerox, with the odd title of The New Company Culture, has been expanded for European consumption. Below eight high-flown American phrases about 'action-oriented', 'empowerment' and 'organisational learning', he has added the stark words 'process re-engineering and simplification'. He certainly means business. Previous articles in this series appeared on May 24 and June 2, 11 and 18.</p>

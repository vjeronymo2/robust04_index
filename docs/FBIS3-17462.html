Yuri Matochkin, head of the region's administration,  suggested to simplify transit document regulations to firms and  organizations that would be vouched for by the Kaliningrad  administration. The Lithuanian side accepted the proposal.    Lithuania and the region also agreed to put off for three  months the introduction of Lithuanian visas for Kaliningrad  residents because the region is technically unprepared to make  special passport inserts for travel through Lithuanian territory.</p>

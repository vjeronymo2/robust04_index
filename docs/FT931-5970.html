			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium prices up on catalyst news PALLADIUM prices rose sharply yesterday on news that Allied-Signal of the US had developed an automoive exhaust catalyst using only palladium. Prices of platinum, for which catalysts is the biggest single market, fell sharply, although the New York market was recovering some of the losses in late trading. Allied-Signal, a leading catalysts manufacturer with 25 per cent of the market, said its new system eliminated the need for other platinum group metals, reducing the cost of precious metal components by up to 50 per cent. The news should be taken more seriously than previous announcemnts of new catalytic systems which have moved platinum group metal prices, analysts suggested. But more details were needed. In late trading on Nymex yesterday the March palladium contract had retreated from an earlier Dollars 112.50 a troy ounce to Dollars 109.50, up Dollars 6.80.</p>

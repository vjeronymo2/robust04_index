			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Mixed reaction to finance initiative - Contracts The announcement of ambitious targets for the government's private finance initiative prompted a mixture of hope and scepticism in financial and civil engineering circles. Contracts for some Pounds 5bn private sector investment are expected to be placed next year, said Mr Clarke. His remarks confirmed the government's commitment to its private finance initiative, but indicated the long lead times which are necessary to get large projects off the ground. Industry and City sources said they were disappointed that no new schemes were announced yesterday. The catalogue of schemes proposed to be placed this year was described by some construction companies bidding for the projects as 'old hat' and little more than a 'wish list'. There had been hopes that the chancellor would give the go-ahead for at least one light rail scheme and for additional road schemes to be financed and built by the private sector. None was forthcoming. 'It was encouraging that the chancellor devoted 10 minutes to the private finance initiative so early on in his speech but surprising that no new specific projects were mentioned,' said Mr Richard Millward, director responsible for the initiative at merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson. The only scheme where progress seems imminent is the modernisation of the rolling stock for London Underground's Northern Line, valued at about Pounds 400m plus a further Pounds 300m if long-term maintenance is included in the contract. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, will announce a decision on the award of a contract 'very soon,' Mr Clarke said. The chancellor assured his listeners yesterday that 'significant progress' had been made on the transport schemes referred to in last year's budget: the Pounds 600m modernisation of the west-coast main-line railway; a new Pounds 200m air traffic control centre for Scotland; and a Pounds 100m extension of the Docklands Light Railway south to Lewisham. Studies are going on into the detail of the west-coast modernisation and bids are to be sought from the private sector for the Docklands extension and the Scottish air traffic centre. But the construction industry, rolling stock manufacturers and potential users are impatient for work to start and this is likely to take some time. 'We have succeeded in developing a massive portfolio of work in progress,' said Mr Douglas Hogg, a member of the Private Finance Panel's executive committee. 'We will be working on this over the next six to nine months but it is just too early to expect anything yet. These projects involve long lead times.'

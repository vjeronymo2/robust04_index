The meeting  is being chaired by Division General Ramon Espinoza Martin,  Chief of the Eastern Army.    The council analyzed a broad agenda, which in addition to  several defense preparation aspects, included other subjects  such as the fight against crime and the increase in food  production.    Several council members and the first secretaries of the  Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] of the six provinces that comprise  the territory defended by the Army are also participating in the  meeting. They are Politburo members Esteban Lazo and Julian Rizo  who are also first secretaries in Santiago de Cuba and Camaguey,  respectively; Juan Carlos Robinson from Guantanamo, Alfredo  Enriquez Pina from Granma, Francisco Garcia Ferrer from Holguin,  and Julian Lopez from Las Tunas, all members of the PCC Central  Committee.    The report by Army chief of staff, Brigade General Urbelino  Betancourt, conveyed the satisfactory fighting capacity of the  forces deployed to this extensive territory, which is  demonstrated by the successful fulfillment of the FAR's main  objectives.    The preparation of the commanders, officers, and soldiers of  the territorial troops militia, both from the regular forces and  the reserves, as well as the production and defense brigades,  was considered good. This evaluation applies to the operational  and tactical levels -- to shooting ability, physical fitness,  and their Marxist-Leninist education, following the example of  Marti.    The refurbishing of the military theater of operations has  progressed considerably over the past year, surpassing all  plans, including the most important engineering works and the  defense tunnels. The work carried out in Santiago de Cuba, which  surpassed the annual plan by 85 percent, has also been  emphasized. This plan also seeks to achieve full protection for  the heroic town, the country's second most important town.  Holguin and Camaguey Provinces also shine in the work they  accomplished.    The plan to maintain weapons in good condition, that is, the  plan for the preservation, diagnosis, prophylaxis, mobilization,  and loading tests of the fighting instruments demanded a  tremendous effort, which is reflected in the following figures:  over 4,600,000 pieces of equipment, from heavy 36-ton tanks to  antigas masks, were tested.    The experience accrued by the Army in this type of work is  now being transferred to civilian organizations that have great  quantities of unused equipment, such as Micons [Construction  Ministry], the Agriculture Ministry, and Minaz [Sugar Industry  Ministry] following the recent guidelines of the party's second  secretary on the importance of maintaining and preserving the  tremendous amount of capital invested by the country, equipment  which is today not used, but which can be essential tomorrow, to  the extent that we bail out of this special period. The  discipline was also considered satisfactory, having reduced the  number of infractions or crimes.    Concerning the nutrition program, in 1993 and in the  previous  year, the Army increased its production of meat, eggs, milk,  tubers and vegetables, grain, honey, coffee, and others, by more  than 30 percent, reaching a total of 20,000 tons, a figure which  surpasses the troops' self-sufficiency needs by 23 percent. This  has allowed the Army to hand over more than 5,000 tons of food  to the people of the eastern region and to begin a modest  assistance plan of food for the officer corps' family groups.    Fish production increased 75 percent as compared to 1993.  The  reforesting program by the Army forces and by the six provinces  was surpassed by 21 percent; that is, by 49 million trees.    The conclusion reached by the military council is that 1993  was a successful year for defense in the Eastern Army, the 1994  objective of which is to maintain the same level of activities,  achieving better results, with the hope of retaining Camilo  Cienfuegos' machine gun, a rotating trophy of the FAR, following  the Army's example. The trophy is today in the hands of the  people of the eastern region.    At the closing of this report, the council was assessing  other points of the agenda. Also present at the meeting as  special guests were Alfredo Jordan, agriculture minister and  member of the politburo; Jorge Fernandez Cuervo, the fishing  industry minister; Division Gen. Fernandez Gondin, first vice  minister of the interior; and Enrique Oltuski, the fishing  industry vice minister.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Acting Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza has  disclosed that Mexican authorities have gradually begun lifting  the embargo on a shipment of Chilean fruit in the port of  Manzanillo.    Although there is still no official information from the  Mexican Government, Insulza told Radio Cooperativa that  yesterday shortly after noon he received reports from Mexico  City announcing the partial lifting of the embargo on the  shipment.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What news is there  about the embargo on the Chilean fruit shipment?    [Insunza] Look, the situation is still rather confusing.  According to the information we have, the embargo on the cargo  from the first ship that was unloaded has been lifted, with the  exception of a few boxes where a dead larva was found, which  seems to have caused some problems and prompted the measure. I  reiterate that there is no reason for this measure because  Mexico has this type of larva, and therefore it poses no threat.  The second ship is allegedly being subjected to a new  inspection. [end recording]    Insulza explained that the Mexican embargo was ordered on 18  March, and apparently there was some misunderstanding because  Chilean authorities were not informed appropriately about the  measures.    The acting foreign minister explained that on 3 March, the  Mexicans decided to ban the entry of Chilean fruit that could be  infested with the fruit fly. The decision was made after the  Chilean Government, in compliance with the agreements in force,  informed the Mexican Government about the existence of the fruit  fly in Santiago. Mexico immediately stepped up restrictions,  thus establishing new obstacles for the entry of Chilean fruit.    On 7 March, Mexico decided to circumscribe restrictions for  the entry of Chilean fruit, and increased to 8 km the radius  around the site where the presence of the fruit fly was  detected. In view of this, Jose Miguel Insulza reiterated that  the situation is regarded as serious by the Chilean Government,  and admitted that despite the good will of Mexican authorities  the measure causes material and intangible damages to Chilean  producers.</p>

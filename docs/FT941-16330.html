			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / People: Inveresk Baroness Dean (above left), of Thornton-le-Fylde, formerly Brenda Dean who was general secretary of the trade union Sogat, has gained her first non-executive directorship. She is joining the board of INVERESK, the Fife-based specialist paper group, which floated on the stock exchange last year. The company has also appointed Bill Goodall (above right) as non-executive chairman, replacing Ingram Lenton who is resigning his directorships because of ill-health. Dean, who became a Labour life peer last year after stepping down as deputy general secretary of the GPMU, into which Sogat - the principal union for paper workers - merged, won the respect of the paper industry for her constructive attitude to change. The industry last year awarded her its gold medal. Lenton, a former managing director of the papermakers Bowater, chaired Inveresk after its management bought it out of Georgia Pacific in 1990 and steered it through last year's flotation. Goodall, who retired as executive chairman of the mini-conglomerate Scapa Group in October, was intended to be Lenton's successor but has had his appointment to the chair speeded up. Inveresk now complies with the Cadbury Report strictures, having a non-executive chairman and, now with Dean, two non-executive directors. Ian Boyd, finance director of Weir Group, joined the board last year.</p>

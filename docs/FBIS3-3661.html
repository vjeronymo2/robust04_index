Although Beijing yesterday released more than 100 elderly  anti-Japan activists after two days of investigations, Shanghai  police rounded up war reparation activist Bao Ge just before the  Prime Minister's arrival in the east China city.    The release of the elderly dissidents coincided with a  report  which said 500 intellectuals had signed a petition to the  National People's Congress (NPC) calling for their release and a  public apology by the police.    According to Bao's friends, the 31-year-old medical  researcher was picked up by police officers yesterday morning.    Yang Zhou, a friend of Bao, said the activist had no plans  to  demonstrate or embarrass the Government during Mr Hosokawa's  visit and he believed Bao would be set free soon after Mr  Hosokawa left Shanghai.    "He (Bao) has no plans to do anything... But the authorities  obviously don't want to see even the slightest trouble.  Although the issue (war reparation) is not related to the Most  Favoured Nation (MFN) debate, anything ugly could affect MFN,"  Mr Yang said.    The 100 or so dissidents, whose average age is 65, were  detained last Friday after they had petitioned Mr Hosokawa to  issue a formal apology and to pay compensations. Bao last  Thursday sent a similar petition to the Japanese Embassy in  Beijing.    The Chinese Government agreed to drop claims to Japanese  compensation 22 years ago when the two nations restored  diplomatic relations. But many Chinese citizens regard the deal  as a sellout and are seeking billions of dollars in compensation  from Tokyo.    One source said police had released more than 100  representatives of the group, the China Civilian Preparatory  Committee for Japanese Reparations, but sent them all under  escort back to their home provinces. Another 100 locked in a  south Beijing depot were also sent home.    "They were released on Sunday night but police are taking  them home under supervision," the activist said, adding a  Beijing-based war reparation movement activist, Tong Zeng,  remained in police custody.    Mr Yang said the strong reaction from the Government could  backfire.    He said that despite the leadership's disapproval,  intellectuals such as Beijing scholar Xu Liangying were still  able to challenge the authorities by putting out an open letter  calling for the release of all political prisoners.</p>

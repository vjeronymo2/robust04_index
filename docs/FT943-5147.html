			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Singapore caught in media dilemma: Kieran Cooke on reconciling censorship with the global information network Out-of-work veterans of Washington's ill-fated 'Star Wars' programme should look no further. Singapore needs you. Singapore wants to turn itself into a global media hub. The problem is that Singapore's leaders remain deeply suspicious of outside influences. 'We have to stay special and unique,' said Mr George Yeo, Singapore's minister for information and the arts, recently. 'To achieve this, we need a kind of semi-permeable membrane to preserve our own bubble in Singapore.' While Singapore does not plan literally to wrap itself in a cocoon, Mr Yeo's remarks are very much a reflection of the dilemma the government feels it is facing. On one hand, Singapore's planners see the economic necessity of being plugged into the global information network. Singapore has the technology and expertise to be the information entrepot of the dynamic south-east Asia region. Its 2.7m people are already among the world's most computer-proficient. 'The future belongs to countries whose people make the most productive use of information, knowledge and technology,' says Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister. 'These are now the key factors for economic success, not natural resources.' But, on the other hand, the government is deeply concerned about losing control over information flows within Singapore. Satellite ownership is not allowed for the general public. The local media faithfully reflect government policy. The importation of foreign newspapers and magazines, ranging from the Far Eastern Economic Review to Cosmopolitan, is carefully controlled. Even newspapers from neighbouring Malaysia are not allowed to circulate in Singapore. Singapore's leaders have shown no hesitation in taking court action, usually involving substantial damage suits, against foreign media which, they feel, have impugned their integrity. But as technology changes, censorship becomes ever more difficult. Services such as Internet, the global information network, can be used not only to access research materials. They can also be used to transit newspapers and pornography. The government admits that where technology is concerned, it is fighting a losing battle. 'Censorship is becoming quite impossible to enforce at the individual level,' says Mr Yeo. 'Once digitised, an objectionable book, magazine or video can be sent through the telecommunications network. 'We can inspect magazines, books, tapes and discs but we cannot possibly screen every bit or byte that comes down the information highway.' Instead, says Mr Yeo, Singapore needs what he calls an immune system capable of fighting off infection from within. A code of what are seen as Asian values, emphasising the family and the primary role of the male, discipline and above all, the needs of society above those of the individual, is the pill the government wants Singaporeans dutifully to swallow to counteract foreign viruses. 'Asian values' was the main theme of a national day address at the end of last month by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. The maintenance of such values is seen as vital for Singapore's continued economic success. 'You may think decline is unimaginable,' said Mr Goh. 'But societies can go wrong very quickly.' While the Singapore government remains deeply sensitive to outside criticism, Mr Goh had no hesitation in painting a bleak picture for his audience of what he sees as moral decay and lawlessness in the west, most notably in the US and Britain. He warned Singaporeans not to fall prey to corrosive outside influences, such as welfarism, divorce, or children being allowed to call their fathers by their first names. 'We must not unthinkingly drift into attitudes and manners which undermine the traditional politeness and deference Asian children have for their parents and elders.' Mr Goh admitted that drug addiction and juvenile delinquency in Singapore had risen. So had divorce, and there were single-parent families. Unmarried motherhood could not be considered a respectable part of Singapore society, Mr Goh declared. In future, unmarried mothers would not be allowed to buy government flats direct but only on the more expensive resale market. There are those who wonder what all the fuss is about. Singapore shows few signs of descending into anarchy and moral mayhem. Its economy grew 9.9 per cent last year and looks on course for similar growth this year. Singaporeans enjoy per capita incomes higher than in New Zealand and only slightly behind Australia and Britain. More than half the population can afford to travel abroad each year where they benefit from the strength of the Singapore dollar. 'In Perth, Singaporeans are called 'birds',' said Mr Goh. 'When they are in the shops, they go: 'Cheap cheap]'.' Analysts say that political pressures are part of the reason for Mr Goh's tough stand. On one side, as prime minister for the last four years, he has to contend with the formidable presence of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, patriarch of modern Singapore. On the other side is Mr Lee's son, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, who has made no secret of his willingness to serve as prime minister. When he came to office, the mild-mannered Mr Goh promised a more open, consultative form of government. But that seems to have given way to a more hard-headed approach. Mr Goh needs to show his cabinet colleagues that he has a firm grip, particularly with a general election likely to be called in the first half of next year. Mr Goh's comments could win votes among the more traditionally-minded, Chinese-educated population. But some Singaporeans find the government's attitude hard to stomach. 'It's the old story in Singapore,' said a local academic. 'The government still has a siege mentality. It wants to open up to media and other outside influences insofar as they will benefit the economy. 'But it still wants to control everything, from what we see at the theatre to what we read. We are the children, it is the father figure. Talking about Asian values is another way of saying:'We know what is good for you. Obey us'.'</p>

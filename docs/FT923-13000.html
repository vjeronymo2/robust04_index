			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Business people in Scotland more confident BUSINESS people in several sectors in Scotland are becoming slightly more confident about their prospects and there are signs of a modest rise in demand. This is shown in the latest quarterly Scottish business survey conducted by chambers of commerce and analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Glasgow. The survey disclosed a slight increase in business optimism in manufacturing and an appreciable rise in confidence in the retailing sector. The tourism and leisure industries also reported improved confidence. There was a sharp fall in optimism about prospects in the construction industry compared both with three months ago and a year ago. There was no evidence of a general upturn in demand for labour.</p>

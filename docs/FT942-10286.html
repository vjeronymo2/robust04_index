			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Disposal plan will cut Do It All to 140 stores Boots and WH Smith said yesterday they planned to sell up to 100 stores in their loss-making DIY joint venture Do It All, with 40 disposals already agreed. They are making total provisions of Pounds 60m. Do It All has 220 stores trading, with 20 already closed. The disposals will leave 140 stores, all of which will eventually be refitted to a new format called the 'new trading concept'. The joint venture partners said they expected the chain to return to a trading profit in the next financial year, 1995-96. The agreed disposals were fewer than the City expected, although the eventual total was larger and the provisions smaller. Analysts pointed out, however, that only 14 sales had been finalised, with contracts exchanged on 10, but 16 were still under negotiation. 'It's a bit disappointing,' said one, 'This has been going on for a long time, and it's still not clear how they are going to get rid of all these stores.' Mr Steve Russell, managing director of Do It All, said the disposals could not be rushed, but the target was achievable. 'We intend to perform this task carefully. These are not panic measures. We want to sell these stores in good order and get the best deals we can.' Sir Malcolm Field, chief executive of WH Smith, said the programme represented 'decisive action', which would 'create a strongly competitive business for the longer term'. Boots' shares closed up 3p at 556p, but WH Smith's dropped 9 1/2 p to 506 1/2 p. The provision will be taken in Do It All's profit and loss account for the year to February 1994. It includes a Pounds 19m write-off on fittings and stock, Pounds 5m for trading losses, and Pounds 31m for reverse premiums, rents on vacant stores and redundancies. The remaining Pounds 5m is to cover write-offs associated with refitting stores. Mr Russell said it was difficult to forecast the number of redundancies, but it was unlikely to be large. Some staff would remain with stores under new ownership. Some jobs would be lost at head office, but these would result from a wider review of management systems to increase efficiency. The partners are spending Pounds 10m this year on converting 38 Do It Alls to the new format, taking the total to 82. The remainder will be refitted over two years - with some earlier refits upgraded - at a cost of about Pounds 20m. Efficiency will also be improved through the introduction of centralised distribution.</p>

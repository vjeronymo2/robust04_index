			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO ROUTS CRAWFORD  </P> <P> Mission Viejo, ranked eighth in Orange County, had little trouble defeating  host Crawford High School Thursday night at Madison High in front of 300 fans.  </P> <P> The Diablos (3-1) scored a 39-0 nonleague victory over the Colts (1-3) behind  the two touchdowns apiece scored by Beau LeBreton and Marcellus Chrishon.  </P> <P> LeBreton was the game's early hero, rushing eight yards for a touchdown on  Mission Viejo's first drive, a 60-yard, 10-play effort.  </P> <P> LeBreton found himself in the end zone seconds later on defense. He stripped  the ball from Crawford quarterback Phil Parker, then picked it up and scored  from 16 yards on the fumble recovery to make it 12-0. Both PAT attempts failed.  </P> <P> Parker, who also played strong safety, was injured while breaking up a pass  play and the game was delayed 27 minutes. He was taken to Sharp Memorial  Hospital, where he was to be observed overnight.  </P> <P> After Parker's departure, Diablo quarterback Tim Snowden completed passes of  21, 14 and 27 yards before Chrishon carried the ball into the end zone from the  one. Doug Roberson's kick made it 19-0 at halftime.  </P> <P> Chrishon scored again from one yard late in the third quarter to make it 25-0.  </P> <P> The Diablos finished the scoring in the fourth. Erick Fielding scored from 18  yards and Payson LeMeilleur scored from one on a quarterback sneak.  </P></p>

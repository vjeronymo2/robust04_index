			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLETT'S 'ATTACKS' DO A 'DISSERVICE' TO MANY  </P> <P> Author Kate Millett's attacks on psychiatry and the "myth" of mental illness do  a disservice to the millions of mentally ill Americans and their families.  Mental illness does exist and tends to be genetic ("In a Mind Field," June 13).  </P> <P> I suffer from the same illness Millett was diagnosed with: manic depression.  However, I have a strong desire not to be victimized by this horrendous  condition, which led to the suicide deaths of my grandmother and great-aunt,  and contributed to the deaths of my mother and brother.  </P> <P> For the past year, after 10 years of suffering and missed diagnoses, I have  been taking lithium, which has improved the quality of my life 100%. Only  someone who has suffered the anguish of being a victim of one's own emotions  and thoughts can fully realize the difference freedom from this condition  brings.  </P> <P> Millett says she should have been able to pursue her divorce, her search for a  lesbian lover, her activism on behalf of a Trinidad prisoner, her public  breakdowns, her political forays to Ireland and Iran, and her attempt to kill  herself without the intervention of family and psychiatrists. She denounces  psychiatrists as frauds and says madness is a myth.  </P> <P> In an extreme emotional state, Millett tried to poison herself with gas, but  thankfully was unsuccessful. My brother, in a manic state, drove all night  through the countryside and caused an accident that killed him and two other  people. He, like Millett, had denounced all psychiatrists as phony and had  rebelled against taking medication.  </P> <P> Can society afford the ramifications of mentally ill people who refuse to be  treated? More importantly, can they themselves afford it? My brother,  understandably, did not want the stigma that comes with mental illness.  Americans' idea of mentally ill people are those who shoot assault rifles into  crowded schoolyards or who are otherwise undependable and untrustworthy. Only  my husband and a few close friends know about my condition. I cannot afford the  employment discrimination and other societal sanctions that would be imposed on  me if my manic depression was known.  </P> <P> NAME WITHHELD  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>
